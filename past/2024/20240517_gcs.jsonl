However, predicting when it will improve is difficult.\n\n\"Predicting if the air quality will improve or worsen can be difficult because of the unpredictable behavior of wildfires and factors such as wind, weather, and terrain,\" said the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Media Relations and Risk Communications in a statement sent to USA TODAY. \"For example, a wind that usually clears out a valley could also blow more smoke in or fan the flames, intensifying the fire and worsening smoke.\"\n\nAccording to Pastelok, weather patterns are still \"very active\" in the regions being affected by the smoke, and that will help improve the quality of air, but it can change.\n\nLike the EPA, Pastelok said the same system that can help improve air quality could also blow smoke back into the U.S.\n\n\"So it's good and bad,\" said Pastelok. \"It can clear for a little bit and then pick back up again on the backside of it.\"\n\nStates impacted by air quality from wildfires\n\nThe following states saw air quality alerts:\n\nIowa: Monday morning, parts of the state saw air quality drop to the \"unhealthy\" range, reports WHO 13\n\nMonday morning, parts of the state saw air quality drop to the \"unhealthy\" range, reports WHO 13 Minnesota - Saw air quality alerts from Sunday to Monday night, according to a press release.\n\n- Saw air quality alerts from Sunday to Monday night, according to a press release.

It stated that the smoke could cause low visibility and increased fine particulate matter, in a press release. Wisconsin- Parts of Wisconsin were placed on an air quality advisory on Monday, which was set to end at midnight the same day, according to previous reporting from USA TODAY.\n\nSmoke could grow with fires\n\nPastelok said the smoke could get much worse going into June and July if fires start to grow.\n\nAlberta, British Columbia, and parts of Manitoba, Ontario and Southern Ontario are \"pretty dry,\" he said. So, if fires do grow in those areas, the Great Lakes area and parts of the far northeastern U.S. could be affected.\n\nThe wildfire season is more active than usual because of the lack of snow depth and Canada's drought situation. Because of that, \"there'll be a lot of smoke in the air across Canada, and it doesn't take much to pull that smoke down. So I think we're still looking at problems here through the summer, in the northern tier in the nation, especially,\" said Pastelok.\n\nHowever, the meteorologist doesn't believe things will be as bad as they were last year.\n\nSide-effects of inhaling wildfire smoke\n\nWildfire smoke can irritate one's eyes, nose, and throat and cause:\n\nCoughing\n\nChest tightness,\n\nShortness of breath\n\nDizziness\n\nFatigue\n\nParticulate matter, a type of air pollutant that is made of small particles of solids or liquids that are suspended in the air, is one of the main components of wildfire smoke, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAccording to Yale Medicine, the particles can be 10 micrometers, PM 10, or as small as 2.5 micrometers, PM 2.5, and the smaller one poses a lot of health risks.\n\nPM2.5 is so tiny it can easily pass people's usual defense mechanisms and dive deep into their lungs. Not only can it damage lung function, but it can also pass into the bloodstream and travel to other organs.\n\nThe following is linked to exposure to the PM 2.5:\n\nHeart attack\n\nStroke,\n\nLung cancer\n\nDecline in cognitive function\n\nWearing masks can protect one's lungs\n\n\"I think you should have masks handy if you have conditions, especially if you're very sensitive to bad air quality,\" said Pastelok.\n\nThe meteorologist says it's better to get masks early so stores won't be out of stock when more people need them.\n\n\"Make sure you're buying them ahead of time here because you never know when the stores might run out,\" he said.\n\nHe adds that folks should be paying attention to weather alerts and checking air quality.\n\n\"I recommend people look at that closely,\" advised Pastelok. \"Especially in the northern tier, northern plains states, upper midwest, upper Great Lakes and far northern Northeast.\"\n\nHe adds that people should have an air purifier handy if they can afford it and to make sure their AC and ventilation systems are working before the smoke reaches them or their air quality decreases.\n\n\"Make sure they're working efficiently because you can't open the windows up because that will bring everything inside,\" said Pastelok.\n\nContributing: Karina Zaiets, Ramon Padilla, Cecilia Garzella, Yoonserk Pyun; USA TODAY\n\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Chicago's air quality now ranks worst in the world as smoke from Canada wildfires hits Midwest.\n\nAir quality alerts could continue around the U.S. for days or even weeks as wildfires across the border continue to burn.\n\nSmoke from wildfires is different from other sources. That's because of the unhealthy matter it contains, how it can travel long distances and persist in the air, changing over time and getting more toxic.\n\nWildfire smoke contains noxious or poisonous gases and particulate matter, tiny particles that can be inhaled. Those particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and affect people with respiratory problems.\n\nWhere the air quality is worst in the US\n\nHow can wildfire smoke hurt you?\n\nSmoke can cause a series of health problems, from minor irritations to serious concerns.\n\nDepending on what's burning – grasslands, trees, vegetation, or buildings – wildfire smoke can contain toxic chemical substances including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, acid gases, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, benzene, toluene, styrene, metals and dioxins, says the New York State Department of Health.\n\nSmoke can become more toxic the longer it lingers in the air. It can combine with trace radicals, or molecules with unpaired electrons, in a process known as oxidation. That process converts the particles into something known as free radicals, which can damage cells and tissues.\n\nSmoke can also hamper what's called the macrophage function, the ability of lungs to protect themselves. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that aids the immune system.\n\nHow small are wildfire smoke particles?\n\nFine particles from wildfire smoke are of great health concern, the Environmental Protection Agency says. Particles can be much smaller than the width of a human hair.\n\nParticles are dangerous because they can be inhaled and travel deep into the lungs. They can cause respiratory irritation and shortness of breath. They can also make conditions worse for those with asthma and heart disease.\n\nWho is most likely to be affected by wildfire smoke?\n\nWildfire smoke presents special health risks for:\n\nHow can you protect yourself from smoke particles?\n\n________\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Associated Press; Environmental Protection Agency; California Air Resources Board; European Commission; New York State Department of Health\n\nLearn more about wildfires and smoke dangers in these visual stories:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/27/smokehouse-creek-fire-map/72763269007/", "title": "Smokehouse Creek Fire map: Texas panhandle blaze covers ...", "text": "A wildfire in the Texas panhandle was burning out of control Tuesday as it threatened towns and forced residents to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek fire burning near Stinnett, about 60 miles northeast of Amarillo, was originally reported Monday evening and has grown to an estimated 500,000 acres by around 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday with no containment, according to a tweet from the Texas A&M Forest Service.\n\nThe fire is primarily being fueled by tall grass.\n\nOn Monday, the National Weather Service Office in Amarillo warned that grasses would be drier because of warmer weather.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, it asked residents to \"avoid flames and sparks over the next several days\" as strong winds could help fires grow.\n\nSmokehouse Creek fire map\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek Fire Is located in Hutchinson County, Texas.\n\nFire's cause under investigation\n\nThe Texas A&M Forest Service told USA TODAY the cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nHowever, Erin O'Connor, the organization's lead public information officer, said that drier conditions have led to expanded dry areas that have contributed to the growth of the fire and have not helped the situation.\n\nCurrently, the fire is not contained at all, but evacuation efforts are underway, states a tweet posted by Texas A&M.\n\nWest Texas wildfires\n\nTexas A&M Forest Service is also tracking a few other fires across the state.\n\nAccording to Texas A&M, these are the locations, sizes and containment of the fires as of 6:15 p.m. EST, Tuesday:\n\nGrape Vine Creek Fire — Gray County, 30,000 acres, 60% containment\n\n— Gray County, 30,000 acres, Windy Deuce Fire — Moore County, 40,000 acres, 20% containment\n\n— Moore County, 40,000 acres, 20% containment Juliet Pass Fire — Armstrong County, 2,963 acres, 100% containment\n\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Air quality update", "text": "New Jersey's air quality began improving late Thursday morning after reaching hazardous conditions Wednesday from an unprecedented amount of smoke that descended on the region from Canadian forest fires. But pollution levels were still very high as of midday and the state was under a red alert.\n\nHours earlier, almost all of New Jersey was under a purple alert - the second highest level that marks very unhealthy conditions for the general public.\n\nAir quality index readings were between 226 and 290 in all but one area of the state. Unhealthy air for the general population begins at 151. The lowest reading in New Jersey was at the Delaware Water Gap, at 171.\n\nBy late morning, conditions had improved somewhat and much of the state was under a red alert. Pollution readings were about half of what they were at the height of the event Wednesday afternoon when a thick plume of smoke shrouded the region in darkness and caused air quality index scores to soar to unheard of hazardous conditions.\n\nThe numbers were lower than Wednesday evening when New Jersey reached historically bad conditions with index scores above 300, which are considered hazardous.\n\nToday's smoke forecast\n\nThe smoke is expected to remain \"locked in\" the region for much of Thursday, said Jim Connolly, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Brookhaven, New York.\n\nA low-pressure system that has funneled the smoke into the metropolitan area has shifted slightly. That may mean the extraordinarily thick plumes of smoke that arrived in the region on Wednesday afternoon may bypass northern New Jersey and instead hit South Jersey and the Philadelphia region harder, Connolly said.\n\nMore:Canada wildfires are turning North Jersey skies orange. Here's our complete coverage\n\nConditions are expected to improve after midnight and into Friday but the region will still likely have air quality issues going into the weekend. \"Hopefully today is the worst of it,\" Connolly said.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday morning in Newark, Gov. Phil Murphy said New Jerseyans should still try to remain indoors for much of the day especially those with chronic lung conditions.\n\nHealth impacts\n\nHospitals saw a slight increase in the number of people entering emergency rooms with respiratory issues on Wednesday. About 143 people sought care for asthma attacks - the highest amount since high pollen days two months ago, said Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli.\n\nPulmonologists caution that those who have chronic lung or heart disease will be at greater risk in the days to come if the smoke doesn't dissipate.\n\n\"The longer this lasts, the greater the risk becomes,\" said Dr. Eric Costanzo, a pulmonologist and chief of critical care at Jersey Shore University Medical Center. \"We haven't had a lot of activity in our emergency department but that's something that may change over the next 24, 48 hours.\"\n\nThe smoke comes from 200 forest fires mostly in Quebec that firefighters are having trouble containing. Murphy was in contact with Canadian officials Wednesday. He said 10 to 12 million acres had already burned. “The scale of this is extraordinary,” Murphy said.\n\nHow long is the wildfire smoke going to last?\n\nMeteorologists say the weather pattern may not change until Saturday.

Outside observers have expressed skepticism that Russia can continue to produce high-tech weaponry amid severe international sanctions, particularly if procurement of some technology by Russia is restricted.\n\nIn addition, Shoigu spoke about legal changes that would guarantee government support to Russian troops who have fought in Ukraine, TASS reported.\n\nScrutiny of Shoigu had increased in recent days. On Thursday, Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on media reports that he had health problems.\n\nShoigu, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has kept a low profile recently despite having a leading role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The independent investigative Russian outlet Agentstvo reported Wednesday that Shoigu was in poor health, citing anonymous sources in the ministry.\n\nPeskov dodged questions on Thursday about the health of Shoigu. “The Defense Minister has a lot on his plate at the moment,” he said when CNN asked about Shoigu’s reported absence. “The special military operation is going on. Naturally, now is not exactly the time for media activity, this is quite understandable.”\n\nThe Kremlin spokesperson declined to disprove the report by Agentstvo when asked by CNN. “I can’t. You shouldn’t listen to the Agenstvo media outlet. Please address [these questions to] the Ministry of Defense.”\n\nShoigu appeared in a Channel One broadcast on March 18 that the Russian outlet said was from that day, but Russian journalists have speculated that the event being broadcast was from March 11.\n\nState-owned TV channel Russia 24 broadcast footage on Thursday of a virtual meeting attended by Shoigu, but did not say when the meeting took place.\n\nThe anchor quoted Peskov suggesting Shoigu was giving a report to the National Security Council on the military operation in Ukraine remotely. The broadcast footage, which interrupted a live interview, did not show Shoigu speak, but his image appeared on screen among other video call participants reporting to Putin.\n\nDuring a televised Security Council Meeting in Russia on March 11, Shoigu told Putin that its invasion of Ukraine was being carried out successfully, despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nWestern leaders said at the time that Russia’s military had encountered unplanned obstacles and resistance.\n\n“All is going according to the plan, we report to you here every day this week,” Shoigu said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russian army had received more than 16,000 applications from volunteers in the Middle East wanting to join the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe defense minister also asked Putin for more weapons to arm the separatist regions in Ukraine’s Donbas.\n\nRussian military leaders, including Shoigu, have been stonewalling their US counterparts, declining calls since the invasion began, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement Thursday. He added that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark A. Milley, “have sought, and continue to seek, calls with their Russian counterparts. Minister Shoigu and General (Valery) Gerasimov have so far declined to engage.”\n\n“We continue to believe that engagement between U.S. and Russian defense leaders is critically important at this time,” Kirby added.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the last known time Austin last spoke with Shoigu was on February 18.

The two last spoke on February 18, a week before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt ends an extended period in which Russia’s top military leaders repeatedly refused to speak with their American counterparts.\n\nOn March 24, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley “have sought, and continue to seek” phone calls with Shoigu and the Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the top Russian general, but the Russians “have so far declined to engage.”\n\nFollowing the call between Austin and Shoigu, Milley is also expected to reach out to his Russian counterpart to see if it’s possible to schedule a call, a defense official tells CNN, but there is no conversation currently on the schedule.\n\nThe two have not spoken since February 11, one week before the last call between Austin and Shoigu.\n\nOn March 1, the US and Russia established a deconfliction line because the two militaries are operating so close together. Some of Russia’s strikes in Ukraine were close to the border with Poland where US troops are operating. Similar to the deconfliction mechanism the US and Russia have over Syria, the idea is to avoid any miscalculation or misunderstanding that might lead to an unintentional and dangerous escalation.\n\nBut even as the Pentagon said the line was successfully tested once or twice daily, there was no communication until now at the highest levels of the US and Russian militaries.\n\n“We have not stopped trying [to establish communications] since the last time they spoke, which is right before the invasion, so it’s been a consistent effort,” a senior defense official said in a briefing with reporters Friday.\n\nBut the official tempered expectations on the impact of the call, saying it wouldn’t solve any “acute issues” or result in “direct change” in Russia’s military actions or increasingly hostile rhetoric.\n\nThe call comes at a particularly fraught time between Russia and the West, with no clear off ramp for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war deep into its third month.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said Friday that the country was entering a long phase of the war, defying early expectations that Kyiv would collapse quickly.\n\n“In order to win it now, we must carefully plan resources, avoid mistakes, project our strength so that the enemy, in the end, cannot stand up to us, ” Reznikov said.\n\nDespite losses that have forced Russia to retreat around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and near the city of Kharkiv in the northeast, Moscow has shown no outward signs of backing off.\n\nVladimir Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, insisted that the Kremlin’s “special military operation” remains on track, even as he acknowledged that it is “not proceeding at the speed certain people wanted in Russia.”\n\nMeanwhile, Finland and Sweden are drawing ever closer to joining NATO, and the US is poised to approve another $40 billion package in aid to Ukraine, including billions in new weapons and equipment.\n\nBoth are indications that the West does not see either this conflict or its strategic consequences dissipating quickly.\n\nFinland’s ambassador to NATO, Klaus Korhonen, told CNN that the enormous groundswell of support in his country for joining the treaty alliance was a “very drastic change in our security environment.”\n\nRussia warned that it would bolster its ground forces and air defenses near Scandinavia and more naval forces if Finland and Sweden join NATO, but the threat has done little to deter their moves toward the alliance, serving perhaps only to hasten their ascension.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/960727/wagner-boss-to-pull-troops-from-bakhmut-over-ammunition-row", "title": "Wagner boss to pull troops from Bakhmut over ammunition row | The ...", "text": "The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has furiously announced that his forces are to retreat from Bakhmut, a key battleground in eastern Ukraine.\n\n“Surrounded by corpses,” Yevgeny Prigozhin delivered an “obscenity-strewn video tirade” against Vladimir Putin’s generals, said The Times, “bringing infighting in the military to a new crisis point”.\n\nHe called Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, and Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, “scumbags” and said that they would “burn in Hell, eating their guts” for failing to provide his group with enough ammunition.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Guardian said that Shoigu “also spoke to Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, but Moscow did not mention the dirty bomb allegations in its statement summarising that call”.\n\nThere has been widespread disbelief given that the Russian defence minister has cited no evidence for his claims that Ukraine could use a bomb to spread radioactive material.\n\nBut Moscow is “expected to repeat the allegation during a meeting of the UN's Security Council”, said the BBC. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the Russian representative to the council, Vassily Nebenzia, said his country would “regard the use of the dirty bomb by the Kyiv regime as an act of nuclear terrorism”.\n\nWhat is a dirty bomb?\n\nA dirty bomb is different from a nuclear bomb. The blast from the latter is generated by a nuclear reaction rather than conventional explosives so a nuclear explosion can be “thousands to millions of times more powerful”, according to a fact sheet from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Nevertheless, the radioactive material from a dirty bomb “would likely fall to the ground within a few city blocks or miles of the explosion”, said DHS.\n\nThe Atlantic’s Tom Nichols explained that the “gunk” inside such a bomb could include “anything that is highly radioactive: nuclear reactor waste, the leftover pieces of a nuclear weapon, even radiological materials from a hospital”.\n\nHowever, DHS said it is “very difficult” to design one that “would deliver radiation doses high enough to cause immediate health effects or fatalities in a large number of people”. The aim is therefore thought to be to contaminate areas to disrupt lives and to cause anxiety in people who think they have been exposed.\n\nWhat is Russia up to?\n\nAndriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, dismissed Russia’s claims on a Telegram channel post on Monday, calling it “dirty blackmail” which “looks very primitive”.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the Ukrainian minister “suggested Shoigu’s comments amounted to an attempt to pressure foreign backers into cutting supplies of weaponry and pressuring Kyiv into peace talks that would stall efforts to militarily liberate more than 15% of the territory in eastern and southern regions still occupied by Russia”.\n\nThe Washington-based Institute for the Study of War added that Shoigu’s comments were a sabre-rattling attempt to “slow or suspend western military aid to Ukraine and possibly weaken the Nato alliance in scaremongering calls with several Nato defence ministers”.\n\nThe Atlantic’s Nichols suggested it could also be part of “the preparation for a Russian ‘false flag’ operation”, whereby Moscow explodes its own dirty bomb, blames Ukraine and then demands “that Ukraine surrender or face nuclear retaliation”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Peter Weber", "Joel Mathis", "Elliott Goat", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/europe/russia-ukraine-war-tide-turning-lister-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tide turns in the Ukraine war as Russia makes progress in the east ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian forces are arguably having their best spell since the invasion of Ukraine began four months ago.\n\nThey have eliminated most Ukrainian defenses in the Luhansk region, consolidated control of a belt of territory in the south, improved their logistics and command structure and blunted the effectiveness of Ukrainian attack drones.\n\nWithin the last week, the Russians have been rewarded for their intense – some would say merciless – bombardments of the remaining parts of the Luhansk region held by Ukrainian forces, which have finally given up Severodonetsk and lost territory south of Lysychansk.\n\nThe head of the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic, Leonid Pasechnik, predicted last Friday that Russian forces would completely encircle Lysychansk within two or three days. So far they haven’t, but the city is in imminent peril.\n\nA column of Ukrainian army tanks rolls down a road near Lysychansk on June 19, 2022. Justin Yau/Sipa USA/Reuters\n\nRussian forces have also stepped up attacks in the Donetsk region, getting slightly closer to the belt of industrial towns in the region that runs south from Sloviansk through Kramatorsk to Kostiantynivka.\n\nIn Lysychansk and many of the towns studded across the meandering front lines that pass through five regions, the Ukrainians may well face a repeat of what happened in Severodonetsk, where they were bombarded into withdrawing. There was simply nothing left that could be defended.\n\nThe immediate dilemma for the Ukrainian military is whether it remains committed to defending Lysychansk, with the risk of losing troops and weapons if the city is encircled – and whether Ukraine’s political leadership will order a withdrawal to new defensive lines.\n\nIf so, can the units now in the pocket of territory held by Ukraine retreat without being decimated? Large sections of the highway from Lysychansk to Bakhmut are littered with wreckage, and Russian units are edging closer to Bakhmut itself.\n\nArtillery shells hit the town of Bakhmut on the morning on June 26, 2022, damaging several homes and killing at least one person. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIt appears the Russians are not currently making much progress from Izium in the north towards Sloviansk, despite repeated attempts to break through Ukrainian lines. Even so, Ukrainian officials cautioned Sunday that Russian forces were “accumulating” north of Sloviansk. The Russian military can quickly mobilize a handful of battalion tactical groups sitting across the border.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers are not getting carried away with optimism. Yuri Kotyenok, for one, believes that Russian forces do not have enough manpower to encircle the heavily fortified cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nIn the longer run, the Ukrainians’ best hope is that as they deploy more Western weaponry capable of destroying Russian artillery, rocket systems and command posts far behind the front lines, they can gradually reduce the deficit in firepower.\n\nBut weapons such as the HIMARS rocket system, which has a range of 70 kilometers (43 miles) in the configuration supplied to Ukraine, require several weeks of training. And in Donbas, several weeks is a long time given the current pressure on Ukrainian forces.\n\nThat pressure is all the greater because many of the units deployed to the region are among the most experienced that Ukraine has. They have been worn down by the sheer intensity of Russian bombardment and are not easily replaced.\n\nAnd the Ukrainian military has already lost in combat some of the weapons rushed to the front. Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed last week that Russian strikes had already eliminated some of the US-supplied M777 howitzers.\n\nThe Russian offensive has also learned from mistakes made during the initial and abortive drive towards Kyiv. Air defenses, principally the S-300, have been deployed to provide extensive rather than local cover, making Ukrainian attack drones less effective. Anecdotally, it seems fewer videos have been posted recently on social media showing Ukrainian combat planes in action.\n\nA man inspects a bomb crater after Russian artillery shells hit a district of Kharkiv on June 26, 2022. Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nRussia appoints new commanders\n\nThe Russian hierarchy has also been reorganized, with new commanders for the southern and central forces committed to Ukraine under the overall leadership of Deputy Defense Minister Gennady Zhidko.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said the “Russian high command is reshuffling and restructuring military command in order to better organize operations in Ukraine.”\n\nIt’s perhaps no accident that the first reported visit of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and senior commanders to forces involved in the “special military operation” came as the tide seemed to flow in Russia’s favor. Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.\n\nRob Lee, an analyst of the Russian military at King’s College London, noted that Zhidko sat next to Shoigu at meetings during his visit. Lee recalled that Russia apparently “had no overall commander in the initial phase (in March), violating the unity of command principle.”\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu attends the Victory Day military parade in central Moscow on May 9, 2022. Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe great unknown is whether Russian success in rolling up Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk might encourage a further expansion of its war aims beyond the special military operation – perhaps an effort to sustain the momentum as far as the Dnipro river, which essentially divides Ukraine into two.\n\nThat is the worst-case scenario for the Ukrainians and for now it remains a distant possibility rather than an imminent risk. Ukrainian forces are still defending some 12,000 square kilometers (4,600 square miles) of Donetsk alone (an area the size of Connecticut.)\n\nDespite Ukrainian reverses in recent weeks, there is still plenty of evidence that Russian armor is also suffering a high rate of attrition. Western officials believe some battalion tactical groups have been reconstituted.\n\nAnd there may be a silver lining for Ukraine in its battlefield reverses: they make the case for an accelerated weapons pipeline from the West just as the G7 leaders meet.\n\nOne of President Zelensky’s most committed backers, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is aware of the risk of “Ukraine fatigue” as the battlefield appears to turn in Russia’s favor.\n\n“The first few weeks and months of the Ukrainian resistance have been characterized by overwhelming global unity and a huge surge of support for the Ukrainian people,” he said as the G7 got underway in Germany.\n\n“It is essential that this is sustained for the long term. Russia’s behavior and the atrocities Putin is committing must not become normalized in the eyes of the world.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden issued a similar appeal. “We have to stay together. Putin has been counting on from the beginning that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter, but we haven’t and we’re not going to,” he said.\n\nThere is – for now – no sign that either side is going to blink, not least because so much is at stake.\n\nHal Brands, writing in Foreign Affairs, said the conflict “has both highlighted and deepened the fundamental global cleavage today – the clash between advanced democracies that are committed to the existing international order and the Eurasian autocracies trying to overturn it.”\n\nBut for Putin, this war of choice is an installment (a big one) of an existential struggle against US hegemony.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War concluded that the Kremlin “intends to conduct a protracted conflict in Ukraine and is seeking to advance mobilization efforts to support long-term military and political goals in occupied areas of Ukraine.”", "authors": ["Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/politics/us-ukraine-aid-skepticism-putin-analysis/index.html", "title": "Putin has been watching and waiting for this moment in Washington ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor months, Russian President Vladimir Putin has waited and watched, hoping for a fracturing of the remarkable Washington consensus built by President Joe Biden on the need to do everything it takes to defend democracy in Ukraine.\n\nNow, at last, the first cracks may be appearing.\n\nThere is no sign that the $18 billion US pipeline of military aid that has helped Ukraine drive back Russia’s onslaught is immediately in danger. But the stirrings of political opposition to an endless US role in the war are growing on both sides of the aisle just two weeks before the November midterms.\n\nEven the slightest hint of a softening of American resolve could comfort Putin as the Kremlin strongman prepares to inflict a painful winter on Ukrainian civilians and Europeans reliant on Russian gas.\n\nIn what can only be described as a political debacle on Tuesday, progressive Democrats published, then withdrew, a letter initially signed in June that called on the White House to match its effort to arm Ukraine with a strong diplomatic effort to engage Russia and seek a ceasefire. This came days after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the possible next speaker, warned that Kyiv could not expect a “blank check” on aid if the GOP is in charge next year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback McCarthy threatens to cut aid to Ukraine if GOP win midterms 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that the GOP leader was forced into a damage control operation with national security leaders in his conference and insisted he didn’t want to cut aid to Ukraine, but merely to ensure tax-payer dollars were not automatically rubber-stamped for the war. The furor over his remarks, reported by CNN’s Melanie Zanona, Kylie Atwood, Jeremy Herb and Katie Bo Lillis, shows the fine line McCarthy will have to walk on the issue if the GOP wins the majority.\n\nFor example, ex-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme. Trump will be a huge influence on any future Republican House majority after the midterms.\n\nEx-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has, meanwhile, been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme.\n\nIt’s clear that a bipartisan consensus for aiding Ukraine still exists in Washington. But the rumblings that Biden’s hardline on Russia may not always enjoy near unanimous support came at an especially sensitive time as the West seeks to discredit Russia’s latest round of nuclear rhetoric – a warning that Kyiv could use a dirty bomb. The claims have led to high-level talks between US and Russian military chiefs and are widely being interpreted as either more scare tactics or perhaps an attempt by Moscow to create a false flag operation that could be used as a pretext for its own use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired general: Russia accusing Ukraine of planning a 'dirty bomb' could be a warning 01:56 - Source: CNN\n\nSeeking to highlight US and Western commitment to Ukraine amid the political chatter, Biden delivered a fresh warning on Tuesday against the use of smaller-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n“Let me just say: Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake for it to use a tactical nuclear weapon,” Biden told reporters after he was asked whether Russia was preparing to use a dirty bomb. “I’m not guaranteeing you that it’s a false flag operation yet, don’t know, but it would be a serious, serious mistake.”\n\nThe President’s comments were a reminder that the maneuvering in Washington over Ukraine aid is taking place in a critical context, with anxiety still acute over a possible escalation of the war that could spill over into direct US-Russia hostilities and put the world on a disastrous path toward a full-on nuclear escalation.\n\nThis is why signs of fraying political resolve in the United States, and in some allied nations, are so significant. They could convince Putin that a war of attrition over the winter could sooner or later cause fatigue in the West and therefore weaken Ukraine’s ability to fight.\n\nQuestions that need to be asked\n\nAnd yet some of the questions raised by those who are cautious about the US stance are relevant and important. A foreign policy operation that lines up the United States against its former Cold War foe and nuclear rival must be constantly evaluated and justified by the President, given the cost and risks.\n\nThe fact that there is no diplomatic track in the conflict – Biden has several times mused privately that he doesn’t know what Putin’s “off-ramps” might be – is worthy of discussion and, potentially, testing in contacts with Moscow. And at a time of raging inflation and economic hardship in the United States, it is incumbent on the administration and its supporters to demonstrate to American taxpayers why a war on the edge of Europe is sucking up billions in public money, even if it’s not as if Ukraine currently has the “blank check” McCarthy mentioned.\n\nThe risk, though, is that such debates still play into the hands of Putin, who has already demonstrated his capacity to exploit and widen US political divides with his election-meddling scheme in 2016 and the hold he had over Trump, even getting him to denounce US intelligence agencies in a joint news conference.\n\nSooner or later, the political jousting in Washington over how long the US should stay involved in arming Ukraine – and how much it would cost – will stumble on the critical questions that could decide the war and could be the motivation for Putin’s frequent escalation of nuclear rhetoric that raises the stakes.\n\nIs the West as dedicated as Putin, whose political survival may depend on victory or at least not losing, to prevailing in Ukraine? And is it really willing to enter into a dangerous cycle of escalation that could risk wider nuclear war to do so?\n\nPolitical drama on both sides of the aisle\n\nIt is with these questions lingering that the drama over a letter signed by 30 progressives played out on Tuesday. Most of the members did not endorse releasing the letter this week, and some said they wouldn’t have signed it now given the grave turn the war has taken in recent days. The anger over the letter caused Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to withdraw the letter, saying it was drafted months ago and released by staff without vetting.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Liberal Democrats abruptly withdraw letter on Ukraine policy amid anger 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nThe episode did not just threaten to expose vulnerable lawmakers just two weeks before an election in which Democrats increasingly fear they will lose the House. It could give McCarthy cover in a future Congress to argue that opposition to Biden’s multi-billion dollar arms packages is not just a Republican preoccupation.\n\nAnd while the letter was withdrawn, some of its sentiments could boil up again.\n\nThe letter said that lawmakers were under no illusions about the difficulty in engaging Russia, given its “outrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine.” But it added: “If there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America’s responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that the terms that Russia has set for any peace deal involve locking in its battlefield gains. Now that it has illegally annexed several Ukrainian regions, any preconditions that Putin would set would be impossible for Kyiv to agree to. And rolling back such positions would deal the Russian leader the defeat he is desperate to avoid. So while the idea of talking might seem appealing, it’s not clear how the US could shift the calculus of either side. And Biden has repeatedly insisted he will not negotiate over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s head, as Putin would like.\n\nOne progressive Democrat, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga that he did not support the decision to pull back the letter.\n\n“I think the letter was common sense,” Khanna said. “I support making sure we arm Ukraine and provide arms to Ukraine and continue to fund it, but I also believe that the President, as he said, we are at a risk of nuclear war.”\n\n“Don’t you think our counterpart should be talking to Russia? Of course they should to be sure that it doesn’t escalate.”\n\nThere is also a risk that diplomacy at this stage could offer Putin a prize for the human carnage he perpetrated in Ukraine.\n\n“There is moral and strategic peril in sitting down with Putin too early. It risks legitimizing his crimes and handing over parts of Ukraine to Russia in an agreement that Putin won’t even honor,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\n“Sometimes, a bully must be shown the limits of his power before diplomacy can work.”\n\nOne thing that the drama over the Democratic letter on Ukraine did achieve was to show that while support for Ukraine is bipartisan, anxiety about the war is too, even if the skeptics are a smaller group so far.\n\nWhat a Republican House could mean for Ukraine\n\nThe prospect of a House more squarely in Trump’s ideological image after the midterm elections and of more GOP senators who share his “America First” worldview will worry the administration.\n\n“I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy said in an interview with Punchbowl News last week, which was seized upon by Democrats.\n\nBut it did not necessarily mean the California lawmaker was determined to cut off aid. He may simply have been creating some political room for himself in the knowledge of the sensitivity of the issue in his pro-Trump party. In theory, a speaker McCarthy would be able to pass a Ukraine funding bill by using both Republican and Democratic votes.\n\nBut whether his own position in a fractious GOP conference would allow him to do so is another matter. That’s one reason why there is growing talk in Washington that Democrats might try to pass a mammoth bill during the lame-duck Congress, which they will still control after the midterms even if the GOP wins, to carry Ukraine through next year’s fighting.\n\nMcCarthy is not the only Republican sounding skeptical notes. Ohio Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance said he didn’t really care about what happened to Ukraine before the invasion and that the US should worry about the influx across its own southern border. (His comment has been used by Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan, who is seeking to make inroads among the state’s significant Ukrainian exile community). Vance is one of a new breed of potential GOP senators that could prove more skeptical to aiding Ukraine than the old guard of senior leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and hawkish South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\nSimilar sentiments to Vance’s are often heard on conservative media. But those opinions usually discount the broader implications of the war in Ukraine. The conflict is so important because it represents more than a territorial spat on the far edges of Europe. It is a fight for democracy itself. If Ukraine falls, Russia will establish the principle that a large authoritarian nation can simply wipe a smaller neighbor off the map.\n\nThis would have grave consequences in other conflicts – for example, over Taiwan amid rising concerns China could try to take back the democratic island by force. And a Russian victory in Ukraine could directly threaten America’s NATO allies and bring the US closer to a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/955947/in-pictures-russia-invasion-ukraine", "title": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine | The Week", "text": "Images of Ukraine’s fierce battle against Russian invasion have flooded out of the besieged nation since rocket attacks on the capital city Kyiv last week gave the first indication that Vladimir Putin had given the order for a full-scale assault.\n\nFrom volunteers signing up to defend the country on the frontline, to residents sheltering in metro stations to escape Russian shells, the conflict has been marked by the resilience of the Ukrainian people, embodied by their President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n“Below ground, above ground, there’s remarkable resistance,” said BBC international correspondent Lyse Doucet in The New Statesman. “In an existential war unleashed by a Russian leader who believes their country shouldn’t exist, Ukrainians have become ever-more Ukrainian.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Therefore, “the West may be better off with Putin than his alternatives”.\n\nA “post-Putin Russia may look like Serbia after Milošević”, wrote Tony Barber for the Financial Times. Serbia after its strongman former president Slobodan Milošević “was no longer a warmongering, hyper-nationalist state” but “it evolved into a flawed democracy and remained at odds with the west”, Barber argued. Russia will “certainly not tailor its foreign policy to suit the west”, he predicted. “At home, the ruling group will ensure that nationwide elections always keep it in power.”\n\nThere is “an ultranationalist tendency in Russian politics, once too unruly for Putin’s taste, but now with a louder voice because of the Ukraine war”, said Barber, and “it seems certain to play some role in setting the tone of future Russian politics”.\n\nOver the last nine years, the “self-appointed tribunes of Russian nationalism” have been “boxed out of decision-making or co-opted for their symbolic value”, wrote Greg Afinogenov for London Review of Books. But “if they were ever to seize power for real, nothing good would come of it”.\n\nOne exit could be followed by another, according to an opponent of Putin. “Any post-Putin ruler would be significantly weaker in terms of legitimacy and public authority… the regime will try to hold on to power but will not last for long,” Vladimir Milov, a long-standing opposition politician who was deputy energy minister early in Putin’s rule, told The Guardian.\n\nWhat next?\n\nHowever, Putin is not about to step aside quietly, said some commentators, and the recent attempted coup may have actually strengthened his hand.\n\n“The irony is that visions of a nuclear arsenal being divided between warlords and rival armies clashing on the European Union’s borders have helped Putin,” wrote Mark Galeotti in The Spectator, “discouraging some who would otherwise want to see a more assertive approach to the ageing autocrat.”\n\nThe president has “invoked the smuta”, the “‘Time of Troubles’ that followed the death of Ivan the Terrible”, added Galeotti, which was “characterised by dynastic crises, foreign invasion, hunger and revolt”. This evocation was “a clear attempt to push the ‘better the devil you know’ argument”, he added.\n\nThis argument has enjoyed some influence at home. “The army, the FSB and the technocrats who make things happen” are “thinking about life after Mr Putin”, said The Economist. “Yet even if they see him as a liability, they may not be prepared to act.”\n\nThey “fear repression” and see Putin “as a nail holding their dysfunctional system together”. It may be “rusty and bent”, but if they pull the nail out, “the whole lot will come tumbling down – and they along with it”.\n\nThe next presidential election is due in March 2024, by which time Putin will have been in power for a quarter of a century. Meanwhile, the world at large is considering what might come when he eventually leaves office. “The point is that the West cannot allow itself to be paralysed by a fear of what will follow Putin,” said Galeotti.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Elliott Goat", "Rebecca Messina", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/958069is-putin-running-out-of-options-ukraine", "title": "Is Putin running out of options in Ukraine? | The Week", "text": "Until last week, Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine had been “almost completely invisible to most Muscovites”, said The Daily Telegraph. The once prominent “Z” signs – symbols of support for the invasion – had started to disappear in April; supermarket shelves were well stocked; restaurants were full.\n\nEven as Russian troops in Kharkiv were being forced into retreat in mid-September, Putin put on a show of normality by attending the opening of a Ferris wheel. But last Wednesday the illusion came crashing down, when he gave a speech in which he threatened to use “all the means at our disposal” to defend Russia’s territorial integrity – and announced the nation’s first mobilisation since the Second World War.\n\nFor the millions of Russians who had been either indifferent to it or pretending to be, the conflict suddenly became “urgent and personal”. Putin and his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, went to some lengths to stress that it was a “partial mobilisation”, and that only people with recent combat experience would be drafted – around 300,000 in total. But there were reports of men in their 50s getting their call-up papers, and many Russians were convinced that a far wider mobilisation was on the cards.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nWithin minutes of Putin’s speech, men were scrambling to avoid the draft, said Pjotr Sauer in The Guardian. Flights to “no visa” destinations sold out; there were reports of cars streaming across the borders into Georgia, Kazakhstan and Finland; and on the Russian search engine Yandex, searches for “how to break your arm” rocketed.\n\nMobilisation has ‘breached unspoken pact’\n\nThe mobilisation has breached the unspoken pact that Putin had made with the Russian people, said The Washington Post: you stay out of politics, and turn a blind eye to our corruption, and we won’t interfere in your daily lives. And in towns and cities across the country, the people have been showing their anger: around 2,000 people have been arrested in protests against the draft; there have been arson attacks on recruitment offices in at least 16 regions; and in Irkutsk this week, a young man shot a recruitment officer. Russians are “snapping out” of their torpor, and making it clear that they don’t want to be cannon fodder in Putin’s war.\n\nBelligerent as it was, Putin’s speech was the bluster of a politician who is feeling the pressure, said The Times. He isn’t only coming under attack from anti-war protesters – he has also been facing public criticism and even mockery from Russian nationalists, who have been enraged by the rout in Kharkiv. The military elite has long been calling for full mobilisation.\n\nBut drafting reservists, to bolster Russia’s depleted and morale-sapped forces, undermines two of the “conceits” that Moscow has relied on to keep the public onside, said the FT: that the war is a “special military operation” to “liberate” Ukraine, and that it is going to plan. It’s not even as if the call-up will achieve much in the short term. It will take months to get the reservists battle-ready, not least because so many instructors are already at the front.\n\nUnlikely to compensate for losses\n\nIn any case, bringing in reluctant conscripts is unlikely to compensate for Russia’s staggering losses, said Edward Lucas in The Times. Since February, around 80,000 soldiers from an initial invading force of 120,000 have been killed, wounded or captured; in a single week of fighting near Kharkiv this month, the Russians lost 100 tanks. The Ukrainians, by contrast, are not only making good use of captured Russian hardware; thanks to the “extraordinary logistical capabilities of the US military”, their front-line troops can rely on a stream of new weapons and ammunition, and every week, “hundreds of soldiers arrive from Western-led training”.\n\nThe worse the war goes for Russia, “the angrier its architect becomes”, but he has few options, and none are good. His nominal allies, in China and India, have made no secret of their concern about his actions; he can’t risk attacking Nato states; and any use of nuclear weapons would be politically “suicidal”. His only real hope is that in the hard winter ahead, Western will crumbles.\n\nSham referendums part of plan B\n\nThe sham referendums in occupied Ukrainian territories are part of this plan B, said Alexander Gabuev in the FT. Putin reckons that by declaring them part of Russia, while also threatening to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia’s territorial integrity, he can scare EU and US leaders into reining in their support for Ukraine and lobbying Kyiv to abort its counter-offensive. The plan, however, is flawed, because Kyiv will not give up the fight.\n\nAnd for Putin, it creates another self-made trap, said Mark Galeotti in The Times. If Russian troops are forced to retreat from these territories, he can’t spin it as a “regrouping”: he will have to escalate the conflict further to regain them, or “be the leader who surrendered ‘Russian soil’”.\n\nPutin is backed into a corner, said Kim Sengupta on The Independent. He is lashing out, and another layer of uncertainty has been added to an already perilous situation.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Elliott Goat", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Rebecca Messina", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}]}

Or that “Googling” a topic could give you a concise summary of what you’re trying to find without having to click through huge numbers of links?\n\nThese and many other clever new capabilities will shortly become part of your everyday computing experience thanks to new features Google introduced this week at their annual Google I/O conference. Leveraging a red-hot and truly transformative technology known as generative AI (artificial intelligence), Google unveiled a suite of new functions for both PCs and smartphones that are going to quickly make the old ways of doing these tasks feel downright archaic.\n\nIn the case of writing emails, for example, instead of getting the occasional word choice or word suggestion that Gmail has started to offer, a new Help Me Write function will generate an entire message based on a simple request of what you want.\n\nFewer passwords:Google rolls out passkey as password alternative\n\nWho gets a blue checkmark:Google says Gmail is getting blue checkmarks to improve email security\n\nNeed to send a note to a company for a refund, for example, or follow up with a colleague on a project? Just type in a description of what you need, and Gmail will not only create a fully formed message using relevant information from previous emails in your inbox, it will also let you adjust the length and the tone (conversational, formal, etc.) of the message it creates. It’s like a magical digital assistant. You can edit or adjust what it creates before you hit send, but the time and frustration savings can be enormous.\n\nHow Google will use generative AI\n\nBeyond practical usage, you can also use these generative AI text capabilities for all kinds of cool creative applications. Want to create song lyrics about a particular topic or generate bedtime stories for your kids based on whatever theme, character, or animal they happen to be currently interested in? No problem. Plus, as you’ll discover, the results can be astonishingly good.\n\nIf you also happen to use Google Docs, Google plans to bring similar capabilities there using what it’s calling Duet AI for Workspace. Like Microsoft’s recently announced Copilot features for an upcoming version of their M365 (formerly Office) productivity applications, Duet AI will enable advanced generative AI capabilities in all the applications of Google’s Workspace productivity suite, including Sheets for spreadsheets, Slides for presentations, Google Chat and Google Meet for video meetings and collaboration.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT? Everything to know about OpenAI's free AI essay writer and how it works\n\nWhether for personal or work use, features like automatic slide design with built-in image creation tools or instant formatting of data based on intelligent analysis of the content in a spreadsheet are going to dramatically change how people start to get things done.\n\nGoogling: How search is changing\n\nWhen it comes to searching, the process of “Googling” something is about to undergo the most dramatic changes you’ve ever seen. One of the most impressive capabilities of the technology underlying generative AI is the ability to summarize large amounts of information in a very concise manner. Practically speaking, what that means is it can take data from multiple sources and stitch it all together in a way that gives you exactly what you want in a single response. Plus, it opens the possibility of making extremely detailed requests and getting answers that are impressively complete.\n\nSay, for example, that you want to plan a vacation trip. Traditionally, you’d probably start by searching for things to do and then places to stay at that location. After that, it might be looking for good restaurants in the area. Then you’d pore over tens or hundreds of links and slowly try to piece together an itinerary of some kind.\n\nWith generative AI-powered search, you’ll be able to ask Google for, say, a five-day itinerary for a family of four that includes all the activities and all the restaurants, while accommodating kids who only like pasta and parents who want good cocktails at dinner. Amazingly, it can do all that in a single response.\n\nMaking improvements:Google launches 'experiment updates' page for Bard, says chatbot math skills are getting better\n\nIf your searches are focused on shopping, not only will the updated Google give you suggestions on the best choices for as specific a request as you’d like to make, it can provide ancillary information on how to best use or do whatever is relevant for what you’re buying.\n\nWhat’s also intriguing about these new search capabilities is they inspire the desire to do further investigations on a topic. It’s much easier (and more enjoyable) to dive a bit deeper into any given subject, making the vast resources of the internet even more useful than they’ve ever been before.\n\nThe impact of ChatGPT on Google\n\nAs mentioned, all of these capabilities and many more in other Google applications like Maps, Photos and Universal Translator are being enabled by a technology called generative AI. This is a relatively new type of artificial intelligence that doesn’t just analyze and respond to data but can generate new information based on an input request using sophisticated data models.\n\nWill everything become a DIY experience?AI, self-service are taking over travel.\n\nIt's the end of the world as we know it:'Godfather of AI' warns nation of trouble ahead\n\nMost of the excitement in this area was started by the debut late last year of a chatbot called ChatGPT by a small company called OpenAI. The impact of ChatGPT – which quickly became the fastest-growing technology-focused service of all time, even beating Netflix in the time it took to get to 1 million subscribers – sent shockwaves throughout the entire tech industry. Since then, every company in the tech world has been scrambling to come up with either competitive responses to ChatGPT or offerings that allow them to take advantage of the massive groundswell of interest in generative AI for both the consumer and business worlds.\n\nSurprisingly, Google, which has long been known as a leader in AI technology, seemed to initially be caught off guard by these developments. That was particularly the case when Microsoft announced a big partnership with OpenAI to enable a new generative AI-powered version of their Bing search engine (see “New Bing with ChatGPT brings the power of AI to Microsoft's signature search engine” for more). What’s particularly ironic is that many of the core developments that led to generative AI – particularly a concept known as a transformer model – were initially created by Google researchers.\n\nAt the recent Google I/O event, however, it became very clear that Google has very quickly responded and is set to release a huge range of generative AI-based offerings. From a new large language model (LLM) called PaLM 2 that underlies much of this new work, to the full release of their own chatbot called Bard, to developer and business-focused tools, as well as all the generative text, image and enhanced search functions described above (and lots more), Google finally showed the world what an AI powerhouse it can be.\n\nIt's still early days for generative AI and there are still several challenges around accuracy and potential bias issues that Google and every other company participating in this area are working to solve. But you can’t help getting excited about the impressive range of capabilities that we’ll all soon have access to.

And search quality raters have received new guidance on how to spot and report this content, too.\n\nA fraction, about 0.25%, of searches returns offensive or misleading content, according to Google. Features designed to get people answers more quickly and on more platforms such as smart speaker Google Home are contributing to the problem. For example, autocomplete fills in information you may be searching for as you type. Featured snippets highlights an answer to a query at the top of search results. They are each generated by search algorithms and reflect what people are searching for and what's available on the Web. Public outcry helped torpedo a featured snippet that claimed President Obama was planning a coup d'etat. Other inaccurate answers supplied in featured snippets included: MSG causes brain damage and some U.S. presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nFacebook has taken the brunt of criticism for \"fake news\" that spread before and after the U.S. presidential election. But Google has come under scrutiny, too, with critics pointing to inaccurate or misleading articles in search results, prompting a national debate over the responsibility of technology companies that disseminate information to billions of people.\n\nFake news has created a public relations problem for Google, whose dominance in search rests on the trust of the public, says search expert Danny Sullivan.\n\n\"When your core product is being the best search engine in the world with the greatest results and you have searches that are clearly not the best answer you can come up with, it just looks bad,\" says Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land.\n\nIn November Google said it would bar fake news sites from using its advertising software. Earlier this month Google introduced a feature that places \"Fact Check\" tags on snippets of articles in its news results.\n\n\"From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,\" Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told BBC News after the election.\n\nGoogle scours hundreds of billions of web pages. Tens of thousands of pages come online every minute, and 15% of searches Google sees each day are new, making it challenging for Google to always present people with the best answers to their queries, it says. It's also under siege from so-called content farms trying to game Google's algorithm to appear higher in its search rankings and get their blue links seen and clicked by more people.\n\nThat's why Google says it's soliciting feedback from users who spot troublesome content in the autocomplete and featured snippets. The people who assess the quality of Google search results have received updated guidelines so they, too, can flag what Google calls \"low quality content\" as in misleading information, offensive results, hoaxes and conspiracy theories, Google says.\n\nQuality raters can't change how search results are ranked but feedback from these contractors is used by engineers and machine learning systems to improve Google search results.\n\n\"They are saying it won't be perfect, you are still going to find stuff that may be shocking or may surprise you,\" Sullivan said. \"I think it's good that Google is making an effort and is showing concern.

One crucial area the Internet giant says could use some work: Jobs.\n\nSo Google is launching a new initiative, Google for Jobs, that includes a feature in search that collects and organizes millions of job postings from all over the web to make them easier for job seekers to find.\n\nIn coming weeks, a Google search for a cashier job in Des Moines or a software engineering gig in Boise will pop up job openings at the top of search results. With Google for Jobs, job hunters will be able to explore the listings across experience and wage levels by industry, category and location, refining these searches to find full or part-time roles or accessibility to public transportation.\n\nGoogle is determined to crack the code on matching available jobs with the right candidates, CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote address Wednesday at Google's annual I/O conference for software developers here.\n\n\"The challenge of connecting job seekers to better information on job availability is like many search challenges we’ve solved in the past,\" he said.\n\nPichai says he hopes Google's new job search function will surface new opportunities for job seekers who often don't know there's a job opening \"right next door.\"\n\nGoogle is the latest Silicon Valley company to announce an effort to boost American jobs after President Donald Trump's call to put America first. The aggressive push into jobs could help Google attract even more employment-related advertising. Already, it's expected to pull in three-quarters of search ad spending in the U.S. this year, according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nIt's also another example of the consumer-centric company's dive into the corporate sector as it hunts for new revenue sources beyond advertising.\n\nAnytime an 800-pound gorilla like Google enters a market, it sends shudders through the established players in the targeted industry. Google's leap into travel search was a game changer for the travel booking industry. In job search, the heavyweight is Indeed, which says it's the largest job search engine, with more than 20 million job postings and 200 million unique visitors a month.\n\n\"We are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone’s life,\" Indeed President Chris Hyams told USA TODAY.\n\nOther job-search companies — such as Monster and CareerBuilder — are partnering with Google, an unusual amount of cooperation from its competitors.\n\nGoogle scours the web, pulling from a broad cross-section of job listings, including from Glassdoor, Facebook, LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter. The aim is to \"increase the efficiency of job matching,\" said Nick Zakrasek, a product manager for Google search, who gave USA TODAY a first look at the new search results job seekers will soon see.\n\nJob seekers who find a listing via Google search are then taken to the company or job-search site listing, where they can apply.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nInside Mark Zuckerberg's vision for your Facebook augmented reality\n\nDid Net neutrality keep broadband out of low-income neighborhoods, as FCC claims?\n\nHow a 22-year-old inadvertently stopped a worldwide cyberattack\n\nGoogle I/O: Here are the big changes coming to Google\n\nGoogle for Jobs could prove useful to Americans whose economic anxiety is growing despite low unemployment rates, as more jobs are being displaced by technological advances, increased automation and spreading globalization. Google is very much a part of those advances: It's charting an artificial intelligence-powered future that promises to radically transform how people earn a living in the years ahead.\n\n\"Google’s always looking at new things it can do with the skill set it has, and particularly ways it can get deeper into search and deeper into enterprises,\" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. \"Jobs is a good fit for both of those, where it can provide a custom or deep search function for job listings on the consumer side and also offer businesses a system to hire workers on the enterprise side.\"\n\nFor employers, identifying the right candidates can be daunting, with nearly half of U.S. companies saying they face challenges in filling open positions.\n\nOn the employer front with Google for Jobs, Google is selling artificial intelligence and search technology to companies to make make it easier for them to find qualified recruits on their websites and job boards, Pichai says.\n\nIn November, Google launched a piece of that technology — Clouds Jobs API, which employers access through Google Cloud. The pilot program with FedEx, Johnson & Johnson, Health South and CareerBuilder is being expanded to include more than 30 employers, job boards and staffing agencies, he said.\n\n\"It’s still early days, but we've seen promising results,\" Pichai said. For example, since using the Cloud Jobs API, Johnson & Johnson has found that 18% of job seekers are more likely to apply for a job on the company's career site, he said.\n\nSome Google competitors in job search says the launch of Google for Jobs will help their own job listings businesses.\n\nFacebook says it launched its own jobs feature to ease the strain of job searches on its nearly 2 billion users. \"This partnership with Google helps us accomplish that goal,\" Facebook product manager Gaurav Dosi said in a statement.\n\nGoogle for Jobs is good for the American economy and \"has the potential to radically improve discovery of the millions of jobs on LinkedIn,\" Dan Shapero, vice president of careers and talent at LinkedIn, said in a statement.\n\nFrustrations\n\nFor many job seekers, applying for jobs online can feel like tossing a resume into a fathomless digital abyss. Google says millions of people each day start their hunt for jobs on its search engine. But finding the right job can be a lot trickier than Googling the next movie times.\n\nJob posts are notoriously hard for search engines to classify because of the wide range of keywords used to describe job functions and inconsistency across industries and organizations in job titles. And many people have very specific requirements for the job they are seeking, such as location, accessibility to public transit and special skills.\n\n\"It's something we see in the search logs. We see signs of our users being frustrated and being stressed while they're doing job seeking queries,\" he said.\n\nHow it works\n\nFor example, when conducting a search for sales jobs in Raleigh, North Carolina, openings will soon begin to appear at the top of results.\n\nA job seeker can narrow the search by applying filters, such as jobs posted in the last three days, entry level versus management roles, full-time roles versus part-time, and roles in a particular industry such as retail. Once a job seeker spots something promising, they can click through to the website where the listing is hosted and apply there.\n\nThe goal for Google is to provide a comprehensive set of job postings that include blue-collar and white-collar positions, Zakrasek said. Google will also be able to point job seekers to jobs that have typically been much harder to search for and classify such as retail and service jobs.\n\nHe recently received a thank you note from the brother of a Google engineer who found a job using the feature while it was being tested.\n\n\"This guy had done computer repair, which means opening a computer box and fiddling with the wiring. It's kind of a dying job in this day and age and he had had trouble finding work,\" says Zakrasek. With Google for Jobs, \"he was able to find a position he hadn't seen anywhere else.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn @jguynn", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/05/18/google-home-take-amazon-echo/84542440/", "title": "Meet Home, Google's answer to Amazon Echo", "text": "Marco della Cava\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google officially entered the voice-activated speaker race Wednesday with Google Home.\n\nThe standalone device will compete directly with Amazon's popular Echo and should be available to consumers later this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced at the search company's annual developers conference, Google I/O.\n\nThe move had been anticipated, as Google looks to put its mark on a coming age of artificial intelligence in which machines learn to interpret and answer human queries by leveraging the speed and scope of Big Data and cloud computing.\n\nThough smartphones still hold a lock human-computing interactions, the surprise hit of Amazon's Echo speaker has energized a new category: speakers run by digital assistants connected to a tech giant's app and content ecosystem.\n\nAfter Google Home and Amazon Echo, it's Apple's turn: first take\n\nGoogle Home project lead Mario Querioz held the device in his palm, revealing a design that was shorter and wider than Amazon's cylindrical Echo, which is powered by Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa.

It will be able to play music, complete a range of tasks and answer questions that one would ask of Google search. Google did not reveal a price.\n\n\"Google’s entry (in this market) validates the space and its vision to sit between the consumers and their favorite brands,\" says Forrester analyst Julie Ask. \"However, Google also failed to offer answers to questions such as a firm date on availability, price or access to the service, (which makes one wonder) how open will access be for brands who want to engage their consumers on Google Home.\"\n\nA video screened during the unveiling of Home showcased a morning routine in which a woman checks on her flight, changes a dinner reservation and sends a text to a friend, while her husband asks the device to turn lights on and children pose homework-related questions.\n\nThe future of computing will be ambient and invisible\n\nAsk says that while entertaining, such use-cases for Home don't yet showcase the \"true breakthrough experiences that bots fueled by artificial intelligence and machine learning\" promise to provide. But, she adds, Google \"is on a journey and they have time (because) consumers won’t expect these experiences for another two or three years.\"\n\n\n\nPichai told the 7,000 developers present at Shoreline Amphitheater that the company was working hard on natural language processing, giving examples of how Google's search engine can understand context. Ask about movies playing, and Google will surface nearby theaters. \"Let's go with Jungle Book,\" Pichai said, and the assistant followed up by purchased tickets and sending them to his digital wallet.\n\n\"Every conversation is different and we're working hard to do this for billions of users around the world,\" he said. \"It's an ambient experience that extends beyond devices, beyond just phones, to devices they wear, into their cars and even to their living rooms.\"\n\nSome of the looming questions about the boom in voice-activated computing includes the security of such human-machine conversations as well as just how such voluminous personal-habit information will be used by companies such as Google and Amazon.\n\nAmazon's $179 Echo, which has sold millions of devices since its initial rollout in the fall of 2014, can respond to a range of questions, from ordering a pizza to calling an Uber. Speaker company Sonos recently laid off some of its staff in order to pivot towards voice control. Devices such as Samsung televisions and Comcast remote controls also react to voice activation.\n\nSiri was the first broad-based application of voice command technology when Apple introduced the feature to its iPhone in 2011.\n\nSiri founder Dag Kittlaus recently unveiled Viv, a cloud-based virtual assistant that he contends will be able to respond to queries that contain multiple layers of requests and require contextual thinking to act on.

Microsoft also announced new features for the Start Screen and a personalized lock screen.\n\nThe big news is Cortana, named for a character in the popular Halo video game. It is powered by Microsoft's Bing search engine and essentially replaces the search function on a Windows Phone smartphone.\n\nYou can use the feature, which is launching in its beta, or test phase, to make phone calls, send texts, take a note or give you a reminder.\n\nCortana has a notebook. You can store your interests, places you frequent, calendar, relationships with friends, family and colleagues and your \"quiet hours.\" So for instance, during your quiet hours you can let certain calls come through.\n\nThe more you use the search function the more Cortana learns about you, by asking you if you want her to store it. Yes, Cortana has a female voice. And \"she\" is shaped like a circle.\n\nMicrosoft executive Joe Belfiore also said there will be third-party apps that can extend Cortana functionality, including one for Facebook.\n\nThe Windows Phone 8.1 update starts rolling out to consumers who currently own Windows Phones in the next few months. It will be available on brand-new phones as soon as late April or early May, Belfiore said.\n\nThe keynote kicked off with Windows Phone, but Microsoft also previewed upcoming Windows updates.\n\nOf consumer interest, Microsoft announced an update to touch-friendly Windows that will add features to make it more comfortable to use for people who prefer more traditional mouse-and-keyboard computing.\n\n\n\nThose new features, including some new right-click functions and additions to the task bar, will be available as of Tuesday to owners of Windows 8 PCs, Belfiore said.\n\nCompany executives also outlined ways in which it will make it easier for software developers to create applications that will work across all Microsoft devices.\n\nIn a question-and-answer format late in the morning event, new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called the day's announcements a \"massive milestone\" for the company.\n\nMicrosoft's Build conference is aimed at the thousands of developers who create applications for its products. One of Microsoft's major themes going forward is its vision for unifying Windows across phones, tablets, PCs and even its Xbox video game console.\n\nIDC research analyst Al Hilwa says the announcements Wednesday \"brought a lot of things together for Microsoft and really shows the new approach they are taking.\"\n\nFor developers, bringing phone and tablet platforms closer together \"makes it easier to write new apps. ... In fact, the same apps can be extended to the TV with Xbox, making it unique in the industry to address all three form factors.\"\n\nAll in all, he said, there were \"a ton of new announcements across all parts of Microsoft. Much more consolidated under a single structure than ever before.\"\n\n\n\nRoss Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research, noted that overall Microsoft's announcements \"ranged from the familiar to the reactionary.\" But he noted that the company's quest to offer \"'Windows everywhere\" will allow Microsoft to use its popularity on the desktop to help drive apps for its phones\n\n\n\nAlso at the event, handset-maker Nokia — which Microsoft is acquiring in a $7 billion deal expected to close this month — unveiled three new handsets coming for Windows Phone 8.1.\n\nThe Nokia Lumia 930 is a new flagship coming to foreign markets. It is similar to the Lumia 929 (also known as Icon) that launched recently in the U.S. on Verizon.\n\nNokia chief Stephen Elop also announced the Lumia 630 and 635, two entry-level phones that will arrive in the U.S. this summer.\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft has touted the strides it has made with Windows Phone. It has increased market share and built up offerings in its app store. As of February, there were more than 240,000 apps, including recent mainstay additions such as Vine, Instagram and traffic and mapping app Waze.\n\nYet Windows Phone still trails Apple and Android market share by a wide margin even as it solidifies its spot in third place over BlackBerry. It ended 2013 with 90.9% growth for the year with shipments of 33.4 million units, according to researcher IDC. Android devices by a variety of manufacturers clocked 793.6 million, for 58.7% annual growth.\n\nAs part of the company's push to a \"mobile-first, cloud-first\" world, Nadella last week in San Francisco made his first public appearance as CEO to announce that the popular Office software suite would be available on Apple's iPad.\n\nThe highly anticipated move was seen as a breakthrough as Microsoft focuses on delivering services to businesses and consumers wherever they are. In the week since that announcement, the apps for Word, Excel and PowerPoint have risen to the top of the free download chart for iPad.\n\nOn Monday, Nadella named Elop to head Microsoft's Devices group as part of several executive moves aimed at getting its management structure aligned with the new multiplatform focus.\n\nInvestors so far like what they see in Nadella, who took over the CEO spot from Steve Ballmer in February.

They'll close at 7:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhat to know about Baltimore’s mayoral election\n\nThe collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge thrust the city’s 2024 mayoral election into the spotlight in late March. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to become the liberal-leaning city’s next leader, and they’ll be charged with working with federal and state leaders to mitigate the economic impact of the collapse on businesses and port workers.\n\nFormer Mayor Sheila Dixon is challenging current Mayor Brandon Scott for the position. The race has focused heavily on crime reduction, with both leading candidates highlighting the decrease in homicides during their tenures.\n\nBaltimore’s homicide rate dropped for the first time in three decades during Dixon’s first year in office in 2008. The annual number of homicides dipped below 300 last year under Scott’s watch for the first time since 2015.\n\nSeveral months ago, Dixon, who was forced to resign in 2010 after she was convicted of embezzling gift cards meant for people in need, appeared to be ahead in the race.

Wes Moore; Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Reps. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., to name a few. If she wins the nomination and is elected in November, Alsobrooks will be the first Black woman to represent Maryland in the Senate and the third Black woman ever elected to the chamber.\n\nBut Trone appears to have a slight edge among the state’s electorate.

But Republicans were buoyed by Gov. Larry Hogan's surprise victory in November and are vowing to field a candidate who can make the 2016 race competitive.\n\nO'Malley, who left the governor's office in January after two terms, would be a formidable Senate candidate if he decided to skip a race for the Democratic presidential nomination against Hillary Rodham Clinton. He has name recognition, a bulging list of contacts across the country who can help him raise money, and a base in Baltimore where African-American voters are key.\n\nBut he could find himself in a Democratic primary against Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a former chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee and member of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's inner leadership circle. Van Hollen, whose political base is in the Washington suburbs of Montgomery County, has long been mentioned as a possible future House speaker should Democrats get back into power.\n\nReps. Donna Edwards and John Sarbanes are the other Democrats in Congress whose names are tossed out as possible Senate candidates. Edwards is the first black woman to represent Maryland in Congress and represents Prince George's County in the Washington suburbs. Sarbanes, who represents the Baltimore suburbs and Annapolis, is the son of a longtime U.S. senator.\n\n\"Maryland has a lot of talent, and they'll be telling you about it in the next 10 minutes,\" Mikulski joked at her news conference Monday. She and Sen. Ben Cardin vowed to support whoever wins the Democratic primary next April.\n\nOther possible Democratic candidates could include Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Rep. Elijah Cummings, and Rep. John Delaney, whose personal fortune could be used to help finance an expensive campaign. All the Democrats being mentioned made statements praising Mikulski.\n\nNot so fast, say Republicans.\n\n\"We tend to do well with open seats,\" said Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party. \"The last two open gubernatorial seats we won. The last Senate race we performed well, considering the mood of the nation.\"\n\nCluster was referring to Michael Steele, a former Maryland lieutenant governor, who lost a 2006 U.S. Senate race to Cardin by 10 percentage points in a bad year nationally for the GOP.\n\nCluster said to keep an eye out for Rep. Andy Harris, the only Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, as well as Bob Ehrlich, a former Maryland governor and congressman, and Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman.\n\nDan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and the 2012 GOP Senate nominee, said on Facebook he'll consult with his family and advisers to \"determine whether I can make a more significant impact in Maryland politics from inside, or outside, the system.\"\n\nOne intriguing possibility: Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has been polling well among Republicans with their eye on the White House. Carson has a house in Maryland but is currently registered to vote in Florida.\n\nDespite the GOP's optimism, Maryland hasn't voted for a Republican senator since Charles Mathias won the last of his terms in 1980.\n\nDavid Karol, an associate professor at the University of Maryland, gives the edge to Democrats and noted Senate seats in Maryland don't come around too often. Mikulski will have held the seat for 30 years when she retires after her fifth term, and Paul Sarbanes was also in office for three decades when he retired in 2007.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of jockeying,\" Karol said. \"But being a Democratic senator from Maryland is only slightly less secure than being a member of the House of Lords.

Sinema left the Democratic Party in December 2022 over concerns of \"rigid partisanship.\"\n\nSinema will not run for reelection, citing increased polarization in the Senate. Rep.

Adam Schiff and Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey will be on the ballot in November to fill the seat of the late Feinstein, who died in September 2023. The Super Tuesday ballot featured Schiff, Garvey and two other Democratic House lawmakers: Reps. Barbara Lee and Katie Porter.\n\nSome feel Schiff is to thank in part for Garvey's second-place finish – he spent millions of dollars on ads boosting Garvey in the lead-up to the primary. The race for the liberal state's Senate seat is all but secured for Schiff as Californians haven't voted in a Republican Senator since 1988.\n\nConnecticut\n\nChris Murphy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMurphy has served as the senator from Connecticut since 2013 and is expected to cruise to reelection in 2024 in predominantly blue Connecticut.

In the Democratic primary to replace her, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is widely considered the frontrunner, though businessman Nasser Beydoun and actor Hill Harper have also declared candidacies. On the Republican side, many are tossing their hats into the ring. Republican candidates include former Reps.

Nevada is a fiercely divided state and forms part of a challenging electoral map for Democrats. Army veteran Sam Brown is challenging Rosen in what may be a tight race, based on recent polls.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRobert Menendez\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMenendez has held his Senate seat since 2006. He has not ruled out running for reelection but faces harsh criticism from his own party after he was charged with accepting bribes and obstructing justice. Other Democratic candidates include New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMartin Heinrich\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHeinrich, who has held his seat since 2013, will run again in 2024.

Cramer was a close ally of Trump during the former president's term in office, but has since voiced support for a possible replacement on the 2024 GOP ticket. Katrina Christiansen, an assistant engineering professor at the University of Jamestown, is vying for the seat from the Democratic side.\n\nOhio\n\nSherrod Brown\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBrown, who first won in 2006, is a prominent target for Republicans in 2024. He occupies a swing state seat they see as a possible pick-up in their quest to regain control of the chamber. Republican state Sen. Matt Dolan is running along with businessman Bernie Moreno and GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBob Casey\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCasey was first elected in 2006. Though he represents a swing state identified by Republicans as an ideal win in 2024, he is considered a tough candidate to beat. The son of former Gov. Robert Casey, Sr. he is widely popular in the state, especially with swaths of voters other Democrats have begun to struggle with attracting. Former business executive David McCormick is challenging Casey.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSheldon Whitehouse\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nWhitehouse, who has been in the Senate for a little under a decade, is running for a fourth term. He will face a challenge on the right from Raymond McKay, a veteran and the former president of the Rhode Island Republican Assembly, and Republican State Rep. Patricia Morgan.\n\nTennessee\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\nParty: Republican\n\nElected in 2018, Blackburn has become a prominent voice among conservatives, particularly on culture war issues.

Gloria Johnson, who entered the national spotlight when she was nearly expelled from the state legislature for holding a protest on the House floor against gun violence, will run. Two of her colleagues, Democratic Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis were briefly expelled for the same action. Joining her in the primary is Marquita Bradshaw, an activist for environmental justice who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2020.\n\nTexas\n\nTed Cruz\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCruz, a political firebrand for his party and a two-time presidential candidate, successfully battled off a challenge from Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke in 2018.

For Democrats who face a tough electoral map in 2024, his race is a must-win. Though Kaine is a veteran of Virginia politics, and the state tends to lean blue, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win in 2021 proved a red tilt is not far off.\n\nRepublican hopefuls include veterans Eddie Garcia and Hung Cao and former Ron DeSantis advisor Scott Parkinson.\n\nWashington\n\nMaria Cantwell\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCantwell has been in the Senate for over two decades, first winning election in 2000.

Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., becoming emotional as she recounted her time with Levin on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"He understands the hazards of a misplaced comma. He understands the danger of using an 'and' instead of an 'or,'\" said McCaskill. \"He understands that is the essence of our work — that we craft language that lives up to our purpose and ideals.\"\n\nIt was just one of a series of remembrances for Levin, a Democratic former Detroit City Council president first elected to represent Michigan in 1978. Retiring after six 6-year terms, Levin, 80, delivered his farewell speech from the floor, urging colleagues to reject soundbite politics and — as he has done in the past — encouraging both parties to protect the political minority in the chamber.\n\nCalling minority protections \"the singular hallmark\" of the Senate, he urged the chamber to turn back a precedent set by the Democratic majority he is part of last year to hamper minority filibusters on presidential nominations, saying it violated the Senate's set process for changing the rules.\n\n\"Protections of the minority make the Senate more than just a place to slow things down,\" he cautioned. \"Those protections make it a place where we work things out. It is those protections which produce compromise.\"\n\nFor Levin's colleagues — including many of the who supported that change — it was yet another reminder of the Michigan Democrat's standing in the Senate and as chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has continued to churn out bipartisan products despite a hyperpartisan atmosphere.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., called him the \"best lawyer in the entire Senate,\" saying when Levin \"gives you his word, that's it. You don't worry.\" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and a member of the Armed Services Committee, called Levin \"a remarkable leader\" who runs perhaps \"the best run committee\" in the Senate or House.\n\n\"Why can't the rest of the Senate work the way the Armed Services Committee works?\" asked Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV, and a junior member of the committee. \"The reason is because we don't have enough Carl Levins.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said simply that if someone was asked what the headline of today's proceedings was it would be, \"Mr. Integrity retires from the Senate.\"\n\nIt seemed even to get to always composed Levin, reacting after the speeches and, earlier, with his voice cracking as he concluded his own farewell address and noticed his older brother, U.S. Rep. Sandy Levin, D-Royal Oak, sitting in the chamber nearby and his family sitting in the gallery.\n\nLevin is Michigan's longest-serving U.S. senator ever but his accomplishments far outdistance his longevity. While remaining a staunch liberal, he has been an indefatigable supporter of the state's dominant auto industry and charted a reputation for bipartisanship in producing annual defense authorizations and running investigations into corporate wrongdoing.\n\nNot only has he fought successfully against Pentagon overspending through the years, he has been part of congressional inquiries into the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, abusive credit card practices, the Enron scandal, offshore tax havens and more. Just this week, his work in trying to get to the bottom of treatment of detainees after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was noted in an Intelligence Committee report criticizing harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA.\n\nLevin, in a farewell speech that saw him praise his staff, said he and wife Barbara will stay in Michigan. He said congressional gridlock created by partisan politics was not part of his decision to retire and he departs with \"unabashed confidence\" in the Senate's ability to persevere.\n\nSaying he hoped the next Congress would attack the \"growing gap in our society between a fortunate few and the vast majority of Americans whose fortunes have stagnated or fallen,\" he called for improvements to education, worker training and research which should be paid for \"by closing egregious tax loopholes that serve no economic purpose.\"\n\nHe decried the soundbite journalism practiced off the floor of the Senate, saying it only seems to exacerbate polarization in Washington. Comments uttered offhand to a reporter in a hallway, he said, \"lead too often to less thoughtful discourse and that has helped drive rhetorical wedges between us.\"\n\nBut he reserved his strongest comments for the Democratic majority's use of the so-called nuclear option last year which broke the filibuster on presidential nominations. While Levin said there is no question any president regardless of party should be able to get their nominations confirmed, bypassing the regular process for changing the rules damages the nation and should be overturned..\n\n\"That precedent will not serve the country well in the future. It leaves the minority with no protection, diminishing the unique role of the Senate,\" he said, hoping it will be changed next year.\n\nSeveral senators stepped forward to hug Levin as he concluded his speech, including Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who will become Michigan's senior senator with Levin's departure. She noted he \"outlasted disco and the Soviet Union\" and said Levin's \"heart is in Detroit, where he was born and raised\" and still lives.\n\n\"Everywhere you look,\" she said, \"you see evidence of Sen. Carl Levin's hard work\" from the riverfront in Detroit and funding for the M-1 Rail along Woodward Avenue to coastal and maritime preserves along the Great Lakes. \"You have given so much and we are grateful,\" she said.\n\nSeveral other senators spoke, Republican and Democrat alike. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called him \"perhaps the greatest intellect\" in the Senate. Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland noted Levin was such a stickler for detail he sometimes sent him notes correcting typographical errors in his bill drafts.\n\nIowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who is also retiring, recounted their long friendship and hoped they could remain close friends despite \"all the times the (University of Iowa) Hawkeyes beat the Wolverines in the future.\"\n\nIt was McCaskill's speech, however, which set the emotional tone for the morning, coming from a tough-as-nails former prosecutor who serves with Levin on Armed Services.\n\n\"This is a senators' senator. There are no sharp elbows. There is no heated rhetoric. ... Carl is methodically doing the grind it out work of legislating. He has the tools of a great senator: intellect, integrity, good manners and an unsurpassed work ethic.\"\n\n\"He has taught me more than I can ever say and I will try desperately to live up to the ideal he has set for all of us.\"\n\nContact TODD SPANGLER at 703-854-8947 or at tspangler@freepress.com.

Mike Coffman's seat in the 6th District, in which Hillary Clinton beat Trump by nearly 9 percentage points in 2016, is high on the Democrats' target list. But before they can take him on, they have to pick a challenger and that battle has gotten so heated it overflowed from Colorado into Washington.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nLevi Tillemann, an inventor and former Energy Department adviser supported by the progressive group Our Revolution, sparked a mini-rebellion against Democratic leaders in the House when he released a secret recording in which House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland urged him to drop out of the race.\n\nHoyer said a decision had been made to back Jason Crow, an attorney and Iraq veteran who has been tapped by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's \"red to blue\" program, and raised more than five times as much money as Tillemann.\n\nThere are also four candidates in each of the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor, an unusually large field of candidates for Colorado. Among them is Democratic Rep. Jared Polis, who is giving up his seat in the 2nd District.\n\nTo replace Polis, Republican Peter Yu has no primary but there there's a Democratic contest to succeed him that pits Joe Neguse, an elected member of the University of Colorado board of regents who also ran the state's consumer protection agency, against Mark Williams, a former Air Force pilot and founder of a training company that combines meditation skills \"with the high-performance mindset of flying fighter jets.\"\n\nBallots for the election were mailed to voters, with registered members getting their respective party's ballot. Those who are not affiliated with either party received both ballots, but can only vote and return one. Ballots have to be returned by 7 p.m. MDT, and voters can search for drop-off locations online.\n\nMaryland\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ben Cardin faces eight challengers, including Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman and former U.S. Army private who was convicted of leaking more than 700,000 classified documents. There are also 11 Republicans on the ballot vying for the Republican Senate nomination.\n\nBut most attention in the state has been focused on the governor's race, where eight Democrats are vying to challenge incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who has maintained his popularity within his party — he has no primary challenger — even as he distanced himself from Trump, most recently by pulling the state's National Guard back from the Mexico border to protest the separation of families.\n\nOn the Democratic side, polls in the primary have shown a tight contest between former NAACP executive director Ben Jealous and Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker, who are both African American and have stirred suggestions Maryland could elect its first black governor. Also in the field is state Sen. Rich Madeleno, who aired a campaign ad showing him kissing his husband of 16 years before he says, \"Take that, Trump.\"\n\nJealous has been endorsed by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Baker is backed by much of the Maryland party establishment, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen.\n\nThere are also primaries in both parties in the 6th District in western Maryland, where incumbent Democrat John Delaney will be giving up his seat to run for president.\n\nAmong the Democratic candidates is liquor store owner David Trone, who spent $13 million in a losing bid for the nomination in a different district in 2016 and had spent $9.5 million through June 6 this year. On the Republican side, former Pentagon official Amie Hober has the backing of a Super PAC affiliated with House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nDemocrats also have a contest in the 1st District on the Eastern Shore, which the DCCC, the political arm of House Democrats, put on its list of targeted races even though Trump won there by 29 percentage points in 2016 and Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Harris is favored for re-election by handicappers.\n\nThree candidates are are in the running, including Army veteran Jesse Colvin. Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College in Towson, said Colvin has been running as a moderate similar to Conor Lamb, who won a special election in Pennsylvania in March in a district where Trump won by 20 points.\n\nMaryland's primaries are open only to people registered in the Democratic or Republican parties. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. EDT.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi voters will decide two congressional primary runoffs on Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats state Rep. David Baria of Bay St. Louis and California-native venture capitalist Howard Sherman will face off for a U.S. Senate nomination to challenge incumbent Republican Roger Wicker.\n\nRepublicans Michael Guest, a district attorney, and business consultant Whit Hughes are vying for the open 3rd District U.S. House seat.\n\nSherman, 63, squeezed out the lead in the June 5 primary against Baria, Rep. Omeria Scott, D-Laurel, and three other long-shot candidates. Sherman received nearly 32 percent of the vote to Baria's 31 percent and Scott's 24 percent.\n\nThe winner of the runoff will face Wicker in November.\n\nHollywood A-listers Robert De Niro and Alec Baldwin are among those who've hosted a fundraiser for Sherman, who is married to Meridian native and Emmy-award winning actress Sela Ward.\n\nIn a crowded field of six Republican candidates and relatively low voter turnout, neither Guest nor Hughes earned 50 percent of the vote in the June 6 GOP primary.\n\nGuest, 48, serves as district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties. He was elected to the position in 2008, after 12 years as an assistant district attorney. In addition to his position as DA, Guest is president of the Foundation for Rankin County Public Schools and serves on the board of the state and central Mississippi Crime Stoppers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Phil Bryant endorsed Guest, saying, \"President Trump will make America great again, and Michael will be part of that team.\"\n\nHughes, 42, of Madison, was a member of one of Mississippi State University's standout basketball teams and served as former Gov. Haley Barbour's finance chairman in his 2003 gubernatorial campaign. He has since served as deputy director of the Mississippi Development Authority, then created his own business and development consulting firm.\n\nThe seat is being vacated by longtime Republican Rep. Gregg Harper who is not seeking re-election. While Harper has not publicly endorsed Guest, he did donate to Guest's campaign. Many of Harper's top campaign aides also joined Guest's team.\n\nNew York\n\nDemocrats will pick challengers to a handful of Republican House members who might be vulnerable in November, including Reps. Lee Zeldin, John Faso and John Katko, whose races could be bellwethers of whether a national wave is building. On the GOP side, the big question is whether Michael Grimm, who resigned his seat before pleading guilty to tax fraud and serving seven months in prison, can make a comeback.\n\nGrimm is trying to take his seat back from Rep. Dan Donovan, a fellow Republican who was backed by Trump in a somewhat awkward tweet that said Donovan voted for the tax overhaul in December when he didn't.\n\nGrimm has said his prosecution was politically motivated and questions Donovan's commitment to the president's priorities. He also recently attacked him for receiving a contribution from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who said this week he would spend tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats take control of Congress.\n\nAlong with Trump, Donovan has the backing of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the political arm of the House GOP caucus.\n\nDemocrats have a six-way primary to pick a challenger for Grimm or Donovan. And there are competitive primaries in a half-dozen other districts up and down the state.\n\nIn the Democratic primary to pick a challenger to Katko in the 24th District, for example, Syracuse University professor Dana Balter had the support of Democratic leaders in the district and activist groups including Indivisible and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and the group Our Revolution founded by backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. But Juanita Perez Williams, who lost the race for Syracuse mayor last year, was recruited by Washington Democratic leaders and is part of the “red to blue” program run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nUnder New York's system, some candidates can run for the endorsement of multiple parties, meaning someone could lose a major-party primary and still run in November as the nominee of the Conservative Party or Working Families Party, for example.\n\nNew York has a closed primary, which means voters must be enrolled as a member of a party to participate. Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. EDT in New York City and the counties of Dutchess, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam and Erie, and open from noon to 9 p.m. Eastern in all other counties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma's biggest contest is the Republican primary for governor, and the unpopularity of Gov. Mary Fallin and the rivalry between Oklahoma City and Tulsa are factors that could lead to an election that only winnows the field and forces a runoff, said Bill Shepard, director of the Sooner Poll.\n\nLt. Gov. Todd Lamb's bid to move up is being dragged down by Fallin, who Shepard said is \"one of the most unpopular governors in Oklahoma history in modern times.\" Lamb's chief challengers are former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett and mortgage banker Kevin Stitt, who is running as a millionaire outsider in the mold of Trump, Shepard said.\n\nTrump, whose approval is close to 80 percent among Republicans in the state, has not gotten involved, but Donald Trump Jr. came into the state to help Lamb in May.\n\nVoters will also be asked if they want the state to legalize issuing licenses to use medicinal marijuana. People who claim to have a medical condition and do not have a license would be subject to a $400 fine if found with marijuana.\n\nThere are also contested Republican primaries in four of the state's five districts, one of which, the 1st District, has drawn the attention of the Club for Growth, a low-tax, small government group that has mounted challenges around the country to Republicans who were not seen as conservative enough.\n\nThe 1st District seat is open since Rep. Jim Bridenstine became director of NASA, and the Club for Growth is backing Iraq veteran Andy Coleman and running ads accusing competitor Kevin Hern, a McDonald's franchise millionaire, of not being a true conservative. Hern responded on Twitter with a video denouncing the club as a leader of the \"never Trump\" movement in 2016.\n\nShepard said there has been no public polling, but he assumes that Hern, who has spent more than $1 million already, has done some.\n\n\"Since he's not put out any polling publicly, you can assume it doesn't show him in the lead,\" Shepard said.\n\nOklahoma primaries are only open to registered Democrats or Republicans. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. CDT.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAfter telling his followers on Twitter on Thursday that Gov. Henry McMaster \"is doing a great job\" and \"has my full and complete Endorsement,\" the president followed up by announcing he would campaign with McMaster on Monday.\n\nMcMaster, who became governor after Trump tapped Gov. Nikki Haley to be ambassador to the United Nations, was the first statewide elected official in South Carolina to endorse Trump for president.\n\nHe was forced into a runoff with Greenville businessman John Warren in the June 12 primary, and Warren last week was endorsed by two former rivals in that primary, Catherine Templeton and Lt. Gov. Kevin Bryant.\n\nThe other major contest in the state is in the 4th District, where Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy is retiring\n\nOn the Republican side, there is a runoff between state Sen. William Timmons and former state Sen. Lee Bright. The Club for Growth has thrown its support behind Bright, announcing on Wednesday it would fund $230,000 in ads attacking Timmons, whose campaign as of June 6 reported just $57,000 in cash on hand.\n\nThere is also a Democratic runoff in the District between Brandon Brown and Doris Lee Turner.\n\nThe runoff election is open to all registered voters, who must declare a ballot preference when they arrive. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. EDT.\n\nUtah\n\nMitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is running for the U.S. Senate nomination to succeed the retiring Orrin Hatch. He's battling Mike Kennedy, a member of the state legislature who represents a district south of Salt Lake City, for the nomination.\n\nRomney came in a close second to Kennedy among Republicans at a party convention earlier this year that was dominated by more conservative voters. He is favored in the primary, with a Salt Lake Tribune poll published Wednesday showing him ahead by 42 percentage points.\n\nIn other races, Rep. John Curtis, a freshman Republican who won a special election last year to replace Jason Chaffetz, is being challenged by businessman Christopher Herrod. Curtis beat Herrod last August in a three-way special primary for the nomination for the remainder of Chaffetz’s term.\n\nEarly voting began on June 12 in the state's closed primary. Polls are open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. MDT. While Utah's Democratic Party primaries are open, meaning any registered voter may vote, regardless of party affiliation, Republican Party primaries are closed.\n\nMore:As more Dems reject corporate PAC money, a Texas Senate candidate's PAC-free campaign pays off\n\nMore:Poll: Democrats still hold a midterm edge, but it's narrower than before\n\nMore:Exclusive: Immigration dominates GOP candidates' TV ads in House contests across the country\n\nContributing: Sarah Fowler and Anna Wolfe, Jackson Clarion Ledger", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/22"}]}

I plan on keeping it for another four years,\" Biden said in a post on X.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump labeled Biden \"the WORST PRESIDENT in the History of the United States\" as he accepted. \"Crooked Joe Biden is the WORST debater I have ever faced - He can’t put two sentences together!\"\n\nHow the debates came together\n\nTrump later said on his social media site, Truth Social, that he agreed to an invitation by Fox News for a third debate on Oct. 2 − outside the parameters put forward by Biden. The Biden campaign rejected the proposal.\n\n\"President Biden made his terms clear for two one-on-one debates, and Donald Trump accepted those terms,\" said Jen O’Malley Dillon, chair of the Biden campaign. \"No more games. No more chaos, no more debate about debates.\"\n\nFor months, it had been unclear whether Biden and Trump would even square off in a debate before the November election. But after having not committed, Biden said last month that he would be willing to debate Trump.\n\nIn a video posted online Wednesday, Biden said he was willing to debate Trump twice before the general election − and proposed the first face-off take place in June. Biden's campaign informed the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has hosted the matches since 1988, that it would not be participating in its series of three debates scheduled for the fall.\n\nIn a statement, the Biden campaign said it wants the first to debate to take place in June, when Trump's hush money trial in New York is \"likely to be over\" and after Biden returns from the Group of Seven Summit in mid-June before Republicans officially award their nomination. The campaign proposed a second debate in September \"prior to the beginning of early voting,\" echoing a Trump campaign demand.\n\nThe Biden campaign proposed the debates be hosted by television networks that previously hosted a Republican primary debate in 2016 and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 \"so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable.\" Biden's team also suggested a vice presidential debate take place in late July.\n\nThe general election involved three presidential debates and a vice presidential debate for nearly two decades, until one was abruptly called off in 2020 when Trump rejected the commission's plan to make it virtual after his COVID-19 diagnosis. Before then, the last time the debate schedule was limited to two face-offs was in 1996.\n\nBoth campaigns frustrated with the commission on debates\n\nDebates organized by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates − the corporation that has traditionally picked the times, locations and moderators of sparring matches − had been set to begin Sept. 16 and continue into October.\n\n\"The American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president,\" the Commission on Presidential Debates said in a statement Wednesday, adding that it will \"continue to be ready to execute\" its original series of debates before the election.\n\nBoth campaigns have expressed frustration with the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nThe Biden team has long complained that the commission failed to enforce its own rules in 2020, when Trump constantly interrupted Biden. Trump complained about commission bias against him.\n\nThe Republican National Committee in 2022 passed a resolution saying it would not allow its nominee to participate in a debate sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, although Trump said earlier this year that he would be willing to forgo that resolution if he could secure a match-up with Biden.\n\nBefore Biden's challenge, Trump's team had called for earlier debates to accommodate early voting. And the GOP candidate accepted Biden's proposed time frame for the debates in a social media post almost immediately.\n\nTrump says he wants more than two debates\n\nTrump said he was \"Ready and Willing to Debate\" him \"at the two proposed times in June and September.\"\n\n\"I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds,\" Trump wrote. \"That’s only because he doesn’t get them. Just tell me when, I’ll be there. 'Let’s get ready to Rumble!!!'\"\n\nTrump and Biden had been sparring over the timing of the debates for weeks, and the back-and-forth heated up Wednesday.\n\nIn a video posted to social media Wednesday morning, Biden took a jab at Trump for refusing to participate in a single Republican primary debate this cycle. He said he'd make good on a promise to debate Trump, telling him, \"Make my day pal, I'll even do it twice.\"\n\n\"Let's pick the dates Donald, I hear you're free on Wednesdays,\" Biden said, making a veiled reference to Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy, an independent candidate running a distant third for president, will not be joining Biden and Trump on the debate stage.\n\nAmong its criteria, the Biden campaign said the debate should also be \"one-on-one,\" allowing voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College.\"\n\nThe latter stipulation was intended to ensure that third-party candidates such as Kennedy are not allowed on stage. Prior debates have had a 15% debate threshold. Kennedy had 8% support in the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll.\n\nKennedy accused Trump and Biden of trying to avoid a robust discussion about their time in office.\n\n\"They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win. Keeping viable candidates off the debate stage undermines democracy,\" he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nContributing: Rachel Barber", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/15/biden-and-trump-agree-to-two-televised-debates/73704438007/", "title": "Biden and Trump agree to two televised debates", "text": "Hey OnPolitics readers!

Minutes and seconds are marked at various points for reference\n\n00:00 CHRIS WALLACE\n\nThe first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format: six, roughly 15 minute segments, with two minute answers and each candidate to the first question. Then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics, and the questions in each topic. I can assure you, none of the questions has been shared with the commission, or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is doing as a health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution both campaigns have agreed that candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has pledged to remain silent: no cheers, no boo’s, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden.\n\n01:40 WALLACE\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nGentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late, Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee the court, Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through and an appointment and what you call an ‘abuse of power.’ My first question to both of you tonight: Why are you right in the argument you make, and your opponent wrong and where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court. President Trump, in this first segment you go first. Two minutes.\n\n2:29 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\n\nThank you very much, Chris, I will tell you very simply. We won the election, elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all top, top academic -- good in every way, good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places so I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding, she's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that -- we have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, says she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time in a great school. And we just, we won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise -- and by the way the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about that, doing it. If they had -- the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the elections so they were stopped, and probably that would happen in reversal so definitely would happen reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it.\n\n3:50 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, Thank you. Same question to your Vice President Biden you have two minutes.\n\n3:56 JOE BIDEN\n\nFirst of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. I -- the American people have a right to have a say to who the Supreme Court nominee is, and that say occurs when they vote for United States senators and when they vote for the President of the United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already -- the election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted. And so the thing that should happen is we should wait, we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, because that's the only way the American people get to express their view, is by who they elect as president who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is, the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that. He ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance, health insurance, now, if they -- if it goes into court and, and the justice and I have nothing -- I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went to the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing is on the court -- if it’s struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held -- make more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. We're able to, they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets, and that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre-existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward; if not, we should wait until February.\n\n6:01 TRUMP\n\nThere aren’t 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as the say is concerned, people already had their say. They -- okay, Justice Ginsburg said -- very powerfully, very strongly -- at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a president's elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years -- I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a president --\n\nBIDEN\n\nWho’s elected at the next election.\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- During that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years; I'm elected for four years. --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe election’s already started.\n\n06:38 TRUMP\n\n-- Joe. The hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat’s simply not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, you said\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now into open discussion, open discussion. Yes, I agree. Vice President.\n\n7:00 BIDEN\n\nNumber one. He knows that -- what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare, and we increase it, we do not wipe any -- and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people have private insurance still, they can they do, they will under my proposal.\n\n7:25 TRUMP\n\nNot what you said. That is not what you said. Your party wants to go Socialist.They're gonna dominate you, Joe, you know that.\n\n7:36 BIDEN\n\nI am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what, I, in fact, approved of. What I approved of. Now here's the deal. The deal is that this is going to wipe out pre-existing condition -- by the way, the 20, the 200 million, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch. How many of those have survived? Over 7 million people have contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?\n\n8:05 TRUMP\n\nJoe, you had 308,000 military people die because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military, so don't tell me about this\n\nBIDEN\n\nI’m happy to talk about this\n\n8:15 TRUMP\n\nAnd if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be 2 million people, because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban\n\n8:24 WALLACE\n\nAll right we're gonna jump in right now. Mr. President. Mr. President, there’s a moderator. We are going to talk about COVID in the next segment, but go ahead.\n\n8:36 BIDEN\n\nWell, let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v Wade. That's on the ballot as well, in the court in the court. And so that's also at stake, right now.\n\n8:52 TRUMP\n\nYou don’t know that’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot, Why is it on the ballot. It's not on the ballot\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt’s on the ballot in the court\n\nTRUMP\n\nI don’t think so. There's nothing happening there. You don’t know her view on Roe v Wade. All right.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI don’t know --\n\n9:06 WALLACE\n\nAll right, all right, let's talk here. We got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen, and we’ve got a lot of time. On health care. And with that, we'll come back to Roe v Wade. All right, Mr President, the Supreme Court will hear a case, a week after the election, in which the Trump administration, along with 18 state attorneys general are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare. You have sent the last --\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause I want to give good healthcare. Good healthcare.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIf I may ask that question, sir. Over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare but you have never in these four years, come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.\n\n09:51 TRUMP\n\nYes I have. Of course I have. I'll get rid of the individual mandate which was added. That is absolutely a big thing, that was the worst part of Obamacare. The worst part of Obamacare. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it.\n\n10:12 WALLACE\n\nI am the moderator in this debate. And I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\n\n10:18\n\nGo ahead.\n\nWALLACE\n\nYou, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions, five days before this debate. So my question sir is, what is the Trump healthcare plan.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, first of all, I guess I'm debating you not him, but that's okay, I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. That has nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices, I'm going with favored nations which no president has encouraged to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down, 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government but you didn't do it, nobody's done it. So we're cutting health care, all of the things that we've done -- insulin. I‘ll give an example: insulin. It's going to, it was destroying families -- destroyed people, the cost -- ‘I'm getting it for so cheap; it's like water.’ You want to know the truth, so cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that --- what we're doing, prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they make just a tiny fraction -- this is big stuff.\n\n11:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare, and the argument that he makes and other Republicans make, is that that is going to end private insurance.\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt is not.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI am asking the question. That it will, it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health care.\n\n11:37 BIDEN\n\nIt does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid, they can get that free. In most states, except governors who want to deny people are poor, Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare -- excuse me, Medicaid -- would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one --\n\n12:22 TRUMP\n\nSo you agree with Bernie Sanders, who’s left on the manifesto we call it, that gives you socialized medicine\n\n12:31 BIDEN\n\nLook. The fact of the matter is, I beat Bernie Sanders --\n\n12:42 TRUMP\n\nYou got very lucky.\n\n12:45 BIDEN\n\nI got very lucky, I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well. And tonight I'm going to -- here's the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far it's simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies; everybody knows he's a liar. I want to make sure -- I want to make the President --\n\nWALLACE\n\nCan you let him finish sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe doesn't know how to do that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThere is no manifesto --\n\n13:25 TRUMP\n\nYou just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan.\n\n13:31 BIDEN\n\nFolks, do we have any idea what this clown is doing?\n\n13:36 BIDEN\n\nLet me tell you what. He is not for any help for people needing health care because he in fact already cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers, because of his recession, number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting health care through Obamacare now he wants to take it away. He won't ever look in your eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away,\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, I want to give them better health care at a much much lower price because he has no, he doesn't know how to read fixed he has never already played it to an extent he has now.\n\n14:16 WALLACE\n\nI know you’ll realize you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President's -- go ahead sir.\n\n14:22 TRUMP\n\nObamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre existing conditions but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed, that they shouldn't even call it Obamacare. But I had a choice to make. Do I let my people run it really well, or badly. If I run it badly they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me, but more importantly I want to help people. Okay, I said you got to run it so well. That's me, and I just had a meeting with them; they said, ‘The problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive, premiums are too high, that it doesn't work,’ I suppose, people -- yes we do want to get rid of it. I want to get rid of something.\n\n15:07 WALLACE\n\nI have to give you roughly equal time, please let the vice president talk.\n\n15:12 BIDEN\n\nHe has no plan for healthcare. He sends out wishful thinking, he has executive orders that have no power, he hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody, he’s been promising a health care plan since he got elected. He has none. Like almost everything else he talks about, he does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is, this man doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOne final question for you, Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans -- we were originally talking about the Supreme Court here -- if Senate Republicans, go ahead and confirm justice Barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster, or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the President, it was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress. So my question to you as you have refused in the past to talk about it: Are you willing to tell the American people tonight, whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court.\n\n16:16 BIDEN\n\nWhatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue -- the issue is, the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. We're in voting now, vote and let your senators know how strongly you feel. Vote now, in fact let people know it is your senators. I'm not going to answer the question.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhy won’t you answer the question -- radical left -- well, listen.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWould you shut up, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWho is on your list?\n\n16:49 WALLACE\n\nWe have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.\n\n16:52 BIDEN\n\nThat was a really productive segment, wasn’t it.\n\n16:57 BIDEN\n\nKeep yapping, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe people understand, Joe. In 47 years, you've done nothing then just.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright. The second subject is a covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject, so let's try to be -- A million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back toward anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward. In this case, the question goes to you first. Sir, two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n17:54 BIDEN\n\nLook, 200,000 dead. You said over 7 million infected in the United States. We in fact have 5% or 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people, they're dying. When he was presented with that number he said ‘it is what it is’ -- what it is what it is -- because you are who you are. That's why it is. The president has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it, because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic, he panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he, we were insisting that the Chinese, the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to watch, and determine for themselves, how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. What did he do then? He then he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. I laid out or I could just watch, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear plus, we should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people to help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap, get people the help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the car, and in your golf course the golf course and going oval office\n\n19:54 TRUMP\n\nThe country would have been left wide open, Millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much -- it's China's fault, it should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault, by the way when you talk about numbers you know how many people died in Japan. How many people died in Russia. How many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done. I closed it and you said he's xenophobic, he's a racist and xenophobic because you didn't close in our country. You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too -- it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early -- in fact Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governors. Oh, really, go take a look. The governor said I did a phenomenal job, most of them said that they attract people that would not be necessarily on my side, said that President Trump's a phenomenal job. We did. We got the gowns, we got the masks, we made the ventilators -- you wouldn't have made ventilators -- and now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already, fewer people are dying when they get sick, far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on, it's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did, you don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that yet.\n\n21:30 BIDEN\n\nI know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell you didn't do very well in swine flu. H1N1. A disaster.\n\n21:38 BIDEN\n\n14,000 people died, not 200,000. There was no economic recession. We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy, it's been shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because -- look you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died at COVID. How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to the nurse holding the phone up so you could in fact say goodbye. By the way, his own CDC director says, we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year, and he held up he said, if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers -- just just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the, the whole notion of a vaccine. We prefer a a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all, and neither do you, I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist.\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\n\n22:44 WALLACE\n\nAnd let me, let me move on to questions about the future, because you both have touched on one of the -- two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government’s top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those are your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your operation warp speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?\n\n23:24 TRUMP\n\nWell I've spoken to the companies, and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political and save less. It is a very political thing I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to -- we have great -- Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by lot. It can become very political, because the left or I don't know --\n\nWALLACE\n\nHead of your operation warp speed, Dr. Slaoui --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there but it could also be -- I had him in my office two days ago.\n\n23:58 WALLACE\n\nHe talked about the summer, sir, before -- it's generally available -- .\n\nTRUMP\n\nHe said it’s a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1. It could also be after that. We're gonna deliver it right away. We have the military all set up -- logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers, and they could do 200,000 a day. They're going to be --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThis is the same man who told you--\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's all set up.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe said this would be gone away. Whether it'd be gone -- miraculously, like a miracle. By the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it.\n\n24:32 TRUMP\n\nThat was said sarcastically, you know that. That was said sarcastically.\n\nBIDEN\n\nAnd so here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious, every serious company is talking about, maybe having the vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out. If we get the vaccine. And pray to god we will. Pray god we will.\n\n24:56 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, I want to pick up one of the -- pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts “will be muzzled, will be suppressed. Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate Senator Harris contributing to that fear?\n\n25:26 BIDEN\n\nNo more than the question you just asked. You pointed it out. He puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Well, no, no, you can trust the scientists. She didn’t say that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nShe said, the public experts, quote, “will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”\n\nTRUMP\n\nShe did say that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's millions of scientists -- there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital, that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. That's not -- they’re the people, and by the way --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI spoke to the scientists that are in charge. They will have the vaccine very soon.\n\nBIDEN\n\nDo you believe for a moment what he's telling you, in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue of COVID. He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record saying that he panicked, or he just looked at the stock market -- one of the two -- because guess what: a lot of people died, and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter.\n\n26:35 TRUMP\n\nDid you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated, either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me, don't ever use that word.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh, give me a break.\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years, you've done nothing.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, let's have this debate. You would’ve had --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me just tell you something. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through -- I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again --\n\nWALLACE\n\nWe’ll talk about the economy in the next segment, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's going up fast --\n\nWALLACE\n\nOkay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled, so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward, by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those reopenings, Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and school. Why, sir?\n\nBIDEN\n\nBecause he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running, I’d know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with a PPE, as well as with sanitation they need. You have to provide --\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi.\n\n27:51 BIDEN\n\nWill he just shush for a minute.\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell it to Nancy Pelosi. And Schumer.\n\n27:59 BIDEN\n\nNancy Pelosi and Schumer -- they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet with them in the Senate. But he sits in his golf course -- I mean, literally, think about it --\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou probably play more than I do, Joe.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWhat about this question of reopenings, and the fact that --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, he wants to shut down this country. And I want to keep it open. And we did great --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYou need to shut it down --\n\n28:22 TRUMP\n\nWait a minute. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe. Just for one second.\n\n28:26 TRUMP\n\nWe want to -- he wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now, we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot -- young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot. But he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing -- if you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down -- they have Democrat governors all. One of the reasons they’re shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election. This is political.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI wonder what's --\n\nTRUMP\n\nThose states, those states are not doing well that are shut down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re going to go on to another subject. You have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer, and in fact recently you have cited the, the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the effectiveness of masks?\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, you have to understand -- if you look, I mean, I have a mask right here. I put the mask on it, you know what I think I need it. As an example, everybody's had a test, and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear a mask, when needed -- when needed, I wear masks. I don't -- I don’t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.\n\n29:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, go ahead, sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nLook, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI was asking, sir, about masks.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh. Masks -- masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now -- if everybody wore masks and social distancing between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters,\n\nTRUMP\n\nAnd they've also said the opposite. They've also said the --\n\nBIDEN\n\nNo serious person has said the opposite --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhat about Dr. Fauci? Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe did not say the opposite.\n\n30:27 TRUMP\n\nHe said very strongly: Masks are not good. Then he changed his mind. He's admitted -- I’m ok with masks.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI want to talk about one last subject, because your different approaches have even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you're holding the large rallies, with crowds packed together thousands of people.\n\n30:44 TRUMP\n\nOutside.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOutside. Yes, sir. Great. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nCause nobody will show up.\n\nWALLACE.\n\nPeople with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nNobody shows up to his rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIn any case, why you’re holding the big rallies, why you're not. You goes first, sir.\n\n31:00 TRUMP\n\nBecause people want to hear what I have to say, I mean, 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAre you not worried about the disease, though, sir.\n\n31:13 TRUMP\n\nWell, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside -- that's a big difference according to the experts. And we do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see. I mean every -- and literally on 24 hours notice -- and Joe does the circles and has three people some place.\n\nBIDEN\n\nBy the way, did you see, one of the last reboot rallies he had -- a reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ‘No no no. Stand back. Put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way, way far away from those other people.’ That's what he said. I can't, I'm gonna be okay. He not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWe had no negative, no negative effect. We've had no negative effect, and we've had, 35 40,000, people at some of these rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nJust finish off because I want to move on to our next --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing, and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. And he's a fool on that.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIf you could get the crowds, you would’ve done the same thing, but you can't -- nobody cares, nobody cares.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, can we move on to the economy. The economy is, I think it's fair to say, is recovering faster than expected from the shutdown much in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V shaped recovery. Vice President Biden you say it's more of a K shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy. President Trump, in this segment, you go first.\n\n32:56 TRUMP\n\nSo we built the greatest economy in history. We close it down because of the China plague, when the plague came in we closed it down, which was very hard, psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down, and he was wrong, again. To me it -- people would be dead now, instead of still 204,000 people is too much, one person is too much, should have never happened from China. But what happened is we've closed it down and now we're reopening, and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the -- he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country, you know, a lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down and you take a look at what's happening in some of your Democrat run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, said they’ll open up November 9. Why November 9? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance, they can wash their hands, they can wear masks -- they can do whatever they want, but they can open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look at -- these governors are under siege in Michigan and a couple of others. You gotta open the states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country, this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright, your two minute sir, we're now moved to you. As I, as I said posing the question, the president says it's a V shape recovery, you say it's a K shape recovery. What's the difference?\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe difference is millionaires and billionaires like him, in the middle of COVID crisis, have done very well. The billionaires array have made another $300 billion. Because of his profligate tax proposal and you only focus on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont -- all the small towns and working class towns in America. How well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI understand. You've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have them.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI get my time back? The fact is that he is in fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president in the United States to leave office, I mean fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. The first one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines, those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have went out there dying, people who have been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. The idea that he is consistent, that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID desks and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why does he want to open it up? Why doesn't he take care of the American -- you can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis, and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home, in terms of your health and your safety. Schools -- why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. You know, they were going to give his administration was going to give the teachers and school students masks. Then they decided, no, couldn't do that, because it's not a national emergency, not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses, nothing. They're closing. One is six is now gone. He ought to get on the job, and take care of the needs of the American people, so we can open safely.\n\nWALLACE\n\nRight. Your time is up, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI need to respond to that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWell, you both have two minutes, sir.\n\n37:02 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me. He made a statement. People want their schools, no, people want their schools open. They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It's so sad what's happening in New York, it's almost like a ghost town. And I'm not sure I can ever recover what they've done in New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThey want to be safe.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThey’ll be careful. But they want their schools -- I'm the one that brought back football, by the way, I brought it back Big Ten football. It was me, and I'm very happy to do it. People on all sides are very proud of me, and you don't want to --\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment but first, Mr. President, As you well know, there's a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax, each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I'm asking you the specific question: Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes, each of those two years.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI paid millions of dollars in taxes. Millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers. I paid $38 million one year. I paid 27 million one year --\n\nBIDEN\n\nShow us your tax returns.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI went -- you'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. You know, what you want to do -- go to the board of elections. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have -- I'm totally underleveraged because the assets are extremely good, and we have a very, we have a --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI’m asking a specific question, a specific question, which is --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me tell you, that I understand --\n\n38:49 WALLACE\n\nNo, Mr. President. I'm asking the question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?\n\n38:59 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars.\n\n39:00 WALLACE\n\nYou paid millions of dollars?\n\n39:02 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars. Millions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.\n\n39:05 BIDEN\n\nWhen?\n\n39:06 TRUMP\n\nBut let me tell you, Chris. Let me just say something. It was the tax laws-- I don't want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer. I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation, and for tax credits. We built a building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. You get an asset, which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired up right after that happened but--\n\n39:43 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, do you want to respond?\n\n39:45 BIDEN\n\nI do want to respond. Look, the tax code that made him, put him in a position that he pays less tax to the school teacher, make them, the money a school teacher makes. Is because of-- He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code, but that's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And we're going to eliminate those tax cuts and make sure that we invest in the people who, in fact, need the help. People out there need help--\n\n40:15 TRUMP\n\nBut why did you do it over the last 25 years? Why doesn’t he do it over the last 25 years?\n\n40:19 BIDEN\n\nBecause you were president-- Because you were president and destroyed things up.\n\n40:22 TRUMP\n\nYou were a senator--\n\n40:24 BIDEN\n\nYou are the worst president America’s ever had\n\n40:26 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say Joe I've done more in, in 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. We've done things that you never even thought of doing, including fixing the broken military that you gave me, to taking care of the vets--\n\n40:30 WALLACE\n\nWe’re talking -- Mr. President, we're talking about the economy. I'd like to ask you about your plans going forward. Because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan, if you were to be elected president, focuses a lot on big government. Big taxes. Big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession.\n\n41:14 BIDEN\n\nWell, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying American. And we have to. We're gonna make-- The Federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to build, to the like. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a--\n\n41:50 WALLACE\n\nRespectfully, sir. I’m talking about taxes, not spending.\n\n41:54 BIDEN\n\nWell, by the way, I'm gonna eliminate a significant number of the tax. I'm gonna make the, the corporate tax 28%, shouldn't be 21%. You have 19 companies--91 companies, federal, I mean in the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.\n\n42:11 TRUMP\n\nWhy didn’t you do it when you were vice president with Obama?\n\n42:15 BIDEN\n\nBecause, because you in fact passed that. That was your tax proposal.\n\n42:18 TRUMP\n\nI got it done and you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it's never boomed --\n\n42:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?\n\n42:32 BIDEN\n\nNot lower taxes for the American people.\n\n42:46 WALLACE\n\nBut in Obama's economy booming. It turns out that in Obama's final three years as president more jobs were created. A million and a half more jobs than in the first three years of your presidency.\n\n42:48 TRUMP\n\nThey had the slowest recovery. Since 19 -- economic recovery, since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you have to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot, but they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. Let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401k's. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas -- You want to terminate my taxes? I'll tell you what, you’ll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here they'll leave for other places. They will leave, and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.\n\n43:29 BIDEN\n\nLook, we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression, in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery, the crazy jobs you're talking about. He comes in on a booming economy. He blew it. He blew it.\n\n43:44 TRUMP\n\nIt wasn’t booming. It wasn’t booming.\n\n43:49 WALLACE\n\nSir, wait. Wait. Is it fair to say he blew it when, when there was record low unemployment before COVID?\n\n43:57 BIDEN\n\nYeah. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in the hole--\n\n44:04 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me, Chris. Wait, Chris. They said it would take?\n\n44:05 BIDEN\n\nNumber one, number two, number three --\n\n44:09 TRUMP\n\nNo, you’re number two. Chris, Chris.\n\n44:12 BIDEN\n\nThis guy --\n\n44:13 TRUMP\n\nThey said it was a miracle to bring back manufacturing, I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing --\n\n44:20 BIDEN\n\nWe did not give up. I'm the guy who brought back the automobile industry.\n\n44:23 TRUMP\n\nHe totally gave up on the auto industry --\n\n44:24 WALLACE\n\nAlright, let him --\n\n44:26 BIDEN\n\nWe brought back, I was asked to bring back, Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They're gone. He blew it. And in fact, they're going --\n\n44:34 TRUMP\n\nOhio had the best year it's ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they've ever had --\n\n44:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n44:40 TRUMP\n\nMany car companies came in from Germany, from China. They went to Michigan, went to Ohio.\n\n44:47 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President --\n\n44:48 BIDEN\n\nAnd so, you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. You know, he talks about the art of the deal. China's made, perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit with Mexico --\n\n45:06 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch --\n\n45:07 WALLACE\n\nAlright, gentlemen --\n\n45:09 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch, Joe. No wonder your son goes in and he takes out what he takes out, billions of dollars. Takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we're at it, why is it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son $3.5 million? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do --\n\n45:34 WALLACE\n\nYou asked a question. Let him answer.\n\n45:36 BIDEN\n\nNone of that is true.\n\n45:38 TRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:39 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Mr. President, please. You asked a question--\n\n45:41 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredited. Totally discredited and by the way --\n\n45:46 TRUMP\n\nHe did get $3.5 million, Joe?\n\n45:48 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice -- Mr. President --\n\n45:49 TRUMP\n\nHe got $3.5 million.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:52 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. It's an, it's an open discussion, please. You --\n\n45:55 TRUMP\n\nNo. It’s a fact.\n\n45:57 WALLACE\n\nWell, you’ve raised an issue. Let the vice president answer.\n\n45:59 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredit --\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- $183,000a month? With no experience and energy?\n\n46:07 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:08 BIDEN\n\nMy son did nothing wrong --\n\n46:09 TRUMP\n\nYes, he did --\n\n46:10 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:12 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn’t want to let me answer because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally, thoroughly discredited --\n\n46:17 TRUMP\n\nBy who? The media.\n\n46:20 BIDEN\n\nBy everyone, well by the media, by our allies, by the World Bank, by eh- by everyone has discredited. Matter of fact.\n\n46:30 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, please stop.\n\n46:30 BIDEN\n\nMatter of fact, even the people who testified under oath.\n\n46:32 TRUMP\n\nSo let me ask you this --\n\n46:39\n\nHe testified under oath and his administration said, I did my job and I did very well.\n\n46:45 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know who they are --\n\n46:46 BIDEN\n\nWell I'll give you the list of the people who testified. Sir, you’ve already fired most of them because they did their jobs.\n\n46:53 TRUMP\n\nWell some people don’t --\n\n46:56 WALLACE\n\nWait a minute, you get the final word.\n\n46:57 BIDEN\n\nWell, it's hard to get any word with this clown, excuse me, this person.\n\n47:00 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say --\n\n47:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\n47:06 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n47:07 TRUMP\n\nWhy did he deserve three and a half million for Moscow?\n\n47:08 BIDEN\n\nLook, here's the deal. I want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean his family we could talk about all night. His family --\n\n47:18 TRUMP\n\nMy family, my family lost a fortune coming down and helping us with government and\n\n47:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President.\n\n47:24 TRUMP\n\nEvery single one of them lost --\n\n47:26 BIDEN\n\nThis is not about his family or my family. It’s about your family.\n\n47:30 TRUMP\n\nThree and a half million dollars.\n\n47:31 Biden\n\nThat's not true. It doesn't want to talk about what you need, you, the American people. It's about you. That's what we're talking about.\n\n47:41 WALLACE\n\nAlright, that's the end of this segment. We're moving on. Mr. President --\n\n47:47 TRUMP\n\nCan I be honest? It's very important to --\n\n47:49 BIDEN\n\nTry to be honest.\n\n47:50 WALLACE\n\nNo, the answer the question is no. No, I, sir.\n\n47:54 TRUMP\n\n-- with a billion dollars.\n\n47:56 BIDEN\n\nThat is absolutely not true --\n\n48:00 WALLACE\n\nGentleman I hate to raise my voice, but why should I be different than the two of you? So here's the deal, we have six segments. We have ended that segment, we're going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are gonna have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I can asked a question about race but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruption. I'm appealing to you sir to do that.\n\n48:34 TRUMP\n\nWell, him too.\n\n48:36 WALLACE\n\nWell, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting-\n\n48:38 TRUMP\n\nWell that’s alright, but he does plenty.\n\n48:40 WALLACE\n\nWell, less than, sir less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of race. Vice President Biden you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president,\n\n49:05 TRUMP\n\nOh yeah sure.\n\n49:05 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, you have often said that you believe you have done more for black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you is why should voters trust you, rather than your opponent, to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.\n\n49:26 BIDEN\n\nIt's about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone, equality for the whole America.\n\nBut we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got into the race was with most people. Close your eyes. Remember what those people look like coming out in the fields carrying torches. Their veins bulgy. Spewing, just spewing anti Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and when they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides. No presidents ever said anything like that.\n\n50:09 WALLACE\n\nOne second, sir.\n\n50:10 BIDEN\n\nSecond point I'd make, is that when Floyd was killed -- when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military to use tear gas on em so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said he only, all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who in fact, he talks about helping African Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man? This man is a savior of African Americans? This man cares at all? This man has done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what it did has been disastrous for the African American community. So --\n\n51:24 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race?\n\n51:30 TRUMP\n\nHe did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African Americans are super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it, Joe.\n\n51:40 WALLACE\n\nSir, it’s his two minutes.\n\n51:41 TRUMP\n\nSo you did that and they called you super predator. And I'm letting people out of jail now that -- You have treated the African American population, community -- You've treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 199 -- And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time. Because they saw what you did. You called them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200-250 military leaders in total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida, I have Texas, I have, Ohio. I have every, excuse me. Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said ‘I support President Trump.’ I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're gonna lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what, if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe. Because we believe in law and order but you don’t. The top 10 cities, and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats. Just radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe. To a point where you don't say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.\n\n53:30 WALLACE\n\nAlright, I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Brianna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question “Whether justice could be equally applied in America”. Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?\n\n53:54 BIDEN\n\nYes, there is a systemic injustice in this country. In education, in the law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent honor men and women that risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do is president of the United States is call together, an entire group of people at the White House. Well, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency. And when these things happen, these cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Brown and Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system report, held accountable. When, and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protests is. Violence is never appropriate.\n\n55:00 TRUMP\n\nWhat is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of town and burned down your stores and kill people all over the place?\n\n55:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President. President Trump, I’d like to continue with this. I promise we're gonna get to the issue of law and order in a moment. Your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, end with sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?\n\n55:37 TRUMP\n\nI ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it and so does everybody else. And he would know it.\n\n55:54 WALLACE\n\nWhat is radical -- What is radical about racial sensitivity training?\n\n55:59 TRUMP\n\nIf you were a certain person, you had no status in life, it's sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place, and they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not gonna allow that to happen.\n\n56:31 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden?\n\n56:33 BIDEN\n\nNobody’s doing that. He's just, he’s racist. Here's the deal, I know a lot more --\n\n56:38 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish.\n\n56:40 BIDEN\n\nThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important that people know they don't want to, many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. But it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of a sense of self esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me who grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism.\n\n57:35 WALLACE\n\nVice President -- I mean, President Trump, sir.\n\n57:37 TRUMP\n\nDuring the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred, you look at Ferguson, you look at, you go to very many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened- Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now,\n\n57:55 BIDEN\n\nOh my god, this is ridiculous.\n\n57:56 TRUMP\n\nBut the reason is that the Democrats that run these cities don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.\n\n58:03 BIDEN\n\nViolent crime -- Violent crime --\n\n58:03 TRUMP\n\nYou still haven’t mentioned, are you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:04 BIDEN\n\nI'm in favor of law. You --\n\n58:07 TRUMP\n\nAre you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:13 BIDEN\n\nLaw and order with justice where people get treated fairly. And the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17%, 15% percent in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch.\n\n58:24 TRUMP\n\nIt’s gone down much more.\n\n58:28 WALLACE\n\nAlright, alright. Mr. President -- Mr. President, you’re now gonna be very happy because we’re gonna talk about law and order.\n\n58:34 TRUMP\n\nThe places we had trouble with Democratic-run cities --\n\n58:39 WALLACE\n\nThat's exactly my question. There have been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer, particularly. And you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors, but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa, and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?\n\n58:59 TRUMP\n\nI think it's a party issue. You could bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it's going up like these never seen anything. The numbers are going up 100, 150, 200% crime. It is crazy what's going on, and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't. Because he'll lose his radical left supporters, and once he does that it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have -- Our suburbs would be gone, our suburbs would be gone, and you would see problems like you’ve never-\n\n59:38: BIDEN\n\nHe wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn.\n\n59:39 TRUMP\n\nOh, I know suburbs.\n\n55:43 BIDEN\n\nI was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All of these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice, or to black and white and Hispanic in the same car, as there have been any time in the past. What really is the threat to the suburbs and their safety has to deal with COVID? They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment. They're being flooded. They're being burned out, because he has refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble.\n\n1:00:15 WALLACE\n\nI do want to talk about this issue of law and order, though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders Task Force you talk about “reimagining policing”. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support- Let me finish the question. What does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support the Black Lives Matter call for for community control of policing?\n\n1:0046 BIDEN\n\nLook, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face. And I'm not totally opposed to defending the police officers. Matter of fact, police, local police, they only want defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with him as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community police, like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down. It didn’t go up, it went down. And so we have to be --\n\n1:01:25 TRUMP\n\nThat’s not what they're talking about, Chris. That’s not what they’re talking about. That’s about defunding the police.\n\n1:01:31 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n1:01:35 TRUMP\n\nHe doesn't have any law - He has no law enforced -\n\n1:01:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That’s not --\n\n1:01:39 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you, go ahead, like we have time.\n\n1:01:46 BIDEN\n\nWe don't have time to do anything --\n\n1:01:53 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, I’m gonna take back control. And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially, we had more than 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice President, you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight you said that you are the Democratic Party right now. Have you ever called the Democratic mayor of Portland the Democratic governor of Oregon and said ‘Hey, you gotta stop this. Bring in the National Guard. Do whatever it takes. That you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland?\n\n1:02:40 BIDEN\n\nI don't hold public office now. I am a former Vice President. I've made it clear, I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. Anyone who committed it --\n\n1:02:53 WALLACE\n\nBut you've never called for the people- Excuse me, sir. You’ve never called for the leaders in Portland, and in Oregon, to call in the national office and knock off 100 days of riots.\n\n1:03:05 BIDEN\n\nThey can, in fact, take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way. Look-\n\n1:03:11 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Oh really? -- The killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything.\n\n1:03:18 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump. President Trump. I interrupt- President Trump\n\n1:03:22 TRUMP\n\nI had to send the US Marshals to take care of business --\n\n1:03:24 WALLACE\n\nGo ahead, sir\n\n1:03:25 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way, you know, his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. That's what this is all about.\n\n1:03:34 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know who said that.\n\n1:03:35 BIDEN\n\nI do.\n\n1:03:35 TRUMP\n\nWho?\n\n1:03:36 BIDEN\n\nI think it was Kellyanne Conway.\n\n1:03:37 TRUMP\n\nI don't think she said that.\n\n1:03:39 BIDEN\n\nShe said that. And so here's, here's the point. The point is that is that that's what he is keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and say, ‘let's get everybody together, figuring out how to deal with this’, what he does he do? He just poured gasoline on the fire. Constantly, at every single solitary time.\n\n1:04:00 WALLACE\n\nAnd to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly warned us-\n\n1:04:07 TRUMP\n\n-answer his stuff.\n\n1:04:08 WALLACE\n\nYou have- No, you've been talking-\n\n1:04:11 TRUMP\n\nHe made a statement- I would love to end it.\n\n1:04:12 WALLACE\n\nI’m asking you- You know, sir- You know, if you want to switch seats-\n\n1:04:17 TRUMP\n\nVery quickly, we could do that but if - the National Guard it would be over. There’d be no problem, but they don’t want to accept the national guard.\n\n1:04:23 WALLACE\n\nOkay, you have repeatedly criticized the Vice President for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups? And to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, as we've seen in Portland? Are you prepared specifically to do that?\n\n1:04:46 TRUMP\n\nSure, I’m prepared to do it. I would say- I would say, almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right wing-\n\n1:05:55 WALLACE\n\nSo what do you, what do you say-\n\n1:04:56 TRUMP\n\nI'm willing to do anything I want to see peace.\n\n1:04:57 WALLACE\n\nThen do it, sir.\n\n1:04:59 BIDEN\n\nSay it, do it, say it.\n\n1:05:00 TRUMP\n\nYou want to call them -- What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me --\n\n1:05:04 WALLACE\n\nWhite supremacists and, white supremacists and right-wing --\n\n1:05:07 BIDEN\n\nThe Proud Boys.\n\n1:05:07 TRUMP\n\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem\n\n1:05:19 BIDEN\n\nHis own FBI director said -- white supremacists. Antifa is an idea not an organization. Militia --\n\n1:05:27 TRUMP\n\nOh you’ve got to be kidding me\n\n1:05:27 BIDEN\n\nHis FBI said --\n\n1:05:28 TRUMP\n\nWell then, you know what --\n\n1:05:29 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re done, sir. We’re going to go on to the next-\n\n1:05:39 BIDEN\n\nEverybody in your administration tells you the truth that that’s a bad to bad idea. You have no idea.\n\n1:05:43 TRUMP\n\nAntifa is a dangerous, radical group --\n\n1:05:46 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now moving on to the Trump and Biden records.\n\n1:05:50 TRUMP\n\n-- they overthrow you\n\n1:05:51 WALLACE\n\nPresident, I'm gonna ask you a question. When the President seats a second term, it’s generally a referendum on his record. But Vice President Biden you'd like to quote your dad's sayings which is ‘Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative’. And in this case, sir, you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you, why should voters you, President over your opponent. In this segment, President Trump you'll go first. 10 minutes.\n\n1:06:19 TRUMP\n\nBecause there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years, and that's despite the impeachment hoax. And you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton where a whole big con job. But despite going through all these things, where at a fight both flanks, behind me and above, there has never been an administration, that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history. Lowest unemployment numbers. Everything was good, everything was go -- And by the way, there was unity. People were calling me. For the first time in years they were calling, and they were saying ‘it's time maybe’. And then what happened? We got hit but now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA, which was a mess under him. 308,000 people died. They didn't have proper health care. He was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA. Our vets, we take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. The job that we've done- And I'll tell you so some people say me the most important, by the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300. And hopefully, three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record, the likes of which very few people- And you know one of the reasons I have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings. And if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say ‘if you left us 128 openings, you can't be a good president. You can't be a good Vice President’. But I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that by the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.\n\n1:08:22 WALLACE\n\nLooking at both your records, why should voters elect you president, as opposed to President Trump -- You get two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n1:08:29 BIDEN\n\nUnder this president we become weaker, sicker. poorer, more dividing and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it, I did. We left a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to be weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.\n\n1:09:01 TRUMP\n\nYour son --\n\n1:09:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, no --\n\n1:09:03 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way --\n\n1:09:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed that both sides would get two answers uninterrupted. Your side agreed to it. Why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?\n\n1:09:18 BIDEN\n\nNever keeps his word.\n\n1:09:19 WALLACE\n\nNo, I’m not asking. That was rhetorical question.\n\n1:09:23 BIDEN\n\nCan you go back 30 seconds?\n\n1:09:25 WALLACE\n\nYeah, yes you may. Go ahead.\n\n1:09:26 BIDEN\n\nSo, thirdly we’re poorer. The billionaires have gotten much, much more wealthy by a tune of over four three to $400 billion more, just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent, when we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's president of the United states. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them be losers and being, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes.\n\n1:10:23 TRUMP\n\nReally? You talking about Hunter? Are you talking about Hunter?\n\n1:10:23 BIDEN\n\nand I resent -- I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden. You’re talking about --\n\n1:10:30 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\n\n1:10:37 BIDEN\n\nThat's not true, he wasn’t dishonorably discharged. None of that is true.\n\n1:10:39 TRUMP\n\n-- and he didn't have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places --\n\n1:10:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:10:49 TRUMP\n\nHe made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.\n\n1:10:50 BIDEN\n\nMy son -- My son -- My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know I had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him.\n\n1:11:02 TRUMP\n\nBut why was he given tens of millions of dollars?\n\n1:11:05 BIDEN\n\nHe wasn't given tens of millions of dollars\n\n1:11:08 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you’ve --\n\n1:11:11 BIDEN\n\nAlready been discredited\n\n1:11:13 WALLACE\n\nWe've already been through this, I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, you know, as the moderator sir I'm going to make a judgement call there.\n\n1:11:20 TRUMP\n\n-- 3.5 million dollars. Let’s talk about Moscow --\n\n1:11:24 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That report is totally discredited.\n\n1:11:25 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen --\n\n1:11:27 BIDEN\n\nMitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayers money. That report was written for political reasons.\n\n1:11:33 WALLACE\n\nYou know, I'd like to talk about climate change.\n\n1:11:36 BIDEN\n\nSo would I --\n\n1:11:37 WALLACE\n\nOkay, the forest fires in the West, are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blame the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, ‘I don't think the science knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama environmental records. What do you believe about the science of climate change? And what will you do in the next four years to confront it?\n\n1:12:11 TRUMP\n\nI want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon, if you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses, our businesses are put out of commission. If you look at the Paris accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management, in addition to everything else. The forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees, that a years old and they're like Tinder, and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette and then the whole forest burns. You've got to have forest management-\n\n1:12:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat do you, what do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?\n\n1:12:57 TRUMP\n\nI believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. You know we're planting a billion trees, the billion tree project, and it's very exciting.\n\n1:13:08 WALLACE\n\nDo you believe that human pollution, gashouse, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet?\n\n1:13:15 TRUMP\n\nI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent yes. I think, to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year, I get the call. ‘California is burning California's burning.’ If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know in Europe they live that, forest cities, they call forest cities. They maintain their forests. They manage their forests. I was with the head of a major country. It's a forest city. He said, ‘Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California, there shouldn't be that problem’. I spoke with the governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor, but he said you know at some point, he can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground. That's burning down because of a lack of management.\n\n1:14:07 WALLACE\n\nBut sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan, which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed --\n\n1:14:16 TRUMP\n\nBecause it was driving energy prices through the sky --\n\n1:14:22 WALLACE\n\nWhy have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars?\n\n1:14:27 TRUMP\n\nNot really, because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car. And you're talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10-12 years old. If you did that the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper-\n\n1:14:48 WALLACE\n\nIn California, they simply ignored --\n\n1:14:51 TRUMP\n\nTake a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way we're gonna see how that turns out, but a lot of people agree with, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars with big incentives or electric cars. But what they've done in California is just-\n\n1:15:17 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden I'd like you to respond to the President's climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You proposed $2 trillion in green jobs you talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035. And zero, net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says, a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.\n\n1:15:46 BIDEN\n\nHe's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when -- During our administration Recovery Act I was able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than, or as cheap as coal, and gas, and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fire plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire in America. They're going to move to renewable energy, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that they can do that we're gonna put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy, that in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized. In a way that, in fact, they'll, they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage. By having a new infrastructure that in fact is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris accord. I will join the Paris accord because with us out look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no no relationship with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforest to Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's admitted the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars. And say, ‘Here's $20 billion. Stop, stop, tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences’.\n\n1:17:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat about the argument that President Trump basically says that you have to balance, environmental interests, and economic interests? And he's drawn a line\n\n1:18:02 BIDEN\n\nBut if he hadn't drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we- He wants to make sure that methane is not a problem. We could, you could now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that we don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. He says that, the fact that it's all true and here’s the deal --\n\n1:18:22 TRUMP\n\nHe’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it's not 2 billion or 20 billion as you said, it's $100 trillion.\n\n1:18:31 BIDEN\n\nI'm talking about -\n\n1:18:31 TRUMP\n\nYou wanna rip down buildings and rebuild the buildings -- where airplanes are out of business. Where there are two car systems or where they want to take out the cows.\n\n1:18:40 BIDEN\n\nThat’s not true. Not true. Not true. Not true.\n\n1:18:43 TRUMP\n\nThat's not true either, right? Now, this is a, this is a 100. That's more money than our country could make in a hundred years.\n\n1:18:50 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:18:55 WALLACE\n\nLet me -- Let me -- Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president said, I think some people who support the president would say, ‘That sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.’\n\n1:19:18 BIDEN\n\nWhat it's gonna do, it’s gonna create thousands and millions of jobs. Good-paying jobs-\n\n1:19:22 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish, sir.\n\n1:19:23 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn’t know how to do that. The fact it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people to weatherize, where he wants to get her get rid of, is going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with a deal with- By the way he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, ‘Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, they may' --\n\n1:19:44 TRUMP\n\nI never said that you made it up. You make up a lot.\n\n1:19:46 BIDEN\n\nAnd here's the deal, we are going to be in a position where we can create, hard, hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes rising seas. We're in real trouble. Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. There because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. We in fact- But the rest of the world we got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into, back into the Paris accord.\n\n1:20:32 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen.\n\n1:20:33 TRUMP\n\nChris, so why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were vice president. Why didn't you get the world- China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements, the Green New Deal is 100 trillion dollar plan --\n\n1:20:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan.\n\n1:20:56 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, gentleman --\n\n1:20:58 TRUMP\n\nYou said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. What he did is he said- He called the military stupid bastards\n\n1:21:06 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President -- Please, stop.\n\n1:21:15 TRUMP\n\nI would never say that.\n\n1:21:18 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President answer his question his final question.\n\n1:21:21 BIDEN\n\nThe final question is I can't remember which of all is real.\n\n1:21:24 WALLACE\n\nI’m having a little trouble myself. But about the economy, and about this question of what it's going to cost. The Green New Deal and the idea of what, what your environmental changes to --\n\n1:21:38 BIDEN\n\nThe Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. You're not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plans.\n\n1:21:44 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:46 BIDEN\n\nPardon me?\n\n1:21:47 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:49 BIDEN\n\nNo, I don't support the Green New Deal.\n\n1:21:50 TRUMP\n\nOh you don't? Well that’s a big statement. You just lost the radical left.\n\n1:21:55 BIDEN\n\nI support the Biden plan that I put forward.\n\n1:21:59 WALLACE\n\nOK.\n\n1:22:00 BIDEN\n\nThe Biden Plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.\n\n1:22:02 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen, final segment. Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks, because it'll not only be the election day but also counting some ballots mailing ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next President will be the legitimate winner of this election? In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.\n\n1:22:41 BIDEN\n\nPrepared to let people vote. You should go to Iwillvote.com. Decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, as well as the FBI director, says there's no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that they're going to be millions of people, because of COVID, that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots, like he does by the way. He sits behind the Resolute desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time and they'll pull stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not gonna be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will- He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. Whether or not when the votes are counted, and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted.If I lose, it will be accepted. But, by the way, if, in fact, he says he's not sure what he's gonna accept, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter. Because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He's going to go. He won’t stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change or are we gonna get four more years of these lies?\n\n1:24:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, two minutes.\n\n1:24:32 TRUMP\n\nSo when I listened to Joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition. Because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started on the day I won and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with the First Lady, they were a disaster, a grace to our country. And we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense. And President Obama was sitting in the Oval office. He knew about it too so don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots is concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot. Okay, so listen it is okay. You're soliciting, you're asking they send it back, you send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some with the name Trump, just happen to have the name Trump, just the other day. In wastepaper baskets. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two, in a Democratic area they sent out 1000 ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice for November 3, you're watching and you see who won the election. And I think we're gonna do well because people are really happy with the job they've done. But you know what, we won't know, we might not know for months. Because these balances are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election can be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. A fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, ‘you have to have your ballot in by November 10’. November 10. That means 7 days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states with that. All run by Democrats. All run by Democrats. It’s a rigged election.\n\n1:26:40 WALLACE\n\nOkay, okay, sir. President Trump, you’re gonna be able to continue. You have been charging for months and mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, the last midterm election, 3, million people voted mail-in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter, of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a justice Barrett, to settle on a disputes?\n\n1:27:17 TRUMP\n\nYeah, I think we're getting them to look at the ballots, differently. I don't think I want them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots I'd say. Because what’s happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They, they take them ‘we don't like them. we don't like them’.\n\n1:27:36 WALLACE\n\nThere are millions of ballots going out right now.\n\n1:27:39 TRUMP\n\nYou do a solicited ballot.\n\n1:27:42 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people --\n\n1:27:46 TRUMP\n\nYou go and vote. You go and vote, like they used to do. You either do a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in and sending it back in and your sending. We have mailmen with lots of a- Did you see what's going on, take a look at West Virginia, mail-in ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is no -- This is not going to end well.\n\n1:28:12 BIDEN\n\nThere is no evidence of that. Five states have had mail-in ballots in the last decade or sol, including two republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you, and sent to your home. All we're saying is, they're saying is, that there has to be a postmark, by the time by Election Day. If it just doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes because-\n\n1:28:38 TRUMP\n\nYou’re wrong. You’re wrong\n\n1:28:41 WALLACE\n\nAnd I want to continue with you on this -- Vice President Biden --\n\n1:28:44 TRUMP\n\nChris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that\n\n1:28:45 WALLACE\n\nExcuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years, with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable number, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots, are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity they just see through that deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a justice Barrett will settle any disputes?\n\n1:29:12 BIDEN\n\nI'm concerned that any court would settle this. Because here's the deal, when you, when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you when the, before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot, because someone made a mistake in not dotting the correct i. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say to you ‘that is totally legitimate’\n\n1:29:46 WALLACE\n\nAlright --\n\n1:29:49 TRUMP\n\nWhen you have 80 million ballots sent in and swamping the system -- You know it can't be done, you know it can’t. And already there have been --\n\n1:29:56 WALLACE\n\nAlright, so wait a minute. Final question is, in eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law in eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them, until Election Day. That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is. And it could be days, it could be weeks.\n\n1:30:25 TRUMP\n\nCould be months.\n\n1:30:28 WALLACE\n\n-- until we know who the new president is. So I first for you sir. Finally, for the, for the vice president. I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge our supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? Will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump will go first.\n\n1:30:54 TRUMP\n\nI’m urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went into watch, they were called poll watchers, a very safe very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people- I hope it's gonna be a fair election. If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board. But if I see 10s of thousands of ballots being manipulated. I can't go along with that.\n\n1:32:31 WALLACE\n\nDoes that mean you are gonna tell your people to take to the streets?\n\n1:32:32 TRUMP\n\nI’ll tell you what it means. It means you have a fraudulent election. You're not equipped to, these people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found balance in a wastepaper basket days ago and they all had the name, military fellas. They were military, they all had the name, Trump on them. You think that’s good?\n\n1:31:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?\n\n1:32:05 BIDEN\n\nYes. Here's the deal, they count the ballots, as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be open until Election Day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it’s gonna take time to do it. And by the way, our military. They've been voting, by ballots since the end of the Civil War in effect. And that's what's happened gonna happen. Why was it not, why is it for them to somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all, that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots. That somehow it's a fraudulent --\n\n1:32:41 TRUMP\n\nIt's already been established. Look at --\n\n1:32:45 WALLACE\n\nYou had an opportunity to respond. Go ahead.\n\n1:32:48 BIDEN\n\nHe has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal, the fact is, I will accept it and he will too. Because you know why? Because once the winner is declared, after all the, all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. And if it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy --\n\n1:33:16 TRUMP\n\nI want us to --\n\n1:33:21 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen? Will you say that’s the end of it? This is the end of this debate. We're going leave it there. To be continued in more debates as we move on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University, and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow. October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9pm Eastern that we hope you watch.

Key topics included healthcare, Covid-19, the economy and Supreme Court.\n\nHosted on September 29th by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, the debate ignited with a fiery clash over healthcare. Biden, visibly exasperated by Trump's persistent interruptions, famously snapped, \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\" The contentious atmosphere persisted as healthcare took the forefront, Trump accusing Biden of socialist tendencies while Biden defended his plan to expand Obamacare while safeguarding private insurance options.\n\nYet, it was Trump's response, or lack thereof, to condemning white supremacist groups that captured significant attention. Initially agreeing with Wallace, Trump later equivocated, shifting blame to leftist groups for violence and telling the far-right Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\"\n\nFinally, Trump's stunning declaration of refusing to commit to accepting the election results if he were to lose sent shockwaves throughout the political spectrum. “This is not going to end well. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen,\" Trump said.\n\nMore:OnPolitics: Biden and Trump agree to two televised debates\n\nSecond 2020 Presidential Debate:\n\nIn the final 2020 presidential debate, NBC's Kristen Welker moderated a more tempered yet still contentious exchange between Biden and Trump on October 22nd. They tackled various issues including COVID-19, China relations, crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defended his administration's pandemic response, asserting, \"We're learning to live with it. We have no choice.\" Biden countered, stressing the ongoing need for precautions and criticizing Trump's management, saying, \"People are learning to die with it.\"\n\nAccusations flew regarding financial ties to China, with Trump alleging, \"He’s talking about me taking money from China? I’ve not taken a penny from any country. Ever.\" Biden vehemently denied, retorting, \"What are you hiding?\"\n\nLater, Trump showcased his criminal justice reforms and criticized Biden for a 1990s crime bill, questioning Biden's past actions on reform. This marked a shift from previous \"tough on crime\" rhetoric, reflecting evolving attitudes towards racial justice spurred by earlier protests.\n\nJeremy Yurow is a politics reporting fellow based in Hawaii for the USA TODAY Network.

Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don’t come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.\n\n[1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--\n\n[1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.\n\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\n\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\n\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\n\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\n\n[1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.\n\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\n\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\n\n[1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\n\n[1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--\n\n[1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\n\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\n\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\n\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\n\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\n\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.\n\n[1:29:30] Biden: No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to\n\n[1:29:33] Trump: But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.\n\nFinal question\n\n[1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/23"}]}

We do this first by failing, learning, acknowledging, hearing and empathizing… And I will continue, tirelessly, to do just that.”\n\nThe statement represents her most significant response to criticisms she has used a “blaccent” throughout her career: from her early hit NSFW parody rap song “My Vag” to her more recent acting roles in the big-budget films “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Ocean’s Eight.”\n\nThe issue is broadly part of the ever-evolving debate around cultural appropriation, or the act of adopting customs from another culture without the proper level of respect or acknowledgment.\n\nAwkwafina, 33, has achieved critical and mainstream success in recent years. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture for the 2019 film “The Farewell” and last year joined the Marvel Universe with her role in “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.”\n\nYet during press for Shang-Chi last year, she struggled to answer a question from Reuters about her “blaccent.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Awkwafina is the new voice of the NYC subway (January, 2020) 01:00 - Source: CNN Business\n\nWhat her full statement says\n\nIn her 351-word statement Saturday – her first tweet in more than two years – Awkwafina noted the injustices Black Americans face, as well as the use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in different contexts, including on social media and in music.\n\n“There is a sociopolitical context to everything, especially the historical context of the African American community in this country,” she wrote. “It is a group that is disproportionately affected by institutionalized policies and law enforcement policies – all the while having historically and routinely seen their culture stolen, exploited and appropriated by the *dominant* culture for monetary gain without acknowledgment nor respect for where those roots come from, the pioneers of its beginnings and the artists that perfected and mastered the craft.\n\n“It is a problem we still see today – though some may pass it off as a convoluted mixture of the ‘internet TikTok slang generation’ that liberally uses AAVE, to add that hip hop – a genre of music that is ubiquitous and beloved across the country – has now anchored itself as a mainstream genre in music history.\n\n“And in life, linguistic acculturation, immigrant acculturation, and the inevitable passage of globalized internet slang all play a factor in the fine line between offense and pop culture.\n\n“But as a non-black POC (person of color), I stand by the fact that I will always listen and work tirelessly to understand the history and context of AAVE, what is deemed appropriate or backwards toward the progress of ANY and EVERY marginalized group. But I must emphasize: To mock, belittle, or to be unkind in any way possible at the expense of others is: Simply. Not. My. Nature. It never has, and it never was.”\n\nIn two follow-up tweets, Awkwafina said she planned to retire from Twitter and offered a vague apology.\n\n“I apologize if I ever fell short, in anything I did. You’re in my heart always,” she wrote.\n\n“To Clarify: I am retiring from the ingrown toenail that is Twitter. Not retiring from anything else, even if I wanted to, and I didn’t drunkenly hit someone with a shoehorn and now escaping as a fugitive. Also am avail on all other socials that don’t tell you to kill yourself!”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/30/michelle-wolf-funny-get-over/564426002/", "title": "Debate: Michelle Wolf's set at the White House Correspondents ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nThe aftershocks of Michelle Wolf's White House Correspondents' Dinner monologue continue. The evening, planned by the association, typically includes playful roasts of the administration and the news media.\n\nSarah Quinlan, contributor for RedState: \"At Saturday night’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner, comedian Michelle Wolf tore into the news media, Democrats and Republicans alike — but it was her jokes regarding White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders that drew the most attention — and criticism.\n\nWolf’s joke that Sarah “divided (the press corps) into softball teams” clearly alluded to a disgusting and inaccurate stereotype that softball players are masculine or unattractive. This joke was unacceptable and insulting. If it wasn’t her intent to insult Sanders’ appearance, why even include that line?\n\nGendered insults are inappropriate regardless of the target’s politics, words or actions, and it’s maddening how often both sides lob them at each other. Not only do gendered insults lack substance, they contribute to the reinforcement of negative gender stereotypes, which hurts all women. Furthermore, they overshadow legitimate criticism. The joke didn’t target the White House’s misuses of power or Sanders’ role in defending and excusing such behavior.\n\nAt the same time, it seems disingenuous that Trump supporters are truly offended by the remarks when the president has engaged in similarly disgusting insults — not to mention Trump’s insults didn’t occur during a roast.\n\nWe should have higher standards for the president of the United States than we do for a comedian.\n\nFor those upset on behalf of Sarah Sanders, why not extend that courtesy to Trump’s targets — and vice versa? Yes, many of Trump’s targets are powerful — but so is Sanders, as White House press secretary. And as White House Press Secretary, she has defended insults: When Trump implied female Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was willing to “do anything” for donations, Sanders told reporters their “mind is in the gutter” for arguing it was sexual. When the president retweeted a fake video designed to defame Muslims, Sanders refused to talk about the video and told reporters they were “focusing on the wrong thing.”\n\nEvery single one of us needs to stop treating bad behavior as acceptable so long as we dislike the targets. Wolf’s joke was over the line. Trump’s insults are unacceptable. I am not defending or excusing either but criticizing both and calling for the return of decency and consistency.\n\nEnough is enough. Let’s end the hypocrisy.\"\n\nJen Chaney, Vulture: \"Life in Washington will move on from this, too. But before it does, I want to pause and make sure it’s clear why I and others reacted the way we did to the backlash against Wolf’s speech. It wasn’t because the White House Correspondents’ Dinner is so important to our nation — I’m guessing most of the country, if not the vast majority, has no idea it even happened last night — or because Wolf is the most brilliant comedian who's ever lived. I thought she was pretty funny, but that’s not really the point. The issue is that those who expressed shock about her performance could not see the obliviousness and hypocrisy in their responses.\"\n\nAdam Conover, The New York Times: \"Some people noted that Ms. Wolf’s routine was poorly received in the Hilton ballroom itself. But watching her at home I recognized exactly what she was doing. Every performer who has done comedy on television knows that the people in the studio don’t really matter. They’re uncomfortable, they’re tense, and they have to be polite because they’re sitting 6 inches away from Chris Christie. You’re never getting a real laugh out of them. Instead, you focus on the audience that counts: the folks at home. And the folks at home don’t want comedy that’s polite and tasteful, and secures them access to an interview next Wednesday — they want comedy that stands on the rooftop and calls out hypocrisy and deceit at the top of its lungs.\"\n\nThe Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal: \"Much — not all — of the press corps has responded to Donald Trump’s surprising victory not by trying to understand it, much less report on it with any balance. Instead, they have treated it like an alien invasion that must be repelled, and anyone associated with it as deserving disdain, ridicule or worse. Any reporter who doesn’t follow this herd of contempt is expelled from polite media company. Ms. Wolf was merely putting a cruder face on what she reads every day. All of which plays into the hands of Mr. Trump, who didn’t attend the event but did indulge in some Twitter gloating afterward.\"\n\nMaribel Perez Wadsworth, president of the USA TODAY Network and publisher of USA TODAY: \"Our ethical code as journalists demands better of us. Therein lies my deeply held conviction that the White House Correspondents’ Dinner has lost its way. This evening is meant to be a celebration of journalism and the First Amendment. And in keeping with that tradition, on Saturday some very important and impactful journalism was honored. Student journalists were celebrated.\n\nWhat followed was not reflective of our highest ideals as journalists. It served only to undermine our credibility. It amplified a growing, dangerous narrative that the news media are biased and unworthy of the public’s trust. Our families, yours and mine, know personally how vital a free press is to protecting our democracy. And so, we must be unwavering in our commitment to safeguard our credibility and journalistic integrity.\"\n\nJill Lawrence, USA TODAY Opinion: \"I gather the WHCD was a big win for Trump and company. I've been to enough of them to know this was 100% predictable. Remind me again, why do we still do this event? The entertainers bomb nine times out of 10. The president often is handing out awards to people who have nailed him (and maybe someday her) to the wall. The competition for guests is ridiculous. The attention goes to the celebs, not the journalists. And the journalists have to pretend it's normal to hobnob with people they are supposed to cover with a critical eye. The only saving grace is that sometimes the actual presidents, who have good comedic timing and professional joke writers, are funny. But Trump wasn't even there Saturday night. The whole thing is weird, and very expensive for an industry that's increasingly dependent on the kindness (or other motivations) of rich outsiders. Maybe a nice luncheon or dinner for honorees is the way to go, with a VIP speaker from the world of journalism.\"\n\nWatch the monologue:\n\nReaders debate:\n\nLet me get this straight, President Trump can brag about grabbing p---y, make fun of a disabled reporter, say a journalist was bleeding from “everywhere,” call world leaders names, consort with Russia, allegedly cheat on three wives, fire or have forced out more than 20 Cabinet members, but Wolf was inappropriate? That’s rich.\n\n— Alee Goob\n\nWolf’s humor may have been appropriate at some nightclub act, but given the venue it was nothing more than mean and vicious — not even jokes.\n\n— Charles Weber\n\nShe’s a comedian, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders is an easy target. These White House reporters are going to condemn Sanders being roasted because they like access to the White House. Why don’t they complain about this president not attending this long-standing event to celebrate our free press?\n\n— Jeff Huffman\n\nWhat did they think they would get by inviting a comedian to roast people? She was insulting as a comedy act. Trump insults people daily on Twitter and he means it.\n\n— Pete Manning\n\nI thought Republicans hated political correctness and loved brutal honesty. That’s why they elected Trump, right? I thought they loved locker room talk, too? Go figure.\n\n— Sandra Brown\n\nI’ve been a member of the press for nearly 40 years. Why on earth do we insist on giving people like Trump free ammunition? I’ve always tried to remain polite and proper while dealing with news sources, though often writing extremely critical and sometimes career-ending stories about them. The correspondents’ dinner is an inherently stupid idea that just solidifies every bad impression many hold of the press.\n\n— Edward Martin\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/opinions/joe-rogan-myth-spotify-joseph/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Don't pretend you don't know what Joe Rogan is all about ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Peniel E.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe controversy over Joe Rogan’s repeated past use of the n-word on his podcast is about more than racist language or cancel culture – it speaks to deeper truths and persistent lies that help define contemporary America. Rogan, who was already under fire earlier this year for being a conduit for misinformation brandished by anti-vaxxers on his popular show, faced immense backlash after a video compilation of him using the n-word, which he said were compiled over a span of 12 years, was widely shared on social media.\n\nPeniel Joseph Kelvin Ma/Tufts University\n\nRogan apologized Saturday and vowed to do better, and Daniel Ek, the chief executive of Spotify – which distributes Rogan’s podcast and invested $100 million dollars to do so, according to the Wall Street Journal – addressed the issue in a memo stating he found Rogan’s words “incredibly hurtful” and inconsistent with company values but did not believe “silencing” Rogan was the answer. Ek also promised to launch an “incremental $100 million” dollar investment designed to elevate marginalized voices on Spotify. Spotify, without detailing specifically why, also removed more than 100 of Rogan’s episodes from the platform, according to JRE Missing, a website that tracks the show.\n\nConservatives who are defending Rogan with cries of free speech are being disingenuous. For one thing, it comes at a moment when conservatives have mastered the art of legislative cancelation, passing laws that threaten to fine and fire teachers who teach aspects of America’s brutal history of racial inequity that might cause discomfort among White students or parents.\n\nThe real issue isn’t about whether to cancel Joe Rogan (although some have advocated for Spotify to end its relationship in wake of the controversy). It is about exposing who Rogan really is and admitting that his brand of conversation, which at times traffics in conspiracy theories, cultural intolerance and blatant racism, attracts millions of avid listeners and corporate sponsors hungry to advertise their wares to such followers. Rogan is, in fact, an agent of these social ills, which he packages and sends out to his audience clothed in the language of moderation and moral equivalence. For example, in addition to his uses of the n-word, Rogan has made waves by suggesting that because “you can never be woke enough … it’ll eventually get to [where] White men are not allowed to talk.” Rogan laughed uproariously when comedian Joey Diaz, one of his guests, described pressuring women into performing oral sex on him. Rogan has horribly and deliberately misgendered a trans MMA fighter. He’s discouraged young people from getting the Covid-19 vaccine, hosted guests who question its validity and given a platform to climate skepticism from controversial clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nThe question of “silencing” Rogan is nevertheless a fraught one. In opposition to Rogan’s platforming of Covid misinformation, a wide range of popular musicians, from the legendary rock n roll artist Neil Young to the Generation X soul icon India Arie, have demanded that Spotify remove their music from its site. They did not want their work to share digital space with the loquacious podcaster – who, beyond the n-word and misinformation criticisms, has also helped build the profile of Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, whose group has used violence to foster political support for a racially intolerant agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, public figures including former President Donald Trump and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis have implored Rogan to stop apologizing for using the n-word. Trump told him to “stop apologizing to the Fake News and Radical Left maniacs and lunatics,” while DeSantis urged, “Do not apologize. Do not kowtow to the mob. Stand up and tell them to pound sand.”\n\nThe far right-wing conservative support for Rogan belies the myth that his show represents a reasonable middle or common ground uniting average Americans untethered to the left-right spectrum of American politics.\n\nThis myth reflects the lies Americans tell themselves about to race, democracy, free speech and capitalism. Rogan’s genius lies in the fact that he presents himself as an everyman throwback to a quieter age – an era without pandemics or Black Lives Matter protests shining a spotlight on racial privilege.\n\nFolks who enjoy Rogan’s political unpredictability, down to earth quality, and frank discussion about politics ignore the fact that he’s one of the wealthiest people in America, that his independent perspective often skews far-right (as evidenced by some of his guests, who have included Roseanne Barr, Ted Nugent, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens and Steven Crowder) and his everyman demeanor is the perfect shtick for a 21st century pitchman able to convince the have-nots that they share a common history, rapport and destiny with the haves.\n\nNo wonder Trump loves him.\n\nRogan also seems to delight in contradicting himself, posting a now-deleted tweet in 2012 to add fuel to the false birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama while also proclaiming Obama to be the best president in his lifetime and insisting that Michelle Obama could defeat Trump in a presidential election.\n\nIn another episode Rogan said aired 11 years ago, he recalled being accidentally dropped off in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Philadelphia with some disbelieving White friends. He likened the situation to being in “Planet of the Apes,” the 1968 science fiction classic starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who travels in time to a future earth ruled by intelligent simians. Rogan’s comparison of Philadelphia’s Black community to the “Planet of the Apes” is morally reprehensible, politically indefensible, and yes, racist.\n\nRogan apologized for this clip in an Instagram video he posted Saturday, noting that he was trying to “make the story entertaining” but also realized “that’s a racist thing to say.” But his audience of eleven million embraces these seeming contradictions. Rogan’s popularity has increased amid the rightward drift and segmentation of social media and popular culture. He has been consistently able to draw a robust number of guests across the polarized American political spectrum.\n\nEven Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who is multi-racial, initially defended Rogan – the same podcaster who introduced the leader of Proud Boys. When a writer pointed out Rogan’s multiple uses of the n-word last week, Johnson thanked him, writing, “I was not aware of his N word use prior to my comments, but now I’ve become educated to his complete narrative. Learning moment for me.”\n\nAny public personality attracting effusive support from Trump and DeSantis, two exemplars of racial and cultural intolerance, can not purport to be, as Rogan does, an independent thinker.\n\nRogan’s everyman persona is attractive to millions who view themselves as fed up with perceived liberal and conservative media biases. Yet Rogan, in many instances, amplifies partisan divides by offering an unvarnished platform for some of the worst impulses in American culture. From Proud Boys to anti-vaxxers, Rogan has helped spread misinformation, furthered the coarsening of popular culture and trafficked in a kind of racial bigotry soft-pedaled in some corners of social media as merely the byproduct of speaking one’s mind.\n\nCritics of Rogan have a right, like musicians have, to disassociate themselves from platforms that carry his brand of discourse. That’s not canceling, that’s consumer choice, a right everyone ostensibly enjoys in a free society.\n\nSpotify, in trying to preserve their profits and their image by enabling Rogan and censoring the worst parts of his act (they have removed 113 podcast and counting from his archive) – while also trying to elevate the voices of marginalized groups – is an illustration of how far capitalism will bend to use race and Blackness for its own purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogan’s and Spotify’s ability to monetize the most noxious and racially intolerant parts of American history and culture has, if anything, been amplified, rather than suppressed, by this latest uproar.

Maybe you recall the logo for the mid-2000s show \"Heroes\" on NBC. The \"o\" was an eclipse image which showed the last bits of sunlight concentrated in one area before being totally obscured by the moon. Did you know this particular moment has a name and you have a chance to see it or capture it (with the right gear of course) on Monday?\n\nHere are some things take notice of and the words to put to what you are seeing during the total solar eclipse.\n\nDiamond ring effect and Baily's beads\n\nThe description above of the \"Heroes\" logo refers to what's called the diamond ring effect. One section on the edge of the disc will be extra bright and resemble a diamond sparkling on a circular wedding band. Astrophysicist Alain Brizard, who is professor of physics at St. Michael's College described it as \"the sun's last attempt to be relevant.\" This happens within moments of the moon fully obscuring the sun.\n\nAfter the diamond ring effect, you may notice what's called Baily's beads. This will look like small beads of light chained together along one edge of the circle. The topography of the moon is varied with mountains and valleys so the Baily's beads phenomenon is caused by the sunlight peeking through some of those lower level valleys, Brizard explained.\n\nOnce the Baily's beads disappear, this is your indication that totality has begun. This is also the moment you can remove your solar eclipse glasses and external filters covering cameras, telescopes or binocular lenses for about 3 minutes and 15 seconds (the estimated totality time for the Burlington area) only. At the end of totality the same thing will happen again, though in reverse. Be sure to put your glasses back on before Baily's beads appear again.\n\nThe moon's path will make a diagonal pass from the bottom right to the upper left of the sun. Look for the diamond ring effect and Baily's beads at the top left before totality and then near the bottom of the sun at the end of totality. You can see a simulation of the entire eclipse from the vantage point of Burlington at https://eclipse2024.org/eclipse-simulator/2024/index.html?city_id=41016.\n\nHere's a breakdown of timing for the Burlington area. (Note: times are expressed in p.m.):\n\n2:13 and 46 seconds - Partiality begins\n\n3:25 and 57 seconds - Diamond ring effect (lasts 5 seconds)\n\n3:26 and 2 seconds - Baily's beads (lasts 5 seconds)\n\n3:26 and 7 seconds to 3:29 and 26 seconds - TOTALITY (three minutes and 19 seconds in Burlington area. Only time when glasses and filters can be off.)\n\n3:29 and 20 seconds put eclipse glasses and filters back on for safety\n\n3:29 and 26 seconds - Baily's beads and then Diamond ring effect\n\n4:38 and 46 seconds - Partiality ends\n\nWhat to look for during totality - from planets to prominences from the sun\n\nWhile the sun will be covered up by the moon, viewers will have the opportunity to see details of the sun and sky that normally can't be seen due to the brightness of the sun. The sun's chromosphere may be visible briefly; it would look like a thin, red layer around the sun. Red, tongue-like protrusions extending off the surface of the sun, called prominences, may also be observed. Assuming the skies are clear, the sun's corona is likely to be seen even without the use of magnification. The corona would look like a ghostly white halo surrounding the sun.\n\nWhile the skies turn dark, you may be able to spot some planets and stars during the day time. \"It looks like the skies will be crowded,\" Brizard said looking at a night sky map during the time of the eclipse. From left to right, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn and Mars would fall in a line along their orbit of the sun. Venus may be one of the brightest objects in the sky with Sirius being the brightest star in the sky while our sun's light is dimmed. Brizard also suggested looking for two prominent red spots. To the left of the sun and moon will be Aldebaran the eye of the Taurus constellation and Mars, further to the right of the convergence.\n\nA mirrorball of little partial eclipses\n\nFor some fun, you could project hundreds of little partial eclipses on the ground during the time before and after totality. Take a colander or anything with small holes in it and hold it up to the light while watching the ground. Like a mirrorball, the colander will scatter eclipse shapes across the ground. Brizard said it works best to stand on concrete or a flat surface, rather than grass or dirt. The scientific process that creates this effect has a name: camera obscura.\n\nWhy this total solar eclipse is special\n\nThere are some factors that make this eclipse special even among other total solar eclipses. The relative sizes of the moon and sun, when viewed from earth, will be about as equal as it gets. This means no \"ring of fire\" around the moon and the surface of the sun will be covered without too much of the corona being obscured.\n\nThis optimal alignment can only occur because of where the moon is in its elliptical orbit around the earth and where the earth is in its elliptical orbit around the sun. The moon, for instance, will be at its perigee − the closest it gets to the earth − one day earlier on April 7. So, the moon will appear larger than normal and larger than the 2017 eclipse. On the other hand, the earth's orbit puts the sun at its mid-point, size-wise and closeness to our planet. In January the earth is the closest it gets to the sun, also called perihelion, and in July the earth is furthest from the sun during its orbit, called aphelion.\n\nAlso interesting is the timing of the sun's solar cycle. Every eleven years or so the sun reaches its maximum level of activity and right now we are in that phase. That means more prominences, sun spots or coronal mass ejections can happen and solar winds bring more magnetic storms to earth which produce the aurora borealis. Sun astrophotographers, in particular, will be using the three and half minutes of moon coverage to get as many photos as they can to study the sun's corona during this time.\n\nSolar eclipses are categorized and belong to a series, which the ancient Babylonians first began tracking. The path of moon's shadow on the earth starts at one of the poles and travels toward the other pole over time, ending that series. This particular eclipse will be part of the Saros 139 series which began in 1501 and will end in 2763. Brizard said it is an unusual astronomical situation to take part in something that began as far back as the renaissance period in earth's history.\n\nAs much as there is so much to see, categorize and document, Brizard says it may be best to leave all that up to the scientists and don't forget to experience the moment as a human being who happens to be upon this earth, in this place in an auspicious time. It's a great community building event, he said, and it may be best to forego all the equipment and just look up. \"We spend our lives looking at screens and kids − they're always looking at screens,\" he said. \"For three minutes or an hour on Monday the 8th, everybody will be outside. As a community, people will be looking at the same place in the sky.\"\n\nContact reporter April Barton at abarton@freepressmedia.com or 802-660-1854.

The magical phenomena could happen again tonight.\n\nThe show fascinated many onlookers as they took out their phones to capture the beauty of the night sky. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued extreme (G5) conditions across the United States. A storm of this intensity has not been seen since October 2003. The storm gained the name \"Halloween Storm\" and caused many power outages in Sweden and damaged transformers in South Africa, according to Earth.com.\n\nMeteorologists have predicted that the northern lights can be visible on Saturday as well as Sunday. If you are going outside to see the northern lights, forecasters want to remind the public that their solar eclipse glasses can be used for viewing the phenomenon.\n\nHere's what you need to know to prepare for the next viewing of the northern lights.\n\nThe northern lights:Danced across the US last night. It could happen again Saturday.\n\nWhat is the cloud forecast Saturday night? Will clouds block the northern lights?\n\nIf you missed the aurora borealis Friday night, you might still catch a glimpse on Saturday or Sunday, depending on where you live. But not if clouds get in the way.\n\nThe cloud forecast for Saturday night is generally good for most of America, but some of the people who missed their chance last night due to clouds may have a similar problem Saturday, said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Tom Kines. Areas that are likely to be cloudy include New England and Mid-Atlantic regions, as well as parts of the Southern Plains, including Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado.\n\n“Even just a few breaks in the clouds will allow the aurora to be visible,” Kines said. “There’s always hope.”\n\nPeak visibility time Saturday night will be between 9 p.m. and midnight, with some chance until 2 a.m., Kines said. The best views will be in dark areas away from the light pollution of cities, he said, though some reported seeing the auroras Friday night from metro areas like Milwaukee and Detroit.\n\nSunday night, if there is any aurora to see, those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic can rejoice, because Kines said the skies should be clearer.\n\nWhere can you see the northern lights tonight?\n\nThe Space and Weather Prediction Center offers an experimental forecast map that shows the aurora may be visible in a wide swath of the U.S. including Oregon, Nebraska, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Other states like California, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida could also see the sky light up again for an encore performance. But visibility will depend on shifting factors that include weather, pollution and cloud cover.\n\nBelow are forecast predictions for seeing the northern lights in New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana on Saturday.\n\nNew York\n\nRain and clouds are expected to damper expectations to see the aurora borealis around the Rochester, N.Y. area. Elsewhere in NY, the Lower Hudson Valley could see the lights again, if weather permits.\n\nMichigan\n\nNWS maps predicting the intensity and location of the northern lights Saturday and Sunday show the aurora will be visible in mid to northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.\n\nSaturday and Sunday are predicted to be mostly cloudy with some rain showers and isolated thunderstorms. The NWS predicted 48% to 58% sky cover in metro Detroit from 8 p.m. Saturday to 2 a.m. Sunday. The western portion of both peninsulas are expected to have a lower cloud cover.\n\nWisconsin\n\nIn the Milwaukee area, the evening is expected to bring mostly clear skies and overnight will have scattered clouds, said Tim Halbach, local meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\nOhio\n\nThose living around the Cincinnati region could be treated to the northern lights Saturday night with the NWS' Wilmington, Ohio, office forecasting dry, partly cloudy conditions. Clouds shouldn't be an issue as many Ohioans reported seeing the lights Friday despite some cloud cover.\n\nIndiana\n\nIn a telephone interview, Mike Bettwy, operations chief of the NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Co, said Indianapolis and surrounding areas might have a better chance of seeing the aurora today and Sunday.\n\nThey can expect clear skies tonight, Bettwy said.\n\n\"The aurora itself might be actually a little bit less active than it was last night,\" he told IndyStar. \"I think the ability for you to see it will be better because the skies will be clearing out — at least in the Indianapolis area and that immediate vicinity.\"\n\nNorthern lights forecast path\n\nIf you want to get a better idea of if you will be able to see the northern lights from your state, check NOAA's aurora forecast tool, which has a 30-minute forecast window.\n\nThe auroras are a natural light display in Earth's sky that are famously best seen in high-latitude regions.\n\nScientist left amazed by the aurora\n\nThe aurora seen on May 10 amazed Antonella Fruscione, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. She sent photos of the lights and the April eclipse to her friends in Italy. The northern lights weren't as prominent in Italy as it was in other places.\n\n\"And I sent them the picture that I took at the solar eclipse and I said, 'Can you imagine how fortunate I was this year, one month apart, I see these two incredible spectacles of the universe,'\" she recalled telling them.\n\nThe phenomena seen Friday and possibly Saturday night isn't usual, she said.\n\n\"It's a very rare occurrence, especially because last night it was really visible,\" Fruscione said.\n\nThat's because the Earth's magnetic activity was at a nine, the highest the index goes, coupled with the Sun being at an active peak, causing eruptions. She added the colors cannot be predicted either as it depends on how the solar energetic particles interact with oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Oxygen appears green, while nitrogen appears purple, blue or pink, she said.\n\n\"It just depends on which atoms in the atmosphere this particle interact with,\" Fruscione said.\n\nShe declined to predict how strong Saturday's aurora could be as it's not in her expertise, but said people make predictions all the time about space weather not just for the northern lights, but to ensure communications, space stations, astronauts and other matter in space doesn't get majorly disrupted.\n\nDown on Earth, however, the activity is harmless to humans.\n\n\"It's completely harmless because the particles do not don't do not reach us,\" Fruscione said. \"The reason why we see the colors is that the particle interacts with the atoms and they make these beautiful colors and that's it.\"\n\nFor Saturday, and any other day where chatter about the aurora borealis is high, Fruscione encouraged people to download an aurora forecasting app to their phones so they can see the colorful skies.\n\nWhat are the northern lights?\n\nThe northern lights materialize when energized particles from the sun reach Earth's upper atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph, according to Space.com. Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that has fascinated humans for millennia.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Tanya Wildt, Detroit Free Press; Alex Groth, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Contributing: Bebe Hodges, Cincinnati Enquirer; Contributing: Steve Howe, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle; Rockland/Westchester Journal News; Alexandria Burris, Indianapolis Star", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/aurora-borealis-photos-northern-lights-seen-us-europe/73652013007/", "title": "Northern lights on full display across US, Europe on Friday: See ...", "text": "The northern lights provided a rare sight for residents across the U.S. and around the world Friday night, with a powerful solar storm fueling a spectacle seen as far south as the Florida Keys.\n\nStrong solar flares the sun has been emitting since Wednesday morning were responsible for the northern lights being visible across a wide swath of North America and Europe.\n\nSeven coronal mass ejections began entering the Earth's outer atmosphere on Friday, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency issued a rare Severe (G4) Geomagnetic Storm Watch this week for the first time in 19 years, but announced Friday evening that extreme (G5) conditions reached Earth at 6:54 p.m. Eastern time. The last extreme event occurred with the \"Halloween storms\" in October 2003.\n\nBecause the sun is at the height of its 11-year-cycle, conditions were optimal for the auroras to put on a light show that electrified sky watchers and appeared to far more Americans than usual.\n\n\"I never in my wildest dreams thought I would see it from my front yard in Key Largo (Florida,) said Mike Theiss, a veteran extreme nature photographer and storm chaser. He'd been seeing the news about the solar storms all day Friday and was \"a bit jealous\" he would miss out on the auroras. But then he started seeing photos posted in real time on social media, in South Carolina, then Georgia and then the Bahamas.\n\nIncredulous about that sighting, he figured he'd take a chance. \"I walked out the front door and there were the lights. I could see a faint red glow with the naked eye,\" Theiss told USA TODAY. \"I was looking at the northern lights. I still can't believe it.\"\n\nSky gazers, if you didn’t have a chance to catch the northern lights on Friday, May 10, you can try again today. Forecasters are predicting that the aurora will be visible across many parts of the United States if the weather permits. There have been several reports of power grid irregularities and functional decreases in high-frequency, communications and GPS systems, according to a report from NOAA.\n\nAlthough the northern lights did interrupt some system functionalities, the phenomena has caused major mishaps in the past. In 1989, the aurora managed to knock out the power in Quebec for nine hours. However, the aurora was the strongest in 1859 when the lights shined so bright it was mistakenly for daylight and lasted for a day, The Planetary Society reported.\n\nHere's a look at some of the images captured around the U.S. and in Europe.\n\nNorthern lights:What's your chance of seeing the northern lights tonight?

It looks like an aurora, but it is not. The soft purple glow is caused by hot (5400 degrees F) rivers of gas flowing through Earth’s magnetosphere at speeds exceeding 13,000 mph. These rivers are energized by strong geomagnetic storms like the one that happened over the weekend.\"\n\nWhile the colorful lights of an aurora normally ripple horizontally across the sky, STEVEs form a distinctive purplish or greenish vertical streak, according to Space.com.\n\nSTEVEs were only rarely documented before the explosion of smartphone cameras and social media, said University of Calgary astronomer Eric Donovan.\n\nAurora lovers, rejoice.2024 could be a great year for northern lights, due to solar maximum\n\n'Utter amazement. ...

My mate Conor likened it to a celestial funnel cloud or tornado changing form in real time.\"\n\nAnother photographer, Wil Cheung of Whitley Bay, England, also photographed the unusual spectacle Sunday night.\n\n\"It lasted for more than an hour,\" marveled Cheung. \"Strong auroras danced in the north while STEVE flowed through the sky to my south.\"\n\nSTEVE is a 'backronym'\n\nThe word STEVE is a \"backronym,\" where words are matched to an abbreviation already in use.\n\nThe name Steve originally came from a mid-2010s Facebook group, which decided to put a name to the mystery sky feature. It's a reference to the children's movie Over the Hedge, where the characters use the name to refer to something they weren't sure about, according to the Australia Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nScientists later backronymed STEVE to the rather unwieldy \"Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement.\"\n\n2024 could be good year for auroras – and maybe STEVEs\n\nThe solar forces that produce auroras are predicted to peak next year and at a more intense level than previously thought, forecasters from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center announced in October.\n\nFor centuries, the aurora borealis, aka the northern lights, has fascinated people. It forms when particles of electrons and protons from space collide with the Earth's magnetic field. The particles then interact with molecules of atmospheric gases to cause the famed glowing red and green colors of the aurora.\n\nThe lights are visible in both the far northern and southern parts of the world. The southern lights are known as aurora australis.\n\nWhile auroras are caused by electrons and protons, STEVEs, which were first officially identified in 2018, are caused by ribbons of hot gases.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, since \"solar activity is expected to be on the rise over the next few years, researchers say, so there could be good opportunities for the public to spot STEVE.\"\n\nHere's your space weather forecast:Why feds are warning about solar storms headed for Earth", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/05/10/northern-lights-michigan-aurora-borealis/73639909007/", "title": "Northern lights may be visible in Michigan: When to look", "text": "UPDATE, 11:30 p.m.: The northern lights are visible all throughout Michigan.

In Des Moines, people will be able to see a partial eclipse from 12:43 p.m. to 3:13 p.m. At 1:58 p.m., 84% of the sun will be obscured by the moon, its peak.\n\nThe fun begins just one minute later in Ames at 12:44 p.m. until 3:13 p.m. and in Iowa City, three minutes later from 12:46 p.m. to 3:16 p.m.\n\nWhat does the word ‘eclipse’ mean?\n\nThe word \"eclipse\" originates from the ancient Greek word “ékleipsis,” which means abandonment. The term was used to describe when one celestial body seems to disappear due to being obscured by another body, specifically the obscuring of the sun or moon.\n\nThe term has been adopted into Latin as \"eclipsis\" and English as “eclipse,” maintaining the same meaning of a temporary obscuring of light from a celestial body.\n\nSuperstitions about the solar eclipse\n\nHumans have been gazing up at the sky since the beginning of time, and while there is excitement for the cosmic event, some might have superstitions.\n\nBad omen?\n\nAcross ancient cultures, solar eclipses were considered bad omens, which is true of ancient Greece. Eclipses were seen as supernatural events believed to foreshadow disasters or even the deaths of leaders. People thought that the Gods were angry with humans and would often make offerings and sacrifices to appease the gods during an eclipse.\n\nAvoid eating food\n\nIn some Buddhist communities, there is a tradition of refraining from eating meat during solar eclipses, an ethical principle of not causing harm to other living things, or Ahimsa. Some Buddhists may observe vegetarian or vegan diets during eclipses as a form of spiritual practice.\n\nUnlucky for pregnant women\n\nIn traditional Chinese culture, pregnant women were encouraged to stay indoors during a solar eclipse. It is believed that the negative energy associated with the eclipse can affect the unborn child's health.\n\nHow often does a solar eclipse happen?\n\nSolar eclipses “are fairly numerous” and two to four can occur per year, according to NASA. But they’re visible “from such a small area of Earth each time” so it’s rarer to experience one, says NASA.\n\nThere are several types of solar eclipses such as the total solar eclipse that some Americans will experience on April 8. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth but only covers most of the sun, meaning the outer edge of the sun appears like a bright ring around the moon, according to the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service.\n\nHow to drive during the eclipse\n\nAccording to AAA.com, you should do the following while driving during the eclipse:\n\nKeep your vehicle’s headlights on.\n\nPut the sun visor down to block your view of the sun.\n\nDon’t wear eclipse glasses while driving.\n\nDon’t try to photograph or video the eclipse while driving.\n\nDon’t pull over to the side of the road, highway or interstate to view the eclipse.\n\nExit the roadway and park in a safe area away from traffic to view the eclipse.\n\nBe mindful of pedestrians who may be walking around with their eyes on the sky.\n\nMore:Solar eclipse 2024: Is it safe to drive during the eclipse? How to stay safe\n\nHow to watch the eclipse without glasses\n\nDon’t let your excitement to look up at the sun override safety, Iowans. If you are unable to get a pair of solar eclipse glasses, try viewing the eclipse through these two options using items found in your home. Be aware that neither of these options allow you to look directly at the eclipse.\n\nNASA’s DIY cereal box viewer\n\nGet an empty cereal box and place a white piece of paper or cardboard in the shape of the box’s bottom. Place it inside the box, possibly securing it in place with glue so it doesn’t fall out or move.\n\nSeal the top of the box and then cut rectangles out of each corner of the box, leaving the center of the box’s top intact.\n\nMake sure that center portion is securely closed with tape and not open like you’d have it when you’re pouring a bowl of cereal. Then, cover one of the holes with heavy-duty foil and secure it with tape.\n\nYou’ll have one remaining corner still open, and that’s because you’ll use it for viewing.\n\nUse a small nail and push a hole in the foil covered corner.\n\nLastly, cover the entire box with construction paper, but leave the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nTo use it, hold the box with the pin-hole side facing the sun. With your back to the sun, look through the viewing corner you cut out. You’ll be able to see a small image of the sun projected on the white paper you placed inside the box.\n\nWatch this NASA demonstration on how to craft this cereal box projection here:\n\nAnother option includes using your kitchen colander. Just stand with your back to the sun and raise your colander, which will project tiny images of the eclipse through the colander’s holes.\n\nMore:Forgot to get solar eclipse glasses? Here's how to DIY a viewer with household items.\n\n— Mary Walrath-Holdridge contributed to this article.\n\nWill it be cloudy in Iowa during the solar eclipse?\n\nDes Moines has a 20% chance of cloud cover by 2 p.m. on April 8, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn Fort Dodge, it's 65%, on par with a forecast the NWS published on social media April 8, with clouds focused in northwest Iowa in the morning and possible showers in the afternoon.\n\nYou may have better luck if you're in southeast Iowa, or planning to travel there.\n\nThat region will have clearer skies in the afternoon, including during the time frame the solar eclipse is taking place, said NWS meteorologist Alexis Jimenez on Friday.\n\nWill Carbondale, Illinois — the closest spot to Des Moines in the path of totality — have clouds?\n\nIn the Weather Prediction Center's updated posted Sunday, there looks to be a stretch of southern Illinois, where Carbondale is located, that will have possible cloudy skies at 2 p.m. Iowa time.\n\nMore:Solar eclipse 2024: New interactive map reveals historic weather trends for April 8\n\nWhat type of eclipse is on Monday? What happens during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe United States will experience a total solar eclipse on Monday. That occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blocking the face of the sun, according to NASA. When you’re in the path of totality, or when the moon’s shadow completely covers the sun, then you experience a total solar eclipse.\n\nDuring this period of totality, you can see the outermost layer of the sun’s atmosphere, or the corona. The sky will grow dark, and that can confuse nocturnal creatures or lead to birds and insects going quiet, USA TODAY reported.\n\nWhat glasses do I need to watch the solar eclipse?\n\nYou need special eyewear to observe the partial eclipse, otherwise you risk retinal damage due to the light from the sun’s surface visible before or after totality as you stare up. Glasses labeled “ISO” ensure the eyewear’s safety and quality.\n\nFind solar eclipse glasses for free or available for purchase at Warby Parker, Hy-Vee and these other stores.\n\nAre there any solar eclipse watch parties in Iowa?\n\nYes, there will be several across Iowa, including at the Drake Municipal Observatory or Hoyt Sherman Place in Des Moines, the Pentacrest in Iowa City and McFarland Park in Ames.\n\nWhen was the last total eclipse in Iowa?\n\nThe last total solar eclipse visible across Northern America was on Aug. 21, 2017, according to NASA. Just a sliver of Iowa was in the path of totality then, a 450-acre piece of land in southwestern Iowa. The differences between the 2017 solar eclipse and the one on April 8 include how many more people live in the path of totality in 2024. That, and people viewing the eclipse in Iowa may experience less totality than in 2017.\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nThe next total solar eclipse to be seen in the contiguous United States, meaning all the states except Hawaii and Alaska, will be on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nWhat happens to pets and animals during the eclipse?\n\nThe topic of animal behavior during an eclipse goes far back. During a total solar eclipse in New England in 1932, anecdotal reports claimed many domestic dogs fell silent during the eclipse, horses clustered together and began shaking their heads and tails with anxiety and several species of wild birds such as crows, gulls and sparrows stopped flying and remained silent and still, according to an article in Animals.\n\nMore:2024 solar eclipse may spark behavioral changes in pets, other animals\n\nThere are four things that could to happen to animal behavior during the eclipse, said Erica Cartmill, professor of anthropology, animal behavior and cognitive science:\n\nAnimals won't do anything unusual.\n\nAnimals will do evening behaviors. For example, if a dog is used to a bedtime treat, he may go to the kitchen to wait for it.\n\nAnimals will display signs of increased anxiety such as scratching, yawning, circling and pacing or if they are animals that typically flock together, they will start grouping.\n\nAnimals will display unexpected behavior.\n\nDog owners shouldn't worry about protecting dogs' eyes from the solar eclipse, according to the American Kennel Club.\n\n\"That’s because dogs don’t naturally look up or stare at the sun,\" according to Dr. Jerry Klein, the chief veterinary officer for the AKC. “They know enough not to.\"\n\nWant to see a total solar eclipse somewhere else?\n\nThough the next total solar eclipse to be seen in the contiguous United States will be on Aug. 23, 2044, there are other eclipses for chasers to watch across the world.\n\n\"There will be other solar eclipses that will be visible from elsewhere in the world; they happen on a semi-regular cadence,\" Dr. Jasper Halekas said in an interview with the Press-Citizen in March. \"It's not always visible in the U.S. There are people who are eclipse chasers and who are willing to fly halfway around the world to see one of these things, but that's not within most people's means.\"\n\nLike a storm chaser, an eclipse chaser actively seeks opportunities to witness solar or lunar eclipses in person.\n\nHere are the places to travel to see upcoming eclipses before another will be viewable from the U.S.\n\nAugust 12, 2026 — The path of totality for this eclipse will cross Greenland, Iceland, the Iberian Peninsula, and North Africa. Eclipse chasers might choose locations like Reykjavik, Iceland, or Tangier, Morocco, for optimal viewing.\n\nAugust 2, 2027 — A total solar eclipse will occur over much of the central Eastern Hemisphere on Monday, August 2, 2027. The totality path will span northern Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Prime viewing destinations include Cairo, Egypt, on the path of totality, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to see a partial solar eclipse.\n\nJuly 22, 2028 — The total solar eclipse on July 22, 2028, will sweep across Australia and New Zealand. Darwin, the capital of Australia's Northern Territory, will be in the path of totality, while other places like Auckland and Queenstown, New Zealand, will have partial views of the cosmic event.\n\nParis Barraza, Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez and Jessica Rish are trending and general assignment reporters at the Des Moines Register and Iowa City Press-Citizen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/world/celestial-events-2023-scn/index.html", "title": "Watch the night sky for these celestial events in 2023 | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The comet, spotted by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, is named C/2022 E3 (ZTF) and will make its closest pass of Earth on February 2.\n\nThe comet should be visible through binoculars in the morning sky for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere during most of January and those in the Southern Hemisphere in early February, according to NASA.\n\nINTERACTIVE: The best space photos of 2022\n\nOn any given day, there is always a good chance that the International Space Station is flying overhead. And if you ever want to know what planets are visible in the morning or evening sky, check The Old Farmer’s Almanac’s calculator.\n\nHere are the rest of 2023’s top sky events, so you can have your binoculars and telescope ready.\n\nFull moons and supermoons\n\nMost years, there are 12 full moons — one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two occurring in August.\n\nThe second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase “once in a blue moon,” according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases don’t always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2.5 years.\n\nThe two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky.\n\nSome astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.\n\nHere is the list of full moons for 2023, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\nJanuary 6: Wolf moon\n\nFebruary 5: Snow moon\n\nMarch 7: Worm moon\n\nApril 6: Pink moon\n\nMay 5: Flower moon\n\nJune 3: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 3: Buck moon\n\nAugust 1: Sturgeon moon\n\nAugust 30: Blue moon\n\nSeptember 29: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 28: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 27: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 26: Cold moon\n\nWhile these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moon, each one carries its own significance across Native American tribes (with many also referred to by differing names).\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses in 2023.\n\nA total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun.\n\nAnd for some skywatchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will actually be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earth’s surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moon’s shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA.\n\nLike a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth during an annular eclipse — but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesn’t completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.\n\nA Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across North, Central and South America.\n\nBe sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nMeanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.\n\nWhen the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red — which is why the event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n\nDepending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it on the moon.\n\nA total lunar eclipse appeared in the skies of Canta, east of Lima on May 15, 2022. Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earth’s shadow.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon don’t completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nThe new year kicks off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is expected to peak in the overnight hours between January 3 and 4 for those in North America, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nIt’s the first of 12 meteor showers throughout the year, although the next one, the Lyrid meteor shower, doesn’t peak until April.\n\nHere are peak dates of other showers to watch in 2023:\n\nLyrids: April 22-23\n\nEta Aquariids: May 5-6\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 30-31\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30-31\n\nPerseids: August 12-13\n\nOrionids: October 20-21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4-5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11-12\n\nLeonids: November 17-18\n\nGeminids: December 13-14\n\nUrsids: December 21-22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights. If you’re able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from late evening until dawn.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone! — so the meteors will be easier to spot.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/13/experts-predict-years-of-good-northern-lights-viewing-heres-why/70201435007/", "title": "Experts predict years of good northern lights viewing: Here's why.", "text": "The northern lights, aka the aurora borealis, have been appearing more frequently in the night sky over the United States recently. In late April, for example, a stunning aurora display was seen as far south as Arkansas in the South and Arizona in the West. And a more modest event occurred this week.\n\nSo why the uptick in aurora sightings? And is this expected to continue?\n\nWell, if you love the aurora, you're in luck, as it may be coming to a sky near you more often over the next few years thanks to the \"solar maximum,\" which occurs in 2025.\n\n\"There have been an increase in aurora seen in general on Earth,\" Shannon Schmoll, the director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University told USA TODAY. \"The sun has been more active, resulting in more solar storms that cause solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME).\n\n\"The material released during these solar flares and CMEs interact with the Earth's magnetic field and excite particles in our atmosphere resulting in a beautiful light show in our sky known as the aurora,\" she said.\n\nNorthern lights photos:See aurora borealis light up skies across several states\n\nWhat are the northern lights?\n\nThe aurora forms when the particles flowing from the sun get caught up in the Earth's magnetic field. The particles interact with molecules of atmospheric gases to cause the famed glowing green and reddish colors of the aurora, according to NASA.\n\nThe composition and density of the atmosphere and the altitude of the collisions determine the colors of the lights, the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said. \"The aurora is most often seen as a striking green, but it also occasionally shows off other colors, ranging from red to pink or blue to purple,\" the University said on its website.\n\nThe lights are visible in both the far northern and southern parts of the world. The southern lights are known as the aurora australis.\n\nMore aurora news:Northern lights expected Thursday night in US. Here's where and when to see the aurora.\n\nWhat are solar cycles? What is the solar maximum?\n\nSolar cycles track the activity level of the sun, our nearest star. A cycle is traditionally measured by the rise and fall in the number of sunspots, but it also coincides with increases in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, radio emissions and other forms of space weather.\n\n\"The sun has an 11-year cycle where it goes through maximum and minimum,\" said Schmoll. \"This results in the number of sunspots seen on the sun. Sunspots result from areas of the sun that have stronger magnetic fields.\"\n\nThe number of sunspots on the sun's surface changes on a fairly regular cycle, which scientists refer to as the sun's 11-year cycle variation. Sunspot activity, and hence auroral activity, tends to peak every 11 years.\n\nScientists use sunspots to track solar cycle progress, NASA said. The dark blotches on the sun are associated with solar activity, often as the origins for giant explosions – such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections – that can spew light, energy and solar material into space.\n\n\"This material and radiation is what interacts with the Earth resulting in aurora,\" Schmoll said.\n\nWhen is the next solar maximum?\n\nScientists have forecasted the next peak of solar activity (the solar maximum) will be reached in July 2025, NASA said. Thus, as we approach the solar maximum, we'll start to see more intense and more frequent aurora.\n\nThe last solar maximum was in 2014; The chances of seeing the aurora at lower latitudes increase when the sunspot cycle is at a maximum.\n\n“When we’re in the minimum part of the solar cycle, the sun is very quiet, basically nothing going on,” Taylor Cameron, a research scientist with the Canadian Hazards Information Service, told the New York Times. “And then at maximum, we’ve got lots of solar flares, lots of coronal mass ejections. The sun is just much more active.”\n\nThe current cycle started in 2019, he added.\n\nThe sun has been surprisingly active, defying predictions\n\nThe Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel, an international group of experts co-sponsored by NASA and NOAA, predicted that this would be a below-average solar cycle, like the one before it – Solar Cycle 24. However, the sun has been much more active this cycle than anticipated, said Nicola Fox, director of NASA’s Heliophysics Division.\n\n\"With more activity comes an increase in space weather events including solar flares and solar eruptions, which can impact radio communications, electric power grids, and navigation signals, as well as pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts,\" Fox said.\n\nWhere can you see the northern lights? When is it most common?\n\nAccording to the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, the best places to view aurora are high northern latitudes during the winter in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia.\n\nFurthermore, there is quite strong (but poorly understood) tendency for auroral activity to be stronger at the equinox than it is at solstice, according to the University. \"This so-called \"Russell-McPherron effect\" means that the statistical likelihood of seeing aurora over interior Alaska, for instance, is roughly twice as high at equinox as it is at solstice.\"\n\nIn addition, combined with a slight preference for better weather in spring than in fall, this means that late February to early April are usually considered the best aurora viewing months in Alaska.\n\nDuring very large auroral events, the aurora may be seen throughout the U.S. and Europe, but these events are rare. During an extreme event in 1958, the aurora was visible from Mexico City, the University of Alaska reported.\n\nThe aurora will be stronger\n\nWe're just at the beginning of the most active part of this cycle, Bill Archer, a mission scientist with the Canadian Space Agency, told the CBC. As the sun becomes more active, looking to peak in activity in 2025, he said that we could see some of the strongest storms in years.\n\n\"Right now we're moving into a solar maximum, which means it's more likely that things like that are going to happen,\" he said, referring to a spectacular auroral display in March in Canada.\n\n\"Not only will we see more auroras, but the aurora that we see will be stronger,\" Archer told the CBC.\n\nPhoto gallery: Best spots to see the northern lights", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/04/08/solar-eclipse-2024-time-path-live-stream-glasses-ohio/73131432007/", "title": "When is the solar eclipse?

They said traffic was much easier than anticipated and they didn’t mind paying $40 for parking today.“It’s worth it today,” Michele said.\n\nFreeway closure: State Route 2 at I-90 east of downtown CLE\n\nAll lanes are closed on Route 2 West at I-90/ Route 2 West, near the Burke Lakefront Airport, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation.\n\nCleveland police confirmed in a social media post that the state route was closed until further notice. No details were given as to why.\n\nLocal officials have warned there could be traffic tie-ups related to the eclipse, both because the area was expecting an influx of visitors seeking to see the event and because people would pull off the road to witness it.\n\nSigns were up on roadways earlier today warning people not to stop along freeways.\n\nThe unusual thrill at Cedar Point today is in the sky\n\nApril 8 has always been too early for Cedar Point amusement park to open.\n\nThe winds off of Lake Erie can still be brutal in April. And sometimes, it still snows.\n\nBut today's eclipse changed Cedar Point's history.\n\nFor the first time since it opened as a bath house in 1870, Cedar Point welcomed guests to ride the rides and check out mother nature's afternoon sky show.\n\nPeople from across the US are pouring into MAPS Air Museum for eclipse event in Green\n\nDennis Bachtel, helping to guide vehicles at the sold out MAPS Air Museum eclipse event Monday, said he's seen people from across the country today. They'd come to Green from as far away as California and Seattle.\n\nMore than 350 vehicles were expected for the sold-out event, MAPS marketing manager Doug Perry said.\n\n\"The first car in this morning was from New Jersey and she was a meteorologist,\" Perry said.\n\nKent welcomes locals, out-of-towners with glasses, toys, sweets and maps\n\nThe information tent on Kent's Water Street is set up to welcome eclipses tourists with stickers, magnets and maps.\n\nExecutive Director for Mainstreet Kent Heather Malarcik said the tent also offers minor medical assistance for anyone who needed help.\n\nMalarcik said she expecting locals, but out-of-towners too, hoping to catch a glimpse of a total solar eclipse.\n\nFood trucks and brick-and-mortar businesses aimed to cater to eclipse lovers.\n\nDaisy Pop's food truck was selling \"eclipsefetti\" pops with sprinkles and a \"2024 Eclipse\" label. And they offered a do-it-yourself sweet eclipse, selling separate moon-shaped chocolate pops and sun-shaped vanilla pops.\n\n\"We've been gearing up for this I'd say for probably a year, doing the meetings and learning all about it,\" Daisy Pop owner Amy Mucha said. \"It's hard to believe the day is finally here.\"\n\nAt Kent's Off the Wagon toy store on East Main, interactive puzzle blocks were set up outside so adults and kids could play.\n\nThe store is also selling eclipse glasses designed by local art teacher Cody Knepper.\n\n\"I think it's gonna be a really cool moment when the eclipse starts,\" said Jade Brundelet, an Off the Wagon employee. \"I feel like it's the perfect place to be around here, and it's a really cool sense of community.\"\n\nLocals may have heeded leaders' advice: Stay Home\n\nBy 1 p.m., Akron Zoo workers Angie Walsh and Abby Sipos had talk to about 62 people visiting the zoo for the eclipse.\n\nMany, Walsh said, are from out of town.\n\n\"I think a lot of local people are probably staying at home in their backyards, hanging out, trying to stay out of traffic and stuff,\" said Walsh, an education mission coordinator.\n\nShe and Sipos are talking to people about a citizen science undertaking at the zoo today called the \"eclipse soundscapes project.\"\n\nThe project enlists zoo-goers to record animal reactions during the eclipse.\n\nIf you had planned to venture out to watch the eclipse, many venues -- including local and state parks -- are already at capacity.\n\nWhat's poppin'? Solar eclipse 'astronaut' passes out popcorn coupons\n\nCuyahoga Falls downtown EclipseFest 2024 is getting busier as the clock ticks toward the eclipse.\n\nThe phenomenon begins about 1:59 p.m. and should peak about 3:15 p.m.\n\nRachael Vanfossen of Metropolis Popcorn in Cuyahoga Falls got into the spirt by dressing as a solar eclipse astronaut and handing out coupons.\n\nAkron RubberDucks' Party in the Park: Hitting one straight to the moon(or the sun)\n\nTrish Ostroski, 76, of Cuyahoga Falls takes a pitch inside the Akron RubberDuck's stadium today at the Party in the Park until Dark event to celebrate the eclipse.\n\nFans can take batting practice in the minor league park and watch the moon overtake the sun from the outfield grass.\n\nNothing says eclipse quite like Santa, alien mini golf and two Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles?\n\nCastle Noel, the year-round Christmas museum in Medina, today is hosting two of the six Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles in the world.\n\nIt's only the second time in recent memory that two of the hot dog-shaped vehicles have appeared at the same place at one time, organizers said.\n\nCastle Noel, which is just off Medina's historic town square, was created by artist Mark Klaus. The museum has a collection of Christmas movie memorabilia, including the original slide featured in \"A Christmas Story.\"\n\nKlaus later added Alien Vacation Mini Golf to the museum, which fills a former Methodist church and several nearby buildings.\n\nSuburban D.C. travelers following their eclipse bliss pop up at Akron's Daily Pressed\n\nRandy Payne, of suburban Washington, D.C., said he decided to drive to Akron on a whim Sunday night.\n\n\"The weather gods are cooperating,\" he said Monday morning while waiting for breakfast at The Daily Pressed downtown.\n\nClouds over downtown disappeared by 11 a.m.\n\nThree others at the Daily Pressed Monday morning also drove from the D.C. area.\n\nMarquise McDonald, Frank McDonald and Lamares Alston said were staying in Pittsburgh because Cleveland was to chaotic. They plan to hover around downtown Akron to observe the moon overtake the sun.\n\nAkron Zoo opens doors, expecting 2,500 visitors on eclipse day\n\nWhen the Akron Zoo opened its doors at 11 a.m., people were already lined up outside.\n\nCarrie Bassett, the zoo's education mission manager, said that the zoo has several events planned throughout the day, including two citizen science projects.\n\nAmong the crowd is Connie Benner. Benner is celebrating her 52nd birthday today.\n\n\"I have been counting it down since I knew (the eclipse) was going down on my birthday,\" she said. Joining her is her sister in law, daughter, niece-in-law, and her great nieces and nephews.\n\n\"I just prayed for nice weather, so we have that now,\" Benner said.\n\nEarly in the day it looked like Benner's birthday wish might come true. The clouds cleared shortly before the doors open.\n\nWill early birds get best seats for eclipse?\n\nEric Flanders of Akron's North Hill neighborhood set up lawn chairs atop of one of Cuyahoga Falls’ parking garages at about 10 a.m. for himself, his wife, son and daughter to view the eclipse in the afternoon.“You never know, even today, if you’re going to get a clear view of it,” he said from the garage roof at about 10:40 a.m.Flanders said he and his family will check out the street level of Cuyahoga Falls’ EclipseFest throughout the day.\n\nBut when the moon starts to cover the sun, they plan to return to their rooftop seats.\n\nJoe Siegferth, Cuyahoga Falls Ward 4 councilor, said he will watch the eclipse this afternoon if he helping with crowd control.Siegferth said Cuyahoga Falls’ “beautiful downtown” and “walkability” makes the city well-suited to hosting many people, adding that he hopes the eclipse event allows out-of-town visitors to see what all the city has to offer — and that they decide to return.\n\nWorried about radiation from the eclipse? Don't be, NASA says\n\nNASA is using part of its website to debunk myths about today's total solar eclipse, including worries about radiation.\n\nWhen the disk of the moon fully covers the sun, NASA says, the brilliant corona emits only electromagnetic radiation, sometimes with a greenish hue.\n\n\"Being a million times fainter than the light from the sun itself, there is nothing in the coronal light that could cross 150 million kilometers of space ,penetrate our dense atmosphere, and cause blindness,\" the space agency said. \"However, if you watched the sun before totality, you will catch a glimpse of the brilliant solar surface and this can cause (eye) retinal damage.\"\n\nNASA points out that it's human instinct to quickly look away from the sun before any damage is done. But health officials urge people to wear special glasses to look at the sun leading up to the total eclipse.\n\nThe space agency said the electromagnetic radiation from the corona, seen as light, is \"perfectly safe.\"\n\nThere is also another form of radiation that travels to Earth from the sun that is also safe.\n\n\"Deep in the solar interior where nuclear fusion takes place to light the sun, particles called neutrinos are born, and zip unimpeded out of the sun and into space,\" NASA said. \"Every second, your body is pelted by trillions of these neutrinos no matter if the sun is above or below the horizon.\"\n\nThe only consequence, NASA said, is that a few atoms in your body are \"transmuted into a different isotope by absorbing a neutrino.\"\n\n\" This is an entirely harmless effect,\" NASA said.\n\nIt does not harm people, including those who are pregnant, NASA said.\n\nMr. Funs having a good time with eclipse\n\nMr. Funs Costume & Curiosity Emporium on Front Street in Cuyahoga Falls has geared up for eclipse day as if it were a festival.\n\nThe shop received a bunch of eclipse-themed merchandise over the past three week. By Thursday, about 25% of the shirts, hats, magnets, tumblers and other gear had sold out.\n\nHunter Riggs showed us his store's eclipse gear.\n\nClearing skies, warming temperatures ahead of eclipse\n\nSunshine is moving from west to east after overnight rain in Greater Akron.\n\nThis picture was taken from the Beacon Journal offices downtown about 10 a.m.\n\nStaff in Copley and Medina reported that skies iin their areas were already clear.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Cleveland has forecast near-perfect weather this afternoon in Greater Akron. Not only will it be partly sunny, temperature will climb to a seasonably warm 72 degrees.\n\nDark Side of the Spoon\n\nRetired Beacon Journal Reporter Jim Mackinnon, known for his puns in stories and around the newsroom, won a contest to name Strickland's eclipse-themed sundae: It's called Dark Side of the Spoon.\n\nStrickland's announced the Mackinnon's winning name early this morning on Facebook.\n\nThe sundae − which includes vanilla ice cream, hot fudge and a Moon Pie surrounded by whipped cream clouds − is available today only between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m.\n\nAkron's four parks, downtown viewing location all booked\n\nThe city of Akron this morning said all eclipse viewing sites set up by the city − four parks and an expansive downtown parking lot near Spaghetti Warehouse − are completely booked with people who pre-registered.\n\nAll nine of the city's community centers, however, are open. People do not need to register in advance to visit those, Mayor Shammas Malik's office said on Facebook.\n\n\"Please stay safe on the roads today and be patient with out incoming visitors,\" the mayor's office said on Facebook. \"Let's enjoy this rare\n\nReminder: No parking on state Route 8, Ohio Turnpike or other freeways\n\nDigital signs this morning warned drivers on the Ohio Turnpike and state Route 8 not to stop along the roadways to watch the eclipse: “No shoulder parking.\"\n\nOn most any other day, few would ever think to stop along these busy routes for anything other than an emergency.\n\nThe solar eclipse, forecast for decades, is not an emergency.\n\nLocal officials have urged people to stay home and watch the eclipse from their own yards.\n\nNortheast Ohio this weekend was already busy with travelers visiting to see the celestial phenomenon.\n\nNorton Councilman Jamie Lukens Sunday noted his own experience Sunday on Facebook after visiting the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.\n\n\"Well… today we went to Cuyahoga Valley NP on a whim just to do a hike and it was nutso up there already,\" Lukens wrote. \"We were very surprised to see plates from Michigan, Virginia, Florida, NY and every state between.\"\n\nLukens wrote that he had been skeptical about the predicted influx of visitors for the eclipse, but the number of visitors to the park changed his mind.\n\n\"Honestly if you can watch from home tomorrow and avoid major cities I would recommend it!\" he said in the post.\n\nWhen was the last solar eclipse seen in Ohio?\n\nFor Ohioans, this is once-in a lifetime event. The last total solar eclipse visible here was in 1806, just three years after Ohio was named a U.S. state and 30 years before a fledgling Akron was incorporated as a village.\n\nAll of Greater Akron today is in the U.S. zone of totality, a thin band of area stretching from San Antonio, Texas, through Indianapolis and Northeast Ohio and on to Niagara Falls, New York.\n\nSolar eclipse 2024 will bring unprecedented traffic to Akron, Cleveland\n\nBecause of the rarity of the total solar eclipse and the limited places to see see it in its totality, Northeast Ohio today is expected to be swamped today with visitors pouring in from central and southern Ohio, surrounding states, and other places beyond the zone of totality.\n\nThe Akron Beacon Journal has reporters and photographers stationed across the region covering Greater Akron watch parties, the celestial thrill at Cedar Point and the unprecedented sky show leading before 2024 home opener for the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nEclipse traffic: How bad will the roads get at the time of totality?\n\nWe'll also be following the weather, traffic jams and potential service interruptions, including cell phone service, as crowds descend on Northeast Ohio, searching for the best view of the eclipse.\n\nEclipse weather: What is the forecast today in Akron?\n\nRain and low-level clouds are currently moving throughout Northeast Ohio, according to a post on X from the National Weather Service in Cleveland. The rain should be gone by noon today and some low-level clouds will linger over Northeast Ohio and Northwest Pennsylvania.\n\nTemperatures across the region are expected to reach the low 70s today. There will be a brief drop in temperature during the solar eclipse's peak around 3 p.m. today but once the sun is uncovered, the temperature will rise again.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/01/05/astronomical-events-2024-eclipse-meteor-shower-full-moon-rochester-ny/72009492007/", "title": "Astronomical events in 2024: Every eclipse, meteor shower, full moon", "text": "A rare astronomical phenomenon this spring will bring a unique opportunity for skywatchers and stargazers, as the Rochester region is among the best places for viewing the Great North American Solar Eclipse on April 8, 2024.\n\nWhile the total solar eclipse may be the banner celestial event in the Flower City this year, its not the only one. Also worth noting in 2024 are two lunar eclipses, a dozen meteor showers and a year's worth of full moons.\n\nThis 2024 celestial calendar offers a comprehensive overview of key astronomical events throughout the year. It includes the dates and names of every full moon, meteor shower and eclipse this year.\n\nFull moons brighten the night sky and offer monthly reminders of lunar phases. Meteor showers, including stunners like the Perseids and Geminids, promise moments of awe and inspiration as shooting stars streak across the skies. Solar and lunar eclipses offer remarkable opportunities to witness celestial alignments.\n\nWe hope this roundup of 2024 astronomical events helps you connect with the cosmos and marvel at the wonders of our universe.\n\nTotal solar eclipse in Rochester NY\n\nOn April 8, Rochester will be in the path of totality − a narrow slice of geography with an optimal view of the moon perfectly in line with the Sun. The path of totality will stretch from the southwestern United States through the central and northeastern parts of the country, across New York state, and up into eastern Canada.\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when Earth, the moon and the sun are in syzygy − alignment − during which the moon moves between the sun and Earth and blocks the solar light from reaching Earth.\n\nStarting at 2:07 p.m. on April 8 in Rochester, the moon will begin to appear to move in front of the sun. Totality begins at 3:20 p.m. and will last for 3 minutes and 38 seconds (plus or minus a few seconds depending where you are standing.) By 4:33 p.m. the moon will have moved past the sun returning the light to normal.\n\nDuring totality, it should get very dark and it is the only time you would be able to see the sun's corona, as well as colorful lights in the chromosphere and solar prominences with your eyes because the moon will be blocking out the most extreme source of light. You should feel a temperature drop and animals may begin to act like it is nighttime.\n\nIn New York, Niagara Falls, Buffalo and Rochester will all be in the path of totality, as will Watertown and Plattsburgh. Locally, Brockport is directly on the center line of totality, as is the Horseshoe Falls in Niagara Falls.\n\nThe shadow will be traveling at an average of about 2,300 miles per hour across New York state and will only take about 10 minutes, from one side of state to the other, said Dan Schneiderman, RMSC's eclipse partnership coordinator.\n\nIt's been 98 years since Rochester was in the path of totality for a solar eclipse (in 1925) and it will be more than two decades (in 2045) before another total solar eclipse will be seen in the U.S., though not in New York. The next time the Rochester region will be within the path of totality is 2144.\n\nOther solar and lunar eclipses in 2024\n\nWhile the total solar eclipse will likely be the highlight of the year for many, it's not the lone eclipse this year. Two lunar eclipses are also set to take place. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, causing the Earth's shadow to be cast on the moon's surface. Lunar eclipses happen when the moon, Earth and sun are closely aligned, typically during a full moon.\n\nMarch 25: Penumbral lunar eclipse: This eclipse will be subtle, visible from the Americas, western Europe and western Africa.\n\nThis eclipse will be subtle, visible from the Americas, western Europe and western Africa.

The Biden campaign on Thursday said Trump is playing politics with his repeated requests for early debates, citing a comment the president made in February: \"If I were him, I’d want to debate me, too. He’s got nothing else to do.\"\n\nTrump refused to debate Republican opponents during the GOP primary. Before he clinched the Republican nomination, he claimed he didn't want to let his former challengers, such as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov.

Trump had claimed without evidence the commission was biased against him during the 2020 race against Biden.\n\nIn a January 2022 letter to the commission, the RNC said it \"has a duty to ensure that its future presidential nominees have the opportunity to debate their opponents on a level playing field.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear on Thursday whether those requests were granted, or whether the RNC withdrew the asks.

No more chaos, no more debate about debates.\"\n\nFor months, it had been unclear whether Biden and Trump would even square off in a debate before the November election. But after having not committed, Biden said last month that he would be willing to debate Trump.\n\nIn a video posted online Wednesday, Biden said he was willing to debate Trump twice before the general election − and proposed the first face-off take place in June. Biden's campaign informed the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has hosted the matches since 1988, that it would not be participating in its series of three debates scheduled for the fall.\n\nIn a statement, the Biden campaign said it wants the first to debate to take place in June, when Trump's hush money trial in New York is \"likely to be over\" and after Biden returns from the Group of Seven Summit in mid-June before Republicans officially award their nomination. The campaign proposed a second debate in September \"prior to the beginning of early voting,\" echoing a Trump campaign demand.\n\nThe Biden campaign proposed the debates be hosted by television networks that previously hosted a Republican primary debate in 2016 and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 \"so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable.\" Biden's team also suggested a vice presidential debate take place in late July.\n\nThe general election involved three presidential debates and a vice presidential debate for nearly two decades, until one was abruptly called off in 2020 when Trump rejected the commission's plan to make it virtual after his COVID-19 diagnosis. Before then, the last time the debate schedule was limited to two face-offs was in 1996.\n\nBoth campaigns frustrated with the commission on debates\n\nDebates organized by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates − the corporation that has traditionally picked the times, locations and moderators of sparring matches − had been set to begin Sept. 16 and continue into October.\n\n\"The American public deserves substantive debates from the leading candidates for president and vice president,\" the Commission on Presidential Debates said in a statement Wednesday, adding that it will \"continue to be ready to execute\" its original series of debates before the election.\n\nBoth campaigns have expressed frustration with the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nThe Biden team has long complained that the commission failed to enforce its own rules in 2020, when Trump constantly interrupted Biden. Trump complained about commission bias against him.\n\nThe Republican National Committee in 2022 passed a resolution saying it would not allow its nominee to participate in a debate sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, although Trump said earlier this year that he would be willing to forgo that resolution if he could secure a match-up with Biden.\n\nBefore Biden's challenge, Trump's team had called for earlier debates to accommodate early voting. And the GOP candidate accepted Biden's proposed time frame for the debates in a social media post almost immediately.\n\nTrump says he wants more than two debates\n\nTrump said he was \"Ready and Willing to Debate\" him \"at the two proposed times in June and September.\"\n\n\"I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds,\" Trump wrote. \"That’s only because he doesn’t get them. Just tell me when, I’ll be there. 'Let’s get ready to Rumble!!!'\"\n\nTrump and Biden had been sparring over the timing of the debates for weeks, and the back-and-forth heated up Wednesday.\n\nIn a video posted to social media Wednesday morning, Biden took a jab at Trump for refusing to participate in a single Republican primary debate this cycle. He said he'd make good on a promise to debate Trump, telling him, \"Make my day pal, I'll even do it twice.\"\n\n\"Let's pick the dates Donald, I hear you're free on Wednesdays,\" Biden said, making a veiled reference to Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy, an independent candidate running a distant third for president, will not be joining Biden and Trump on the debate stage.\n\nAmong its criteria, the Biden campaign said the debate should also be \"one-on-one,\" allowing voters to compare the only two candidates with any statistical chance of prevailing in the Electoral College.\"\n\nThe latter stipulation was intended to ensure that third-party candidates such as Kennedy are not allowed on stage. Prior debates have had a 15% debate threshold. Kennedy had 8% support in the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll.\n\nKennedy accused Trump and Biden of trying to avoid a robust discussion about their time in office.\n\n\"They are trying to exclude me from their debate because they are afraid I would win.

Katie Britt, R-Ala., delivered the Republican response to Biden's remarks after he wrapped up his speech, highlighting conservative priorities during a close election year.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage of the State of the Union.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTakeaways from Biden’s State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden called on Americans to look to \"the future\" and not return to the politics of his predecessor in a State of the Union address that served as the kickoff to a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nHe began his address with an immediate attack on Trump by casting the fight ahead as one to preserve \"freedom and democracy\" − the central theme of his candidacy. Biden made restoring abortion rights a major theme of his speech, blaming Trump for the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 by appointing three justices who tilted the court's conservative majority.\n\nHe also addressed challenges both at home and abroad, getting into a heated confrontation with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., over the border and calling on Israel to “do its part” in sending humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden, Donald Trump troll each other during SOTU speech\n\nHe never mentioned Donald Trump by name. But President Joe Biden was quick to go after his “predecessor” and “the last administration” Thursday during the State of the Union address, hammering Trump on everything from Russia policy to abortion, taxes and the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump started jabbing Biden hours before he entered the House chamber, where he delivered his speech. Trump complained about Biden being late when the event didn’t start on time and kept up his “Play by Play” throughout much of the speech.\n\nFor instance, at one point in the speech, Biden accused Trump of trying to “bury the truth about Jan. 6” to which Trump defended Jan. 6 participants on Truth Social and repeated unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\n-- Zac Anderson and Michael Collins\n\n‘Remember Abbey Gate’ man yelling interrupts SOTU speech\n\nApproximately one hour into the speech, in which Joe Biden drew sharp contrasts between himself and the Republican Party, a person began shouting causing the President to pause briefly. “Remember Abbey Gate! US Marines!” the protester shouted.\n\nAbbey Gate is a reference to a 2021 suicide bombing during the evacuation of Afghanistan.\n\nThe protester was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n-- James Powel, Jeanine Santucci, Tom Vanden Brook, Ken Tran\n\nHouse Republican: Joe Biden's energy was 'high' despite age\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., said he was impressed by Joe Biden's energy on Thursday night, despite his age. The Montana lawmaker remarked that the president's energy was notably \"high.\"\n\nZinke's reaction to his address is a stark contrast to Republicans who have repeatedly attacked Biden, 81, over his age. Prior to Biden's address, several House Republicans joked they wanted to see a \"coherent\" message from the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'We want families to grow'\n\nKatie Britt addressed a number of conservative priorities on Thursday, from addressing inflation to curbing TikTok.\n\nBut the Alabama lawmaker also discussed IVF in the wake of her home state's Supreme Court decision earlier this year.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The decision rocked families and medical providers across the country.\n\n\"We want families to grow\" Britt said of herself and her Republican colleagues. \"It's why we strongly support continued, nationwide access to invitro fertilization. We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt zeroes in on Joe Biden's border policy\n\nKatie Britt on Thursday said the American dream \"has turned into a nightmare for so many families.\"\n\n\"President Biden's border policies are a disgrace. This crisis is despicable. And the truth is, it is almost entirely preventable,\" she said.\n\nBritt told the story of a Texas woman who was trafficked by drug cartels. She also referenced Laken Riley, a Georgia woman who was killed. An undocumented immigrant has been charged following her death.\n\n\"Mr. President, enough is enough. Innocent Americans are dying, and you only have yourself to blame.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt hits Joe Biden in Republican SOTU response\n\nKatie Britt kicked off her response to Joe Biden's State of the Union address by calling the president a \"permanent politician,\" referring to him as \"out of touch.\"\n\n\"Under his administration, families are worse off,\" Britt said.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden addresses concerns about his age\n\nJoe Biden ended his speech by addressing Americans' well-documented concerns about his age, cracking a joke.\n\n“I know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” he quipped.\n\nThe president said he is still up to the task, citing his experience and wisdom. He seemed to draw a direct comparison to his predecessor and opponent, alluding to his belief that he and Donald Trump think different core values define America.\n\n“My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy... Honesty. Decency. Dignity. Equality,” he said. “Now some other people my age see a different story. An American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.”\n\nBiden also highlighted his decades of experience in politics, reminding viewers that there was a time in his career when people told him he was “too young.”\n\n“Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures,” he said. “The very idea of America, that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nStanding up to China\n\nRelations with China have stabilized – for now. But competition with the rival nation remains a top priority for the Biden administration.\n\n“America is rising,” Joe Biden said Thursday. “We’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan straits.”\n\nBiden said Thursday that he had revitalized U.S. alliances in the region and taken steps to protect American investments in advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\n“Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,” Biden said.\n\nMoments later, as Biden said that issues such as the reduction of fentanyl production and trafficking should be bipartisan, he chafed at Republicans seated in the chamber.\n\n“You don’t want to do that huh,” he said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho yelled 'Liar!' at Joe Biden?\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., was the first Republican to accuse Joe Biden of being a 'liar' during the state of the union, according to reports.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Van Orden told USA TODAY in a text message: \"Who?\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nContaining the “threat posed by Iran”\n\nJoe Biden warned Houthi rebels in Yemen that the U.S. will take any means necessary to protect commercial vessels in the Red Sea and minimize disruptions to global trade.\n\nAn attack by the Iranian-backed group on a shipping vessel killed three crew members on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its coalition partners are wary of escalating the conflict. They have responded to previous episodes of violence with limited airstrikes.\n\nBut the president said Thursday, that “containing the threat posed by Iran” is key to achieving stability in the region.\n\n“As commander-in-chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel,” Biden said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden calls for temporary cease-fire in the Middle East\n\nBiden rebuked Israel for the high death toll in Gaza and called for a temporary cease-fire in its war with Hamas.\n\n“Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip,” Biden said. “Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.”\n\nHe added: “As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.”\n\nThe bloody conflict began five months ago, to the day, when Hamas fighters kidnapped, killed and most likely engaged in “sexualized torture” of Israeli civilians, according to a U.N. report, during the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBiden pledged to the families of hostages that he would not rest until their loved ones return home. The commitment drew a standing ovation from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd while the U.S. firmly supports Israel’s right to defend itself, Biden said, the price that innocent Palestinian women and children are paying is too high.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Biden said.\n\nBiden pressed both sides to accept the terms of a six-week ceasefire that would bring about the release of hostages, including an unknown number of Americans, and help get higher amounts of aid into the Gaza strip.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden demands assault weapon ban, touts lower crime rates.\n\nJoe Biden told the joint session that he is demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks.\n\n“None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged Jasmine, whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers at a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Biden said families who lost their children urged him to “do something” to address gun violence.\n\n“Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was president,” he said.\n\nBiden claimed America is safer today than when he took office and touted his American Rescue Plan's investment in public safety.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nProtestor who interrupted Joe Biden handcuffed and arrested\n\nThe protestor who interrupted Joe Biden, yelling about Abbey, Gate was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden interrupted by a protestor\n\nA protestor loudly interrupted Biden's speech from the House gallery overlooking the House floor, yelling about Abbey Gate. It's a reference to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which saw 13 military members killed.\n\nThe protestor was escorted out by security.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says his \"predecessor\" is playing politics with border\n\nJoe Biden talked about introducing a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system, secure the border, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, he said, would be the toughest set of border security reforms and would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers. But Republicans killed the legislation earlier this month, even after GOP lawmakers participated in negotiations.\n\n“But unfortunately, politics have derailed it so far,” he said. “I’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him.\"\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nRepublicans are leaving Biden's State of the Union early\n\nIn a sign of disinterest and disdain at the president's address, a handful of Republicans have slowly been trickling out of the House chamber as Joe Biden has been speaking.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden calls for expanded voting rights\n\nIn recognition of a dark moment in U.S. history, Biden pressed Congress to strengthen voter protections.\n\nHis speech fell on the 59th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when Alabama police clubbed and attacked civil rights advocates with tear gas during a peaceful demonstration.\n\nThe incident was a catalyst for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 several months later, which banned literacy tests and introduced other measures intended to help African Americans exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\nBiden held hands and marched with civil rights activists last year in Selma; Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at this year’s commemorative event.\n\n\"There are forces taking us back in time. Voter suppression. Election subversion. Unlimited dark money. Extreme gerrymandering,\" Biden said Thursday. \"It's time do to more than talk. Pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act!\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden pushes for a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nBiden said he would like to see a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit he approved during the pandemic. The credit enacted as part of his American Rescue Plan was only active in 2021.\n\nThat year, the Child Tax Credit increased from $2,000 to $3,000 per child over six and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under six. It also raised the age limit from 16 to 17. Working families received the full credit if they made less than $150,000 for a couple or $112,500 for families with a single parent.\n\n“Restore the Child Tax Credit because no child should go hungry in this country,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDemocrats to Marjorie Taylor Greene: 'Shut up!'\n\nAs Joe Biden railed against Republicans for killing a bipartisan border and migrant deal earlier this year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene got into a testy back and forth with the president and yelled \"It's about Laken Riley!\"\n\nRiley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nDemocrats immediately stood up to boo at Greene, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was seen yelling at her to \"Shut up!\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n“Strong and getting stronger”\n\nBiden sought to boost confidence in America’s future, saying on Thursday that when the country gets knocked down, it gets back up.\n\n“We keep going. That’s America,” Biden said.\n\nIt’s because of the tenacity of the American people that Biden said he could say in his address, “The state of our union is strong and getting stronger.”\n\nThe line drew loud cheers and applause from Democrats in the chamber, who erupted in chants of “Four more years!” Republicans stayed seated.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublicans jeer as Biden accuses them of cutting Social Security\n\nBiden accused Republicans of supporting cuts to Social Security and vowed to protect the social safety net, provoking jeers and a handful of GOP members yelling \"Liar!\" back at the president.\n\n\"If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them,\" Biden said.\n\nIf the dynamic sounds familiar, that's because it is. Biden made the same point at last year's State of the Union address, and Republicans responded the same way.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vows to lower housing costs\n\nTo address the increasing cost of housing, Joe Biden said he wants to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down.\n\n“I know the cost of housing is so important to you,” he said.\n\nHe said the administration is also eliminating title insurance fees for federally backed mortgages so that when a homeowner refinance their home, they can save you $1,000 or more.\n\nHe also urged Congress to pass his housing plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring rents down.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden: ‘I want to make college more affordable’\n\nBiden pushed for making college more affordable and urged lawmakers to continue increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families.\n\nHe acknowledged Keenan Jones, a public school educator from Minnesota, who was a guest sitting near the first lady Thursday evening.\n\n“While we’re at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise,” he said.\n\nBiden told the joint session that he wants to give every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three and four year olds as well as expand high quality tutoring and summer learning to increase reading levels.\n\n“To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene: 'Tell Hunter to pay his taxes!'\n\nWhen Biden spoke about raising the corporate tax rate, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., interrupted and yelled, \"tell Hunter to pay his taxes!\" referring to the president's son, Hunter Biden and his federal tax evasion charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden calls for Medicare to negotiate lower prices on 500 prescription drugs\n\nJoe Biden touted his administration’s steps to lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs, noting that “for years, people have talked about it, but finally we got it done.”\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022, gave Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices directly with drug companies. As a result, Biden said, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market.\n\nNow it’s time to go further, he said, and give Medicare the authority to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorge Santos, during the State of the Union, announces he's running for reelection\n\nDuring Biden's speech, embattled former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House for his extravagant lies and slate of criminal charges, announced he was running for reelection, challenging his fellow New Yorker, Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.\n\n\"Tonight, I want to announce that I will be returning to the arena of politics and challenging Nick,\" Santos said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIVF and Roe v. Wade take center stage\n\nJoe Biden during his speech highlighted Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision treating embryos as children.\n\n“She was told her dream would have to wait,” Biden said. “Let’s stand up for families like hers,\" said Biden.\n\nHe also pointed to Kate Cox, who was denied an abortion in Texas.\n\n“Here are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need,” said Biden. “Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain warms up to Joe Biden\n\nUnited Auto Worker President Shawn Fain mouths \"it's you,\" in response to accolades from Joe Biden.\n\nIt's a big turnaround: Fain and the UAW withheld an endorsement for Biden for months as the United Auto Workers pressured the administration to strengthen union rules. The union openly criticized the administration for failing to tie generous federal funding to strong labor requirements.\n\nThey finally endorsed Biden earlier this year after big contract wins in the fall.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDonald Trump's Truth Social website is down\n\nWhile Joe Biden has attacked Donald Trump at length, the former president has not responded as often as expected.\n\nHis Truth Social website went down shortly after Biden began his speech.\n\nTrump aides are weighing in often on Biden on other social media, but the candidate himself is silenced …. for now.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: ‘My predecessor failed’ handling COVID-19 pandemic\n\nBiden said America is on the comeback from the worst pandemic and economic crisis in the century.\n\n“My predecessor failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people—the duty to care,” Biden said. “I think that’s unforgivable.”\n\nBiden said the COVID-19 pandemic no longer controls our lives. And while the U.S. economy was on the brink, it’s now the “envy of the world.” He cited unemployment at record lows, an increase in small business owners, new manufacturing jobs, a decrease in inflation and increase in exporting American products.\n\n“It doesn’t make news, but in 1,000 cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told,\" he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nJoe Biden condemns Jan. 6 mob attack in SOTU address\n\nWarning that democracy is under assault, Joe Biden cited the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election.\n\n“The insurrectionists were not patriots,” Biden said. “They came to stop the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nLies about the 2020 election and the plot to steal the election posed the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War, Biden said, “but they failed.”\n\nTrump and some Republicans in Congress “seek to bury the truth about Jan. 6,” Biden alleged. “I will not do that.”\n\n“Here’s the truth,” he said. “You can’t love your country only when you win.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Lies!' one House GOP lawmaker yells\n\nAs Joe Biden was speaking, one House Republican interjected and yelled \"Lies!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., instructed GOP members to remain cordial throughout the address, but that message evidently didn't get through to some lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is sitting behind Joe Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., are sitting behind the president on Thursday. It's traditional for the vice president and speaker of the House to sit behind the president during the State of the Union.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden criticizes Donald Trump's attacks on NATO\n\nOne of Biden’s few foreign policy successes since last year: the addition of Sweden to the NATO alliance.\n\nSweden cleared the final obstacle on Tuesday when, after more than a year of delays, the Hungarian government finally approved the nation’s membership. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson submitted the accession paperwork in Washington, D.C. hours before Biden’s evening address.\n\nThe ceremony made it convenient for Kristersson to attend the State of the Union as a guest of the White House. And it gave Biden a ready-made opportunity to juxtapose his support for the alliance that is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary with the position of likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nTrump last month claimed he once told the leader of a NATO nation that Russia can do “whatever the hell” it wants countries to countries that spend less than they should on their national defense.\n\n“We will not walk away. We will not bow down,” Biden said Thursday. “I will not bow down!”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden opens remarks with call to support Ukraine aid\n\nPresident Joe Biden opened his speech by declaring loudly that America stands with Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin continuing to wage war on the sovereign nation.\n\nBiden said he hoped to \"wake up the Congress\" and alert the American people \"this is no ordinary moment\" with democracy under threat in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\"If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not,\" Biden said from the House chamber. “But Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is asking.\"\n\n\"They are not asking for American soldiers,\" Biden said. \"And I'm determined to keep it that way.\"\n\nA national security bill that included assistance for Ukraine cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. Facing potential blowback from conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not brought the bill for a vote.\n\nKyiv’s ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, and a Ukrainian soldier, Andrii Chevozorov, were present for the remarks.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden kicks off speech with a joke\n\nAs Biden reaches the podium, he quips: \"If I were smart I'd go home now.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, standing over Biden's left shoulder, cracks a smile.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDemocrats chant 'four more years'\n\nAs President Joe Biden made his way down the aisle in the House chamber, Democrats erupted in chants of \"four more years!\" dispelling at least any public perception of Democratic concerns about the president's reelection prospects.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, looked on silently.\n\n– Riley Beggin and Ken Tran\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona is SOTU designated survivor\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona is the designated survivor for this year’s State of the Union.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members. The practice ensures that someone in the line of presidential succession is always available to assume the presidency if the worst-case scenario happens.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJoe Biden has arrived to applause from both sides of the aisle\n\nJoe Biden is now on the House floor to raucous applause from Democrats – and at least some from Republicans.\n\nUpon entering the chamber, Biden greeted Republicans and was seen in a long conversation with ultraconservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden's cabinet has arrived\n\nPresident Joe Biden's cabinet has entered the House floor, to a lot of cheering from Democrats.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the reception wasn't as warm from Republicans, who stood in silence besides the few who did applaud.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden bypasses protesters en route to Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:59 p.m., just 10 minutes after departing the White House.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters blocked parts of Pennsylvania Avenue, a major street that connects the White House to the Capitol and is the route usually taken by the presidential motorcade when heading to the Capitol.\n\nReporters traveling with Biden said the motorcade took a different route that bypassed the protests.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nSCOTUS arrives at State of the Union\n\nThe Supreme Court justices have arrived on the House floor ahead of Joe Biden's speech, to bipartisan applause.\n\nSort of.\n\nNoticeably not as many Democrats opted to cheer compared to Republicans as the justices walked down the aisle. The court's 6-3 conservative majority has been a frequent point of criticism from Democratic lawmakers, especially after the court overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion, in 2022.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden en route to Capitol\n\nJoe Biden’s motorcade departed the White House at 8:49 p.m. for the short ride to the Capitol, where he will deliver his State of the Union address.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGOP lawmaker wears Donald Trump T-shirt\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, one of former President Donald Trump's most outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill, is wearing a T-shirt sporting Trump's booking photo with the caption \"NEVER SURRENDER\" along with a bowtie with an American flag pattern.\n\nTrump took the photo in association with the criminal charges he faces in Georgia. The former president is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from Joe Biden in the Peach State.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nProtestors host “People’s State of the Union”\n\nA group of protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Middle East gathered outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of Biden’s speech for an event dubbed the “People’s State of the Union.”\n\nProtestors attempting to block Biden’s motorcade in Washington chanted “free, free Palestine,” some wearing t-shirts that read “Biden’s legacy = genocide.”\n\nIfNotNow, an organization made up of Jewish American activists, took credit for displaying banners calling for a cease-fire on nearby freeways earlier in the day on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nKamala Harris, senators arrive ahead of Joe Biden's State of the Union\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, joined by senators, have arrived to the House floor after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the lower chamber into order to introduce them.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vs. Donald Trump polls\n\nNow that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are expected to face off in November, where do the rivals stand in the polls?\n\nIn a hypothetical general election match-up, Trump leads Biden by 1.8 percentage points, according to a Real Clear Politics average of nationwide polls. But keep in mind that's within the margin of error of many surveys.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat does SOTU mean?\n\nIf you're keeping up with Joe Biden's State of the Union address tonight, you're probably going to see four letter a lot: SOTU. If you need a primer, SOTU stands for State of the Union.\n\nAnother acronym you might see tonight: POTUS. That stands for president of the United States.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhy are women wearing white at the State of the Union?\n\nIn the House chamber, where Biden is expected to speak in less than an hour, several female House Democratic lawmakers are dressed in all-white to commemorate the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden expected to slam Republicans for rejecting bipartisan border deal\n\nJoe Biden is likely to criticize Republican lawmakers on Thursday for rejecting a bipartisan border security deal that Senate conservatives killed earlier this month.\n\nRepublicans initially demanded that border security policies be attached to additional foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that Biden requested last year. After months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of senators released an agreement that would have significantly restricted asylum and created a new emergency mechanism to stop migrants from illegally entering the country.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump came out against the provisions, and many Republicans followed suit. House leaders declared it “dead on arrival” in their chamber, and Senate Republicans abandoned it when it became clear it wouldn’t get the support of a majority of their conference.\n\nDemocrats have since seized on the turnaround, arguing Republicans aren’t serious about their claims of urgency at the border. Republicans, however, are also expected to bite back: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., is expected to say Biden “invited” the border crisis and describe it as “despicable” and “a disgrace” in prepared remarks of the formal GOP response.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat time does the State of the Union address start?\n\nThe State of the Union address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nJoe Biden will begin addressing lawmakers and Americans across the country after he enters the halls of Congress alongside officials from all three branches of America's government.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden set to address IVF after Alabama Supreme Court ruling\n\nAs Joe Biden addresses the nation Thursday in his State of the Union speech, hopeful parents and medical experts will be looking for signs that access to IVF, or in vitro fertilization is not in jeopardy.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The court’s ruling alarmed prospective parents and IVF clinics, and the real-world consequences were immediate. At least three Alabama medical facilities halted in vitro fertilization treatments.\n\nThe issue is sure to take center stage during Biden's speech. Among the guests joining first lady Jill Biden is Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the court's decision.\n\nThere is a good chance that Biden will emphasis her experience as yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nGeorge Santos is back on Capitol Hill for State of the Union\n\nFormer Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House last year for fabricating his background and his sweeping criminal charges, is back on Capitol Hill today for the State of the Union address.\n\nOne House Republican told USA TODAY that Santos “should stay away.”\n\nBut, the Republican joked, his return is fitting since “he’s already delivered a State of the Union address,” referencing the embattled for lawmaker's lies.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat notable guests are attending the State of the Union?\n\nEvery year, invited guests are an important part of the messaging strategy for the president’s State of the Union speech. This year, the First Lady Jill Biden's guest list reflects key themes Joe Biden is expected to address, including the conflict in the Middle East, the student debt crisis, reproductive rights, and other top issues.\n\nAmong her 20 invitees are:\n\nShawn Fain of Detroit, Michigan. Fain is President of the United Auto Workers, the union Biden walked the picket line with last September.\n\nof Detroit, Michigan.

USA TODAY reached out to users who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nRead more:A State of the Union intermission? False claim circulates ahead of address\n\n– BrieAnna J. Frank\n\nRepublican response to focus on economy, border\n\nKatie Britt will call Joe Biden “a dithering and diminished leader” during the Republican response to the State of the Union this evening, according to advance excerpts from her speech.\n\n“America deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders, stable prices, safe streets, and a strong defense are the cornerstones of a great nation,” she says in prepared remarks.\n\nThe 42-year-old first-term senator also plans to touch on border security, the economy and crime, painting a picture of the country “at a crossroads,” choosing between a bright future or “an America in decline.”\n\nBritt will speak shortly after Biden’s remarks conclude.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nBiden's crucial SOTU: Addressing age, the economy, and Donald Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden faces a pivotal State of the Union address Thursday as he looks to silence skeptics about his ability to keep serving, convince restless Americans of a strong economy and reestablish the stakes of a likely rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nIn what could be his final State of the Union address, the moment could not be much bigger for Biden, who is saddled with challenges at home and abroad.\n\nBiden hears heckling regularly from pro-Palestinian protesters as he tries to navigate the U.S. role in the Israel-Hamas war without further alienating his liberal base.\n\nHe's been unable to assuage concerns about his age and ability to effectively serve another four years. Despite a booming stock market and historically low unemployment, Biden isn't getting credit for an economic rebound. His approval rating, already hovering in the low 40s for two years, dipped even lower in recent weeks.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden housing plan set for State of the Union\n\nTimes are tough for homebuyers and renters. Between high mortgage rates, lack of availability, skyrocketing home prices and dire rental prices, housing costs are devouring the American pocketbook.\n\nWith the dismal housing outlook weighing on family budgets, President Joe Biden will use his State of the Union speech Thursday to showcase plans to help Americans obtain mortgages and to push down monthly rents, according to the White House.\n\nBiden will call on Congress to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide first-time middle-class homebuyers an annual tax credit of $5,000 for two years.\n\nThis would effectively reduce the mortgage rate by more than 1.5 percentage points, the White House said, and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first home over the next two years.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden will address abortion rights, economy in SOTU\n\nAccording to excerpts released ahead of his speech, Biden will highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights against Trump.\n\nAccording to excerpts, Biden will also highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights, vowing to codify abortion rights if given a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\n“Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,” Biden will say. “But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\nBiden will also tout the “greatest story never told” as he talks about the nation’s economic rebound following the pandemic.\n\n“Let’s tell that story here and now,” Biden will say. “America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down, investing in all of America – in all Americans – to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden to reject ‘an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution’ in State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden will say he rejects “an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution” during Thursday’s State of the Union address as he frames a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, according to excerpts released by the White House, will say his life has taught him to “embrace freedom and democracy” and values such as honesty, equality and giving everyone a fair shot.\n\n“Now some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s not me,” Biden is expected to say.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is a designated survivor?\n\nMembers of Joe Biden’s Cabinet are expected to attend tonight’s speech at the U.S. Capitol, but one of them – a “designated survivor” – will be watching from a secret location.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members. The practice ensures that someone in the line of presidential succession is always available to assume the presidency if the worst-case scenario happens.\n\nThe White House hasn’t said who this year’s designated survivor will be. During last year’s address, the designee was Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. In 2022, it was Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTonight's State of the Union is happening later in the year than usual\n\nTonight’s State of the Union address is only the second to take place during March since 1964. The first was Biden’s speech in 2022. Last year, Biden delivered his address on Feb. 7.\n\nPresidents have mostly delivered their State of the Union speeches in January, but some have taken place in February in recent years, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nThis year’s scheduling allows Biden to address the American public two days after winning several state primary elections on Super Tuesday. In contrast, Trump delivered his State of the Union speech a month before Super Tuesday took place in 2020.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHouse Republicans donning badges with Laken Riley's name\n\nAhead of Biden's State of the Union address, House Republicans are wearing pins and badges bearing Laken Riley's name. Riley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are handing out pins and badges to their fellow Republican colleagues as the GOP continues to focus on the crisis on the southern border as a messaging point against Biden.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow long have previous State of the Unions lasted?\n\nState of the Union speeches typically range from about 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes. Biden’s previous addresses each lasted more than an hour. In 2022, he spoke for just over an hour and in 2023 he spoke for an hour and 13 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nFormer President Richard Nixon delivered the shortest State of the Union address in 1972, speaking for under 29 minutes. Former President Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech. During his 1995 and 2000 addresses, he spoke for close to an hour and a half.\n\nBiden is the most talkative president in recent memory in terms of the actual number of words spoken in his speeches.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow can I stream the State of the Union?\n\nThe State of the Union address will be streamed on the USA TODAY YouTube channel and through the USA TODAY channel on your smart television.\n\n– James Powel\n\nState of the Union bingo: Everything you need to play during Joe Biden's speech\n\nIt's time to play State of the Union bingo! You know − the game where you play along as Joe Biden gives his annual address to the nation.\n\nIn his State of the Union address, Biden is expected to speak about domestic and international challenges. We've done our best guess to compile a list, or rather bingo cards, of talking points or phrases Biden probably will use.\n\nPick a card and cross off a square every time Biden brings up one of the statements or terms to claim political victory over your opponents.\n\nWho is Katie Britt?\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Thursday evening.\n\nBut who is the first-term lawmaker? Britt, 42, is the youngest Republican woman to ever be elected to the upper chamber and is considered a rising star among a party dominated by older men. On Thursday night, she'll also offer a contrast to President Joe Biden, the oldest sitting president in American history.\n\nShe has two children still in middle and high school and said in a statement ahead of the speech that the Republican Party is the party of \"hard-working parents and families.\"\n\nBritt's speech will come just over two weeks after the Supreme Court in her home state issued a decision that rocked families across the country: The Alabama high court determined that frozen embryos used in IVF are children and have legal protections under state law.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden’s State of the Union address to focus on four themes\n\nThe White House briefed Democratic congressional aides on Thursday morning about Joe Biden’s address and outlined key themes of his speech, according to a person in the briefing. A slideshow, shared with USA TODAY, was presented to staffers read out four themes:\n\nProgress and possibility\n\nDefend democracy and freedom\n\nEconomy from middle out, bottom up\n\nMove the country forwards, not backwards\n\nThe presentation also alluded to the presidential election and former President Donald Trump. Another slide in the presentation read that the “key message” after Biden’s address will be that “there’s a clear contrast” and “competing visions for the country.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDonald Trump to prod Joe Biden during State of the Union\n\nRest assured: The 2024 Republican frontrunner will not stay silent during Biden's speech tonight.\n\nDonald Trump says he and his staff will provide running (critical) commentary on social media as Biden delivers the State of the Union.\n\n\"We did this once before to tremendous success,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. The former president on Thursday also put out a \"prebuttal\" video statement, mostly hitting Biden over immigration and border security.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHow long is SOTU?\n\nLast year, President Biden spoke for one hour and 13 minutes according to UC Santa Barbara's \"American Presidency Project.\" The shortest State of the Union address (00:28:55) was given by President Richard Nixon in 1972. Bill Clinton gave the longest-ever State of the Union address (01:28:49) in 2000.\n\nMore than a speech:5 things Biden really needs to do in the State of the Union\n\nIt's not just what he'll say to a joint session of Congress Thursday. It's also how he looks and sounds to perhaps his biggest TV audience of the year.\n\n− Carli Pierson\n\nWhat is the State of the Union? Why is it important?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nJerry said the State of the Union often provides a spotlight for the president to reference values such as unity or American innovation. She said it also provides a \"unique opportunity for Americans and people around the world to see how this checks and balances system of our government works.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/county/2023/11/20/texas-state-to-host-first-2024-presidential-debate/71656238007/", "title": "Texas State University to host first 2024 presidential debate", "text": "Texas State University will host the first 2024 U.S. presidential debate in September, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Monday morning. This is the first time a presidential debate will be hosted in the Lone Star State.\n\nThe Sept. 16 debate will be the first of four ahead of the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nTexas State is the only Texas university to have graduated a U.S. president. Former President Lyndon B. Johnson gradated in 1930 with a degree in history and a teaching certificate.\n\nTexas State has nearly 39,000 students, about 43% of whom are first generation students. The university is poised to become a Research 1 Carnegie level university by 2027 after Texas voters earlier this month approved Proposition 5 — a new research fund for four state universities, including Texas State.\n\nKelly Damphousse, who became Texas State's president in July 2022, said that hosting a presidential debate was a goal of his from his first week on the job. He said he believes Texas State was chosen due to its legacy with Lyndon Johnson and its facilities.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“Texas State looks a lot like the state of Texas demographically. We are almost all Texas students here, more than 95%,” he said. “And so I think in many ways we look like a great opportunity for them. Not just our facilities, not just our campus, but just the entire story must have looked attractive to them.”\n\nThe debate will be held in the Strand Arena, the school's events center. Hundreds of media outlets and attendees are expected to come.\n\nDamphousse said the university is dedicating $5 million to prepare for and run the debate, including updating infrastructure, facilities, Wi-Fi and electrical feeds around the arena. The university will call on private donors to help fund these improvements, he said.\n\nHe said the presidential debate is expected to cause a “huge economic spike” for San Marcos.\n\n“It really is a partnership with the city of San Marcos and the university,” Damphousse said. “But we also know that this is a unique opportunity for us, and we want to make sure that not just our campus, but our city, the Hill Country of Texas, the entire state of Texas is represented well by this opportunity.”\n\nEric Algoe, executive vice president for operations and chief financial officer at Texas State, said the debate host application process involved hundreds of pages.\n\n“It’s akin to the Super Bowl,” Algoe said.\n\nDamphousse said the university hopes to involve all students, though not all students will be able to attend the debate. He said there will be other events in the weeks leading up to it for students to take part in.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates is the nonprofit, nonpartisan group that produces all presidential debates. It has existed since 1987 solely to organize the debates.\n\nFrank Fahrenkopf, co-chair and co-founder of the commission, said Texas State was chosen after it submitted a bid to host. Each year the commission tries to pick a school from the East, West, Midwest and South, he said, after the Secret Service and the commission’s team of experts evaluate the sites.\n\n“We send out requests to most of the colleges and universities in the country who would be interested in hosting the debates and we get in (bids),” Fahrenkopf said. “The folks that came back from (Texas State) were really delighted with the campus, the people at the campus we're going to work on the project, the facilities, etc., and so it was one that made the final cut.”\n\nFahrenkopf said this will provide a great opportunity for Texas State to gain more prominence.\n\n“It puts their school on the map a little bit more nationally and internationally,” he said. “And plus, it's a marvelous opportunity for the students who participate and see what's happening right on campus with the presidential candidates.”\n\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, debates were held with limited audiences, so this will be the first after the pandemic with a full house. Typically, about a third of the tickets will be split between the hosting school and the commission, Fahrenkopf said. Students also tend to get involved by working the event, he said.\n\nThe other debates will be held Oct. 1 at Virginia State University and Oct. 9 at the University of Utah. Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., will hold the vice presidential debate Sept. 25. Three of the universities are hosting for the first time this year, Fahrenkopf said.\n\nThe 2020 debates were held at universities in Ohio, Miami and Nashville, Tenn.\n\nJon Taylor, a University of Texas at San Antonio political science professor and chair of that department, said that “it makes perfect sense” for Texas to host one of the debates.\n\n“We're at the forefront of American politics,\" Taylor said. \"We have tremendous influence on the way that politics works in this country and governance works in this country, be it on issues such as immigration or abortion.\"\n\nTexas will vote in the presidential primary to help decide each party's nominee on Super Tuesday, March 5. Incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are both running for their party’s nomination and are the current front-runners.\n\nOther presidential candidates can qualify for the debate if they have at least 15% support in national polls. Fahrenkopf said the last third-party candidate to qualify was Ross Perot from Texas in 1992. This year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer who is the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, is running as an independent candidate.\n\nWith a year left before U.S. voters pick their next president, it remains to be seen who will win each party's nomination and who will make the debate stage.\n\n“We don't yet know whether President Biden will agree to debate, or if Donald Trump would participate to debate or whoever may replace them,” Fahrenkopf said. “The president's numbers don't look good. And Trump is not the most popular guy that’s ever lived. We don't what's going to happen. So we’ll just wait and see.”\n\nAdditional reporting by staff writer Hogan Gore.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/21/trump-leads-gop-field-iowa-poll/70639433007/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Donald Trump holds commanding lead in first test of 2024 ...", "text": "© Copyright 2023, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nDonald Trump holds a commanding lead over the rest of the 2024 Republican presidential field in Iowa — and a more than 2-to-1 lead over his closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — with about five months to Caucus Day, a new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nThe poll of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers comes as the former president grapples with the fallout of a fourth criminal indictment and a pack of other top contenders prepares to gather for a high-stakes GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\nAmong those likely caucusgoers, 42% say they plan to support Trump — a lead of 23 percentage points over DeSantis, who is at 19%. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina follows in third place with 9%.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy follows with 4%.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe poll finds many indicators of Trump’s strength, but the race is not settled and may be “closer than it may first seem,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducted the poll.\n\nMore:See where presidential candidates are campaigning in Iowa\n\nSixty-three percent of likely GOP caucusgoers say they support Trump as their first or second choice in the caucuses or are actively considering him. That footprint is on par with the 61% who say the same for DeSantis.\n\nPlenty could shift by Caucus Day on Jan. 15.\n\nA majority, or 52%, of likely GOP caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate, while 40% say their minds are made up. Seven percent do not have a first-choice candidate.\n\nIn addition, just 7% of poll respondents say they are considering only one candidate for president. Seventeen percent say they are considering two candidates; 19% say three; and 55%, four or more.\n\nThe poll of 406 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 13-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nIt is the Iowa’s Poll’s first test of the field of 14 Republican candidates vying for their party’s chance to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nIn addition to the top contenders, seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nThey include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is at 2%, and former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, who has 1%.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Binkley, conservative radio host Larry Elder, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez all register below 1%.\n\nAs they think about which candidate to support, 65% of poll respondents say it’s most important to find a candidate who comes closest to their own views on issues, while 29% say it’s most important to pick a candidate who has the best chance of defeating Biden.\n\nDonald Trump’s legal challenges may be helping him in Iowa\n\nEven as Trump faces mounting legal troubles, his support appears only to grow.\n\nA grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump Aug. 15 for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election there.\n\nThe Iowa Poll, which was conducted Aug. 13-17, showed greater support for Trump in the days after the indictment was unveiled.\n\nIn the days before the indictment, Trump led DeSantis 38% to 20%. In the days after, his lead grew to 43% over DeSantis’ 18%.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint, combining his first-choice support, second choice and those actively considering him, also increased 12 percentage points after the Georgia indictment was announced — from 55% to 67%.\n\nDonald Trump leads, but Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott have room to grow\n\nAlthough Trump leads overall, the poll measures candidates’ full footprint of support in Iowa, where caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by Caucus Day.\n\nThe footprint adds together those who say the candidate is their first choice for president, those who say the candidate is their second choice and those who are actively considering supporting the candidate.By that measure, about as many likely GOP caucusgoers are considering DeSantis as are considering Trump.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint includes the 42% who say he is their first choice for president, 10% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him. That’s 63%, or nearly two-thirds of likely Republican caucusgoers, who are considering caucusing for Trump.\n\nDeSantis’ support includes the 19% who name him as their first choice, 20% who say he is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering him — totaling 61%.\n\nScott is the only other candidate whose Iowa footprint tops 50%.\n\nIn addition to the 9% who say Scott is their first choice for president, 15% say he is their second choice and 29% say they are actively considering him. That gives him an Iowa footprint of 53%.\n\nHaley’s Iowa footprint totals 40%, Ramaswamy’s is 34% and Pence’s is 31%.\n\nSelzer said other candidates have the opportunity to gain on Trump and turn people who are actively considering them into firm supporters, but “there’s a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrump’s support is more firmly locked in than DeSantis’; 66% of those who name Trump as their first choice say their minds are made up, while 34% say they could be persuaded to support someone else.\n\nFor DeSantis, it’s nearly the inverse, with 31% who say their minds are made up and 69% who could be persuaded.\n\nMore:Donald Trump, at Iowa fair, woos crowds, rebuffs 'wise guy' question on taking plea deal\n\nTrump also leads DeSantis among self-identified Republicans, the core of caucusgoers, 51% to 20%.\n\nAmong those who say they will be attending their first caucus in January, Trump leads the Florida governor 47% to 18%.\n\nAnd among evangelicals, an influential group in Iowa that’s often key to a caucus win, Trump leads with 47% who say he is their first choice for president. He’s followed by DeSantis, who gets 20% of evangelicals and Scott who gets 7%.\n\nPhil Marchand, a 42-year-old Sergeant Bluffs resident and poll respondent, said he caucused for Trump ahead of the 2016 election and has been “on the Trump train” ever since.\n\nMarchand is steadfast in his support for Trump in the current election cycle. He said he considered other Republican candidates, including DeSantis and Scott, but ultimately decided to caucus again for the former president come January.\n\n“The more time I spend listening to DeSantis and the more I listen to the things Trump is saying, the more I think that it has to be (Trump). It can’t be anyone else,” he said.\n\nMore:Trump is wrestling with 5 big legal cases. Here's how they may collide with the campaign calendar.\n\nMarchand said he appreciates Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy and his efforts to grow the economy and jobs.\n\nIf Trump does not receive the Republican nomination, Marchand said he would likely register as an independent and vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nIndependent caucusgoers could be ‘the way in’ for Trump challengers\n\nAmong independents, Trump and DeSantis are nearly evenly split, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nAnother 13% of independents support Scott, 12% support Christie, 10% support Haley and 6% each support Pence and Ramaswamy. No other candidate tops 5% with independents.\n\nSelf-identified independents who say they will likely caucus with Republicans make up 25% of the poll’s respondents.\n\n“To me, that's a little bit of something to be paying attention to,” Selzer said. “Because we've seen this happen in the past. A non-Trump candidate could say, 'I've got to get people to come to the caucus who are outside of the GOP base.’ So, if a candidate can grow the people who are coming to the caucuses, that is the way in, because Trump is strong with that base.”\n\nBrian Alstrom, a 48-year-old independent voter and poll respondent, said he would consider caucusing in January — if it looks like some of the candidates opposing Trump have a chance.\n\n“I did vote for him both times because it was the lesser of two evils,” Alstrom said of Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. “But it was hard to even listen to him speak. I’m just done with him. Hopefully I don’t have to vote for him again, because I’m not going to vote for Joe Biden.”\n\nAlstrom, who is a Dorchester resident, said he’s soured on Trump’s personal approach to managing conflicts and his combative attitude. He said DeSantis is his top choice for president, followed by Scott.\n\nIn DeSantis, Alstrom sees an appealing candidate with a “common sense approach” to issues that are important to him, such as the economy and national security.\n\n“Florida speaks for itself in how successful they’ve been,” he said. “... I’d love to see that transfer to the rest of our country.”\n\nDonald Trump has never been viewed favorably by more Iowa Republican caucusgoers\n\nSince his presidency ended and as he has mounted a third campaign for the White House, Trump has been criminally indicted four times, has attacked Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s popular Republican governor, and has held relatively few campaign events in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nAnd yet, Trump has never been viewed favorably by more of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers than he is now, the Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn August 2015, Trump was viewed favorably by 61% and unfavorably by 35% — his best showing among likely GOP caucusgoers during the 2016 caucus cycle. Trump went on to finish second in Iowa’s Republican caucuses behind U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nMore:Candidates try to clear GOP debate fundraising hurdles. Is it changing their Iowa strategy?\n\nNow, Trump is viewed favorably by 65%. That includes 42% who view him “very favorably” — the best showing of any of the 2024 candidates. Another 33% view him unfavorably, and 2% are not sure.\n\nTrump’s best showing is among self-identified Republicans, with 77% viewing him favorably and 21% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHe also does well with those who make less than $70,000 a year (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable) and among evangelicals (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable).\n\nDeSantis’ overall favorability numbers are about on par with Trump’s.\n\nThe Florida governor is viewed favorably by 66% of likely GOP caucusgoers and unfavorably by 29%. Another 5% are not sure.\n\nAmong self-identified Republicans, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 74% and unfavorably by 21% — numbers that are about equal to Trump’s.\n\nMore:Republican presidential candidates woo Iowa's pivotal evangelicals to pry them away from Trump\n\nPoll respondent Rick Williams, a 72-year-old Holstein resident and self-identified Republican, said he considers himself a Trump supporter and believes the former president is being unfairly targeted in the series of criminal indictments that have been unveiled this year.\n\nStill, he plans to support someone else in the caucuses. Right now, he prefers DeSantis.\n\n“Trump supporters are going to support him no matter what if he's the nominee,” Williams said. “But we need the independents. We can't win with just us. We've got to get the independents, and I don't know if he can swing them.”\n\nThe Florida governor has higher favorability ratings with independents than Trump: 52% view him favorably, and 43% view him unfavorably.\n\nMore:Mike Pence is asking Iowans to choose him for president. Some say Jan. 6 is 'holding him back'\n\nFor Trump, it’s the inverse: 44% of independents view him favorably, while a majority, 53%, view him unfavorably.\n\nWilliams, a semi-retired paramedic, said Scott is currently his second-choice candidate.\n\nScott is viewed favorably by 59% and unfavorably by 17%. But a higher percentage — 24% — are unsure, indicating they don’t know enough about him to say one way or the other.\n\nGenevieve Hefel, a 63-year-old Dubuque resident and poll respondent, said she voted for Trump in the 2020 election but has felt her support for the former president wane.\n\nBecause of the recent indictments, Hefel, a retired Army sergeant, said she believes there’s “too much noise” around Trump for him to be able to defeat a Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nHefel said she’s still considering other Republican contenders in the race, but she’s drawn to Scott’s “positive message and Christian beliefs” and plans to caucus for him.\n\n“He's able to carry on a conversation to get his point across without having to be ignorant or raise his voice,” Hefel said, reflecting on an interview she saw Scott give recently. “He handled it very professionally and calmly, and I thought he made very good points.”\n\nScott does best with those age 55 and older, with 70% viewing him favorably and 16% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHaley is viewed favorably by 53% and unfavorably by 26%. Another 21% are not sure.\n\nMike Pence, Chris Christie among those with highest unfavorable ratings\n\nSeven candidates are underwater, meaning more likely Republican caucusgoers view them unfavorably than favorably.\n\nThey include Binkley (12% favorable, 21% unfavorable), Hurd (13%-22%), Hutchinson (20%-32%), Johnson (18%-22%) and Suarez (12%-23%).\n\nPence is viewed favorably by 42% and unfavorably by 53%, with 5% who aren’t sure. Even though he’s underwater, a plurality — 33% — say they have a “mostly” favorable view of the former vice president.\n\nBut he holds no advantage with evangelicals, despite his efforts to highlight his own faith and connect with Iowa’s religious conservatives: 43% view him favorably and 51% view him unfavorably — numbers that mirror his overall favorability numbers.\n\nAmong all the candidates, Christie is viewed unfavorably by the greatest share of poll respondents, with 60% saying they view him unfavorably, including 31% who view him “very” unfavorably. Another 28% say they view him favorably and 12% say they’re not sure.\n\nNo 2024 presidential candidate performs better than Iowa’s own Republican elected officials.\n\nReynolds commands the highest numbers, with 81% viewing her favorably (including 50% who view her very favorably), 18% who view her unfavorably and 1% who are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is viewed favorably by 73%, unfavorably by 22%, and 5% are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 406 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/biden-laws-passed-priorities-to-get-done-executive-orders/index.html", "title": "5 significant bills and 5 executive orders Biden signed in his first ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden took the oath of office a year ago with the country facing challenges not seen in generations.\n\nOn top of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the new President inherited an economy that had crumbled as Covid-19 cases rose and a nation so divided that his predecessors supporters had stormed the US Capitol two weeks prior in a bid to stop his ascent. Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/27/gop-republican-debate-live-updates/70982273007/", "title": "Republican debate highlights: UAW strike, a government shutdown ...", "text": "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — Republican presidential candidates gathered in California on Wednesday for the second GOP primary debate of the 2024 election season.\n\nThe seven candidates who qualified for the event in Simi Valley battled over issues ranging from abortion rights in American to the war in Ukraine and healthcare costs. The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here,\" DeSantis said.\n\nChris Christie: Kick Donald Trump 'off the island'\n\nNone of the Republican debaters wanted to vote one of their fellow candidates \"off the island,\" though Chris Christie suggested running Donald Trump out of the GOP primary.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families all over this country,\" Christie said. \"He needs to be taken out of this process.\"\n\nOther candidates balked at the last question of the evening, one borrowed from the game show \"Survivor:\" Who would you vote \"off the island.\"\n\nDeSantis voiced his objection, calling it \"disrespectful\" to the candidates who showed up to the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRon DeSantis takes on Donald Trump over abortion\n\n“He should be here,” Ron DeSantis said of Donald Trump during Wednesday's debate, calling on the former president to explain his stance on abortion.\n\nTrump recently called the Florida governor’s six-week abortion ban “a terrible mistake” and refused to state his position on a federal ban, while on NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nDeSantis, who has also fielded criticism from anti-abortion advocates for not taking a strong enough national abortion stance, called out Democrats for what he said are extremist abortion rights positions.\n\n“We’re better off when everybody counts,” he said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Bring it, Tim:' South Carolina candidates Haley, Scott argue about experience\n\nThe two South Carolina candidates in this race went after each other over who has the better experience: Former Gov. Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n– David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia’s war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to “level with the American people” on the issue.\n\n“Just because…Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,” he said, bringing up the country’s ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, “A win for Russia is a win for China.” She added, “But I forgot, you like China.”\n\nRamaswamy hit back that “hurling personal insults” were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a “greenlight” to China to invade Taiwan. “Peace comes through strength,” Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n“This is where President Trump went wrong,” Haley said. “He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don’t know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‘I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American’\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said “I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.”\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n“We've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,” Pence said. “You empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida’s new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a “hoax” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida’s other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n“Florida is showing how it’s done,” DeSantis said, boasting his administration’s focus parents’ rights and having “eliminated critical race theory.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‘honey, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.’\n\n“Why is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?” Haley said. “When I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there’s two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n“It is our job to make sure that never happens,” Ramaswamy said. “But it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox.

It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the “spirit” of Tim Scott’s comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n“I understand that hardship is not a choice,” Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes “victimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can’t fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn’t think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n“What I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing — showing up,” Scott told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right – and wrong\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in California will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nAnd one of the sponsors of the debate is the Fox Business Network, so expect a lot of discussion of the economy. You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden’s border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He’ll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‘vice presidential debate at best’\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. At least that’s how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” he told CBS News. “This is the JV team.”\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday’s discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is “running away” with the primary in every poll.\n\n“This is the XFL, and it’s entertainment, I guess,” he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president − and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn’t given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n“I think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,” he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion’s harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley’s comments during the event, saying abortion is “a moral issue.”\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate − she certainly garnered the best reviews − and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn’t alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn’t allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump’s four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him – while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. “It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. – John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country’s future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But the debate also got personal, with Republican hopefuls targeting Ramaswamy’s lack of political experience, Haley’s perspective on abortion restrictions in the U.S. and more.\n\nDonald Trump did not participate in the event, instead opting for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitical groups divide their forces between Trump speech, non-Trump debate\n\nSome political interest groups seem more interested in Donald Trump’s speech in Michigan this week than in the challengers' debate in California.\n\nFor example: American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group, financed a plane to fly over the site of Trump's union event with a banner saying \"Trump Sold Us Out.\"\n\n“It’s obvious that, barring something drastic, Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee next year,\" said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century. \"The Republicans on the debate stage know that, too.\"\n\nGroups that flooded Milwaukee for the first Republican debate are not much in evidence in Simi Valley, though the Reagan library is a fairly remote location compared to Wisconsin's Fiserv Forum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere is the second Republican debate?\n\nThe seven Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Simi Valley, California, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nNorthwest of Los Angeles, the library opened in 1991 with a ceremony that at the time boasted the largest ever gathering of former presidents and their families. The site is also the final resting place for the 40th president and his wife, Nancy Reagan.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not debating?\n\nNo, Donald Trump won’t go head-to-head with his Republican rivals on Wednesday night.\n\nInstead, Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, is traveling to Michigan to speak with supporters in a battleground state. It's also the epicenter of the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, where workers are protesting the nation's largest auto companies.\n\nTrump also skipped the first Republican debate last month, explaining that he didn’t want to give opponents free shots at him.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nFox's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino, UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón are moderating\n\nFox News Media's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino and UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón will co-moderate the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nCalderón will be the first Afro-Latina to moderate a Republican Primary Debate, according to the network.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nGOP debate participants\n\nSeven Republican candidates are expected to participate in the Wednesday debate: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who qualified for the first GOP debate last month, did not make the stage this time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson did not qualify for the first or second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow to watch the Republican debate tonight? What channel is it on?\n\nFox Business Network and Univision will broadcast the second Republican presidential primary debate. It will air at will air at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe RNC will also stream the event on video-sharing platform Rumble.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nWhen does the Republican debate start?\n\nThe second GOP presidential primary debate will take place Wednesday, Sept. 27, will air at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe Republican candidates are set take the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, California on Wednesday as they continue vying for their party’s nomination in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nFox Business Network and Univision will broadcast the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\n– Anthony Robledo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/23/republican-gop-debate-live-updates/70653558007/", "title": "Republican debate recap: Highlights as GOP candidates face off", "text": "Eight Republican presidential candidates battled Wednesday over Ukraine, abortion and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as they gathered in Milwaukee for their first primary debate of the 2024 cycle.\n\nWith frontrunner Donald Trump absent, Vivek Ramaswamy took a lot of heat, with Mike Pence calling him a \"rookie\" and Chris Christie attacking him as an \"amateur.\"\n\nAs other candidates criticized Ramaswamy’s lack of experience, the Republican entrepreneur said his business background was a better asset to lead a \"revolution” and pitched himself as some who could offer a new generation of leadership.\n\nNikki Haley ripped into Ramaswamy for saying that the United States should cede eastern Ukraine to Putin. “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows,” she said.\n\nTrump’s name finally came up about an hour into the debate: The candidates were asked : Would you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\nWould you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection. Mike Pence got backup for the issue that has been the biggest weight on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021 as Trump wanted.\n\nRepublican hopefuls make their pitch to voters\n\nDuring a 14-minute discussion, most of the GOP candidates said they would still support Trump, even if he is convicted of crimes and still wins the Republican nomination. They also said GOP voters are tiring of all the drama surrounding the former president.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTwo GOP candidates, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, again said that Trump's indictments disqualify him from leadership of the party or nation.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd at a sports arena in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nOn the stage in Milwaukee, most of the attacks went against businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, an upstart who has seen his poll numbers rise. Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn’t need a president who’s too old, or a president who’s too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n“We need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,” Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n“There’s a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,” she said, later adding, “Parents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.”\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: “The job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he’d freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy “if we do the giveaway that you want to” and give Putin eastern Ukraine, “it's not going to be too long” before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n“You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,” Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did – though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would’ve done what he did.\n\n“Answer the question,” Pence said.\n\n“Mike did his duty,” DeSantis responded. “I’ve got no beef with him.”\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, “not grudging credit.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump’s two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence’s exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don’t support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a “pro-life” candidate, but there isn’t a uniform standard.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn’t having it.\n\n“Nikki, you’re my friend,” Pence said, “but consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n“It’s a moral issue,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in − and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‘A guy who sounds like ChatGPT’\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn’t hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n“I’ve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here…” Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n“The last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur,” Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n“This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,’” Haley said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n“I don’t think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,” Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he’ll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn’t having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n“The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,” she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n“You tell me who are the big spenders,” she said. “I think it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won’t spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n“Fight it out,” Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‘I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves’\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire’s crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n“I’m open to hearing somebody change my mind,” said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n“I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves,” Biel said, adding he’s open to “people who I disagree with.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n– Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‘softball’ interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a “softball” interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n“In his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he’s running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his “broken promises” to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely “double down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.”\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court’s decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data?

Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president’s record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump’s campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n“President Trump has already won this evening’s debate because everything is going to be about him,” Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n“In fact, tonight’s Republican undercard event really shouldn’t even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump’s team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there’s a good chance they’ll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire “Ending Inflation” plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts – entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week “three hours of solid debate prep” – to the basketball courts – North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O’Donnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy” in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he “will share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.”\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate − advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that’s where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the “most dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war” and said it’s clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, “but if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.”\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan – but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for “some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson’s campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren’t accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n“I am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,” Suarez wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates’ position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n“Every Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,” Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn’t the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n“It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‘as much as I can’ of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight’s Republican primary debate.\n\n“I’m going to try to see — get as much as I can, yes,” Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. “I have none,” he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden’s reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme “MAGA” Republican Party.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. “You can’t stop the Trump Train,” senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon “walk through” said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n– Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024. Out of the last six presidential elections, four have been decided by less than one percentage point in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debate will be held ahead of the Republican National Convention, which is also set to take place in the city next year.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nHow can you watch the Republican debate?\n\nThe first Republican primary debate is scheduled for Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe debate, hosted by Fox News, will air on Fox News Channel as well as Fox Business Network.

It's set to last two hours until 11 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n– Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/politics/american-politicians-old/index.html", "title": "One thing Americans agree on? Our politicians are too old. | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe President of the United States is 79 years old.\n\nThe speaker of the House is 82 years old.\n\nThe Senate majority leader is 71 years old.\n\nThe average age of a US senator at the start of 2021 was 64.3 – the oldest in American history.\n\nWhile the American public doesn’t agree on much, they do agree on this: Our politicians are simply too old.\n\nA new CBS News poll shows that almost three in four Americans (73%) think there should be some sort of maximum age limit placed on elected officials. Support for such an age limit is consistent across party lines. Seven in ten Democrats (71%) are on board, as are three quarters of Republicans and independents. Support is also remarkably consistent among age groups. Interestingly, the youngest group in the survey – those ages 18-29 – are least in favor of maximum age limits (68%), while three quarters of all other age cohorts back them.\n\nWhat should the age cutoff be to serve in office? The most common answer among the choices presented in the CBS poll was 70 years old, with 4 in 10 Americans picking that option. One in 4 (26%) said 60 should be the oldest someone can be to hold elected office, while 18% said 80 should be the limit.\n\nThis is not, of course, some pie-in-the-sky discussion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, as I noted above, is 79 years old. He will turn 82 shortly after the 2024 election. He is already the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president.\n\nThat has led to skepticism, including from members of his own party, that he should seek a second term.\n\n“My hunch is that we need new leadership across the board – Democrats, Republicans, I think it’s time for a generational move,’ Ohio Democratic Senate nominee Tim Ryan said recently when asked if Biden should run for reelection.\n\nA slew of polling conducted over the summer showed that large swaths of the country also raised doubts about Biden running for another term, with some survey respondents citing his age.\n\n“The presidency is too hard, physically, on anybody that’s there,” Jean Davis, an 87-year-old Iowa resident told the Des Moines Register in July of Biden. “He might have it mentally. But, physically, I don’t think he’s capable.”\n\n“I’m just going to come out and say it: I want younger blood,” Nicole Farrier, a 38-year-old Michigan resident, told The New York Times in July. “I am so tired of all old people running our country. I don’t want someone knocking on death’s door.”\n\nAs the Times put it in a separate story:\n\n“Mr. Biden looks older than just a few years ago, a political liability that cannot be solved by traditional White House stratagems like staff shake-ups or new communications plans. His energy level, while impressive for a man of his age, is not what it was, and some aides quietly watch out for him. He often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump sought to make Biden’s age and mental acuity an issue during the 2020 campaign – and has continued to do so since losing that race. “This guy doesn’t have a clue,” Trump said ahead of their first 2020 debate. “He doesn’t know where the hell he is. This guy doesn’t know he’s alive.” Trump, it’s worth noting, is no spring chicken at 76 years old as he eyes another potential White House bid.\n\nBiden has hit forcefully back against those sorts of attacks. “Watch me, Mr. President. Watch me,” Biden said in August 2020. “Look at us both. Look at us both, what we say, what we do, what we control, what we know, what kind of shape we’re in. Come on.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, following Biden’s annual physical last fall, his physician said the President “remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”\n\nEven below the presidential level, the question of age has come to the fore in recent months. Last spring, the San Francisco Chronicle published a lengthy piece detailing the alleged mental decline of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 89 years old. The article included these lines:\n\n“Four U.S. senators, including three Democrats, as well as three former Feinstein staffers and the California Democratic member of Congress told The Chronicle in recent interviews that her memory is rapidly deteriorating. They said it appears she can no longer fulfill her job duties without her staff doing much of the work required to represent the nearly 40 million people of California.”\n\nFeinstein subsequently told the Chronicle’s editorial board that she was “puzzled” by the reporting, noting: “I meet regularly with leaders.

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainment/music/coachella/2024/04/11/coachella-2024-live-updates/73293383007/", "title": "Coachella Weekend 1 live updates: Beyoncé banner mystery, Peso ...", "text": "The 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is about to kick off Friday with Lana Del Rey as headliner and rumors are running rampant of a possible guest appearance by her collaborator-friend Taylor Swift.

Who's to say what might happen between now and then?\n\nFollow The Desert Sun's live team coverage all weekend long for the latest on celebrity sightings, special guest performances, weather, traffic, music reviews and more.\n\nCoachella traffic: What Palm Springs roads are closed?\n\nWeekend 1 of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is in the books, and many festivalgoers will be starting their trek home today. Drivers should expect delays later in the morning on Interstate 10, one main artery in Palm Springs remains closed after the windstorm Sunday:\n\nNorth Indian Canyon Drive at the wash, from Sunrise Parkway to Palm Springs Station Road.\n\nThe Joy, 21 Savage, Teezo Touchdown surprise guest for Doja Cat's Coachella headlining set\n\nDoja Cat opened her Sunday set with five powerful male backup singers who most of us don't know, but we sure do now. The men are from a South African acapella group called The Joy, and after hearing them sing “Shutcho” with Doja, we hope they only grow in notoriety.\n\nThe first famous special guest of Doja's Sunday headlining set was 21 Savage, who came out to perform “n.h.i.e.” Teezo Touchdown then emerged during “MASC” in spiked football shoulder pads before Doja finally acknowledged the crowd nearly an hour into the set while carrying what appeared to be a bottle of whiskey.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nDo Lab ends Coachella Weekend 1 with not-so-surprising guests Bonobo and Barry Can’t Swim\n\nAnd the surprise is… Bonobo and Barry Can’t Swim. Goldenvoice threw a little mystery into Sunday when the set list in its app included what was labeled only as a surprise set. Shortly before it was set to begin, the app was updated to explain that DJs Bonobo and Barry Can’t Swim would be playing the set together. Barry Can't Swim performed in the Gobi tent earlier in the evening Sunday, so it wasn't that shocking to see him come out for a back-to-back set with Bobono at 10:45 p.m.\n\nWhile it wasn’t as cool as Billie Eilish’s surprise Do Lab set from yesterday, it was surely still (electronic) music to the ears of those looking to get in some final beats before the festival ends.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nEnd-of-the-night Coachella special guests include Robin S, Peso Pluma and Kodak Black for DJ Snake, Big Sean for Jhené Aiko\n\nDJ Snake's Sunday night set in the Sahara tent included three special guests: Robin S, Peso Pluma and Kodak Black. Kodak Black sang \"Tunnel Vision,\" and Peso Pluma came out to sing a brand-new collab with the DJ.\n\nThere was a rumor cirulating online that Lisa of BLACKPINK was going to come out as a surprise guest for DJ Snake as well, but she did not. However, a video of the two supposidly meeting backstage after his performance is going viral on Twitter, and many fans are speculating that she was meant to perform, but arrived late, or DJ Snake went over time and was told not to have her come out. Neither rumor has been confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Outdoor Theatre stage, rapper Big Sean came out as a guest for his longtime partner, Jhené Aiko, who he's been dating and collaborating on music with since 2016.\n\n— Ema Sasic and Niki Kottmann\n\nWill Smith comes out during J Balvin's Coachella set to sing 'Men in Black'\n\nThe trippy otherworldly space visuals that provided an undeniably epic backdrop (perhaps the best of the festival so far) for J Balvin’s set took on newfound thematic significance when the Reggaeton star brought out the iconic rapper and actor Will Smith Sunday.\n\nWill Smith appeared as a literal man in black as he was dressed in the clean-cut suit and sunglasses of his character from the famous '90s film and received a rapturous welcome from the crowd that only grew more excited as he began rapping to the movie’s iconic theme song.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nKhruangbin offers Coachella guests a place for good vibes and good jams\n\nKhruangbin’s Outdoor Theater performance Sunday night was full of hazy, feel-good vibes as the festival began to wind down. During the hour-long set, the trio of Laura Lee Ochoa (bass), Mark Speer (guitar) and DJ Johnson (drums) didn’t stop playing, and seamlessly transitioned between songs that sounded like a spaghetti western soundtrack with funk, surf rock and psychedelic rock.\n\nDuring the handful of tunes when Speer and Ochoa sang, the vocals were drenched in effects. The catchy song “Time (You and I)” felt like being in the world’s largest discotheque as many in the audience began dancing.\n\nThere were no guest appearances, but since the trio has worked with Leon Bridges — who is performing at the Stagecoach country music festival April 17 — there's a hopeful possibility he may be a surprise for next weekend.\n\nFor those leaving the festival early or looking to recharge before DJ Snake, J. Balvin and Doja Cat’s sets, Khruangbin was the perfect performance to catch.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nCoachella's Heineken House quickly reaches capacity ahead of Lupe Fiasco set\n\nIf the first weekend of Coachella has taught us anything, it’s that people still want to hear hits from the early 2000s.\n\nOne day after many fans grew frustrated by long lines to enter the Heineken House stage area for T-Pain, a similar situation unfolded Sunday to enter the branded area to see \"The Show Goes On\" rapper Lupe Fiasco. Just like yesterday, a lengthy line was already visible about half an hour before the 7:15 set was scheduled to start. That line seemed to have more than doubled in size by the time the set started, with hoards of more generally frustrated people still arriving even as others gave up and left for other easier-to-access stages. While the line was moving at a decent clip as of 7:25, it seemed clear many of the people in it would likely not get in (unless the set flopped and sent people toward the exits prematurely).\n\nAdding to the frustration and confusion was that the branded area requires a 21-and-up wristband, which many people did not seem to realize until they had already waited for a while. The clear lesson: Coachella should book more early and mid 2000s throwbacks (Ludacris, anyone?) and put them on bigger stages.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nBebe Rexha, David Guetta turn Coachella into 'biggest club in the world'\n\nSinger-songwriter Bebe Rexha has collaborated with plenty of artists over the years, but her heart seems to lie with French DJ David Guetta the most. It came as no surprise then, although fans were still delighted, that she welcomed Guetta on stage toward the end of her Coachella set. Their latest collaboration, \"I'm Good (Blue),\" was a huge dance hit last year, and Guetta said they were going to turn Coachella into \"the biggest club in the world,\" which got the crowd screaming and jumping around.\n\nThe DJ also took time to praise Rexha. He shared that he heard her singing in a recording studio years ago and her voice impressed him so much that he asked her to help him with a record. Since then, he's watched her go from a songwriter to a touring artist.\n\n\"I've been seeing you work so hard, and not many people can sing like you,\" Guetta said. \"I want to say I'm so proud of you and I love you.\"\n\n— Ema Sasic\n\nYG Marley brings out his mom, Lauryn Hill, and Busta Rhymes during Coachella set\n\nMany of us scratched our heads when we saw YG Marley, grandson of Bob Marley, was getting his own set on the Coachella Stage on Sunday. The vocalist has only released one song (TikTok hit \"Praise Jah in the Moonlight\"), so his spot on the lineup — and coveted stage placement — made many people cry \"nepo baby\" online, but the rumors that he'd bring out some famous family and friends proved true, which made the set an unforgettable one.\n\nFugees member Lauryn Hill, YG Marley's mother, joined her son onstage after he performed unreleased tracks \"Marching to Freedom\" and \"Running to a Solution,\" singing \"Ex-Factor\" and \"Lost Ones.\"\n\n\"So YG, before you were born, we used to do something like this,\" Hill said, before launching into \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\" and welcoming fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean. They then performed \"Fu-Gee-La\" together.\n\nBusta Rhymes came to the stage to perform two songs, \"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See,\" and his verse from \"Look At Me Now.\" He was joined by Spliff Star.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nCrowd goes wild as Reneé Rapp brings out Kesha, girlfriend Towa Bird during Coachella set\n\nThere's nothing like watching your favorite singer of the moment at one of Coachella's biggest stages — crushing it, mind you — and then reaching a new level of ecstasy when she brings out a special guest you never would have predicted. That's exactly what happened for me and my fellow fans of Reneé Rapp during her debut Coachella set Sunday afternoon.\n\nFive songs into the already electric set, Rapp introduced a special guest with the words \"please welcome who I consider the hottest person ever, KESHA!\" The crowd of course roared, and the two broke into a duet of Kesha's iconic (or at least iconic for us millennials) 2010 banger \"TiK ToK.\" The 37-year-old songstress came out wearing a white tank with the words \"I Am Mother,\" and quickly proved that she is, indeed, Mother.\n\nThe best part? When Kesha changed the opening words to \"Wake up in the mornin' like f*** P Diddy\" instead of \"feelin like P Diddy,\" a clear reference to the rapper's rape and sexual assault accusations as well as recent home raid (on March 25, Homeland Security Investigations agents searched his Los Angeles and Miami homes as part of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation).\n\nKesha left the stage after \"TiK ToK,\" but a few songs later, Rapp brought out her rumored girlfriend Towa Bird, a fellow musician who opened for her throughout her recent Snow Hard Feelings Tour, to play the guitar on \"Tummy Hurts.\"\n\n— Niki Kottmann\n\nTaking Back Sunday proves they aren't stuck in the 2010s\n\nTaking Back Sunday? More like Taking Back Coachella. The emo-punk band’s Sunday afternoon set at the Mojave tent was packed and speaks to the resurgence of all things emo and pop-punk from the early 2000s.\n\nHalf the band appeared on stage in their Sunday best in brown suits, the others in brown trousers and black shirts. The 45-minute set started with “A Decade Under the Influence,” which is said to be about frontman Adam Lazzara attending a Coldplay concert with his ex-girlfriend.\n\nFans sang along to the lyrics of Taking Back Sunday’s songs “Amphetamine Smiles,” “You’re So Last Summer” and “You Can’t Look Back.” Many had their phones up taking pictures and videos, but more of the audience savored the melodic musicianship and lived in the moment.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nGrimes apologizes on X for issue-ridden Saturday Coachella set\n\nAfter a set that appeared to involve several equipment malfunctions Saturday (that, at points, saw her screaming in frustration into the mic), the Canadian musician Grimes published a lengthy apology for the technical issues on her X page (formerly Twitter) late Saturday night.\n\nIn an apology filled with technical terms and producing jargon, Grimes explained that she had chosen not to handle certain aspects of her production and now regrets that decision after several glitches occurred.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nThe man behind Desert Daze gets his Coachella moment with band jjuujjuu\n\nDesert Daze founder Phil Pirrone made his Coachella debut on Sunday in the Sonora tent with his Los Angeles-based band jjuujjuu. The early Sunday sets are tough to draw a crowd to, regardless of status in the music industry, but a decent crowd for the smaller Sonora tent turned out to see the band play its multifaceted rock music. Pirrone made no mention of Desert Daze, but he did ask how many were attending Coachella for the first time. Several hands went up, and he dedicated a song to them.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\n'Cowboy Carter' banner spotted above festival grounds on 6-year anniversary of 'Beychella'\n\nDo our eyes deceive us? A sky banner with the words \"Cowboy Carter,\" the name of Beyonce's latest album, was spotted above the festival grounds on Sunday. Does this mean Queen Bey herself will make a surprise appearance at the festival? We can only hope, especially because her pal Taylor Swift was spotted dancing and singing along at friends' sets on Saturday. It could also be a nod to her infamous Coachella performance, nicknamed \"Beychella,\" which occurred exactly six years ago to the day. We'll be on the lookout for any superstar wearing \"LEVII'S JEANS\" and report back.\n\n— Ema Sasic\n\nOrbital makes its mark with Coachella 2024 set\n\nAs Gesaffelstein’s catchy but abrasive DJ set at the Outdoor Theater ended and Tyler, the Creator took the Coachella Stage for his headlining set, the British electronic dance music duo Orbital took to the Gobi tent for the first time since 2010.\n\nSince founding in the late ‘80s, Orbital set itself apart from contemporaries by composing a dynamic techno and trance soundtrack for highlighting sociopolitical and environmental issues. One example of of this is the 2022 collaboration with Sleaford Mods, “Dirty Rat,” which was performed early in the set.\n\nAnother highlight was “Satan,” which began with an audio clip of a child talking to her father who tells her “If you see your mom this weekend, tell her ‘Satan.’” Images of recent social unrest and military dictators also flashed on the screens.\n\nBoth Hartnolls performed with lights on their heads, making them appear as robots at times.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nTyler, the Creator brings out Donald Glover, A$AP Rocky and Charlie Wilson during his headlining Coachella set\n\nMusician, actor and TV writer Donald Glover made a surprise appearance during Tyler, the Creator’s headlining set Saturday, coming on stage to help with a special duet version of “RUNNING OUT OF TIME” from the 2019 album, “Igor.” Tyler joked that he “used to hate” Glover before thanking him for his wide-ranging creative works.\n\nSoon after, rapper A$AP Rocky emerged onstage to perform his verse from their songs, “Potato Salad” and “Who Dat Boy,” to screams from the crowd.\n\nLater in the set, Charlie Wilson, the 71-year-old former lead vocalist of the Gap Band, joined Tyler onstage as another guest performer.\n\n— Tom Coulter\n\nSaint Levant speaks about Israel-Hamas war during Coachella set\n\nRapper Saint Levant is known for his advocacy for Palestinians and bringing attention to the Israel-Hamas war, which has resulted in the death of over 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza. He did so again on Saturday. Some fans had Palestinian flags and many were wearing keffiyeh, a traditional headdress in the Middle East that has become a symbol for Palestinian liberation and solidarity.\n\n“Coachella, my name is Saint Levant and I was born in Jerusalem and raised in Gaza,” he said. “As I hope all of you are aware, the people of Gaza have been undergoing a brutal, brutal genocide for the past six months. And the people of Palestine have been undergoing a brutal occupation for the past 75 years.”\n\nRead my full review here.\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nIce Spice doesn't bring out Taylor Swift but announces new album\n\nWith Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce in attendance, rapper and internet sensation Ice Spice delivered a high-energy, half-hour set at the Sahara tent on Saturday — ending the show with the announcement that her new album, “Y2K,” is dropping soon.\n\nThe New York rapper performed many of her viral hits, including “Deli,” “boy’s a liar, Pt. 2,” and “Barbie World (with Aqua),” and she also played a new untitled song, dancing and twerking every step of the way. While Swift didn’t perform, Ice Spice also played her verse from the “Karma” remix after giving her a shoutout.\n\nIce Spice closed with “Think You the S*** (Fart),” before a screen behind her declared the new album — which the rapper has teased in recent months — will be released soon, to cheers from the crowd.\n\n— Tom Coulter\n\nICYMI: Last Dinner Party looked and sounded great during Coachella set\n\nThe Last Dinner Party’s performance on Saturday transported the audience to Sunday prayer or a seance performed by a coven of witches. It was an enchanting set, showcasing songs from their debut album “Prelude to Ecstasy.”\n\nSome of the songs they performed included “Caesar on a TV Screen,” “My Lady of Mercy,” “Sinner” and their most popular, “Nothing Matters.” As a treat for their very first Coachella, they also performed the unreleased “Second Best.”\n\nBesides their music, the indie rock band also always brings their unearthly charm to fashion — past ensembles seemingly inspired by things like the Victorian era or a medieval romance novel. Saturday’s garments generally appeared to be themed around lace and added to their charismatic performance.\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nOlivia Rodrigo jumps onstage with No Doubt\n\nIn perhaps the most shocking twist of the day, No Doubt, a band that rose to prominence in the '90s, brought out the Queen of Gen Z pop, Olivia Rodrigo.\n\nRodrigo, wearing an I (heart) ND shirt, sang the No Doubt song “Bathwater” with Gwen Stefani to the delight of the crowd as cell phones flew in the air in unison to capture the moment. The magical moment no doubt — pun intended — made every Gen Zer (and some of us past our 20s) lose their minds.\n\n— Niki Kottmann and Shad Powers\n\nDesert Cahuilla Bird Singers make guest appearance with Blur on the Coachella Stage\n\nBlur’s set on the Coachella Stage Saturday night had a surprise local guest appearance by the Desert Cahuilla Bird Singers, who appeared at the festival in 2023 and 2022. The singers and dancers performed the songs “Bird Song” and “Death Of A Party” with the band and returned on stage for the final song “Tender.”\n\nRead my full review here and setlist here.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nBillie Eilish and brother FINNEAS jump onstage at the Do Lab\n\nIf there's one thing we learned this weekend, it's that seemingly every day at Coachella brings a new chance to see Billie Eilish. Less than 24 hours after her showstopping guest appearance onstage with Lana Del Rey, Eilish and collaborator (and brother) FINNEAS made a surprise appearance in the much smaller Do Lab, where they seemed to perform a couple unreleased electronic songs, one of which is called \"Lunch.\"\n\nThe famous siblings, who won the Academy Award for Best Original Song earlier this year for \"Barbie\" soundtrack hit \"What Was I Made For?\" (and won the Chairman's Award at the Palm Springs International Film Awards for the same song here in January) showed up with FINNEAS' girfriend, makeup YouTuber Claudia Sulewski.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio and Ani Gasparyan\n\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce spotted watching Bleachers at Coachella\n\nJust as was rumored earlier this week, Taylor Swift opted to use a Blank Space in her schedule this weekend to attend the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in support of pal Jack Antonoff.\n\nIt all became clear when Antonoff's band, Bleachers, was performing an energetic set in Coachella's Mojave tent Saturday night, and many attendees had their cell phones trained not on Antonoff, but on the wings stage left.\n\nThat’s because there, amid the smoke machine fog, stood two figures with the body size and musical enthusiasm to match Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce. It soon became clear it was the world’s biggest power couple bopping along to the band led by Swift's longtime friend and collaborator Antonoff. The long-held rumor that the two were attending Weekend 1 of Coachella was finally confirmed.\n\nAs fans with the right angle scrambled to capture an image or video of the two, Swift and Kelce danced and fist-pumped to the lively Bleachers set.\n\nRead our full story here.\n\n— Shad Powers\n\nT-Pain causes the Heineken House to reach capacity\n\nIt may have been a few years since T-Pain’s glory days, but it appears Coachella’s organizers may have underestimated just how big of a draw the hip-hop star still is. About 40 minutes before he was set to take the stage in the Heineken House Saturday, a lengthy line had formed, leading some festivalgoers to audibly express frustration that the line would likely prevent them from hearing “Buy U A Drank” and other hits.\n\nRight before publishing this article at 6:50 p.m., the rumor in line was that they'd reached capacity and nobody still in line would be let in.\n\nIt has not been announced whether T-Pain will be invited back for Coachella Weekend 2, but if he is, they may want to look at a bigger stage.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nVampire Weekend brings out Paris Hilton during Coachella set\n\nVampire Weekend was added to the Coachella lineup on Tuesday, thrilling Indie rock fans and setting off furious debate about whether or not they will play Weekend 2.\n\nDuring their Weekend 1 set Saturday afternoon, the band made the interesting choice of bringing out Paris Hilton to ... play cornhole on stage? While they played a country tune? And then, they made the even more fascinating choice of bringing out an unidentified dude dressed as Abraham Lincoln to play some cornhole after Hilton left the stage? We're confused, if you can't tell.\n\nThe last 15 minutes were \"one continuous honky-tonk,\" Desert Sun columnist Shad Powers said, as the band ended the set on a jovial yet inexplicability random note.\n\nRead Powers' full review here.\n\n— Niki Kottmann/Shad Powers\n\nRAYE stuns the Coachella crowd with killer vocals\n\nRAYE came out in full force at her Coachella performance on Saturday, stunning the crowd with her vocal prowess. Her high notes could give you goose bumps.\n\nShe performed songs off her debut album, “My 21st Century Blues,” which included \"Worth It.,\" \"Mary Jane,\" and \"Ice Cream Man.\" She also performed an unreleased song she’s been teasing audiences with, with the lyrics “I'm seein' a sad little sinner, in the mirror. The devil works hard, like my liver.” She implored fans to be patient for its official release, saying it’s not finished yet and art takes time.\n\nRAYE spoke with the audience throughout her set, often times joking like when she mentioned how easy it is to get cannabis in California or revealed her obsession for cheese before performing “Mary Jane.” She grew emotional before introducing “Ice Cream Man.,” a heartbreaking and beautiful song about her experience with sexual assault and overcoming the pain that entailed.\n\nRAYE ended her Coachella performance with her most popular songs that you’ve likely heard on TikTok — \"Prada\" and \"Escapism.\" Her set went about two minutes over, but no one was complaining as the Mojave tent was stuffed with fans and they gave her deafening cheers.\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nWomen of the WTA tour get in on the Coachella fun\n\nThe Tennis Channel had a little fun with some of the top women on the WTA tour this week and asked them who they would choose as their dream Coachella headliners.\n\nThe stars, all of whom were in the desert last month for the BNP Paribas Open, had a wide range of answers from U2 to Chance the Rapper to Rolando Boldrin. You might be asking who is Rolando Boldrin? He is the uncle of Brazilian tennis star Beatriz Haddad-Maia who kept it in the family for her third headlining spot. Her other two choices were Jack Johnson and Eddie Vedder.\n\nTwo-time BNP Paribas Open champion Victoria Azarenka wanted a country takeover at Coachella, choosing Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs and Lainey Wilson. She might want to just wait a couple weeks and go to Stagecoach.\n\nJessica Pegula, Elina Svitolina, Ons Jabeur and Maria Sakkari all shared their thoughts. Try to match the player with one of their headliner choices: Bon Jovi, Damso (a popular rapper in France), Linkin Park and Arctic Monkeys. Watch the video above to find out.\n\n— Shad Powers\n\nWhat it's like being a Coachella traffic flagger\n\nTraffic at Coachella is the bane of every festivalgoer's existence (especially this year, with a new Blue Lot design that makes for a much longer walk to the festival). But no one has it worse than the people who have to stand there in the blazing heat, guiding disgruntled drivers on where to go and park.\n\nCarlos Chavez and Kenneth Carleton are both flaggers for traffic control at the festival. Their hours vary from 12 to 18 hours a day, Chavez said. But they don’t keep the money they make. They donate it to Set Free Church in Sanger, which is near Fresno, instead.\n\n“We do this for our ministry to keep the doors open for the next person who struggles with addiction, homelessness and (to) get them off the streets,” he said. “So this is a way to give back.”\n\nThere are about 18 of them from the church working , according to Chavez. They commute an hour every day from where they’re staying in Desert Center.\n\nBoth Chavez and Carleton are doing this for the second year.\n\n“We’re all doing it for the glory of God, for the next person … so it’s a blessing just to be out here in the heat, just working for the next brother,” Carleton said.\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nWhat do you think of the Coachella 2024 art installations?\n\nThis year, Coachella only features three new art installations, but they've definitely made an impression. The pieces include:\n\n\"Dancing in the Sky\" by Morag Myuerscough\n\n\"Babylon\" be Nebia\n\n\"Monarchs: A House in Six Parts\" by HANNA (the studio of Leslie Lok and Sasa Zivkovic)\n\nWe weren't huge fans at first, but by the evening, we realized what makes these pieces so cool. Read Desert Sun reporter Paul Albani-Burgio's hot takes on the artwork here.\n\n— Niki Kottmann\n\nCoachella 2024: 3.8-magnitude earthquake strikes Saturday, felt in Indio\n\nA magnitude-3.8 earthquake struck at 9:08 a.m. about 8 miles northeast of Borrego Springs and 20.9 miles south of La Quinta, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nA small rattle was felt in the Coachella Valley, including in Indio on Day 2 of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts festival.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of damage.\n\n— Kate Franco, City News Service\n\nCoachella Friday headliner Lana Del Rey brings out Billie Eilish, Jon Batiste\n\nAs of 12:37 a.m. Saturday, Coachella Weekend 1, Day 1 headliner Lana Del Rey had brought out two back-to-back special guests: five-time Grammy Award winner Jon Batiste and Coachella 2022 headliner Billie Eilish.\n\nBatiste and Del Rey sang their collaboration “Candy Necklace” off her latest album, \"Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd.\" Batiste played piano and Del Rey sang while seated atop the instrument). Eilish and Del Rey first sang Eilish's 2016 hit \"Ocean Eyes,\" followed by a duet of Del Rey's \"Video Games,\" the 2012 debut single off her sophomore album.\n\n— Ema Sasic\n\nCoachella Weekend 1:Highs, lows and in-betweens from Day 1 of the festival\n\nJustice proves why they're Coachella veterans\n\nDuring an April interview with Billboard, the French electronic music duo Justice discussed its first return to Coachella since 2017. Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay explained that the lengthy periods between albums cause uncertainty.\n\n“We’re both like, ‘OK, is there going to be anybody that’s still interested?’” Augé said during the interview.\n\nOn Friday at the Outdoor Stage, it was obvious throughout the headlining set that the French disco fused with rock ‘n’ roll and dubstep remained popular during its fourth appearance at the festival since 2007, the same year Daft Punk headlined the Sahara tent and videos of the performance went viral, elevating French electronic music and taking it mainstream around the globe.\n\nHowever, this performance was more refined and featured more stunning visual production beyond the illuminated cross in the Justice logo. Both Augé and de Rosnay dropped the varsity jackets and appeared suave in suits as they masterfully transitioned between songs.\n\nSome highlights were the duo opening with the banger \"Genesis,\" the live debuts of \"Generator\" and \"Incognito,\" and \"D.A.N.C.E.\"\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nChlöe starts Coachella set with a bang but ends early\n\nThose hoping to see catch Chlöe singing her biggest hit better have gotten to the Gobi tent on time Friday night.\n\nThe singer broke with convention by opening her set with a heart-dropping rendition of her hit “Have Mercy” that surely roused anyone who was starting to drag after a long day at the festival.\n\nUnfortunately, that choice was also perhaps an early sign that Chlöe would be treating things a bit too expediently: despite repeatedly mentioning how bummed she was about how fast the set was going by, she ended her performance about 10 minutes early.\n\nBut the set generally made up for what lacked in length with sheer power as Chlöe spent much of it tearing through several songs that were clearly written as a response to a man who wronged her.\n\nAt one point, she asked how many people in the audience could relate and then denounced those who cheat with an epithet that can’t be printed in this publication. That charged sequence of songs seemed to reach a thematic peak when she performed “Boy Bye,” a powerful song of liberation that she said was released earlier today. And while Chlöe surely left some feeling a little, well, cheated themselves, she did at least leave the crowd with her other hit “Treat Me,” which closed out her show.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPeso Pluma brings out Becky G in a fun throwback to Coachella 2023\n\nPeso Pluma's much-anticipated Coachella set got even better Friday night when friend and collaborator Becky G popped up onstage to sing their song \"Chanel,\" which Becky G brought out Peso Pluma to sing during her set on the main stage at Coachella last year.\n\n— Tom Coulter\n\nSabrina Carpenter doesn't bring out Taylor Swift, but shines all by herself\n\nPop singer — and Taylor Swift pal — Sabrina Carpenter made a stunning Coachella debut Friday night, and even though she didn't bring out her famous friend, she did reward fans with her latest groovy single \"Espresso,\" as well as an hourlong set featuring all her biggest hits.\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the set was Carpenter's beloved \"Nonsense,\" which she's known for changing the outro of during each live performance. On Friday, the outro was, naturally, Coachella-focused:\n\n\"\"All about the balls I'm Cinderella. Only use my mouth that's acapella. I'm so glad you came for me Coachella,\" she sang.\n\nRead my full review here.\n\n— Ema Sasic\n\nBizarrap brings out Shakira during electric Coachella set\n\nGlobal superstar Shakira made a guest appearance at Argentine producer Bizarrap’s set at the Sahara tent Friday night, bringing her signature dance moves and her world-famous diss song to the Empire Polo Club.The crowd, already excited throughout Bizarrap’s DJ set, became fully rapturous when the Colombian star emerged to first perform “La Fuerte,” a collaboration with the producer. She followed it with her \"Vol. 53\" of the Bzrp sessions, a scathing diss song aimed at her ex-husband Gerard Piqué, about halfway through the hour-long set. She also announced her upcoming world tour for her latest album, “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran.”\n\nRead my full story here.\n\n— Tom Coulter\n\nCoachella traffic: If you're not in Indio, beware that many Palm Springs roads are closed after 8 p.m. Friday\n\nIt's after 8 p.m. on Friday, the opening night of Coachella 2024. If you haven't made your way into the desert yet, beware. Many main arteries in Palm Springs are closed due to blowing sand. Road closures as of about 8:15 p.m. include:\n\nNorth Indian Canyon Drive from Sunrise Parkway to Garnet Avenue at the wash.\n\nNorth Gene Autry Trail from East Via Escuela to Salvia at the wash.\n\nSid Sriram brings a slice of India to Indio during Coachella set\n\nSid Sriram, an Indian musician, gave an engaging performance infusing pop and Carnatic music at the Gobi tent on Friday. He started his set with an invocation prayer to the Hindu god Ganesha.Many of his fans likely know him for performing movie soundtracks in South Asian cinema and, of course, Carnatic music. His performance included a small riff on the Tamil movie song “Kannalane enadhu kannai” and an improvisation in Carnatic music about Muruga, the son of the Hindu god Shiva and a common subject for songs in the genre. He ended his set with a prayer that he said his mother taught him.In addition to Indian music, his set mainly included English songs from his discography.\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nChappell Roan shows what Midwest Princesses are made of during Coachella set\n\nAt the start of her Friday set, emerging pop singer and Missouri native Chapell Roan declared herself a Midwest Princess (a reference to her debut album that came out last year, \"The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\"). Then, she spent the next 45 minutes demonstrating exactly what that means. A Midwest Princess, it turns out, always owns the stage, whether they are dramatically singing to a wig they placed over a microphone (like during “Picture You”), leading the crowd in a dance designed to spell out the title of one their most infectious bops (“Hot-To-Go”), or epically dissing their ex before launching into a lively rendition of one of their most popular songs (“My Kink is Karma\").\n\nThis set was a clear contender for having the most hyped crowd of the first half of Friday (shout out to the two girls near me who appeared to be having the time of their lives during “My Kink Is Karma”) and I think I have a clear theory for why: anyone who catches Chapell Roan live finds themselves wanting to be a Midwest Princess, too.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nDeftones fulfills many fans' Coachella dreams\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the French pop band L'Impératrice entered a sizable crowd with its funky grooves and overall feel-good music. Less than an hour later, the Sacramento metal band Deftones arrived on the same stage to perform an ear-piercing and ferocious set.\n\nIt felt right considering Deftones have been on many Coachella fans’ wishlist for several years, but the closest thing the festival put up in the past was frontman Chino Moreno’s side-project Crosses in 2014. Fans embraced the band’s revolving heavy sound of melodic and screeching vocals, frenzied guitars and pounding rhythms. Some crowdsurfed, and there appeared to be mosh pits throughout the set.\n\nDeftones rose to prominence during the late ‘90s on tours opening for the likes of Ozzy Osbourne and KISS. As nu-metal bands Korn and Limp Bizkit were featured on MTV, Deftones attracted the same crowd while appealing to fans of alternative and pop music.\n\nMoreno has been open about his pop influences. In 2011, the band released a compilation of covers such as The Smiths’ “Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want,” Sade’s “No Ordinary Love,” Duran Duran’s \"The Chauffeur” and more.\n\n— Brian Blueskye\n\nFaye Webster wows sans Lil Yachty during Coachella set\n\nFaye Webster gave a delightful performance at the Mojave tent on Friday, coupled with stunning and sometimes even comedic visuals.\n\nHer stage was adorned with a large blue t-shirt, blue shirts on clothing racks and washing machines in a nod to the cover art from her latest album, “Underdressed at the Symphony.” She bookended her set with visuals of a minion-version of herself.\n\nWebster, dressed in a cool, blue-striped ensemble, opened with “But Not Kiss” and performed several other songs from her new album. This included “Lego Ring,” which features Lil Yachty on the album. Lil Yachty was absent from Webster’s Friday performance, but he will perform in the Mojave tent on Sunday.\n\nThe crowd reacted with outward joy when Webster played some of the most-loved songs in her discography, singing along to “Right Side of My Neck,” “In a Good Way,” and the closing song of her set “Kingston.”\n\n— Ani Gasparyan\n\nThe Japanese House set plagued by technical difficulties\n\nOne of the biggest bummers that can happen at Coachella is when a rad artist is making the debut you know they've been dreaming of their whole lives only to have it blindsided by technical difficulties.\n\nThat was the unfortunate turn of events for The Japanese House, a band created and helmed by lead singer Amber Bain. Their set was supposed to begin at 4:30 p.m. at the Mojave tent. At 4:36 p.m. the band came out and Bain said they were having technical difficulties and as she strummed her guitar a couple times you could see her face drop as it was clear the problems were persisting. After a few minutes, she said \"We're going to pretend like this never happened and we're going to backstage and come back out when everything's fixed.\"\n\nThe band filed back to the wings and returned about six minutes later. After more adjusting and back-and-forths with the sound techs they started at around 4:45 p.m. even though you could tell Bain was still struggling with her ear piece and her levels. Not to mention the frustration knowing that 15 minutes of their 40-minute set was wasted.\n\n\"This is my first Coachella, can you tell?\" Bain deadpanned opting for gallows humor and putting on a good face despite what had to be a heart-sinking moment.\n\nShe sounded great and had raucous support from the crowd as she was able to get seven songs in before her 5:10 p.m. cutoff time. The crowd swayed and sang along to \"Something Has to Change\" (a very appropriate song for the circmstances). She then said \"This one goes out to my gays\" which drew a roar before jumping into her song \"Boyhood.\"\n\nShe closed with \"Sunshine Baby,\" thanked the crowd and hustled off the stage.\n\nI felt the same sympathy for Bain that I did for the Linda Lindas at last year's Coachella as their entire Weekend 1 set was ruined by similar technical snafus.\n\nKudos to Bain for powering through a tough situation and still providing her fans something to remember, even if it was just 25 minutes worth.\n\n— Shad Powers\n\nYoung Miko crushes her debut Coachella set\n\nPuerto Rican rapper Young Miko made her Coachella debut on Friday, performing an array of hits, including several popular songs from her brand-new album, “attn.”\n\nDonning oversized jean shorts and with a full band backing her, the 25-year-old rapper braved the afternoon heat to deliver a thrilling performance on the Coachella Stage. She played several songs from her new album released earlier this month, including “wiggy,” “ID” and “princess peach.”\n\nSeveral people in the crowd waved Puerto Rican flags throughout the performance, to the delight of Young Miko, whose real name is María Victoria Ramírez de Arellano Cardona. She closed with a pair of popular collaborations: “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 58,” followed by “Classy 101,” which she recorded with Feid.\n\nYoung Miko also performed her full verse from Bad Bunny’s “Fina.\" While there were no guest appearances during her set, the rapper clearly didn’t need any assistance to boost the crowd’s excitement despite the scorching afternoon sun.\n\n— Tom Coulter\n\nCoachella brand pop-ups: Where to get freebies, sometimes AC\n\nAcross from the Indio Central Market is a row of air-conditioned tents for Absolut vodka, Carrera eyewear and International Delight cold foam cream. If you forgot your shades at home, stop by Carrera, where you can get festival-exclusive sunglasses. And if you’re running low on caffeine, the International Delight tent has coffee samples that can be topped with its latest cream. There’s also a music station that you get to take DJ reins over and a lounge area.\n\n— Ema Sasic\n\nLa Quinta locals celebrate a decade of attending Coachella\n\nSally (celebrating her 72nd birthday today) and 80-year-old Bob Arroyo of La Quinta arrived in time for the gates to open for what they say must be nearly their 10th year attending the festival. The pair was always curious about Coachella in its first few years, and read about it in the paper when they lived in Los Angeles County, but have made attending a tradition now that they're locals. They attend both weekends so that they can catch any artists they missed Weekend 1, and sometimes even take the chance to see a set they loved a second time. \"Some people go on cruises,\" Sally said, \"but we go to Coachella.\"\n\n— Andy Abeyta\n\nCoachella Sahara tent: The trek to new site is no joke\n\nYou've probably heard by now that the Sahara tent has moved quite a bit south on the grounds this year, stretching out the distance from the Sahara to the rest of the festival. As an experiment I walked from the Outdoor Theatre to the Sahara tent, what I would call the farthest possible trek on the grounds. It took me 13 minutes, and 13 seconds and 985 steps. And that was at 2:45 p.m. with a mostly open field in front of me. So, factor that math into your daily plan if you hope to see an act at the Sahara tent followed by an act at the Outdoor Theatre. Whew!\n\n— Shad Powers\n\nCoachella time: Fans rush in as gates open 20 minutes late\n\nIn true Coachella fashion, the gates opened 20 minutes later than scheduled on Friday, but that only made festivalgoers at the front of the line even more eager to run to the most important area of the grounds this early in the day: the merch tent.\n\nLana Del Rey Coachella concert merch: Where to find artist-specific tents\n\nThis year, the artist-specific tents aren't next to the main merch tent you see when you walk in the gates. Instead, Lana Del Rey, Doja Cat and No Doubt have their own merch tents to the right of the Heineken House stage at the back of the festival grounds. Noticeably, Tyler, The Creator doesn't have his own merch tent.\n\n— Niki Kottmann\n\nUpdate: Coachella livestream on YouTube schedule for Friday\n\nThe livestream schedule for Coachella 2024 Weekend 1, Day 1 has been released.

Well, it's Pacific Standard Time. Here's a cheat sheet. Are you in New York (Eastern time zone)? Subtract three hours and that's local time in Indio. Are you in Chicago (Central Standard time)? Subtract two hours and ... there you have it. Denver (Mountain time?) Take away one hour, bro. You're welcome.\n\nCoachella Weekend 1 weather: Storm to hit SoCal, but not Indio\n\nWhile another spring storm is set to hit Southern California this weekend, bringing rain mostly to the Los Angeles area and parts of the Inland Empire, those who are flocking to the Empire Polo Club in Indio for Weekend 1 of Coachella should be pleasantly surprised. The National Weather Service out of San Diego on Friday is predicting picture-perfect (selfie-perfect?), if breezy, conditions in Indio and across the Coachella Valley Friday through Sunday.\n\nFriday: Sunny with highs near 90 degrees. The afternoon will see wind of 5 to 10 mph with some gusts hitting 20 mph.\n\nSunny with highs near 90 degrees. The afternoon will see wind of 5 to 10 mph with some gusts hitting 20 mph.

Read about why The Desert Sun staff is keeping their eyes peeled for Anitta, Sia, Kali Uchis, Megan Thee Stallion, The Weeknd, Leon Bridges, PinkPantheress and Blake Shelton.\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nTaylor Swift at Coachella? Here's why she might show up in Indio\n\nSnow touching down in sunny Indio is as rare as crossing paths with Taylor Swift, but for Coachellagoers, the rumors are spiraling if the star will make an appearance to support her friend and \"Snow On the Beach\" collaborator Lana Del Rey (headlining Friday's show). Her opening act in South America, Australia and Singapore, Sabrina Carpenter, also has a set at Coachella on Friday. On Saturday, Swift's friend and co-producer Jack Antonoff is playing with the Bleachers fresh off a new album release. The three acts will also repeat next week, so be on the lookout for Taylor and Travis.\n\n— Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter\n\nIt's going to be a (Vampire) Weekend 1. What about Weekend 2?\n\nVampire Weekend was added to the Coachella lineup on Tuesday, thrilling Indie rock fans and setting off furious debate about whether or not they will play Weekend 2, largely regarded as the \"music lovers'\" weekend (as opposed to Weekend 1's reputation as the influencer weekend). History suggests it's anybody's guess. Arcade Fire was similarly added to the 2022 lineup and only played Weekend 1. Blink-182 was added last-minute in 2023 for Weekend 1, and then got a huge upgrade to headliner Weekend 2 when Frank Ocean controversially bowed out.\n\nVampire Weekend, which was formed in 2006 in New York City, is no stranger to Coachella, Desert Sun Features Editor Niki Kottmann writes. The group played the festival in 2008, 2010 and then again in 2013. Check them out Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Outdoor Theatre.\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nCar camping at Coachella? How to get there, rules, tips, silent disco\n\nCar camping is the most classic way to experience a weekend at Coachella. Make friends. Do fun activities (silent disco, anyone?).

So it should come as no surprise that several artists who gained success on the popular social media platform will be taking the stage at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival this year.\n\nCheck out Gasparyan's story about TikTok stars Kenya Grace, Thuy, YG Marley, Jungle and Saint Levant, all of whom are slated to play this weekend.\n\n— Kate Franco\n\n3 Coachella artists likely to get political as Ukraine, Israel-Hamas wars continue\n\nSpeaking of Saint Levant, he's one three acts USA TODAY California elections fellow Kathryn Palmer has picked to make a political statement at Coachella.\n\nPalmer writes that music and politics have always had an intertwined relationship, as evidenced when more than 80 performers pulled out of the South by Southwest festival in Austin in March to protest several defense contracting companies participating in the event, and its \"super sponsor,\" the U.S. Army. Though there have not been any high-profile disputes among artists and Coachella organizers similar to that in Austin, the festival is by no means insulated from the Israel-Hamas war or the war in Ukraine.\n\nRead about the backgrounds of Saint Levant, ARTBAT and Miss Monique, and their personal connections to ongoing world strife\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nMore:Coachella '24: A first timer's guide to merch, packing, set times and other festival info\n\nMore:6 Latino artists to watch at Coachella 2024, from Peso Pluma to Young Miko\n\nMore:Coachella 2024: 8 pop acts you can't miss, including Sabrina Carpenter, Reneé Rapp", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2023/09/09/college-football-week-2-top-25-scores-live-updates/70795018007/", "title": "College football Week 2 highlights: Alabama beats Texas, Top 25 ...", "text": "Week 2 of the 2023 college football season is mostly in the books.

Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian, who served as Nick Saban's offensive coordinator in 2019–2020, marched his Longhorns into Alabama's Bryant–Denny Stadium and beat the Crimson Tide, 34-24.\n\n“They (Alabama) were 52-1 in their last 53 (home) games, so I guess they’re 52-2 now,\" Sarkisian said after the Longhorns win.\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 349 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. He said he's \"so proud of my team and my defense. We balled out.\"\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas extends lead to 10 with another haymaker\n\nHave yourself a night Adonai Mitchell.\n\nTexas’ junior receiver caught his second touchdown of the night, a 39-yard pass from QB Quinn Ewers, to extend the Longhorns’ lead over the Crimson Tide to 10 points in the fourth quarter. Mitchell has three receptions for 78 yards, while tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders has has five receptions for 114 yards. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama's 2-point conversion good after 39-yard TD\n\nAlabama isn’t done yet. After giving up two touchdowns to Texas in all of 15-seconds, the Crimson Tide cut the Longhorns’ lead to three points. Alabama’s Jalen Milroe dropped a low snap, but quickly picked it up and found Amari Niblack across the middle for a 39-yard touchdown. Alabama successfully completed a two-point conversion to bring the score to 24-27. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas intercepts Milroe again, up by 11\n\nFifteen seconds later, the Longhorns scored again.\n\nTexas’ Jerrin Thompson picked off Alabama’s Jalen Milroe and returned it 32-yards to the Crimson Tide’s 5-yard line. It marked Milroe’s second pick of the night.\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nN0. 10 Texas answers back with TD, leads No. 3 Alabama 20-16\n\nAlabama’s lead didn’t last long. Texas immediately responded by finding the end zone themselves. Texas QB Quinn Ewers completed a 50-yard play to Ja'Tavion Sanders and capped the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Adonai Mitchell to put the Longhorns up 20-16 over the Crimson Tide.\n\nA pass interference call on Alabama’s Terrion Arnold, his second of the night, accelerated Texas’ drive.\n\nAlabama led for one minute and nine seconds. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama takes lead over No. 10 Texas with 49-yard TD\n\nJermaine Burton finally got his touchdown.\n\nAfter two of Burton’s end zone catches were erased due to untimely penalties, quarterback Jalen Milroe connected with Burton for a 49-yard touchdown in the final minute of the third quarter.\n\nIt marked Alabama’s first touchdown of the game and the Crimson Tide took the lead over Texas for the first time. They are up 16-13 over Texas. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas marches down field, but misses field goal\n\nTexas had the opportunity to extend their lead to seven, but Longhorns kicker Bert Auburn missed a 42-yard field goal to the left. That’s not the only missed opportunity of the drive. Texas QB Quinn Ewers went for the end zone on third down, but receiver Xavier Worthy couldn’t come up with the ball.\n\nTexas leads Alabama 13-9. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama’s Caleb Downs not feeling well, out for now\n\nFreshman safety Caleb Downs, the Week 1 SEC Football Player of the Week, is on the sidelines and not feeling well. According to ESPN’s Holly Rowe, Downs “lost his lunch,\" an expression that normally means someone vomited. Kristian Story is in the game at safety for Downs. — Cydney Henderson\n\nAlright, alright, alright: Matthew McConaughey attends Texas-Alabama matchup\n\nMatthew McConaughey is in Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe actor was in attendance Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium for Alabama’s matchup against Texas, his alma mater. (McConaughey graduated from the school in 1993 with a Bachelor of Science degree.) He went particularly crazy during Quinn Ewers’ 44-yard TD pass to Xavier Worthy.\n\n\"Hook em, baby!\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama penalty wipes out touchdown, again\n\nAlabama’s offense appeared to find a groove to start the third quarter with quarterback Jalen Milroe’s 34-yard pass to Isaiah Bond to convert a third down. But another penalty (holding) wiped out Milroe’s touchdown pass to Jermaine Burton, the second time a flag has negated a score this game.\n\nCrimson Tide kicker Will Reichard has been the real MVP so far. He nailed a 51-yard field goal to bring Alabama within 4-points of Texas, 13-9. Reichard is responsible for all 9 of Alabama’s points. — Cydney Henderson\n\nFor Shedeur Sanders, Colorado's defeat of Nebraska was 'personal'\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Deion Sanders preached all week about how Saturday’s game against Nebraska was deeply “personal.”\n\nThere were plenty of reasons for this:\n\n∎ It was his first home game as head football coach at Colorado.\n\n∎ It was a sold-out game against the Cornhuskers, Colorado’s hated old rivals.\n\n∎ For his quarterback and son Shedeur, it also was a direct confrontation with Matt Rhule, the Nebraska coach who managed to offend him at times this year, including during pregame warmups when he said he saw him standing on the Buffaloes’ logo at midfield.\n\n“It was extremely personal,” Shedeur Sanders said after the Buffs beat Nebraska at Folsom Field 36-14.\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nHalftime: No. 10 Texas 13, No. 3 Alabama 6\n\nThe Longhorns enter halftime with a 7-point lead over the Crimson Tide at Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nAlabama has struggled to get points on the board, but the Crimson Tide’s offense appeared to ignite with a third-down conversion when quarterback Jalen Milroe found Kobe Prentice for a 28-yard pass up the middle with 44 seconds left in the first half. A touchdown, however, was called back due to a penalty (ineligible lineman downfield) and another Alabama penalty (illegal motion) kept them out of the end zone. They settled for a field goal to cut into Texas’ lead, 13-6.\n\nMilroe has thrown for 80 yards and one interception and run for 52 yards. Prentice leads Alabama receivers with three receptions for 42 yards.\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers looked comfortable in the first half. He’s thrown for 138 yards and one touchdown to receiver Xavier Worthy, who has five receptions for 75 yards so far. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas back on top of No. 3 Alabama after Ewer's deep-shot TD\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers connected with receiver Xavier Worthy for a 44-yard touchdown to take a 10-3 lead. Texas had tried another deep shot on the previous play, with Ewers throwing a lateral to Worthy, who then tried to find Adonai Mitchell down the field. But a pass interference penalty was called on Alabama’s Terrion Arnold for pulling Mitchell’s jersey, setting Texas up at the Crimson Tide’s 44-yard line and giving the Longhorns another crack at a big play. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama ties it up after Nick Saban’s gusty fourth down call\n\nAfter Texas took an early 3-0 lead, Alabama answered back with a 12-play, 51-yard drive to tie the game, 3-3. The Crimson Tide converted a 4th and three at Texas’ 42-yard-line, thanks to quarterback Jalen Milroe’s 6-yard pass to Malik Benson. But Alabama’s offense couldn’t get in the red zone and settled for a 43-yard field goal. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas jumps to early lead over No. 3 Alabama after interception\n\nAlabama quarterback Jalen Milroe ran for 12 yards to capture a first down at the Crimson Tide’s 41-yard-line in the first quarter against Texas, but the drive ended two plays later when Texas defensive back Jahdae Barron intercepted Milroe. Barron’s pick resulted in a field goal for Texas to take an early 3-0 lead over Alabama. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 20 Mississippi rallies past No. 22 Tulane with big second half\n\nTulane led Ole Miss by 10 late into the third quarter, but the Rebels used a big fourth quarter to beat the Green Wave 37-20 in Yulman Stadium. Tulane was without starting quarterback Matthew Pratt, and backup Kai Horton played a solid role but was overwhelmed by the defense in the second half. In the second half, Ole Miss outscored Tulane 27-3, and sealed the win with fumble return for a touchdown with less than two minutes left. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMississippi takes fourth-quarter lead on Tulane\n\nThe Rebels defense has made life tough for Tulane in the second half, and it’s offense broke through for a touchdown and capitalized on an interception to take a 20-17 lead over Tulane with 12 minutes left. The Green Wave then fumbled the ball to give Ole Miss the ball back. The Rebels have scored 13 consecutive points since the second quarter — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNotre Dame overcomes weather delay to get past North Carolina State\n\nAfter a lengthy weather delay, Notre Dame used a strong fourth quarter to pull away from North Carolina State and win on the road, 45-24. Leading 24-17 heading into the final 15 minutes, Notre Dame picked off Wolfpack quarterback Brennan Armstrong on back-to-back possessions in the final frame that led to two touchdowns to strengthen the lead. After forcing a fourth-down stop, Sam Hartman tossed a 35-yard touchdown pass to Holden Staes to seal the win before North Carolina State added a touchdown with two minutes left. T he duo of Hartman and running back Audric Estime were tough to stop, as the signal caller threw for 286 yards and four touchdowns on 15-for-24 passing, while Estime had 14 carries for 134 yards and two scores. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 10 Texas at No. 3 Alabama: What to know about the matchup\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nWhy watch: The week’s headliner pits these national name-brand programs and future SEC foes in a rematch of last year’s encounter in Austin, in which the Crimson Tide narrowly escaped 20-19 thanks to some late heroics by Bryce Young. He is off to the NFL, of course, but the early returns on new Crimson Tide starting QB Jalen Milroe are quite positive. Longhorns QB Quinn Ewers, who was knocked out of last year’s tilt with Alabama with a shoulder injury, will be just as eager to show what he can do.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Ewers and the Longhorns’ offense were a bit slow out of the gate last week against Rice. A similar start in Tuscaloosa could prove catastrophic, although the Texas defense should be better equipped to contain Milroe’s two-way ability than that of Middle Tennessee. If it isn’t a one-score game at halftime, there might not be any late drama — Eddie Timanus\n\nTexas vs. Alabama all-time record\n\nThe two programs have faced off 10 times. The matchup will be the second all-time in Tuscaloosa, and Alabama lost the last game 10-0 in 1902. The Longhorns hold a 7-2-1 series lead, but Alabama has won the past two matchups: the BCS Championship Game in 2009 and the matchup in Austin a season ago. The Longhorns have not beaten the Crimson Tide since 1982. — Nick Kelly, The Tuscaloosa News\n\nMiami holds halftime lead against No. 23 Texas A&M\n\nSpecial teams doomed the Hurricanes in the first half as two miscues led to easy points for No. 23 Texas A&M, but they still lead the Aggies 21-17 at halftime.\n\nDylan Joyce had his punt blocked by Jahdae Walker after Miami’s first possession and A&M cashed in three plays later as Conner Weigman scored on a keeper from 1-yard out.\n\nAfter A&M took a 10-0 lead, Miami answered after a 3-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Van Dyke to Colbie Young\n\nThe special teams came into play again when an A&M punt was muffed by Jacolby George at the Miami 7-yard line. Two plays later, Amari Daniels' 9-yard score put the Aggies up 17-7.\n\nVan Dyke (13-of-17, 232 yards, 3 TDs) then went deep to bring the Hurricanes within three, delivering a beautiful throw to freshman Isaiah Horton for 52 yards. After A&M missed a field goal with 57 seconds left, Miami took the lead after Van Dyke drove Miami 75 yards with no timeouts in 44 seconds and hit George on an 11-yard scoring strike. — Scooby Axson\n\nHow to watch Alabama vs. Texas\n\nThe game will be on ESPN and can be streamed on Fubo.

He’s 4-for-8 with 116 yards and the one touchdown pass. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan football score today: Wolverines in control against UNLV\n\nMichigan quarterback JJ McCarthy completed his first 13 pass attempts, and Blake Corum ran for 46 yards and two touchdowns as the Wolverines rolled to halftime with a 21-0 lead against UNLV.\n\nMcCarthy finished the half 17-of-18 for 188 yards with one touchdown to Roman Wilson. McCarthy had completions to seven receivers and added 38 rushing yards.\n\nEach of UNLV’s four first-half possessions ended in a punt, as the Rebels could only muster up 40 yards of total offense. UNLV quarterback Doug Brumfield threw for 58 yards and was sacked five times. — Scooby Axson\n\nNotre Dame football score today: NC State keeping it close\n\nNC State is hanging on at home against No. 11 Notre Dame, down 24-17 and starting the fourth quarter with the ball.\n\nAfter making it a one-score game, the Wolfpack forced a fumble to get great field position on Notre Dame’s side of the field. However, Brayden Narveson missed a 34-yard field goal that would have cut the deficit. The Wolfpack were able to force a punt to get the ball back to start the final 15 minutes. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOle Miss football score today: Tulane leads in major home game for Green Wave\n\nTulane is without starting quarterback Michael Pratt but the Green Wave are holding up in a big home matchup against Ole Miss, up 10-7 in the second quarter.\n\nOle Miss only needed three plays to score a touchdown on its opening drive, but Tulane was able to respond thanks to a 57-yard pass from backup Kai Horton to Lawrence Keys III. The Green Wave were able to punch it in a few plays later, and their defense has forced the Rebels to punt on three straight drives. Valentino Ambrosio nailed a 44-yard field goal to start the second quarter to take the lead. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh on chain gang for son's youth football game\n\nJim Harbaugh can't be on the Michigan sidelines this week against UNLV because of his self-imposed three-game suspension. But nothing can keep Harbaugh away from football for too long.\n\nHarbaugh picked up a new gig and is spending his second Saturday off working the chains for a youth football game at his son Jack's game, dressed in his usual Michigan striped polo and hat, per a photo posted by ESPN reporter Sean Ritchlin.\n\n“There’s a chance my son Jack’s team is going to be playing at the same time. If he’s playing, I’ll go watch that game,” Harbaugh said the Monday before Michigan’s season opener against East Carolina. “I don’t know if I’ll watch on TV if I won’t be able to watch it. I can’t predict what it’s going to be at the time.

The Tigers also fumbled early in the game and that was returned to the 1-yard line, and the Buccaneers punched it in one play later.\n\nThe Tigers' mistakes have given Charleston Southern hope from what has been a mostly ineffective offensive performance from the Buccaneers. Clemson is outgaining Charleston Southern 265-43. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado no longer coming. The Buffs are here.\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Head coach Deion Sanders and his Colorado football team made a statement to the nation in their first game last week at TCU. One week later, they made another one with less drama and flair, easily beating Nebraska 36-14 Saturday in front of the sold-out crowd of 53,241 at Folsom Field, the largest crowd here since 2008.\n\nAfter finishing 1-11 last season, the Buffaloes improved to 2-0 by overcoming a slow start, capitalizing on early Nebraska turnovers and then holding on to show they’re more than a one-week sensation.\n\nThe Buffs also weren’t nearly as sharp as they were in in last week’s 45-42 win in Fort Worth. They punted four times in their first four possessions Saturday after punting only three times all game the week before.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders even suffered four sacks in the first half but threw touchdown passes in the second and third quarters to help put Colorado up 20-7. The second one went to South Florida graduate transfer Xavier Weaver, who produced his second straight game of at least 100 yards.\n\nThe Buffs now look to go 3-0 with a night game next Saturday at home against Colorado State. −Brent Schrotenboer\n\nNo. 23 Texas A&M at Miami (Fla.) predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nWhy watch: Are the Aggies finally ready to live up to their seemingly annual billing? The same question could be asked of the Hurricanes. Both teams handled overmatched opponents as good teams should in Week 1, setting up what could be an interesting clash in the Sunshine State. A&M defeated the Hurricanes in a lackluster 17-9 contest last season, but both teams appear to have more competence on the offensive side this time. Aggies QB Conner Weigman torched New Mexico for five TD passes without a pick under new coordinator Bobby Petrino. Hurricanes QB Tyler Van Dyke wasn’t quite as prolific against the other Miami from Ohio last week, but RBs Henry Parrish and Mark Fletcher lent plenty of ground support.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: The Hurricanes’ much more accomplished secondary featuring DB Kamren Kinchens and the Aggies’ stout ground defense led by LB Edgerrin Cooper could neutralize the respective strengths of the opposing offenses. If that is the case, we might have another low-scoring struggle like the 2022 encounter. But that development would also significantly reduce the game’s blowout potential, so there should still be intrigue in the closing minutes. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Eddie Timanus: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Erick Smith: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Jace Evans: Miami\n\nMiami Paul Myerberg: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Scooby Axson: Miami\n\nIowa at Iowa State how to watch and what to know\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, Fox\n\nWhy watch: This one won’t light up the scoreboard as a number of other games on the schedule will, but it should be competitive with the Cy-Hawk Trophy on the line. The Cyclones claimed it a year ago in a 10-7 slog, ending a six-game skid in the series. Unfortunately, not much else went right the rest of the way in a 4-8 campaign, while Iowa managed to go 8-5 despite its well-documented scoring woes. The Hawkeyes should be a bit more productive with Michigan transfer Cade McNamara now quarterbacking the attack, though nagging injuries could again hamper his mobility. The Cyclones will counter with freshman QB Rocco Becht, who had an efficient pick-free debut against Northern Iowa.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Cue the \"take the under: jokes in 3… 2…. Oh, who are we kidding? They’re already out there, especially given that gambling issues stemming from a state-wide investigation have depleted both rosters. But personnel matters aside, both these teams are constructed to win a grind-it-out affair that may not provide many flashy plays. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUtah football score today: Utes survive Baylor\n\nJaylon Glover scored on an 11-yard run with 17 seconds left and Nate Johnson came off the bench in relief of an ineffective Bryson Barnes, leading No. 12 Utah to a comeback 20-13 win against Baylor.\n\nJohnson ran up the middle untouched from seven yards out to tie the score at 13 with two minutes remaining, capping an 8-minute, 15-play, 88-yard drive.\n\nBarnes got the start, subbing for an injured Cameron Rising and went 6-of-19 for 71 yards with an interception and was sacked twice. In the fourth quarter, Johnson completed six of his seven passes for 82 yards.\n\nBaylor got the ball back with 1:54 left but Sawyer Robertson, starting in place of an injured Blake Shapen, forced a pass over the middle which was intercepted by Cole Bishop, who returned it to the Baylor 29, which led to the winning score. The Bears got down to the 22-yard line on their final drive, but Robertson's pass fell incomplete in the end zone as time expired. — Scooby Axson\n\nColorado score today: Shedeur Sanders does dad’s dance to celebrate TD\n\nLike father, like son.\n\nAfter rushing for a 6-yard touchdown to put Colorado up 36-7 over Nebraska, quarterback Shedeur Sanders took a page out of his dad’s playbook for his celebration. Shedeur Sanders hit Deion Sanders’ signature ‘Prime Time’ shuffle in the end zone.\n\nHe’s thrown for 393 yards, two touchdowns by air, one touchdown on the ground and no interceptions on the day. − Cydney Henderson\n\nGeorgia, top-ranked teams score blowout wins\n\nNo. 1 Georgia started off slow with no first-quarter points, but it responded with a dominant second quarter en route to an easy 45-3 win over Ball State.\n\nThe Bulldogs victory marked just one of several top-ranked teams putting up huge victories over smaller schools. No. 4 Ohio State’s offense looked better against FCS Youngstown State in a 45-7 win, and No. 7 Penn State dominated Delaware with a 63-7 thumping of the Fightin' Blue Hens.\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes score after another Nebraska turnover\n\nNebraska hung on for as long as it could, but several miscues later and Colorado is starting to pull away from its rival.\n\nAfter Jeff Sims’ touchdown run cut the deficit to six, Colorado scored 16 unanswered points to put the game nearly out of reach with a 29-7 lead with under 11 minutes left in the game. Trailing 23-7, Nebraska was in need of a score and in Colorado territory, but a botched handoff resulted in a fumble, the fourth turnover of the game for the Cornhuskers.\n\nColorado then marched down the field and capped the drive with a trick-play touchdown for Tar'Varish Dawson. The two-point conversion wasn’t good, but the 22-point lead nearly wraps up another win for Coach Prime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNotre Dame scores on first play after weather delay\n\nIt appears Notre Dame was ready to play.\n\nAfter a lengthy weather delay at NC State, Notre Dame returned to the field with the ball at the Wolfpack 20-yard line. Running back Audric Estime then took the first play back 80 yards to the house for the first touchdown of the game to give the Fighting Irish a 10-0 lead. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJeff Sims' big run gets Nebraska on the board\n\nIt was a nightmare first half for Nebraska quarterback Jeff Sims, but things may be turning around thanks to a big run.\n\nOn Nebraska’s opening drive of the third quarter, Sims took a quarterback draw 57 yards down the sideline, untouched and into the endzone to give the Cornhuskers their first points of the day and second touchdown of the season. The touchdown cut the Colorado lead to 13-7. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nVirginia’s Mike Hollins scores TD 10 months after shooting\n\nThere might not be a more important touchdown scored during Week 2 than the one by Virginia senior running back Mike Hollins.\n\nHollins was one of two students hospitalized after a Nov. 13 campus shooting, when a former Virginia football player opened fire on a bus returning from a field trip. Three teammates – Devin Chandley, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry – were killed.\n\nHollins took a second-quarter handoff against James Madison for a 4-yard touchdown, his first trip to the end zone in nearly a year – Sept. 17, 2022 against Old Dominion.\n\nVirginia leads JMU 28-17 in the third quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nAlabama vs. Texas odds\n\nThe top college football betting apps favor No. 3 Alabama in its primetime matchup with 10th-ranked Texas.

One of the best mobile sports betting apps, BetMGM is among those offering the top NCAA football betting promos in 2023. — Richard Morin\n\nWhy Deion Sanders slept in his office before Colorado vs. Nebraska\n\n\"I wanted to wake up and see the stadium,\" Deion Sanders said. \"I wanted to wake up and feel it. I wanted to see it empty and then see the transformation. It's pretty much what we're doing.\" — Gabriela Carroll, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nOhio State score today: Buckeyes up big at half\n\nQuarterback Kyle McCord’s inconsistencies during Ohio State’s opener have been washed away, even if only for a week.\n\nMcCord completed 13-of-18 passes during the first half for 253 yards and three touchdowns, including two to Marvin Harrison Jr., as the Buckeyes go into halftime with a 28-7 lead against Youngstown State.\n\nThe Buckeyes have rolled up 339 total yards during the first half. Ohio State registered 380 total yards last week against Indiana. — Casey Moore\n\nNorth Carolina State football scoreboard struck by lightning\n\nDonors at North Carolina State can’t be happy with this one.\n\nThe program’s brand new scoreboard was struck by lightning and shorted out during the Wolfpack’s game against Notre Dame.\n\nFans were cleared at Carter-Finley Stadium with N.C. State trailing the Fighting Irish 3-0 early in the second quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nColorado shuts out Nebraska in first half\n\nColorado’s offense hasn’t been as explosive as it was last week, but its defense is creating all sorts of issues for Nebraska. The Buffaloes have a 13-0 lead at halftime.\n\nTen of the 13 Buffalo points were off turnovers, and they scored all of their points in the final 4:20 of the half. Shedeur Sanders is 14-of-21 with 134 yards and one touchdown, and head coach Deion Sanders said it's the defense keeping the Buffaloes up, forcing three turnovers in the first 30 minutes.\n\n“We wasn’t clicking on all cylinders,” Sanders told Fox Sports at halftime. “The defense has been holding up strong and I'm proud of that.”\n\nA fierce Big 12 rivalry that’s set to renew with Colorado re-joining the conference next year, Sanders has made it known the importance of this game, and he reminded fans before heading back into the locker room.\n\n“This game is personal,” he said. “This game is 13-0, we should be up a lot more.” — Jordan Mendoza\n\nUtah score today: Utes struggling in brutal Texas heat\n\nNo. 12 Utah, playing its second straight week without injured starting quarterback Cameron Rising, is struggling against unranked Baylor, and trails 10-3 at halftime.\n\nThe Bears lost last week against Texas State and are also playing without their top quarterback, Blake Shapen, who injured his knee in that game.\n\nIt was 95 degrees in Waco for the 11 a.m. kickoff with an expected high of 101 by the time the game ends.\n\nUtah’s first half drives ended in three punts, an interception and a Cole Becker 31-yard field goal.\n\nBaylor took a 10-3 lead on a short Sawyer Robertson touchdown run. Robertson threw for 126 yards in the first half, while Dominic Richardson paced the ground game with 67 yards. — Scooby Axson\n\nGeorgia gets insane interception as Bulldogs jump to big lead\n\nEverything is going right for Georgia in the second quarter, as the Bulldogs have built up a 31-0 lead at the half and got an interception you had to see to believe.\n\nDown 14-0, Ball State quarterback Kadin Semonza attempted a pass, but it deflected off a Cardinal player’s back foot, and went right into the hands of Chaz Chambliss for the pick. The Bulldogs put up all 31 first-half points in the second quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes get in end zone after interception\n\nAnother Nebraska turnover, more Colorado points.\n\nColorado is making it a nightmare for Nebraska quarterback Jeff Sims.

Colorado got the ball at the 19-yard line and went three-and-out, but the field position helped as Jace Feely nailed a 31-yard field goal to give Colorado a 3-0 lead with a little more than four minutes before halftime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Missed field goal ends Nebraska’s promising drive\n\nThe bad luck continues for the Cornhuskers.\n\nAfter a scoreless 20 minutes, Nebraska went from its 9-yard line to Colorado territory. But things took a turn on a third down, as a man in motion got in the way of the snap and Nebraska was able to fall on it to keep the ball on fourth down. The quick turn of events continued with Tristan Alvano’s 45-yard field goal attempt hitting the right upright, keeping Nebraska and Colorado scoreless with under seven minutes left in the first half. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTerrell Owens, Michael Irvin, Chauncey Billups among stars who show up for Deion's home debut\n\nSome high-profile former athletes made their way to Boulder, Colorado, to watch Deion Sanders coach in his home debut against Nebraska.\n\nA packed house was at Folsom Field for the 10 a.m. local kickoff.

Colorado responded by getting into Nebraska territory, but penalties hurt the Buffaloes and they punted from the Nebraska 35-yard line. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next drives, and Nebraska will begin the second quarter with a punt.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of Deion Sanders, is 6-for-9 with 40 yards and three carries for 18 yards in the opening frame. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOhio State score today: Buckeyes break tie with another Marvin Harrison Jr. TD\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. had just two catches for 18 yards against Indiana in Ohio State’s 23-3 win last week.\n\nIn the first quarter against Youngstown State, the junior wideout has four receptions for 122 yards and his first two touchdowns of the 2023 campaign.\n\nAfter Harrison’s first TD put Ohio State ahead 7-0, Youngstown State put together a 75-yard scoring drive -- highlighted by a 36-yard pass play on third-and-3 – that tied things up 7-7 at Ohio Stadium.\n\nOhio State followed with a three-and-out, but on its next possession Kyle McCord found Harrison in the end zone for a 39-yard TD.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead 14-7 after one quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nGeorgia gets on the board with punt return touchdown\n\nAfter a slow start on offense, it's the Georgia special teams getting the Bulldogs on the board.\n\nMekhi Mews took a Ball State punt and returned it 69 yards to the house, the first punt return for a touchdown for the Bulldogs in 14 years. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nGeorgia score today: Bulldogs off to sluggish start\n\nOne quarter down and Ball State is giving the defending champions all it can, preventing Georgia from getting on the scoreboard in a 0-0 tie.\n\nAfter a solid kick return to open the game, the Bulldogs offense got it to the Ball State 10-yard line, but Peyton Woodring hooked a 28-yard field goal left.

Virginia will also wear helmet decals of the players' numbers (1, 15 and 41) and sport legacy patches. James Madison will also wear helmet decals in honor of the players\n\n“It’s difficult for me. Some days are harder than others, right, and same for those players and the staff,” Virginia head coach Tony Elliott said this week, via the Daily Progress. “I can’t imagine what it’s like for their families dealing with it. We have an opportunity as a community, as a football program, fan base to pay respect to the three young men, their families, and then also the other 125 guys that have chosen to stay the course, do what’s difficult, and show up every single day.” — Scooby Axson\n\nOhio State score today: Marvin Harrison Jr. catches 71-yard TD for 7-0 lead\n\nThe No. 4 Buckeyes struggled to get anything going on offense during their opener against Big Ten rival Indiana last week.

It’s been one week since their Buffs upset TCU in Texas 45-42. And now they face Nebraska, their old rival in a game that issued more than 800 media credentials, the most ever at CU and highest since 2001. It was also the most expensive ticket in CU football history, according to TickPick, an online ticket marketplace that listed prices at $385 and up Friday night.\n\nThe big reason for it is Sanders, whose win last week and flamboyant overhaul of the team have been the talk of the sports world recently after the Buffs finished last year 1-11 under a different coaching staff. — Brent Schrotenboer\n\nCollege football picks Week 2\n\nThe names of elite schools in college football don't get much bigger than Alabama and Texas. The pair represents the upper-crust of programs have shaped a significant history of the sports. So when the Crimson Tide and Longhorns clash Saturday in Tuscaloosa, it's not surprising that most of the country will be on that game. Alabama needs a victory to help silence some of the doubters about the direction of the program. Texas needs a big win to establish credibility after almost 15 years out of the national title picture.\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports’ expert picks for all of Saturday’s the ranked games.\n\nColorado QB Shedeur Sanders gets timely motivation from Tom Brady ahead of Nebraska game\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders received a text message from a trusted mentor of his shortly after leading his team to a stunning 45-42 win Saturday at TCU.\n\nThe mentor was Tom Brady, the legendary former NFL quarterback.\n\nHis message was simple: “Don’t be satisfied.”\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nWhy is Deion Sanders on TV so much?\n\nTV companies lined up to show Deion Sanders’ games for their intrigue and entertainment value with Sanders as a new head coach at the highest level of college football.\n\nThen advertisers lined up to buy ads during these games, betting it will get them a big audience for their brands at a cost of around $130,000 for 30 seconds if they bought the air time recently for his next game Saturday against Nebraska.\n\nBefore and after kickoff, the broadcasters themselves then focus on Sanders throughout the game, knowing he's the big reason viewers are tuning in.\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nNo. 11 Notre Dame at North Carolina State predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, noon ET, ABC\n\nWhy watch: Though the Fighting Irish had to go a long way for one of their two relatively easy wins, this true road game could serve as their first real test of the campaign. The Wolfpack handled a road opener against an improved Connecticut program and now looks to make an even bigger splash. The setting will be familiar for new Notre Dame QB Sam Hartman, who went 2-2 against the Wolfpack at Wake Forest but with neither win coming in Raleigh. N.C. State QB Brennan Armstrong has no history with the Fighting Irish, as he missed Virginia’s 28-3 loss to Notre Dame due to an injury in 2021.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: It probably won’t be a shootout. The Wolfpack defense, anchored by LB Payton Wilson, is stronger than any the new-look Irish offense has seen to date. But Notre Dame isn’t likely to surrender many big gainers either, so the intensity level should still be high in the fourth quarter. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Eddie Timanus: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Erick Smith: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Jace Evans: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Paul Myerberg: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Scooby Axson: Notre Dame\n\nNebraska at No. 25 Colorado predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, noon ET, Fox\n\nWhy watch: Colorado games have suddenly become appointment viewing after the Buffaloes made the biggest splash of opening weekend. They’ll now look to follow their takedown of TCU in their first home game of the Deion Sanders era against old Big Eight rival Nebraska. The Cornhuskers are also under new management with Matt Rhule back in the college game. But his debut outing at Minnesota produced another late collapse to which NU fans have grown all too accustomed. The promising development for the Cornhuskers was the overall performance of the defense, but Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders and his array of fast targets will bring a bit more fire power. Nebraska QB Jeff Sims is well aware he must take better care of the ball.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Colorado’s overall team speed would make the Buffaloes a much stronger comeback candidate should they somehow fall behind. An early Cornhuskers’ deficit would seem more difficult to overcome given Nebraska’s unproven ability to put up fast points.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Nebraska\n\nNebraska Eddie Timanus: Colorado\n\nColorado Erick Smith: Colorado\n\nColorado Jace Evans: Colorado\n\nColorado Paul Myerberg: Nebraska\n\nNebraska Scooby Axson: Colorado\n\nTexas vs. Alabama predictions\n\nHere’s who our staff is predicting will win this No. 3 vs. No. 10 matchup:\n\nDan Wolken: Alabama\n\nAlabama Eddie Timanus: Alabama\n\nAlabama Erick Smith: Alabama\n\nAlabama Jace Evans: Alabama\n\nAlabama Paul Myerberg: Alabama\n\nAlabama Scooby Axson: Texas\n\nCollege football Week 2 bold predictions\n\nDisappointments and better-than-expected performances are anticipated each weekend in the wild world of college football.

It's been difficult to follow all the moving pieces during past weeks and months.\n\nWe knew last summer that more lucrative TV deals would soon lure UCLA and Southern California to the Big Ten for the 2024 season. Likewise, Texas and Oklahoma announced plans to move to the SEC. But little did we know how many other programs also would soon be moving.\n\nWhat's transpired in the Pac-12, Big 12 and Big Ten in the recent weeks has grabbed most of the college realignment headlines, but big changes are coming to both the Power Five and the Group of Five by this time next year. This season, the Big 12 will welcome three teams from the American Athletic Conference: Central Florida, Cincinnati and Houston.\n\nIn the past four decades, teams moved, conferences grew and a few collapsed. That doesn't sound much different than today's situation – other than the rapid pace at which these changes are unfolding.

He finished with a score of -11, four strokes ahead of Ludvig Åberg, who was competing in his first Masters.\n\nScheffler started the day on top of the leaderboard, but the final round was not smooth sailing.

He joins Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters multiple times as the world No. 1.\n\nWoods finished at the bottom of the golfers who made the cut with a score of +16.

The year prior, Scheffler banked $2.7 million. — Adam Woodard, Golfweek\n\nScottie Scheffler reacts to Masters win\n\nAfter winning his second Masters Tournament, Scottie Scheffler talked about the significance of winning and having a child.\n\n\"You’re about to make me cry here in Butler Cabin,\" Scheffler said. \"It’s a very special time for both of us. I can’t put it into words what it means to win this tournament again. I really can’t put into words what it means to be a father for the first time.\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nLudvig Åberg finishes first career Masters in line for second\n\nIt’s hard to have a better debut than Ludvig Åberg just did at Augusta.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Sweden finished his first Masters with a score of -7 on Sunday and was in second place. He shot -3 for the final round with a double bogey and five birdies.\n\nÅberg scored par on the final hole. When his last shot drained in the cup, the crowd cheered loudly.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of things that we did very well this week, especially today,\" Åberg said. \"I came out today, I was very nervous, I was shaking… It’s a privilege to be in this position.\"\n\nLast season, he finished first in the PGA Tour University program as a member of Texas Tech’s golf team. Now, he’s making his name as one of the best up-and-coming golfers in the big leagues. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nScottie Scheffler on brink of second Masters victory with late birdie\n\nIs the green jacket Scottie Scheffler’s to lose? At this point, it would seem so.\n\nThe top-ranked golfer extended his lead to four strokes when he made a birdie on hole No. 16, his third birdie in four holes and his seventh birdie of the day. He now has a score of 11 under par with two holes to go.\n\nScheffler made the long drive to put the ball squarely on the green. He then tapped in the putt, much to the delight of the crowd. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nScottie Scheffler opens up lead as late groups battle Amen Corner\n\nThe drama continues to build at Augusta.\n\nScottie Scheffler hit three straight birdies to further his lead heading into Amen Corner. But the margin is down to two strokes after he hit a bogey on hole No. 11. He also hit a bogey on hole No. 4 and hole No. 7.\n\nOther pairings are battling through Amen Corner with the green jacket still very much on the line. Ludvig Åberg hit a double bogey on hole No. 11 but finished the trio of holes with a birdie. His Max Homa hit two over par on hole No. 12. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nNeal Shipley speaks on Tiger Woods pairing at Masters\n\nAmateur Neal Shipley earned his way into the 88th playing of the Masters with his runner-up finish at the 2023 U.S. Amateur at Cherry Hills Country Club in Colorado last summer. Now, he’s leaving Augusta National Golf Club as the Low Amateur at the Masters, the only one to make the cut and a Sunday in which he was paired with five-time champion Tiger Woods.\n\nShipley, a grad student from Ohio State, finished 12-over par.\n\n“Playing with Tiger, Sunday at the Masters, the whole week, I think I have to win one of these things to kind of top this week,” Shipley said after his final-round 1-over 73.\n\n“Today being out there with Tiger, we were chatting. We talked a lot about just golf, (Woods’ son) Charlie and just normal things. He’s such a normal guy and really cool. He was great to me all day. Couldn’t be more appreciative of him just being awesome today, and it was just really cool to be around him and just the attention he gets and the roars. The crowds were phenomenal.\"\n\n—Cameron Jourdan, Golfweek\n\nRace for Green Jacket turns into four-way tie at the top of leaderboard\n\nAll of a sudden, we have a four-way tie atop the leaderboard.\n\nScottie Scheffler bogeyed No. 7, his second dropped stroke over his last four holes, to fall to 6-under par. More importantly, that set up the logjam, where he joins Collin Morikawa and Ludvig Åberg in the tie for first.\n\nMax Homa would birdie No. 8 to join the group.\n\nMorikawa has been the steadiest of the three, with clean, if unspectacular, pars in each of the seven holes he has played thus far. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nScottie Scheffler teases extended lead before bogey\n\nScottie Scheffler gave himself a little breathing room with a birdie on hole No. 3 in the fourth round of the Masters. Key word: little.\n\nThe tournament leader finished the Par 4 hole in three strokes. On his second shot, he smacked the ball cleanly from the sand bunker and it landed just a few feet away from the cup. The world No. 1 player then made an easy putt to finish the hole.\n\nThe next hole, he hit a bogey. On the Par 3 No. 4, Scheffler whiffed his putt just beyond the cup to miss par. He then tapped the ball in to add a stroke to his score.\n\nScheffler, who will be a new dad any minute now, retains his -7 score at the top of the Augusta standings. His round partner Collin Morikawa and Max Homa are one stroke behind him in second place. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nPair of birdies move Max Homa, Ludvig Åberg up the leaderboard\n\nThe competition is fierce in the fourth round of the Masters and hole No. 2 seems to be where the magic is happening.\n\nBoth Max Homa and Ludvig Åberg, who are paired, scored birdies on the hole to move up the leaderboard.\n\nHoma’s shot was his first birdie in 34 holes. He finished the hole in four strokes for one under par. He now has a -6 score to tie Collin Morikawa for second place.\n\nÅberg also found the cup in four strokes, completing it with a smooth putt. His score of -5 puts him in fourth place. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nScottie Scheffler and Collin Morikawa tee off in Masters fourth round\n\nAt 2:35 p.m. ET, Scottie Scheffler began his final round at the Masters in an attempt to win his second green jacket. The tournament leader stood next to the tee, did a little waddle, raised his club up and down and struck the ball with a long drive. The ball landed firmly on the fairway.\n\nHis group mate, Collin Morikawa, then stepped up to the tee, took a little less preparation, and landed his ball down the fairway as well. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nCameron Smith nails eagle to keep Masters hopes alive\n\nAnything can happen at Augusta.\n\nCameron Smith knows that and just scored an eagle on hole No. 2 in the fourth round to keep himself in the mix for the green jacket. He completed the five-par hole in three strokes with a chip shot from the sand bunker.\n\nThe shot sprung him into fifth place with a score of -3, tied with Bryson DeChambeau. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nTiger Woods reflects on 2024 Masters performance\n\nTiger Woods finished his performance at the Masters with a score of +16 after going +10 on Saturday, the worst round of his career at Augusta. His sixth green jacket seems farther away than ever before.\n\n“I think that just the wind and what it was doing out here to the golf shots,” Woods told reporters of what was difficult this year. “... It doesn’t take much to get out of position here and unfortunately I got out of position a lot.”\n\nHe said that his familiarity with Augusta makes it a special place for him to compete.\n\n“It’s always nice coming back here because I know how to play it,” he said, noting that he’ll have to get some homework in ahead of upcoming events like the U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club in North Carolina where he's not as comfortable with the course.\n\nWoods withdrew from last year’s Masters due to pain and also pulled out of the Genesis Invitational in February due to illness. He said overall he said this Masters performance was “a good week all around.” – Victoria Hernandez\n\nTiger Woods ends 2024 Masters in last place\n\nTiger’s day, and his 26th Masters appearance, is now over. Barring a collapse from other players at the bottom of the field, Woods will finish in 60th, in last place, at 16-over par. The next closest players are Vijay Singh and Erik van Rooyen, both of whom are 14-over.\n\nWoods would settle toward the end of the round, birdieing No. 15 before he converted three pars to close the round.\n\nOne of the day’s big movers is Tom Kim. He started the day at 11-over par and has converted eight birdies – including six on his first eight holes of the Back 9 – to climb to 4-over through 16. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTiger Woods goes vintage — at least for one shot\n\nHe may be firmly in last place, at 16-over par, but Tiger Woods is still providing glimpses of why he’s a fan favorite. At the par-three No. 16, Tiger’s tee shot found the greenside bunker. His shot out of the bunker, though, was vintage Tiger; he lofted it well past the pin and let the slope do most of the work. The ball softly rolled about 20 feet to get within inches of the hole to save par.\n\nWoods is making his way through his final hole of the round.\n\nElsewhere on the course, World Golf Ranking No. 2 player Rory McIlroy did everything he needed to do on No. 2, except sink the eagle putt. Needing just about eight feet, he pushed the ball just right of the hole. It got worse: his birdie try from about three feet was also pushed so he had to settle for a disappointing three-putt par. He’s currently 4-over through two. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhen is Scottie Scheffler teeing off at the Masters on Sunday?\n\nTop-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler will tee off at 2:35 p.m. ET on Sunday in the fourth round of the Masters. He’s paired with Collin Morikawa.\n\nScheffler, who is hoping to capture his second title at Augusta, is currently first in the field with a score of -7. Morikawa is one stroke behind for second place. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nTony Finau, Jon Rahm tee off in Round 4\n\nAs we get closer and closer to the group of players in the red teeing off, there are still some notable names who have hit the course. The pairing of Jon Rahm and Tony Finau has made its way to No. 3, with Rahm dropping an early stroke on the second hole – one where many golfers Sunday have gained ground – to get to 5-over par. Finau would capitalize on that makeable No. 2 to record a birdie to get to 4-under, as he tries to get under par.\n\nElsewhere, Brooks Koepka, who has two second-place finishes in his Masters career, has had an uneven round; he’s through No. 7 and has three bogeys to match three birdies. Koepka is at 6-over par.\n\nMore or less the same goes for Phil Mickelson, who went bogey-birdie-bogey on Nos. 2, 3 and 4, respectively. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nVerne Lundquist reflects on final Masters, explains decision to step away\n\nOn Sunday, Verne Lundquist is walking up to the final green of his Masters broadcasting career.\n\nThe longtime sports broadcaster has been a stalwart of Masters coverage for four decades, but the 2024 golf major will be the last that he calls at Augusta in a plan that has been two years in the making.\n\nLundquist has been behind the microphone for many memorable calls over the years, and recently labeled Tiger Woods' iconic chip on hole No. 16 in 2005 and Jack Nicklaus' putt in 1986 as the two best calls of his golf career. On April 13, he had an opportunity to reflect on what 40 years of the Masters has meant to him.\n\n\"Fortieth means I'm old,\" Lundquist said with a laugh. \"And final − it's filled with emotion, it really is. This place has been so special for my personal and my professional life.\"\n\nFor more, click here.\n\nNeal Shipley making most of pairing with Tiger Woods\n\nNot only is amateur Neal Shipley having a solid day – he started the day at 11-over par and shaved a pair of strokes on the front nine – he also has the privilege of being paired on Sunday at the Masters with Tiger Woods.\n\nCameras have caught the two, at times, talking, with Woods appearing to give Shipley small pieces of advice. Shipley is actually a grad student at Ohio State and is the only amateur who made the cut. Shipley’s caddy is a close high school friend.\n\nShipley is currently 10-under par and just nearly sunk a putt at No. 10 for what would’ve been his fourth birdie of the day, but he settled for par.\n\nWoods remains in last place, at 15-over. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nHole No. 5 presenting an opportunity for Sunday Masters golfers\n\nIf early play is any indication, the 575-yard second hole Par 5 at Augusta National may present a chance for players in contention to move up the leaderboard. The second eagle of the day was recorded at No. 2, as Min Woo Lee piped his driver just over the fairway bunker to set up an approach he beautifully eased onto the green. Lee is sitting at 5-over par.\n\nMeanwhile, the struggles continue for Tiger Woods, who is now in sole possession of last place, at 15-over par. He followed his triple-bogey at No. 5 with a bogey at No. 6. He did settle for rather uneventful pars on Nos. 7 and 8 as he approaches the turn. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTiger Woods records first triple-bogey of his 2024 Masters\n\nAfter previously taming the par-four fifth in the previous rounds, Tiger Woods recorded his first triple-bogey at the 2024 Masters. He sliced his tee shot sliced deep to the right, shot a provisional and then had to return to the tee to drive once more. That one found the fairway, but his approach landed well right of the pin. He deftly found a ridge to get his bogey try closer to the pin, but his following putt curled just around the hole, setting up the tap-in triple.\n\nWoods is currently 14-over par through five.\n\nElsewhere on the course, we saw our first eagle of Sunday, as American Kurt Kitayama flushed his tee shot at No. 2 to set up the chance to shave two strokes off his score. He’s at 9-over par after consecutive pars at Nos. 3 and 4. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTiger Woods gets off to shaky start in Round 4 of Masters\n\nAfter a rough third round Saturday in which he posted a career-worst Masters score of 10-over par, Tiger Woods has started his final round rather mixed.\n\nHe parred the first, birdied the second and bogeyed the third.\n\nAt No. 1, Tiger found the fairway off the tee box and then had his approach trickle off the green. He chipped his way to a makeable putt to earn par.\n\nHe aggressively attacked the Par 5 No. 2 and got onto the green in two shots, setting up a lengthy eagle attempt. He would have to settle for a two-putt and his first birdie of the round.\n\nAt No. 3, a precise tee shot set up another chance to shave a stroke off his score, but Woods’ chip up the slope in front of the green didn’t have enough pace, and it rolled back down the hill. He flubbed his par save and would tap in for bogey. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nTiger Woods pars first hole at fourth round of Masters\n\nAnd we’re off! Tiger has historically played this hole an abysmal 18 over par, but he’s 1 under this week. Tiger found the fairway in prime spot to attack the back pin, perched atop a plateau, but his approach landed on the green and just leaked off the edge. He hit a nifty chip from there to run about four feet short and got in for par to start the day. Nice and smooth. And he’s moving pretty well, too.\n\n– Adam Woodard, Golfweek\n\nMasters leader Scottie Scheffler says he'll leave if his wife goes into labor\n\nAUGUSTA, Ga. – Scottie Scheffler is flying solo this week at the Masters, and for good reason.\n\nHis wife, Meredith, who usually travels with him when he competes, is back home in Dallas awaiting the birth of their first child later this month.\n\nAfter shooting 1-under 71 at Augusta National on Saturday to take a one-stroke lead after 54 holes, Scheffler confirmed yet again that he will leave the 88th edition of the Masters no matter the circumstances if his wife goes into labor. Asked on Saturday evening to detail his plan, he said, \"Definitely have a way to get home pretty quickly. We have somebody here that has access to their cell phone, if that’s all right.” He turned to the Masters member moderating the press conference as if making sure that would be permitted. “And, yes, I’ll be available to go home then whenever I need to.\"\n\n– Adam Schupak, Golfweek\n\nMasters Round 4 start time\n\nThe final round of the Masters starts at 9:15 a.m. ET on Sunday when Adam Hadwin and Vijay Singh tee off.\n\nWhat time does Tiger tee off at the Masters?\n\nTiger Woods is set to tee off at 9:35 a.m. ET.\n\nNew swing coach for Tiger Woods at the Masters?\n\nTiger Woods' son Charlie joined his father on the driving range Sunday morning at Augusta National, where Charlie appeared to be coaching his dad ahead of Sunday's the fourth round of the Masters.\n\nAfter making history with a 24th consecutive made cut at Augusta, the elder Woods endured his worst Masters round ever by shooting a 10-over 82 in the third round on Saturday and will not be among those in contention on Sunday.\n\nMasters tee times for Sunday\n\nHere is every tee time and pairing for the final round of the Masters.\n\nMasters 2024 TV schedule\n\nYou can check out the Masters over-the-air television schedule for the final round here.\n\nThe Masters live stream\n\nFor cord-cutters, select focuses of the Masters will be available on Paramount+ and ESPN+ over the four-day event.

Of the eight who advanced to the weekend, five lost positions, two remained the same and one even gained a little ground on the field.\n\nHere’s how the remaining LIV players have fared through three rounds at the 2024 Masters.\n\nBryson DeChambeau: 5th, 3 under\n\nCameron Smith: T-9, 1 under\n\nPatrick Reed: T-16, 1 over\n\nTyrrell Hatton: T-21, 3 over\n\nBrooks Koepka: T-36, 6 over\n\nPhil Mickelson: T-36, 6 over\n\nJoaquin Niemann: T-21, 3 over\n\nJon Rahm: T-28, 5 over\n\nMissed cut: 6 over and worse\n\n— Adam Woodard, Golfweek\n\nMasters weather: Augusta forecast\n\nHere’s the Sunday forecast for the Masters.\n\nMasters prize money 2024\n\nHere is the purse breakdown for the 2024 Masters.\n\nMasters winners: Who has won the most Green Jackets?\n\nJack Nicklaus holds the record for most Masters wins with six. Tiger Woods has the second-most wins with six. Arnold Palmer has four wins. Here’s the full Masters winners list, year by year.\n\nHow many hole-in-ones have been hit in Masters history?\n\nThere have been 34 hole-in-ones in Masters history. The first came in 1934 from Ross Somerville, who smoked an ace from 145 yards out on the 16th hole. Shockingly, Somerville was an amateur at the time he made that hole-in-one. The most recent hole-in-one came in 2022 from Stewart Cink on the same hole, using an 8-iron to hit the cup 166 yards away.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mens-basketball/2023/01/23/notre-dame-mens-basketball-faces-a-crossroads-so-theres-plenty-to-dissect/69823694007/", "title": "Notre Dame men's basketball faces a crossroads, so there's plenty ...", "text": "Tom Noie: It still doesn't seem real, the events of the past week. Here we are in late January, a time when we should be talking/plotting/dreaming about what Notre Dame needs to do the rest of the way to get back to the NCAA tournament. Instead, the Irish season has gone off the rails, the head coach has decided (likely with a nudge) that this season will be his last, and the program is staring at a future that is, at best, uncertain. Mike Brey was right - this whole college basketball thing really is fragile. We're about to find out just how much. Anyway, how's your month been? Probably better than Brey, who's set to leave after season No. 23. He'll be the first to admit that it's time, and it is. It's also time to talk Notre Dame men's basketball, which we'll do today forever however long you want to ask, vent, etc. Just make sure to include your name and hometown. And with that, you know how this goes. Let's light this chat candle...\n\nGuest: I congratulate Tom for his fair & balanced critique of ND b-ball over these past years. I thought his article Sunday highlighting the top 23 games under Coach Brey was particularly effective to remind us all of the skill & leadership Coach has given the players & fans over his 23 seasons.\n\nTom Noie: Skill and leadership and, oh, by the way, a heck of a lot of memories and games and wins that nobody thought possible back in 2000. Should this program have won more? Yes. Should it have been better in the NCAA tournament? Absolutely. But rewind back to July 2000 when Mike Brey walked in the door of the Joyce Center. How many fans of a program that was dying a slow death would've taken nearly 500 wins? Three Sweet 16s? Two Elite Eights? A freaking ACC tournament championship after beating Duke and North Carolina? How many would've taken that? How about everybody. This isn't ending the way anyone imagined, but it was one hell of a ride. That you can't argue. Roll through the 23 memories of Brey's 23 seasons for evidence.\n\nMike, Nyona lake: Recruiting question. Keep hearing N.D. can't recruit because of standards. Just can not believe there are not three or four kids in the whole USA that are not smart enough to go to N.D. and still play ball. Maybe not top ten guys but 15 thru 80. Maybe not get the one or two to make you a national champ every year but good enough to be in the top twenty and at least compete for the top half in the ACC. You can not tell me that none of the teams that do compete every year don't have some standards also.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Two questions in and and we've already reached the non-believer section. That's OK. I get it. One former Irish assistant coach said years ago - a decade or so back - that even back then, in the mid-2000s, out of the top 100 high school seniors maybe 10 - maybe - would have the grades to get into Notre Dame for basketball. Of those 10, maybe two, sometimes three would actually have a passing interest in the program. That was then. Now? Maybe one or two top 100 would be seriously interested in Notre Dame. The admission standard remains the standard. I can't tell you that \"none of the teams that do compete every year don't have some standards,\" but I will. Notre Dame often can't touch the prospects that go to Duke or Carolina or Kansas or UCLA or even Virginia. It's a harder job than anyone wants to admit, which is why it's a lot closer to Boston College and Georgia Tech than anyone wants to admit.\n\nSteve McTigue: Tom, what do you think the Irish are looking for in a new head coach?? Don’t you think they should secure that position fairly soon to avoid to many portal transfers, and to bring in new talent?\n\nTom Noie: Steve: A coach with a plan would be a good start. Notre Dame is going to be this kind of a team on offense, and be that kind of a team on defense. There seemed no plan the last couple of years, just kind of roll the ball out. When you watch how other teams run offense, with different actions and sets you're struck by how Notre Dame doesn't nothing like that. Same goes for defense. And then there's the overall structure of the roster. I'm all for rolling more guys through and being multiple - not the same stuff from the same five guys. So you need a little of everything from someone who's got endless energy, someone who's going to sell his program, and the sell the fans the product is worth watching... Tom Noie: ...As for the second part of your question, I'd be surprised (stunned) if this was a quick hire. Now, if you believe Chris Quinn or Sean Sweeney (both NBA assistants) are the answer, and you can get them out of their current jobs today, you do it. But no sitting college coach is going to leave in the middle of the season for another job. I expect this process to be more exploratory for the next six, seven weeks where Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick does his due diligence, narrows his list to a select few in early March, then zeroes in on a candidate as that coach's season comes to an end. Everyone wants a timeline and wants it to be sooner than later, but it wouldn't surprise me if this pushes closer to April. And it's Jan. 25. Buckle up. This is going to be a loooooooooong haul.\n\nTerry: How is it that the ND Women’s BB program can continually recruit the top players in the country and the men’s team can’t even sniff a top recruit?\n\nTom Noie: Terry: Let's start with this - it's comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the game is the same - they play on rims that are 10 feet and courts that are 94 feet long and all that, but comparing what the Notre Dame men's program can't do compared to the Notre Dame women's program is downright silly. The Notre Dame women's program is one of the sport's bluebloods - Connecticut, Tennessee, Stanford, etc. It SHOULD recruit the elite of the elite. Asking why the men's program can't do what the women's program can do is like asking why the Notre Dame men's program can't be like Duke or North Carolina. The men's program and the women's program couldn't be more different.\n\nPaul R: If you were Jack Swarbrick, who would be your pick for next head coach and who do you think is most likely/realistic?\n\nTom Noie: Paul: I'm glad I'm not Jack Swarbrick having to figure this out, because, as has been mentioned, this is not going to be a quick-hire situation, as it was when he needed a football coach (Marcus Freeman) and women's basketball coach (Niele Ivey). It's hard to say who is likely/realistic because we have no idea what Notre Dame wants from its next head coach. Dynamic young guy? Established older guy? Someone in between. If he were to speak to the media, which he likely won't until the process ends, Jack Swarbrick would say he wants the best possible coach to lead Notre Dame. Who is that? I'll go, in no particular order, with Darian DeVries (Drake), Micah Shrewsberry (Penn State) and Pat Kelsey (Charleston) with wild cards being Chris Quinn and Sean Sweeney. But again, a disclaimer...nobody has ANY idea what direction this is going to go. None.\n\nMatt from Aldie, VA: Thanks, Tom. Quick two-parter: Bottom line, was Brey forced out against his will, or did he come to the realization before it got to that point? And are you hearing anything specific about what his role could be at ND in the future? He's a class act and it would be great to keep him on campus in some capacity, when he's ready. Bonus question: Since Brey has nothing to lose, do you foresee any dramatic lineup or strategic changes between now and the end of his tenure? Thanks again!\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Quick two-parter that doesn't have a quick answer. Last week's decision that this is it was a combination of factors. Jack Swarbrick is on record with the South Bend Tribune as saying that Mike Brey could coach at Notre Dame for as long as he wants. As December became January, that want-to waned. He just didn't feel like he could reach his guys and do the job the way the job needs to be done. I'm sure he went to Jack and Jim Fraleigh, the administrator in charge of men's basketball and they agreed. Some sort of separation agreement was reached and here we are. Tom Noie: As for a future role for Mike Brey at Notre Dame, that was more feel-good/wishful thinking than anything. When this season ends, he can't put Michiana in his rearview mirror fast enough. Save for returning for some reunion doings during football weekends, I don't expect Mike Brey to have any future reason to return. And if the first two games since his I'm-outta-here presser is any indication, he's going to ride into the college basketball sunset his way. The rotation hasn't changed much. I don't see that changing.\n\nMike, New Jersey: Hey Tom, Do you have any sense of direction Notre Dame will be going to in looking for the next Head Coach? Personally I’d love someone with Midwest ties who builds the roster with size, physicality, and athleticism.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Zero. Maybe less than zero. As mentioned earlier, Jack Swarbrick, should he choose to speak with the media, would hit all the high points on what he wants from the next men's basketball coach, but does he? An elite coach, a coach who's going to make this an elite program, may be too expensive. Does Notre Dame want to pay north of $3 million for an elite coach? My guess is no.\n\nGuest: monte williams or marty inglesby??\n\nTom Noie: Monty Williams. But again, you have to ask yourself - why would someone who has one of the best 30 jobs in the basketball coaching world where you have the best of everything at your fingertips while coaching the best of the best decide yeah, I'm done with this lifestyle of private planes and five-star hotels and sold-out arenas and international attention to go back to college and recruit high school kids? It's a tough sell. Maybe Monty Williams or Chris Quinn or Sean Sweeney, the three possible candidates with NBA ties are looking for a career change, but that's a big jump. The NBA is the great known. College basketball in 2023 and beyond is the great unknown.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Before we get to the back and forth of this, I want to make one comment. Prior to Brey's announcement of stepping down, you were writing about the failures of this season's team. You pulled no punches. You were exceptionally critical, but truthful to a fault. You must have a great deal of clout at SBT to take on a Notre Dame sports program like that. In any event, I admired and appreciated your accurate assessment of where this season was going. Tip of the cap to you.\n\nTom Noie: Thanks my man...say it louder for the people in the back...you know, the ones who shout from the shadows about how the beat guy should be more cheerleader and less critical. I'm glad someone understands that it just doesn't work that way. It can't. Not for the team you cover or the person covering it. The beat writer has to take the good and the bad and the ups and the downs and continue to tell the story. I hope I've done that. It's not easy, but that's our job. We have to do it whether the team we cover is 15-5 in the ACC or headed toward 5-15. Now....back to our discussion...😀\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, This team collapsed for many reasons. From the outside, I see 3 big ones. 1. Poorly coached. Go back to SYR at ND. I think Goodwin said, \"We didn't know what to do against the zone.\" WHAT? You've played in more games than anyone in ND history. You played against SYR 1,000 times. Edwards played the entire 2nd half 15 ft from the bucket. That's how far Boeheim extended. How hard is it to put LAZ or Ven under the hoop and force Edwards out of the middle of the zone? Then, Dane goes back to working the spot at the FT line. No ability to adapt. 2./3. No athleticism. On D, they play matador style. Wave the cape and let the bull go by. Hell, they escort opposing guards to the hoop. On O, they have no ability to beat anyone off the bounce. LY, you polled us about the MVP of the team. I said Wesley because you can't teach his athleticism and instinct for the game on O or D. But, I also said Paul A. was a close 2nd because his post play created space for the jump shooters. Now you see that 1st hand.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: All true. All of it. But here's the thing too about Notre Dame being poorly coached. This team, and teams before it, knew what they signed up for in playing for Mike Brey. He's not going to browbeat you into figuring out the zone. He's going to trust that your proverbial basketball IQ will see it and allow you to say, yeah, I get it. I know what to do. Brey's at fault for the collapse of this season, but is it his fault that he draws up the perfect baseline out of bounds play at the end of the Florida State game, only to have a super senior throw away what would've been a game-winning layup? Is it Brey's fault that a super senior can't effectively inbound the ball late in the game at 'Cuse? Or that another super senior can't make a critical WIDE OPEN 3-pointer in that game? Brey's at fault, but the guys he trusted to deliver didn't deliver. Tom Noie: Notre Dame misses Blake Wesley terribly and misses Paul Atkinson terribly, but don't dismiss what Prentiss Hubb brought to that group. Yeah, he took the occasional bad shot, but he brought a certain swagger a certain middle-finger to you attitude on the road that the rest of his teammates fed off and followed. Notre Dame won seven games away from home last year, and was 6-4 on the road in league play. The Irish are 0-5 on the ACC road this year and 0-7 overall. Ask yourself why, then remember P-Hubb.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, In your opinion, is the new coach, whiever it is, capable of \"patching this together\" or are we in a complete overhaul/rebuilding mode? Part 2 is I doubt ND will ever go for wholesale transfers to restock the program immediately. Do you feel the same way and if so, how does that impact the next coach's success?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: This is headed toward a complete teardown/overhaul/rebuild. On Tuesday, about an hour before the Notre Dame-North Carolina State game tipped, news broke that Brady Dunlap, one of the three recruits signed for next season, had asked for his release from Notre Dame. Had Dunlap remained in the fold, and if (massive if) Cormac Ryan decides to return for a sixth year, Notre Dame would have only 10 players on scholarship - and that's with nobody leaving. Dunlap's departure drops that number to nine. If Ryan decides it's time for a change, that number falls to eight. Dunlap probably won't be the only guy who decides to seek something else besides Notre Dame. That's the way of the college basketball world. Notre Dame has not been hit hard by the transfer portal, but I don't expect that to be the case. New coach wants a new direction. Somebody else is going to leave. Next year will suffer with a patchwork roster. Tom Noie: And Notre Dame won't stabilize through the transfer portal. While it's true that Notre Dame basketball has taken transfers in the past dating all the way back to Ryan Humphrey in 1999 and Dan Miller in 2001, the game has changed. Notre Dame could afford to take a Humphrey or a Miller or a Ben Hansbrough or a Scott Martin with a promise (and a wink) that though their transcripts might not mirror Notre Dame, they could get on the Notre Dame academic track during their sit-out seasons. There's no longer a sit-out season - kids are immediately eligible. It's not a coincidence that since the sit-out season went away, the only transfers to choose Notre Dame - Paul Atkinson and Marcus Hammond - are GRADUATE TRANSFERS. Now, the new coach may get a transfer break or two next season, but the portal is more myth than reality for Notre Dame. It just is.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, You, and others, have speculated about the next coach. I think you even mentioned Beilein and Pitino, both of whom are 70ish. If you really want to hire a 70 year old coaching legend, go after Coach K. While at Duke he repeatedly stated that the only place that could make him leave Duke was ND. Admitedly, that was some time ago, but \"ya never know until you ask.\"\n\nTom Noie: Joe: You know you're my guy, but that might be the silliest idea around. Beyond silly. Here's why - yes, John Beilein and Rick Pitino are both in their 70s, like Mike Krzyzewski. But they couldn't be more different. Here's why - Beilein and Pitino may both feel like they have something still to prove at the highest college level. Beilein for his epic failure in the NBA, Pitino for his epic exit from Louisville. It's no secret that Pitino wants back in to the white-hot spotlight of a major college job. If you know him, Iona's a stopover. A stop-gap. Beilein has long dreamed of coaching at Notre Dame. K? He's got too many NCAA championship and Olympic rings on his fingers to answer the phone.\n\nGuest: Play the bench already\n\nTom Noie: I don't see it happening. Mike Brey's going to do it his way. That's how Notre Dame got to where it is now - he's going to play the guys he trusts. He doesn't trust the bench. Not saying he's right, just saying Brey's going to Brey the rest of the way. As wrong as that might be.\n\nBill Milford ct.: hey Tom — your the man to trust on who’s coaching in 23 season -so my question is regarding the current commits. Give us a break down on each one’s strengths & weakness AND will they stay committed - can any expect to contribute right away ? thanks\n\nTom Noie: Bill: Notre Dame's incoming recruiting class slipped from three players to two following Tuesday's news that swingman Brady Dunlap from Harvard-Westlake High School in California has asked to be released from his letter of intent. Of the three - Markus Burton and Parker Friedrichsen - Dunlap might've been most ready to play given his size (6-foot-7). Burton and Friedrichsen are skilled guys, but also guys who look like they've never set foot in the weight room. It's so hard to say, even the in the best of years, how a prospect's going to carry over from high school to high Division I. No idea if they'll stay committed. It all depends on what the new coach wants, though it would be hard to see Burton going elsewhere. The last thing the new coach wants to do is run off the local kid. Both may HAVE to contribute next season given the uncertainty of the rest of the roster. We can't sit here on Jan. 25 as the snow falls outside and say we have ANY idea what Notre Dame's roster will look like next season.\n\nMatt: Tom, what do you think the time line will be on getting a new coach. Late March early April until they get the list and then interviews. The first recruits are the underclass men, 2023 class and then he can hit the portal.\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Late March at the earliest if everything falls into place. Mike Brey announcing when he did that this is it for him allows for everyone who might be interested in the job to really take a long look at it, and vice versa in terms of vetting candidates, but how much can you do with a sitting head coach in the middle of his season? Little. Next to nothing. So the timeline is going to be an extended one, unless there's a stealth candidate that Jack Swarbrick has identified who can be hired on say, Selection Sunday. Otherwise, pack your patience. This is going to take some time.\n\nMike,: Tom, do you think a few from the staff will stay to help smooth over the transition?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: I don't know how their contracts are structured - say, they're obligated to work through a certain date every year before it rolls over - but I can't see anyone from the current coaching or support staff saying, yeah, you know what, I'll help without any assurances that they're going to be retained. Mike Brey knows what he's going to be doing next year (hint: sitting on a beach in Florida) but his staff and support members are likely worried as much or more right now about where life is going to take them than what kind of defense Louisville might throw at them Saturday. It's human nature - you want to finish this out and do what's best for Notre Dame if you're an assistant coach, but you're also worried about where you're going to land in this profession. It's hard.\n\nMike, Nyona lake: Another question about recruiting. Just read your story in Monday paper about the five things a new coach should ask. If everything in that story is true then I guess that answers the question why there are no fans at the games. Been a season ticket holder for over 35 years. Give me one reason after reading this story I should renew next year.\n\nTom Noie: Mike the non-believer returns....what do you mean \"if everything in that story is true...\" Seriously? Come on, my man. I'd give you a reason why you should renew your tickets for next season, but you probably wouldn't believe it. Sorry.😄\n\nguest: Any thoughts on who you think will get the coaching job? Brad Stevens ?\n\nTom Noie: You're Brad Stevens, president of the Boston Celtics. You make close to $4 million a year. Why are you going back to college? Hard pass.\n\nJoe: My dream candidates that you throw a blank check are Billy Donovan, Tony Bennet and Dana Altman. Any of those above a 0% chance?\n\nTom Noie: Less than zero.\n\nJoe: I feel what made Brey’s offenses excel through the years was a floor general point guard. I know Hubb was better than perceived, but do you think that was the biggest issue the last 5 years. I’m confident we have more wins if Matt Farrell is on the team\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Here's what I don't get about the whole notion of this program has stunk for five seasons. Did last year NOT happen? Did Notre Dame not go 24-11 and win a school record 15 Atlantic Coast Conference games? Did it not have the school's only one-and-done in Blake Wesley? Was it not two minutes from getting to a Sweet 16? Please eliminate last season from the other four, where you do have a point. The pieces didn't fit those seasons. Brey hitched his coaching wagon to guys who didn't deliver, who should've been better than what they were - save for John Mooney who was left a bag of spare parts during his best seasons. Prentiss Hubb was really good for this program - trouble is, he was too inconsistent, which blinded fans' perspective of him.\n\nJoe: Obviously the program needs a breath of fresh air and reboot, but I can’t help but think they are such a better fit in today’s big east than the acc. I know men’s bball will never be the driver of nd’s conference alignment and I think the acc move was great at the time, but do you think there are any administrators in the athletic department that regret that move?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Did you see the Dec. 11 game against Marquette? Not only was the first sign that this run was over for Mike Brey, it was a sign that Notre Dame (as it's currently constructed) has no business being in the Big East. Notre Dame used to play like that. Notre Dame used to win like that. But the move to the ACC was done for more than just men's basketball. If Notre Dame were to be part of a conference on a sport by sport basis, the Big Ten and the Big East would fit better - but it would take time to overhaul the roster to fit those leagues. That's not how college athletics works. Jack Swarbrick had to take a big-picture 35,000-foot view of what league best served his entire athletic department. That's the ACC.\n\nJoe: It shocked me that Brey’s first game was a sellout. His engagement and personality could not have been more conducive to garnering fan support. I get that the losing the last few years is going to drive fans away (I was looking for Wake Forest tickets and it’s incredible that the cheapest ticket is $35), but what do you think the new coach has to do to re-energize the fan base?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Win, but even that's hard and not the only answer. Fans are hard to figure out. Notre Dame won last year - won in the ACC like it's never before won - and it had exactly one sellout (Duke). Fans today are beyond fickle. Even when you win, you sometimes lose. I can't imagine that had Brey played more than seven guys, the fan base would be like, whoa, gotta go out and see the Irish. Fans today are different. They'd rather stay home and watch it on their TVs. New coach isn't changing that.\n\nJoe: Correlation or coincidence that the program finally got it’s sought after practice facility and then went into a terrible tailspin?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: I'd say correlation. Notre Dame without a practice facility was a program with a certain underdog edge. Like, we practice in the basement of an old arena that has seats held together with Duct tape. We don't get any bells and whistles but you know what, we're still going to win. It got way more country club when Rolfs opened. It just did.\n\nJoe: Do you think there’s a difference between how the job is perceived nationally compared to how you perceive it up close and personal? I was particularly struck by Pat Forde’s column about the success of other catholic schools in college basketball and how strange that ND doesn’t match their consistent success.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: No, because what's the separator when you look at other Catholic schools. Let's take Gonzaga and Villanova for their previous sustained successes and Marquette and Xavier right now. All private schools, but all schools that don't play football. Basketball is the sole focus, it's where every single one of those schools' resources go toward. They better be good in men's basketball because that's what's going to make the most money. That's never going to be the case at Notre Dame, where it's football first and second and third and sometimes fourth and fifth. Pump the powers that be with truth serum and they'd probably admit - and maybe even without serum - that's it's critically important for Notre Dame football to be good for myriad reasons. Notre Dame basketball? Yeah, that matters and they want to get to the NCAA tournament, but if they don't, hey it's almost time for spring football. And who's the quarterback?\n\nJimmy D: Who realistically are the top 2-3 options to replace Brey? How soon after March madness can we expect an announcement?\n\nTom Noie: Jimmy: Realistically, there's no realistic top options because as was mentioned earlier, nobody knows what Jack Swarbrick wants out of this job. If you're realistically serious about winning national championships and going to Final Fours, then you hire Rick Pitino. He'll win. Maybe not the way anyone in the university would want, but he would. The next hire will tell us a lot of how men's basketball is viewed by the university. Timetable? Don't expect anything to happen before April. This is a long haul process.\n\nMark from Rochester, NY: Tom, I know there are games left in this lost season, but what are your thoughts on Starling? Does he stay for a new coach? Transfer? Professional? Thanks for all you do.\n\nTom Noie: Mark: He's played/developed like someone who knows he needs another year in college, whether that's at Notre Dame or elsewhere, we don't know. He was as tied to Mike Brey as any recruit in recent memory. He wanted to go to Notre Dame, but he also wanted to play for Brey. It's hard to see him going the NBA route based solely on his stats - 12.0 ppg., 2.9 rpg., 1.3 apg., .425 FG, .311 #-point, .640 FT. He needs at least another year to show what he can do well. What is that? I don't know, and I don't know if he knows. Blake Wesley set such a high bar that everyone expected the same (and more) from Starling. He's not built that way. Does he come back? That's a question you can ask for every single player on the roster and the two incoming recruits. Until a new coach is in place and every player sees how they fit, there's no real answer.\n\nMark from Rochester, NY: Tom, with how bad this season has been, I feel like the next 2-3 seasons could be more of the same. Talk me off the ledge\n\nTom Noie: Mark: Nope. You're on that ledge and have to decide for yourself if you want to slide back toward terra firma before that ledge snaps. When Mike Brey arrived, he had Troy Murphy and David Graves and a young Matt Carroll and an old Martin Ingelsby and Ryan Humphrey in a sit-out season. That program was built to win from the jump. This one's not. He's not leaving the cupboard completely bare, but there's a chance for it. Yeah, next year is going to brutal unless Jack Swarbrick nails this hire. He has to.\n\nAndrew from Mass: How many games do you project they win in conference this year? Not that I still think the season can be saved or anything but I am very curious\n\nTom Noie: Andrew: Notre Dame is staring down the barrel of 3-17 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Tuesday's loss at North Carolina State marked the unofficial halfway point - 10 games down, 10 to go. Notre Dame is 1-9 in the league. When you look at what's coming on the back half, you understand how desperate everything felt when Notre Dame lost its first two home games and lost getable games on the road against Florida State and Boston College. That was against the bottom half of the league. Look at February. Where do you see wins? You want to say Saturday at home against Louisville and maybe the following Saturday at home against Wake Forest. But those aren't guarantees. December and January were times for this program to stack a few wins. February was going to be brutal regardless. Even more so now that you have a lame-duck coach and a lame-duck roster in a lame-duck season. As bad as it's been to date, it might get worse.\n\nPat H. Springfield Illinois: Can’t disagree with any of your reporting and analyses. You did an exceptional and, most important, extremely fair job. What you are doing is what journalism is about - reporting history as it happens in a thorough and objective manner.\n\nTom Noie: Pat: Many thanks. When you've covered Notre Dame men's basketball for 25 seasons, you just want to be prepared for when something like this to max it all out and give readers they best sense and understanding of what it all means. I hope I've done that.\n\nPat H. Springfield Illinois: Forgot to ask my question: When can we expect Mike Bret to be inducted into the Ring of Honor?\n\nTom Noie: Pat: The Ring of Honor was Brey's baby. He chose the guys to go up. Somebody has to choose him. If I were the new coach, I'd wait a year or two before (if) everything gets back on track to where fans care and the wins are there and then give Brey his proper day.\n\nEM: Echoing Muffet McGraw’s comments in the immediate aftermath of Brey’s announcement, how can any N.D. men’s b-ball coach hope to compete and win in today’s environment - including, e.g., the transfer portal, NIL rules, and the general sense that every sport at N.D. takes a back seat to football? Having said that, how did McGraw manage to succeed where Brey didn’t?\n\nTom Noie: EM: You can't. Oh, you can try and do and say all the right things, but even then, it's only going to get you to the occasional Sweet 16 or Elite Eight. Notre Dame men's basketball is about players/prospects choosing Notre Dame for more than just basketball. Pat Connaughton is one of only two former Irish in the NBA, but he didn't seriously dream of being an NBA player when he was at Notre Dame. Now, when that dream materialized, Connaughton chased it and made himself an NBA player. Blake Wesley as well. But they're exceptions, not the rule. How did Notre Dame do it with Muffet McGraw? How many women's basketball players leave after one year for the WNBA? Apples to oranges again. Same sport, way different success models.\n\nTom from Sister Lakes MI: Hi Tom, Great coverage of Brey's retirement and the aftermath. Play along with me. Based on your many years of being around the program, Jack Swarbrick asks for your opinion on the new hire. JS has two questions for you: Should I hire a former ND player? If yes, who should it be? What are your answers?\n\nTom Noie: Tom: Still waiting for the phone to ring with Jack Swarbrick on the other end. Don't think he's going to do that anytime soon - OK, never - but I'll play along. I'd say, why, yes, you need to do whatever's needed to hire Monty Williams. He'd be more than a basketball coach at Notre Dame. And it's about way more than basketball there. It's a sense of spirituality, and Williams would definitely fit. He's won, he's as class as they come and he could relate to today's college athlete. He'd be perfect for the job, given nothing else than his life experiences. But again, if you're an NBA coach, at the peak of your profession, why college? Tom Noie: Do I get to keep my press pass?😃\n\nGuest: Tom, thanks for your terrific reporting. Given its many constraints, is it even possible that Notre Dame men’s basketball could ever be an elite program for an extended period, for example on a part with women’s program? Thanks for your consideration. From John, Leonardtown, MD\n\nTom Noie: John: Mike Brey was quick to say in his walking-away presser last week that the Notre Dame men's basketball job is a great job, but what he didn't say is it's a really hard job. For myriad reasons. I don't ever see it being elite - like Jay Wright made Villanova. It's a good program, that's expected to be great. If that's the case, the university needs to do everything in its power to make it great. They don't do that. They won't do that. That's what made Brey so unique - he accepted all of it and said, yeah, fine, I'm going to win anyway. Eventually, that fight wears on you, and wears you down. It did to Brey. Notre Dame is different in so many ways. Not always for the best when it comes to sustained basketball success.\n\nJoe C: Hi Tom. I just read your listing of 15 possible candidates to replace Coach Brey, who did a remarkable job during his tenure at ND. One coach I'm thinking you may have overlooked is Matt Langel from Colgate. Coach Langel checks all the boxes but one, that being no previous connection to ND. But he's the winningest coach in Colgate history, Patriot League Coach of the Year three straight years, and resurrected a program that has now been to the dance 3 of the last 4 years. He's young, graduates his players, and is accustomed to recruiting kids who need to meet rigorous academic standards. Plus he's used to living in snowy, cold-weather towns. And he's Catholic!! Your take, please, and thanks for hosting the forum.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Matt was No. 16 on my list, so he definitely was on my radar. I had to trim it somewhere, so I went with 15. Matt Langel fits.\n\nScottie: Tom, you made history Sunday for the first time ever the SB tribune had more ND bball articles than ND football congrats and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nTom Noie: Scottie: There's more where that came from. Keep reading!😃\n\nEd,Greensboro: Belated Happy New Year Help me understand how a group of players can find out their coach is leaving, and the go out and lay an egg against B.C.. Have they no. grit or pride? This is how we will remember this group.\n\nTom Noie: Ed: Good call. Mike Brey has done nothing but own where this season has gone. Notre Dame stinks, and he has said it's his fault. At what point do we point to the players. At what point does pride kick in? If you're ever going to win one league game, wouldn't you think Boston College would be it? How do you not win that game? Brey put all his trust in guys who've done nothing to reciprocate. Yeah, Notre Dame's a player or two short in the big picture, but where's the pride? The want-to? Don't know.\n\nGuest: With 6 more weeks in the regular season, what must happen so the Titanic does not completely sink?\n\nTom Noie: The violinists already are playing, the lifeboats are being lowered, there are people running from stern to bow and bow to stern. It's only a matter of time. Notre Dame is 1-9 in the league with a mind-numbing February still to come. If you can get off the boat now and get to dry land, do it. Don't hang around to see if Jack can get out of the makeshift brig. 😃\n\nGuest: Do you think it might be time to give VanLuben more court time? The same for Zona? They both appear to be active inside when given a few minutes. It is something that has been missing in most games.\n\nTom Noie: More Ven-Allen Lubin, still not sure on Matt Zona, but that's another conversation. Mike Brey admitted (yet again) that he erred in Saturday's loss to Boston College after he decided not to play Lubin more than six minutes in the second half after he was pretty good in the first. Best scenario for Notre Dame on Tuesday was Nate Laszewski picking up three really early fouls. Lubin had to play, and finished with 10 points, five rebounds and two blocks in 22 minutes. Notre Dame's best lineup might be Laszewski and Lubin with Cormac Ryan, Marcus Hammond and J.J. Starling. Let that group get loose. We've seldom seen it. One of the many missteps in recent weeks.\n\nJim from California: Why is the ND woman’s basketball team able to recruit the elite high school prospects in the nation and Canada, and the men’s team can’t?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: If you're an elite high school prospect and can go anywhere to play men's college basketball, why would you go to Notre Dame? You can go to Duke. You can go to Kansas. You can go to Kentucky. You can go to UCLA. Why would you ever pick Notre Dame? You wouldn't. The answer's obvious.\n\nGeorge Bernard: I heard Bill Walton this morning say that 25% of NBA players were international. When I went to check the internet I could only find a hit from 2020. Why is there not information from 2023? Surely it is known.\n\nTom Noie: George: Think you've been hanging around a bit too much with Bill Walton while listening to the Grateful Dead, if you catch my, um, drift. Thanks for the insight. I think. 😃\n\nBrian Batavia, IL: Hi Tom: The b-ball program went sideways after the 2017 Maui Invitational. I am surprised Brey lasted this long. His successor will not find a bed of roses when he arrives full time. There will be no allowance for one and done players. No throwing NIL money at recruits. The transfer portal will be curtailed by university brass. The only way this program can reach an Elite 8 presence on occasion is for the new coach to get lucky with recruits and be able to coach them up. The new coach will need to have more than 7 scholarships on his squad. The 7-man rotation beats the crap out of the players. Do you have a long term solution for the program with these constraints? If you do I’ll drive to South Bend and buy you drinks and dinner.\n\nTom Noie: Brian: A complete tear-down and overhaul of the Notre Dame men's basketball program as we know it would be a start. New head coach. New assistants. New voice. All needed. But a new direction. More support staff. Admissions restrictions relaxed. It wasn't a coincidence that Notre Dame rarely carried the maximum number of scholarship players allowed (13). Mike Brey's marching orders from the university was this - less is better. If you can get by with 10 or 11, we'd really appreciate it. Long-term? Many dark days are ahead. Can this program sidestep them? Good luck\n\nDave: Hi Tom for the next coach will they focus on a young uand coming guy with recruiting experience\n\nTom Noie: Dave: Only Jack Swarbrick knows, and he's not telling.\n\nDan - Chicago: I think we all overrated this team's talent before the year. I think especially in terms of Starling and Ryan and their expected contributions But yet, with even that said, I think this is the most disappointing team I have watched in terms of results vs talent on paper. Where does it rank for Tom?\n\nTom Noie: Dan: Somewhere beyond the bottom, and even then it might be too generous. A lot of this is on Brey, but a lot of it is on the players. They knew the drill. They knew what the roster was going to look like. Why, then, did Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski and Cormac Ryan decide to come back if they knew the pieces wouldn't fit or that they were a player or two short? They believed they could make another run. Maybe they fooled themselves. But this season was off the tracks almost from the start. We just didn't see it, or just figured once they get it figured it, they'd be fine. They never did figure it out. It's a complete collapse in every sense. Put it on Brey, but put it on a group that was given so much, but delivered so little.\n\nDan - Chicago: For the obvious question, who is your money on?\n\nTom Noie: Dan - Nobody, because I don't know what this program wants to be. Maybe when there's a no coach in place and it's five years down the road (and I'm hopefully still employed) we can say then, ahhhhhh, it all makes sense. We see why Notre Dame went the route it went. But now? It's had to point to one guy, one clear-cut guy and say, he's the slam-dunk hire who's going to make this all better.\n\nDan - Chicago: I know when you have a 7 man rotation it is hard to shake things up. But I think the one thing last thing that hasn't been tried is starting Lubin and giving him more minutes. Seems worth a shot. I hate to say it, but I might sit the 5 star recruit more in lieu of extra minutes for Lubin. Starling has been the least effective of the five guards.\n\nTom Noie: Mike Brey admitted he made a mistake against Boston College by not playing Ven-Allen Lubin more. Lubin played more Tuesday and was really good. Why not play Lubin and Starling and heck, Dom Campbell and Tony Sanders and Matt Zona more moving forward? Brey will never do it. He really should. It's time.\n\nDonny: Obviously this season is not over yet, but I am extremely scared of what this roster is going to look like next season. Do you expect most of the non seniors/graduates to come back? Even if they do, there is so much inexperience everywhere.\n\nTom Noie: Donny: Be scared. Very scared. I drew the comparison of LSU when it fired Will Wade last year. There was a point where the Tigers didn't have a single scholarship player on the roster. It might not get that drastic for Notre Dame, but the new coach isn't exactly walking into a situation where he has a roster ready-made to even compete, let alone win.\n\nDan - Chicago: Is Markus Burton the starting pg next year? Is he tall enough to be effective in the ACC?\n\nTom Noie: Dan: Markus Burton is really good right now at the high school level, but he has to get bigger and stronger to survive college basketball life in the real world. We need to see the next coach before figuring out the next starting point guard.\n\nChris from Albany: Tom thanks for the chat. In reading your article about the hurdles to overcome at ND what do you think the realistic expectations of the basketball head coach is at ND? My own expectation is to make the big dance 2 out of 3 years which Brey did through his first 17 years.\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Here's my expectation for Notre Dame men's basketball - stop expecting the NCAA tournament. Here's what I mean - run a program that doesn't worry about getting to the NCAA tournament. Does Tom Izzo worry about getting to March? Does BIll Self? Does Mick Cronin? No. Build a program that might not win NCAA championships, but is respected enough and good enough to be competitive enough where you're not sweating out Selection Sunday every single year. Market your program better. Promote it better. Get the national media to understand that even if you lose a game, you're good. I don't get this NCAA tournament scorecard nonsense. Welp, made it two of the last three years. We're good. Nah, forget that. Just be good enough and respected enough and sustained enough where Selection Sunday doesn't matter. Get to the point where the only question is where you're going, not if you're going. That's reasonable, isn't it?\n\nChris from Albany: Is Virginia the blueprint that ND should reach for? I assume they have some of the same issues as ND but they seem to overcome. Why? Is it simply Bennett is that good?\n\nTom Noie: In theory, but be Notre Dame. Do it your way, but be 1,000 percent committed to doing it your way. The commitment level, not sure if it's always there. Notre Dame talks so much about being elite, but it's really not, not the way it could and should and has to be in men's basketball.\n\nJim Tal Valley Center, CA: Morning Tom, Great work on all the latest doings involving the ND hoop program. In your estimation, what would be a reasonable timeline by which the Irish should have a new coach in place? Unless it's someone that isn't currently coaching it's hard to imagine anything getting done before mid-to-late March at the earliest. Also, do you have any preferred candidates for the job as of now? Thanks for all you do.\n\nTom Noie: Jim: First week of April would fit. And look back in the chat for our poll - the top six possibilities are in the poll. But I'll let you in on a secret. Just between you and me, OK? Nobody knows who the next coach will be. Not the beat writer. Not the athletic director. Maybe not even the next coach.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, Do you think ND can keep Starling, Lubin and Campbell?\n\nTom Noie: Chris: All depends on the next coach. Do those players fit his style? Do they meet the next coach and think immediately, yeah, I can play for this guy. I WANT to play for this guy. Nobody knows.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, How big of a difference would Basile at VTech have made ?\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Perhaps he'd have helped, but it never got to that point where they wondered how he'd fit. His visit was more courtesy than reality.\n\nJack: In his retirement presser, Brey made it seem like he will be very much involved in the coaching selection. Do you think he should be, and could this tilt things toward Inglesby?\n\nTom Noie: Jack: That was a fun line, but absolutely not. Mike Brey can offer his opinion to Jack Swarbrick, but this is Jack Swarbrick's hire based on who he best fits for his vision of the program and for the university. At some point, he'll have to say, if he hasn't already, Mike, I love you and love what you've done for our school, but I need to go this alone. Thanks.\n\nEd Zagorski, Irving, TX: Your article on the challenges for the next coach was really interesting. Using your crystal ball, how long (or can) will it take the program overcome the issues that have mounted and do you believe the University will invest in support staff to help the new coach? I was there as a student in the late 70s during the ‘glory days’ and am concerned that the school won’t invest as it will never make the kind of money that the football program does.\n\nTom Noie: Ed: The issues are too great to overcome to get this program to the point where Mike Brey couldn't get it - to a Final Four. This is not a Final Four program. That comes from deep within the university. Look, there's care there. People care about the program, but not enough to help get it where it should be. You think this year or the last couple years (minus 2021-22) were bad. Might have to get used to it.\n\nClaire M: Tom, appreciate your coverage of ND hoops. Amongst other issues with this team this year, the inability to guard or win the close games they did last year is there is no Blake Wesley to get a steal and dunk to put a game away as he did last season in numerous game situations. With that, while Starling is a gifted guy and will become a good player at some point (somewhere), there is a big gap between where he is and the impact Wesley had on a team as a freshman. We were lead to believe that Starling was the guy with “it”, that he got itwas so mature and we have not seen that from him.\n\nTom Noie: Claire: good stuff. What we've seen from Starling this season is a lot of what we saw from him last season at LaLu. He was OK with being the fit-in, third guard. When the time came for him to step into more of a role, he did. He was that gifted. That's different at the college level. Again, he was OK with being the fit-in freshman surrounded by old guys. Whereas Blake Wesley was like, yeah, I'm playing and I don't care who cares, Starling's a different kind of kid. He may be more talented in a raw sense than Wesley, but Wesley was, for a lack of a better term, a killer. Like, I'm coming after you and you have no choice. Starling's not there yet. Wesley raised the bar so high, a bar that Starling hasn't been able to reach. I believe Notre Dame missed its chance when it started 0-2. It should've given the ball then and there to Starling and said, run with it. We've not seen Starling's true skills. We might never see them.\n\nWillie from Mishawaka: I recently read an article written by Brett Friedlander about how Pat Kelsey would be a perfect fit to replace Mike Brey. Young, energetic, and a catholic school product who learned from Skip Prosser. What do you think about this possibility?\n\nTom Noie: Willie: There's a reason why he's in the SBT's top three possible candidates. He fits for a lot of reasons. Not the least of which was this - he took over a Charleston program last year - his first year - and the roster had .... two players. He still had a winning season. He's got the juice for a program that lacks it.\n\nHarold C.: I think that LaPhonso Ellis would be a great fit for ND BB Coach! What’s your opinion?\n\nTom Noie: Harold: If there's a person in the world better than Phonz, show me. Phonz is a friend, but he has zero coaching experience. He could reach guys and teach guys but in this day and age, you better know exactly what you're signing up for and, in the case of Notre Dame, what you're walking into. For someone who's never been the lion cage at this level, that's a tough ask. I can't do that to my man.\n\nEd,Greensboro: Tom, same old story last night in Raleigh.How much damage is this season's death march doing to the program?\n\nTom Noie: Ever seen the GIF of the child swinging innocently on a swing while a structure fire rages behind him? It's like that. This program is headed for 3-17 in the league. When it ends, there will be nothing remaining but ash.\n\nSteve Duff: You deserve hazard pay for covering this team Tom - ooof. Any chance Brey will start lengthening the rotation now that the season is effectively over? I believe JR is a redshirt but it would be nice to see what Zona and Dom in particular can do. That cupboard is gonna be pretty bare for whoever replaces him. Thanks Tom and hang in there!\n\nTom Noie: Steve: Thanks, but I didn't sign up for this job with the stipulation that it would be all sunshine and balloons. It comes with the job, and I owe it the readers and the people who care about Notre Dame men's basketball to paint a fair and accurate picture, regardless of how awful it might look. Lengthen the rotation? If Mike Brey was going to do that, he could've started two games ago. Why would he start now? He's nothing if not loyal, and his loyalty to Trey Wertz and Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski goes beyond anyone's comprehension.\n\nRyan mars pa: Tom what is going on with this team lost some close games will miss coach brey after this season\n\nTom Noie: Ryan: A complete collapse in confidence from a group that was supposed to carry a boatload of it through this season. And that's just for starters. I'd say keep the faith with the hope that it gets better, but I'm not sure it will. At least, not anytime soon.\n\nGuest: I would also love to see the men’s basketball program get the talent and also support from local fans as the women’s program has. But we need to win first…\n\nTom Noie: Great. I'd love to see local fans be expected to play the same prices for women's basketball tickets as they do for the men. Then we're having a totally different conversation. There's a reason why the women's program has built a stronger following. It's all about 💰\n\nJohn, Orlando: Hi Tom, where does Notre Dame’s winning percentage over the past 23 years under Coach Brey rank nationally among division 1 schools over the same period? I realize that this data may be difficult to find / access but to paraphrase Coach Brey this is the ultimate measurement.\n\nTom Noie: John: Interesting, but impossible to find on the fly. My apologies. Answered a similar question earlier. I'm not about this program getting to the NCAA tournament X number of times in Y amount of years. This should be a program that should annually be good enough to where it shouldn't sweat Selection Sunday. The NCAA tournament is an absolute crapshoot (coming from someone who doesn't gamble). Just get in and then you go from there.\n\nJack: Hey Tom, do you expect buy-in from Notre Dame to actually go out and get a coach with a chance to be successful and provide him with the resources to succeed? Or do you expect them to got the traditional route of finding the cheap option and putting him on an island with no resources? Maybe they can find a few extra dollars in the football team's Gug couch cushions?\n\nTom Noie: Jack: Start shaking those couch cushions. Resources? That's a four-letter word around Notre Dame when it comes to the basketball program. Taboo. Off limits. It's not something anyone wants to talk about.\n\nChris, DC: Do Lubin and Starling return?\n\nTom Noie: Hire a head coach first. Then salvage the roster.\n\nBrian: Real question, who is in the starting lineup next year? Starling possible transfer or NBA, VAL could leave. Zona, JR, Sanders who else?\n\nTom Noie: A great unanswerable question. Nowhere close to being answered.\n\nEM, South Bend: I know it’s comparing apples to oranges, but why has the women’s program under both Coach McGraw and Coach Ivey been able to be so successful for longer and the men’s program has not?\n\nTom Noie: EM: It's like asking why Duke and North Carolina has been able to sustain success. Look at the women's game as the women's game. Look at the men's game as the men's game. Comparing it is beyond silly. Are we then going to ask why Notre Dame men have had a one-and-done but the Notre Dame women haven't? See? Silly.\n\nEM, South Bend: Endorsing comment by Joe from South Side!\n\nTom Noie: Amen brother!\n\nPhil: Do you expect to see a transfer portal exodus among the younger guys (and maybe even older guys that have sat at the end of the bench their whole career)? Maybe a change will be good for some of these guys as they might get a coach that goes more than 6 deep?\n\nTom Noie: Phil: Mike Brey's rotation now goes only six deep? In another week, it will have gone only five deep. But I get it. Don't know how many times this has to be said to understand - it's beyond impossible to say for sure what's going to happen with the roster until there's a new coach in place. Matt Zona may look at the new coach and say, yeah, my kind of guy. J.J. Starling may look at the new coach and say, nah, I'm out. We. Don't. Know. They. Don't. Know. Nobody. Knows.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Absolutely true. There is CLEARLY enough blame to go around. I am just saying, he let Boeheim sit in his comfort zone for the entire 2nd half. TAKE HIM OUT OF IT! Force Boeheim to counter your move. Make him collapse the zone and maybe you can get off a decent shot or two. Part 2 is I always supported PHUBB. Last chat, I brought up the A/TO ratio. Last night, 11 Assists to 15 TOs. 15! NCST, not an overly impressive OFF team, 13 to 2. Poorly coached, no ability to defend.\n\nTom Noie: No want-to. No care. No nothing.\n\nMike in PA: Tom - thanks for this much needed therapy session. This is more of a comment than a question, but the folks who say good riddance to Brey, or say 3 sweet 16's in 23 years is underachieving or mediocre, must not have been alive for most of the 80's or 90's, right? ND Basketball was simply non-competitive for a decade. Brey comes in and immediately gives them a shot of life, and he goes on to have some of the highest highs in program history. He should be celebrated at all costs. Put him in the ring of honor now. Those who mock him, pun intended, will likely never be happy with any coach, in any sport.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Thank you, a voice of reason. Look what Mike Brey did in establishing a culture/identity in the Big East as it changed. Look at what Mike Brey did in starting over, then establishing a culture/identity in the Atlantic Coast Conference. There may have been two or three, OK, maybe four coaches in the country who would've enjoyed similar success. Do others see that? Nah, they whine about the NCAA tournaments and the losing seasons. Think back to where Notre Dame was in 2000 when Brey arrived. You'd have been laughed out of Rocco's if you said the new guy was going to go to a couple Elite Eights. They would've locked you up and thrown the key in Saint Mary's Lake if you said the new guy would beat Duke and North Carolina on back-to-back nights to win an ACC tournament. Brey fell short in a few areas, yes, but he far exceeded expectations in many more. And he did it all under the guidelines set forth by his bosses.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I think Parker F. walks as well. Remember, he and Dunlap had already reneged on scholarships prior to ND calling. In your opinion, where do they stand with Burton? Is he committed to ND or Brey. I was kind of surprised he said he would decide after the season. I just thought he was locked in with ND.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Yeah, I'm not sure that's not Markus Burton just being a 17-year-old kid who's head is still swimming. It's not like he had a lot of high major offers when Notre Dame came calling. Is he suddenly an option for Indiana or Purdue or someone else close to home? Not really sure. If any recruit should feel safe - way safer than Brady Dunlap (see ya!) or Parker Friedrichsen - it's Markus Burton. The last thing the new coach is going to do is to cut ties with the local guy. Not exactly the way to build interest/equity with your fan base, is it? I'd be surprised if Markus Burton isn't at Notre Dame next season, no matter the coach.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I would like to comment on your hiring timeline. First, the only guys who leave the NBA for college ball are guys who have exhausted their chances in the NBA. There are exceptions, but Quinn, Williams.....No Chance. Sweeney maybe just because of his attraction to ND. Also, a lot of the names mentioned are likely taking their teams to the Big Dance. They are not going to disrupt their seasons with an announcement like that. Finally, Jack S. has made a lot of hires in his time. I am sure he has a replacement planning chart on his computer somewhere. Let's let this play out and put some faith in his track record.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Agree with that 1,000 percent. Our timelines line up. Jack Swarbrick needed four days to hire Marcus Freeman. He didn't even need four hours to hire Niele Ivey. This will not be a quick hire, nor should anyone expect it to be. This will be an extended timeframe. We're not talking days or weeks. We're talking months. Jack Swarbrick has nailed a lot of the big issues (football coach, women's basketball, ACC membership, football independence). I expect him to nail this one as well. He's said on multiple occasions that it's the big-picture/high profile issues that drive him. Here comes another.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Cannot hire any coach in his 70s. Too old. Everyone opposing coach will tell recruits \"that guy will die before you graduate.\" That includes Mike K. They need 40ish like Brey was when he was hired. Pitino is a much larger longshot than Mike K. based on the fact that his background isn't as clean as ND would require. No chance for him. Wouldn't want him anyway.\n\nTom Noie: Want to win today? No, really win. Seriously win. Gotta get dirty. Got to.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, sincere question. Why aren't we hearing Mike White as a possible hire? 45 years old. Wildly successful at every stop. And certainly strong ties to South Bend. The guy's childhood dream was to play QB at ND.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: How do you convince anyone you're the right hire if you're on your third head coaching job in three years? A lot of anything that happens moving forward with the job is based on timing. It has to fit. If Mike White still was at Florida and ready for a reset, yeah, he might be the clubhouse leader.\n\nDave: Does the football team have the same admission requirement as the basketball team? How is it that only 10 of the top 100 hoops recruits can get into ND, but we can get top 150 football recruits?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: You do follow Notre Dame football. You know of the Four Horsemen and Rockne and Holtz and everything else. If you do, you don't have to ask the question. It's Notre Dame football.\n\nTom: Tom can you please provide a public service announcement to all of the delusional Irish fans that Mark Few, Brad Stevens, Monty Williams, and all these other pipe dream candidates are not walking through that door. Some of the names I have seen tossed around are absurd. Notre Dame Basketball does not equal Notre Dame football. Why would any of these guys take a job at an ACC bottom feeder that could care less about their basketball program?\n\nTom Noie: Tom: They wouldn't. There's a faction of the fan base that doesn't operate in reality. They believe what they want to believe and nothing - and nobody - is going to convince them any differently. The elite of the elite college coach looks at Notre Dame and say, no freaking way. They know. They know not only how the sport operates but how Notre Dame operates. Mike Brey did a whole lot for that program, and it's still in the coaching stone age.\n\nMark: Has the name Bryce Drew came up at all?\n\nTom Noie: Why would it? What's he done? He's OK at a mid-major right now. He went 0-18 in the SEC. That's the hardest of sells at Notre Dame, regardless of his feel-good storybook career at Valpo, which, in today's world of college basketball, may as well happened in the 1960s. This has to be as close to a home-run hire as it can get. Bryce Drew's a leg-it-out close call at second base double.\n\nMike in PA: Tom - I saw someone mention Coach K as a replacement. Obviously, that's just crazy and will never happen in a million years. If on a crazy scale of 1 to 100, and Coach K is a 150, where does Jay Wright stand? I know I know, probably 149. But I would love it.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Honestly, if the scale is 1 to 100, both are about a 2,500. And that might be too low.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, your thoughts on Cormac Ryan coming back for a sixth year. I say slim to none\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Same stance as J.J. Starling and Ven-Allen Lubin returning. No thoughts until a head coach is in place. Ryan, though, may decide it's time to start his next chapter, though his return would work for various reasons.\n\nRay: Hi Tom. During your last chat in November you ended the chat claiming I was pretty much crazy in my opinion of Brey. I said if I knew today what Brey's record would have been after 23 years that I would not have hired him. You called my drunk and dismissed my opinion as silly. I completely disagree. College hoops for the last couple of decades is all about NCAA tournament success. The regular season is meaningless. This is not an opinion Tom. Look at the TV ratings for games in November- early March and compare it to the tournament. Power programs fire coaches who don't perform well in the dance. Brey has failed in the dance. In 23 years he made the second weekend of the tournament only three times. He made zero final fours and lost as a favorite to the following teams - Mississippi, Winthrop, Washington State, Xavier, Old Dominion, Florida State, Old Dominion, and Iowa State. In 23 years he only defeated two teams that were seeded higher - Illinois and Alabama.\n\nTom Noie: Ray: Still silly, and still wondering if you're at the bar at 9:36 a.m. California time. If you need to be walked through where this program was when Mike Brey arrived and where he took it, NCAA tournament flameout aside, we'll just have to agree to disagree. Have another one on me, though 😃\n\nJim Tal Valley Center, CA: Tom, I have great admiration for Mike Brey but one of the true testaments of a successful coach is the condition that he leaves the program in when he departs. And from that standpoint, given all the uncertainty concerning the Irish as to the incoming freshman class and the potentially dubious makeup of next year's roster, there's no way anyone can say he succeeded on that front. Your thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Agree. Epic failure, a failure that is totally unacceptable. Brey will long be remembered for what he did with this program in the Big East, then in the ACC, but the shape in which he leaves it, yeah, that's in the second paragraph as well.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, if somehow this team made the NIT they will not go correct? Again a long shot. I understand.\n\nTom Noie: Chris: It depends. Do they stagger across the finish line to get to NIT territory or do they beat Duke or Virginia on the road. Right now, this can't end soon enough. It's hard to see that sentiment changing.\n\nBonkers in Yonkers: Tom, it's been awhile. I'm sure you've answered this but bear with me and anyone that's joined in the last 10 minutes. Rank the Top 3 coaching candidates, if you'd be so kind, that are your most likely to be interviewed and offered the job. #KeepGrindin\n\nTom Noie: Bonkers: It's been about four hours, so I might be a little punchy. But the top three, in any order, would be Darian DeVries from Drake, Micah Shrewsberry from Penn State and Pat Kelsey from Charleston. NBA guys? Chris Quinn and Sean Sweeney. That's a pretty good starting five. Let's see where it goes.\n\nRay: Ray from Southern California - Tom I don't personally know one ND fan that agrees with what you wrote below in BOLD: How many fans of a program that was dying a slow death would've taken nearly 500 wins? Three Sweet 16s? Two Elite Eights? A freaking ACC tournament championship after beating Duke and North Carolina? How many would've taken that? How about everybody. These numbers would be good if Brey coached 10-12 years and decent if he coached 13-15 years but three Sweet 16's and zero final fours in 23 years is not good Tom. I don't know one ND fan that thinks it is. I will stop commenting on this now. I think you understand my position and its a position of many Notre Dame fans.\n\nTom Noie: Ray: Just stop while you're way behind. You cull this information because as you've said, you know ..... 25 Notre Dame fans? Whoa, a whole 25. Not exactly a good cross section of the fan base, or maybe it is. Let me put this as delicately as possible - wake up. This program has gone to one Final Four in its history, and wandered through the college basketball desert for 10 years before Brey. But it's suddenly Final Four or bust? Couldn't be more wrong. You and your \"many Notre Dame fans.\" When the new gets to multiple Final Fours in his 10 seasons - that's the timeframe, right? - I'll buy you and your 25 fellow fans dinner.\n\nJames - Indiana: Micah Shrewsberry as next HC? Brad Stevens lead assistant at Butler and then Celtics and then went to learn under Painter and now at PSU. Seems like a home run hire\n\nTom Noie: James: Almost too good to be true, right? He fits for many reasons.\n\nDave Y - St Louis: Based on what you know about coaching hoops at ND, what kind of style of play do you think fits them best for ACC play and what new coach can provide that style?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: Look at what wins in the Atlantic Coast Conference. You better run some offense that's difficult to defend. Multiple actions. Multiple options. Have skilled guys who can go off the dribble. Have versatile wings who can shoot it and rebound. Defend. You better have at least one pro every season. Two? Even better. Three? Now you have the makings of a team that can make a deep NCAA run. A team that's unafraid on the road. What coach fits that criteria? That's the job of Jack Swarbrick.\n\nMike - NC: Any chance Chris Quinn comes back? I know he's Spo's top assistant and likely wants to stay in NBA but think he could be convinced to come back?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Chris Quinn had the chance to come back a couple years ago and learn the college game, where he'd likely have been Brey's successor. He chose to stay in the NBA, where he believes he has a future as a head coach. Has that changed? If it has, and has drastically, then yeah, he's on the short list. But I don't know any NBA coach who's in a hurry to go back to college.\n\nJohn: Cupboard looking awfully bare next year lol, especially if Ryan leaves. Assuming Burton and Parker stay in class, you're looking at Starling, JR, Sanders, Zona, and Lubin as starters?\n\nTom Noie: John: That's best-case scenario, which everyone would sign up for right now. Will it stick? We'll see...\n\nDave - NY: I think this is a worse job than people think. AD and President rumored to leave in 2-3 years right? The talent on this roster that is coming back is bad for even a mid major team. Do you think Burton and Parker will stay?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: I wouldn't go as far as classifying it as a \"worse job\" but it's a difficult job. Way harder than an outsider would admit it to being. It's only going to get more difficult with NIL and the transfer portal (i.e. free agency). Notre Dame's academics-first model doesn't cut it.\n\nLInas from Orange County,CA: Hi Tom, Really tough season. Thanks for letting us vent. Here's my take on what went wrong with the Irish this year: No really good passer (never thought I'd miss Prentiss:) and no \"bangers\" under the boards (think Harangody/Geben/Mooney/Cooley). Thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: Linas: Fair on all levels, and that the returning guys didn't get any better, didn't add a new dimension to their games, Fellow ACC opponents have to be looking at Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski and saying, I guarded this four years ago...you're still doing all the same stuff?\n\nDan - Chicago: I'm surprised that Ryan coming back for a 6th college year is still a possibility in your eyes. Which way do you think he is leaning?\n\nTom Noie: Dan: He's not, and it's not, but it's there. You have to leave that door open since it is an option. He won't close it until this season ends. Never thought Nate Laszewski was coming back...every indication was that he was ready to move on. Then he returns. Just when you think you know, you don't.\n\nJim Tal Valley Center, CA: Tom, though there are many reasons why this season went down the drain, I believe one thing stands out. This team and these players were lost when it came to being clutch. A number of games were there for the taking, but this group shrunk big time when it mattered most. It was simply beyond them to deliver at critical times and without a go-to guy to rely on, they had nowhere to turn. No question, this team goes down as the epitome of a club that didn't measure up when push came to shove!\n\nTom Noie: Jim: True, but how do we explain what Cormac Ryan did in the NCAA tournament last March? Every indication was that it was the beginning of him making that his team. That he would pick up where he left off. Man, talk about a big swing and a miss on that one.\n\nDave - NY: Does Jack make major changes to this program and give them the support it needs or do he and the administration not care enough about the success of basketball? Even though ND is a \"football school\", why can't they pour resources and money into it in a way we see many other schools do for their \"Second sport\"? Hell, Michigan did it for basketball. Why can't ND?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: If there's one thing that Notre Dame has more of than almost every other private school, it's money. And if there's one thing that Notre Dame doesn't want to spend, it's, yep, money. If it was THAT serious about having the elite of the elite athletic programs across the board, money is no issue. At Notre Dame, it's a HUGE issue. They have it, and they're not spending it .... on athletics?? No way.\n\nMike from San Diego: It’s not feasible we have a head coach before end of march correct? Anyone worth getting probably won’t confirm to ND until their respective season is over with- am I correct in that assumption? That being said does Mike stepping down so early give the incoming freshman and current players (ie Starling and Lubin) too much time to look elsewhere??\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Agree on the first part, don't agree as strongly on the second. Mike Brey saying he's leaving or not saying he's leaving, kids (especially freshmen) all spend time about looking elsewhere. Should they transfer? Should they try and make it in the league? Brey leaving doesn't change that. Or accelerate it. When it goes as sideways as this has gone, everybody's looking with the side eye at something that could be better for them.\n\nJames - CA: It's odd how this program always used to have really good guard play and what seems like the last 5 years haven't had a single guy who could consistently get downhill. Hubb at least took care of the ball but why did Brey think Wertz could run this offense when he's arguably the worst of the 7 guys?\n\nTom Noie: James: One of the greatest unanswerable questions about this season and about this team. Trey Wertz by all accounts is a great kid, but he's simply not a frontline Atlantic Coast Conference caliber guard. He's just not.\n\nPeter, VA: Tom, what are your thoughts on goodwin’s career? Having played the most games in school history, this year he has looked slower and less consistent.\n\nTom Noie: Peter: He's played in a lot of games, but never really added to his. He's got the flat-footed 3 and the low-post game and that's about it. Limited. It's hard watching him try to figure it out, when there are no answers. Maybe that's him. Maybe that's lack of development.\n\nGuest: Any word of Bobby Hurley or Chris Collins being considered??Both Duke guys that kno ACC n east coast recruiting!I think could be nice fits but my list is like most ND fans 1-Monty2-Quinn then Kelsey!!\n\nTom Noie: Quick, easy passes on both. Notre Dame isn't Duke Midwest. Time for a new direction.\n\nJustin Ft. Wayne: Hey Tom! I saw earlier you said a new coach is going to change putting butts in the seats and selling the place out. You don’t think the right hire could bring juice to this program and sell the place out and get students back to the games. Not every game sure but half the games? Maybe it’s wishful thinking on my part!\n\nTom Noie: Nail the hire first and get the roster figured out. If you win, the fans, even the Notre Dame fans, will find their way back. Maybe. Until there's something else to complain about. Or if it's snowing outside. Truth.\n\nBonkers in Yonkers: Tom, any early indication of who will be coming back for Brey's final home game? Coach Brey was instrumental in creating the Ring of Honor. Hopefully ND gives him something big after the game so the former players that are able to come back and the fans in attendance can give him the ovation he deserves. Think we'll see him inducted into the Ring of Honor on that night?\n\nTom Noie: Bonkers: Still a ways out from that final home game against Pittsburgh, but it being a midweek game instead of the weekend kind of curbs the enthusiasm if you will. Ring of Honor that night? Not seeing it. Yes, Mike Brey did a lot for this program since he arrived, but this season has been the greatest of failures. Hard to look past that - at least, at this point. Let a few years pass so the good times can better be remembered. It's too soon now to point to 2015 and 2016 and everything else and say, hey, thanks MB\n\nJames - CA: The 5 man class in 2017 did Brey in. Not only did they not live up to their rankings, it made it so Brey couldn't recruit over them and then couldn't recruit behind and develop the typical 4 stars he used to. Instead, tried to go for a 5 star to get immediate playing time or low 3 stars and this is the result. It's baffling how these 6th year seniors are playing like freshman\n\nTom Noie: James: So true. The loyalty for his guys that long sustained Mike Brey wound up doing him in. He just couldn't bring himself to consider there might be better players out there than Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski. That's an aspect that has to change - you have to earn your spot every single season. If there's someone out there who's an upgrade, don't be afraid to upgrade. But that 2017 class ran its course a year and a half ago. You saw it. Others saw it. Brey never saw it.\n\nTom D.: My biggest fear is ND hiring \"Mike Lite.\" Any chance we will get an aggressive coach who recruits at a high level and plays more than seven guys?\n\nTom Noie: Tom D: Yes, yes, yes. I'm confident Jack Swarbrick will land this hiring plane. It's a little rocky coming down out of the clouds now, but it will be OK. Watch.\n\nChad ,Toledo: Any mention of Bobby Hurley or Chris Collins ??Both Duke guys that know the ACC and east coast recruiting!!Maybe nice fit imo!!\n\nTom Noie: Second time around for these guys today. Answer's still the same - absolutely not.\n\nJames - CA: What's the excuse for ND to not be like Michigan in basketball? Both are football schools but the difference is Michigan seems to actually care about pouring money and resources into bball program to be good, while Jack is fine with just sniffing the NCAA tournament\n\nTom Noie: James: You answered your own question. Notre Dame is not Michigan because Michigan does something for basketball that Notre Dame doesn't do and likely will never do - pours money into the program. Also, Michigan and Notre Dame being even, the cost of attendance is more attractive at Michigan than at Notre Dame. (see, Dickinson, Hunter)\n\nRobert from Mishawaka: Your recent articles have given the average fan some very interesting insight as to what the Notre Dame administration does for the program. From the support staff, to the admissions office. Thank you for blunt answers, and continue being you. I hear you all the way from the back row.\n\nTom Noie: Robert: I'll keep shouting if you promise to keep reading. Deal?.\n\nGuest: Except for last year's success, I think one of the amazing things about the struggles over the last five years, is that the ACC has been so down. Even this year, ND's conference schedule has been incredibly manageable. I know there has been coaching turnover at UNC, Duke, and Louisville, but what are some other factors you can point to that has contributed to the ACC's decline?\n\nTom Noie: How about this one - let's go with arrogance. For the longest time, the Atlantic Coast Conference was seen as the best college basketball conference in the country. Everybody wrote it. Everybody believed it. To the point where the league didn't believe it needed anyone selling its product to the nation. And then everything changed. The SEC got better and stronger. Same for the Big 12. And the Big Ten. Now, turn on any game from those conferences on a given night, and listen to the commentators and the studio talent talk up those leagues. The SEC. The Big 12. The Big Ten. How this league or that league is so deep. Just recently, there was talk of how every single Big 12 team could - and maybe should - make the NCAA tournament. Who's carrying the torch nationally for the ACC? Nobody. It's just kind of stepped back into the shadows, where everybody else talks up those other leagues, and rarely talks about the ACC. Tom Noie: More proof? Look at last year, when Notre Dame won a school record 15 league games and finished second - one win away from sharing the regular-season title with Duke. What was the national narrative? That the ACC was down and that Notre Dame didn't deserve an NCAA bid. At 15-5. Who went to bat for Notre Dame? For the league? Nobody, to the point that if the regular season had lasted another week, Notre Dame wouldn't have made the Field of 68. The reaction of the ACC was like, meh, who cares, we're the ACC. The league's become an afterthought, because the league's allowed it to become one. That's wrong, and that should never happen.\n\nMikeMcFadden, Williamsport, PA: What advantage did coach Brey think he had by playing ONLY 7 players for 23 years? I cannot think of one thing, only disadvantages like no player development, lost recruits, etc.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Easy. Seven personalities are easier to manage than seven, eight or nine. Play seven, and get those seven to act/work/think like one to the point where they just know how to play a d know what the other guys are doing. You take care of the ball better, you play better. Now, for that to work, it has to be the right seven guys. Think back to 2014-15 and those seven - Pat Connaughton, Jerian Grant, Zach Auguste, Steve Vasturia, Demetrius Jackson, Bonzie Colson and V.J. Beachem. You can win with those seven. You can go far with those seven. Why? Because it was the right seven. That's when it works.\n\nGuest: Hey Tom - here are some names I thought of potential replacements that I havent seen much of.. Ed Cooley, Anthony Grant, Earl Grant, Valentine from Loyola (although this year has been gross).. any thoughts on those 4?\n\nTom Noie: Absolutely. For starters, Providence and Dayton (heck, yeah) are better jobs than Notre Dame. In addition, Ed Cooley and Anthony Grant are alums of those schools. Earl Grant hasn't exactly done enough at Boston College to warrant a lateral move - and it is lateral. Drew Valentine went from 25-8 in the Missouri Valley Conference to 6-12 in the Atlantic-10. And the ACC is probably two steps up from that. Tough sell on him.\n\nMike from San Diego: I'm just curious, does your criticism of the team cause any bad blood between you and the players / coaches?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Bad blood? No, for the most part, the players and the coaches get it. A lot of that came from Mike Brey, like this is what we signed up for. It's part of the deal. The one area where it has caused friction is when it gets really bad (2018-19, this season) where the core guys get a little salty. Guys that don't really get what we do (I'll refrain from names) who truly believe I should be more of a champion/cheerleader of the program. I've had former players unfollow me on Twitter, and also confront me on why I was negative toward them. I explain to them that I didn't go 3-15. Sometimes they don't get it. Brey and I have had our moments and our battles, but that's normal. He gets what our job is.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, I was wondering if ND can have a tickets policy of kids get in free for certain games. At least there is someone in the seat who may occasionally yell and stand.\n\nTom Noie: Chris: You'd think they'd have adopted that long ago, or especially when there were maybe 4,000 total for the Dec. 11 game against Marquette. Get it that you don't like the coach, but you've got to be better than that.\n\nRay from Southern California - Thank you Tom. You do a great job and I have enjoyed your articles for many years. I respect your opinion even when I disagree with you.\n\nTom Noie: We can agree to disagree. It might be difficult to see all the way out there, but if you sat in my seat, it all makes a whole lot more sense. Trust me.\n\nMike from San Diego: Do we look to hire a guy that could (potentially) bring over some good players for next years roster (I'm totally kidding.. but kind of not)\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Next season has to be a wash. Now, I know the new guy will get here and insist that they can win and win now, but this has to be more of a big picture hire. If you have to sacrifice next year and the roster makeup to get the right guy, it's more important to nail the hire than salvage the roster.\n\nMike in PA: Ray - You now know me, and I could not possibly disagree with you more. I also know TWENTY SIX ND fans that also disagree with you. So there's that.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: You go to the right coast, Ray will go to the left. Somebody's gotta keep the peace.\n\nRay from Southern California - When did I say final four or Bust? My position is only making 3 Sweet 16's in 23 years. I never said final four or bust. If Brey never made a final four but made the Sweet 16 say 5-6 times then you would be correct. Nobody is expecting final fours. We were expecting Brey to win some of the games against Old Dominion, Winthrop, Iowa State, Ole Miss, Florida State, Xavier, and Washington State. Brey laid a huge egg many times in the dance. That's the issue. Like you said we agree to disagree. Robert from Mishawaka: I can't believe Ray thinks ND is a power hoops program and should fire a coach based on NCAA tourney results. Matt Painter would be nervous if Ray were his boss.\n\nTom Noie: Robert: As would a lot of other coaches. Getting to a Final Four, getting to a Sweet 16 isn't as easy as filling out a bracket every Monday in March.\n\nJustin Ft. Wayne: Your telling me every football player goes to class and has good grades? I surely hope they loosen up the policies so basketball can get to the national stage it should be at.\n\nTom Noie: Justin: Don't hold your breath. 😃\n\nJoe from Chicago: How would you assess the comradery of this group? They've seemingly been around forever, but I never got the sense that there was a ton of chemistry\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Seven guys in the rotation, seven Ubers to the arena. Not a whole lot of togetherness there. Or if it is, it's so understated that it's barely noticeable.\n\nWadelite: Is it a bit disingenuous to even suggest Brey inherited a dumpster fire job. He inherited 2 first round draft picks plus a top 40 recruit in Carroll who would become a 10 year nba vet. Also a 1500 point scorer in Graves and a verbal from Chris Thomas. Yes he secured his verbal, but would he have landed it from the beginning. In 22 years Brey has recruited 2 first round draft picks. One from his high school and one from South Bend. Just 3 second round picks, 2 from northern Indiana. In terms of roster talent he is leaving his successor a lot less than what he inherited. There are many coaches who could have taken ND to the NCAAT in Brey's first 2 seasons.\n\nTom Noie: Wade: Nobody's saying it was a Dumpster fire when Mike Brey walked in the door, but it was a Dumpster fire of a decade. It remained Independent way too long, then wandered around aimlessly in the Big East wilderness for five, six years. And that core that Brey inherited of which you speak? The Troy Murphys and the Matt Carrolls? That core lost 17 games the year before Brey got here. The ground on which he walked in on as the third coach in three years was a whole lot shakier than you might want to believe. Tom Noie: This is what set Brey apart - how many times did the Big East change during his tenure? Going division? OK, you better win. he won. Going one division? Better win. He won. Then expansion, how many times? Three? Four? Better win. He won. He also did it with little backing from the administration in terms of arena renovation and practice facility. He barely cared. Notre Dame won. Notre Dame established an identity in arguably the country's toughest league. It stood toe to toe with Connecticut and Georgetown. It beat Villanova and Marquette. That matters. Tom Noie: Then just when everything seemed in place, they up and moved leagues. Brey had to start over. Two years later, Notre Dame is cutting down nets in Greensboro. From no direction, no culture, no anything to something. Even the most ardent Brey basher has to see that. Acknowledge that. When people don't, or won't, that's just crazy talk,\n\nMike from San Diego: To the poll question.. could that someone else be Chris Mack? Is he just out of the question bc of a couple bad years? Andy Kennedy? I'm going w/ a bald theme here\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Given my current hairline, I admire the flex, but given how it ended with Chris Mack at Louisville, with him secretly taping a conversation with Dino Gaudio to save his own backside, that's too much to look past. Andy Kennedy? Think Notre Dame can do better.\n\nWadelite: Have to disagree with Bill on Brady Dunlap. He is the least ready to play. No defined skill. The Oklahoma guard can at least shoot and he will put on some muscle. Burton is not scrawny, but of course will need more strength.\n\nTom Noie: They're both too little to withstand the ACC. Burton can get to the basket as easily as anyone right now, but that's not the case when it's Armando Bacot lurking. At best, even with Mike Brey back next season, I couldn't see any of those three being must-play pieces.\n\nWadelite: I believe early on we wanted to believe the too close early season games were because of experienced mid major teams with some quick guards and physical big men, but for me the nathan Jessup code red was saint bonaventure. They returned no one from last season. It was a patch work group of unheralded transfers and frosh that manhandled ND'S super seniors and top 50 frosh. Embarrassing, because that team had no continuity in playing together. The msu game was a mirage. A team on fumes from 2 cross country trips missing 2 of their top 5 guys. They were like an nba load management team on a back to back. This team was doomed when Brey thought he could get by Lasz at center for 30 mpg and Hammond being hurt and losing his opportunity to stake out the lead guard spot to start the season.\n\nTom Noie: Amen, but I wrote part of the Saint Bonaventure disaster on playing away from home for the first time. Like, it had to get better. It never got any better. Still hasn't, to the point where you wonder if they're going to win even once away from home. Speaks to the \"road dawg\" mentality of good Irish teams of seasons past.\n\nMike from San Diego: It can’t be understated that I think we had the coolest coaching duo in D1 w/ Brey and Freeman... at lot of our reputation is at risk w/ the new hire. We need somebody funny and charming like MB or I am out. Those r my only reqs\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Regardless of who is hired, he's not going to come anywhere close to Mike Brey. We all were spoiled for 23 seasons. He was the best to cover because he got it. He got all of it. He never closed down his locker room after even the toughest nights. He never made his guys unavailable. He never declined to answer a question, and there were plenty of tough ones. I'll miss covering him every day for six months out of the year, but intrigued as hell about where all this might go.\n\nWadelite: I have an interesting darkhorse coaching candidate: Ryan Odom. His father has big time ACC roots and Ryan was the head coach for a 16 seed that beat Virginia by 20 points. Doing alright at Utah State, a sneaky very good mid major program. Oh and regarding Bryce Drew. He does not go 0-18 if Darius Garland is healthy for his entire frosh season. His value to that team was comparable to Troy Murphy as a soph at ND. Also recruited Nesmith, a future 1st round pick. A promising wing for the Pacers.\n\nTom Noie: Ryan Odom, yes. Bryce Drew. Nope. Don't see it.\n\nRobert from Mishawaka: I’ll keep listening my man!\n\nTom Noie: You better!\n\nJoe from Chicago: As far as names being thrown out. I hear Porter Moser a lot and while he had success at Loyola, I think is OU stint has not been anything to elevate his profile. TJ Oltzenberger from Iowa State and John Beilein would be my home run hires. Never knew Belein had said that Notre Dame was his dream school Tom Noie: Joe: Timing with Porter Moser. Had he still been at Loyola, maybe the frontrunner. Now? Don't see it. And Oklahoma has more resources/money than Notre Dame. You also could argue that Iowa State and the Big 12 (Otzenberger) is a better situation. Not everybody is looking at Notre Dame job and thinking, that could be mine. Might be the opposite.\n\nWadelite: How about Scott Drew?\n\nTom Noie: Why? He's built Baylor into his own, and can get anybody he wants into school. He gets here and learns how it works and thinks, yeah, Waco ain't that bad.\n\nBobby: Steve Pikiell?\n\nTom Noie: I'd look hard at him. You win at Rutgers the way he's won at Rutgers, it's impressive. So is he. Has been since his days at Stony Brook.\n\nWadelite: Based on what you noted on transfers, is it likely ND will only be able to look at freshman transfers besides graduate transfers. FWIW I can come with at least 4 that ND recruited who are buried at better programs and will be recruited over. There are also at least 2 ivy league potential transfers who have a 5th year option. Last seasons poty and the second leading scorer this season.\n\nTom Noie: That's great, but from what I understand, getting a freshman out of the portal today is akin to Mike Brey playing 12 guys - impossible. The portal the way it's currently constructed works against Notre Dame. A freshman's transcript better look almost identical to that of a freshman at Notre Dame. The chances of that happening? Good luck.\n\nWadelite: On Scott Drew, at ND he would just have to play second fiddle to Marcus Freeman. In Waco he has to play second fiddle to Chip and Joanna Gaines.\n\nTom Noie: Or he can have them refurbish a farmhouse for him out on Mayflower Road...IYKYK 😃\n\nWadelite: If Darian Devries were hired at his coach, do you really think his sophomore son averaging 19 ppg at Drake is not admitted as a transfer? The PTB would find a way.\n\nTom Noie: Little different deal there, my man.\n\nMike in PA: Tom - what do you think Mike Brey's next move is? He said he wouldn't rule out coaching again. Everyone, and I agree, says he would be great on TV. Do you get the sense that is something he would want to do? If he did coach again, do you see it at a Power 5? Or would he go somewhere like, Iona?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Mike Brey's answer the other day for what's next was along the lines of being at a party/gathering for an extended time, enjoying the hell of out of it, but then ducking out to take care of something and promising to return. Everyone at the party is telling you/begging you not to leave the party yet. It's still a good time. But you leave anyway and when you return, the vibe's different. Nothing is the same. You kick yourself for not just going home. That's what it is with Brey right now - just go home. The thought right now about coaching sounds like a good time, but get him away from the grind, and then have him jump back into it at some other school. He'll realize it's just not the same. He says he wants to coach, but I don't see it. The time and the effort and the energy that it takes, yeah, he's a competitive SOB, but he's also someone who had looked forward to unplugging from coaching and all that it entails. Don't know if TV is the next move. Can see him in more of an advisory/consultant role.\n\nPaul R: What do you think about John Becker from Vermont? Consistent winner, teams play hard and come close to big upsets in the NCAA tourney almost every year\n\nTom Noie: Paul: Solid coach, along the lines of Matt Langel from Colgate. Would be on my second Top 15 list. Might be someone to at least effort.\n\nMatt from St. Louis: Think any of the current super seniors continue to play after this year? Nate and/or Dane good enough to play some overseas? Do you think any of them have interest in that?\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Yes, especially given how their last seasons at Notre Dame went, they won't/don't want that to be their last organized basketball experience. They'll find a place to play overseas for a few years, then fall back on those MBAs. It's a nice option to have.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I don't see Brey coaching college ball again. He never embraced the changes that we now have to live with and he never showed the hunger necessary on the recruiting trail. As much as he sees himself as a teacher, and I think he is, I just don't think he is willing to put up with all of the \"distractions\" that prevent him from teaching. And they are hear to stay.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Agreed. It's more difficult to win these days, let alone getting out of it for a year or two, then trying to get back up to speed. Like, wait, THIS is what I came back for? Forget that. He's run his race. It's time to live a good life, a better life.\n\nCraig in NJ: The coach who will take this job is a young guy at a smaller school like Digger (Fordham) or Mike (Delaware). ND may provide job secuirty but it is not one of the top twenty jobs in the country. Well, top 30. Okay, maybe top 50\n\nTom Noie: Craig: Are you sure it's Top 50? Now, it can be if there's a buy-in from the university. Jack Swarbrick comes to the new guy and says, we've decided to do it the way Duke and Villanova and Gonzaga do it. Then everything's there - the national name, the facilities, the league, everything. If nothing changes, or very little changes, it remains a really difficult job. Even worse for a young guy who doesn't know any better and won't push for any additional support.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, The Parker, Brady, Markus recruiting class was never meant to be a \"Homerun\" class. Brey's poor roster management backed him into a corner. That class was intended to lend stability to the program so that it didn't become an annual revolving door. Those 3 were likely multi-year guys. BTW, what is your read on JRK? I would think the local boy sticks it out. Yes?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: J.R. Konieczny strikes me as someone who will wait and see how all this shakes out. He has to get this next move right - stay or go? He can't afford to be like, ah, it's never going to happen here, so I'm out, when it MIGHT happen here. See Matt Ryan. He was soooooo anxious to go and start his clock that he missed out on a potential gold-mine of an opportunity at Notre Dame. You know what they say - grass ain't always greener.\n\nJim from Charlottesville VA: Hello Tom & All. I observe a lightness about the Coach retiring—both here and throughout college basketball— that does not extend to the players in this disastrous season. There’s something misguided about that. The Irish roster proved in over its head in November. In the flow of play this year, they too often get beaten by better players (who are better coached) to be pinned with beating themselves. Brey particularly should not throw them under that bus.\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Lightness? Around these parts? Not feeling that. If anything, I've been told I'm too hard on the coach and the players and the program. Gotta pat 'em on the back for giving it the old college try. As has been mentioned, Brey owns everything about this tire fire, but the players don't skate. Look at some of the end-of-game/close-game decisions they've made. That's not a coach thing. It's a player thing. Brey has talked a lot about this team taking ownership of itself, but no player has said, hey, this one's on us. We've failed Coach.\n\nMatt: I really hope Brey just empties what bench he has and let them all play at this point. Give the incoming coach some game film on them. They can't do any worse.\n\nTom Noie: Wanna bet...we crossed the \"this can't get any worse\" the afternoon of the North Carolina loss. My response to Dane Goodwin when he said it was, really? Sure it can get worse. Remember the core of this team was on the court when it trailed North Carolina by 52 in an ACC tournament game. Just when you think it can't get worse, it gets worse.\n\nCraig in NJ: Sorry Tom. I need a sarcasm font. The primary appeal of this position is job security.\n\nTom Noie: True, but if you get a coach worth anything, he'll be like, forget job security and no pressure. I want to freakin win.\n\nMatt: For the last game, if Brey isn't wearing a mock turtleneck underneath a Hawaiian shirt, I will be upset.\n\nTom Noie: Please, only in your dream. Or nightmare. Let's not make this more of a clown show than it already has been. Please. 😃\n\nWadelite: Tom, I am still mystified on the parent of a former player taking a cheap shot at you on Twitter. Garbage about you \"not being supportive\". What a crock as you have considerably more grief about being the opposite.\n\nTom Noie: It's all good. Just consider the source. Some people get it, some don't.\n\nTom D.: Does anyone ever confront Jack Swarbrick about ND's lack of commitment to basketball success. If so, what is his reply? Thanks!\n\nTom Noie: Tom: Confront probably not the right word to use. We're not in the confronting business (seriously). I've had plenty of talks with Jack Swarbrick, particularly about the basketball program. He'll give the standard middle of the road all is well AD kind of answer. Even though you both know that's not true. It's not in his nature, or job description, to ever admit that, yeah, we need to be better in that area.

The dog, who hails from the small town of Camden, was informally adopted by Rita Kimball in 2010 after she saw him hanging out in a grocery store parking lot.\n\n“He had been shaved up his back, had bloodstains around his neck from a chain or rope, and looked pretty rough,” Kimball said. \"The clerk in the grocery told us he had been there for three days, and they were feeding him scraps. ... When we left the store and entered the parking lot, he followed.\"\n\nKimball took the tiny pooch home and the rest was history.\n\nShe decided to name him Spike because he had a big attitude despite being \"small and friendly.”\n\nThe record-holder spends his time taking long walks with his owner, enjoying Braunschweiger sausage with cheese for dinner and waiting to take his weekly evening bath.\n\nSpike just celebrated his 24th birthday.\n\nFebruary: Dog famed for living with coyotes in Nevada reunites with family\n\nAfter living with a pack of coyotes in the Nevada desert for six months, a 4-year-old bull terrier named Hades was reunited with his family just in time for Valentine’s Day.\n\nThe Cabada family of Las Vegas fought to prove they were Hades' rightful owners after a bitter battle ensued between them and the women who rescued him from the wild.\n\nAfter nine days of reviewing photos, videos, and documentation from the family, a nonprofit shelter caring for the pup determined Hades did belong to the Cabadas after all.\n\n\"It was a very emotional reunion,\" Kelsey Pizzi, a spokeswoman for the Animal Foundation, told USA TODAY at the time. \"As soon as he saw his family, he ran right over to them ... He just kept jumping into everyone's arms.”\n\nThe family spent Valentine’s Day celebrating the return of their pup by baking a cake.\n\n\"We got him some Valentine's treats, he's here, home in his big old fluffy bed,\" Christy Cabada said at the time.\n\nMarch: Husky with lopsided grin finds forever home\n\nOne shelter dog’s unique looks made finding a home for him rather difficult. Harvey, a husky with an off-kilter muzzle, spent months in a Southern California waiting to be adopted.\n\nMost of the families that came around to adopt a pet would either ignore Harvey after a glance or say he was ugly. A shelter employee decided to lend Harvey a helping hand by sharing some of the canine’s best attributes on Facebook.\n\n\"Harvey is a quiet and mellow husky who gets along with other dogs and loves treats,\" according to the post. \"He has a facial deformity that doesn't bother him but gives him a crooked smile. I think it makes him even more endearing.\"\n\nIt didn’t take long for the shelter to get a bite.\n\nA Seattle woman by the name of Sherry Lankston came across the post, she commented that Harvey’s sweet face had her “swooning.\"\n\n\"I saw the post and shared a joke with my husband. I'm like, 'I found our second dog. His little wonky smile melted my little wonky heart,’” Lankston told USA TODAY.\n\nLankston and her family drove over 1,000 miles to meet Harvey in person. They realized they were going to adopt Harvey as soon as they saw him.\n\nLankston said Harvey's \"deformity\" is actually his superpower.\n\n\"That smile is literally one in a million,\" she said. \"He's gonna get away with so much trouble.\"\n\nApril: Adoption of massive cat in Virginia\n\nIt didn’t take long for someone to show interest in giving Patches, a 40-pound gray and white kitty, a fur-ever home, despite his unique health challenges.\n\nThe Richmond Animal Care and Control campaigned hard for Patches, with clever captions and pictures on social media to entice a potential owner.\n\n\"Did you wake up today and say, 'Let’s adopt the largest cat anyone has ever seen? If so, we have the cat for you,'” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post on April 19.\n\nPeople who expressed interest in adopting the “pretty sweet kitty” were asked to send the shelter an email with their home information and a written commitment to help Patches \"get to a safe and (healthy) weight,” USA TODAY reported.\n\nPatches was adopted later that same afternoon, the shelter confirmed in a video saying the cat was \"leaving the building.\"\n\nChristie Chipps Peters, director of Richmond Animal Care & Control, told USA Today the following morning that the feline was doing well in his new home.\n\n\"We are so happy to have found him a committed companion who will help him get to a healthy weight,\" Peters said.\n\nMay: Giant snapping turtle found in the Chicago River becomes internet sensation\n\nA Chicago resident took to the internet to document the sighting of a massive snapping turtle while they were sunbathing in the Chicago River, naming it Chonkasaurus.\n\nSince the clip was first posted in May, it has been viewed over 900,000 times.\n\n\"Great to see this beast thriving here on what was once such a toxic river, but is slowly getting cleaned up and restored,\" Joey Santore, who shared video of Chonkasaurus on X, wrote in the post.\n\n\"Somebody planted a bunch of native plants up the river from here, too,\" he said. \"I can only wonder (what) this thing's been eating.\"\n\nSantore decided to take the bit one step further by adding hilarious commentary about the surprise sighting as he kayaked along the river and chatted with another person about the giant reptile.\n\n\"That's a massive turtle … look at that beast,\" Santore is heard saying in the post as the turtle rests on rocks. \"Hey, how ya doing guy? You look good, you’re healthy.”\n\nJune: Video shows 28-year-old chimpanzee catch first glimpse of sky\n\nA 28-year-old chimpanzee named Vanilla melted hearts in June after video showing her see the sky for the first time after spending her life in a cage.\n\nSave the Chimps, a Florida sanctuary that captured the moment on video, had offered Vanilla a new home after the animal sanctuary where she lived in for 24 years closed down.\n\nVanilla was among four primates relocated to Save the Chimps.\n\n“Vanilla was a bit more apprehensive when the door opened to this new world” unlike some of her chimpanzee counterparts, who strolled right in, Save the Chimps previously told USA Today.\n\n“She sat in the doorway until Dwight, the alpha male, encouraged her to join him.”\n\nThe heartwarming video shows Vanilla leaping into Dwight’s arms while taking in the sky for the first time in her life.\n\nKeep looking up, Vanilla.\n\nJuly: Divers spot unique underwater creature in Taiwan\n\nDivers documented a rare encounter with a deep sea creature off the coast of Taiwan in June.\n\nThe oarfish, characterized by a scaleless body covered in silvery guanine are usually found 200 to 1,000 feet below the surface, making the sighting highly unusual. The underwater creature, also known as Regalecus glesne, can be found pretty much anywhere except the Arctic.\n\nThe viral video, originally published by diving instructor Wang Cheng-Ru in June, shows the group coming upon the deep-sea fish in shallow water off the coast of the Ruifang District on the northeast corner of the island, USA Today reported.\n\n“Many amazing animals can be found off Taiwan's northeast coast … but it was my first encounter with a giant oarfish,” Cheng-Ru told Newsweek.\n\nGuinness World Records once named the oarfish the \"longest bony fish in the world.\"\n\nIn 1963, an oarfish was caught in New Jersey that was an estimated 50 feet long, and in 1885, a 600-pound specimen was caught in Maine.\n\nAugust: Giraffe without spots born at Tennessee Zoo\n\nKipekee isn’t like any giraffe you have seen. She's better.\n\nThe giraffe, born at Brights Zoo in Limestone, Tennessee on July 31, is the only known giraffe to be born without any spots, zoo officials previously shared with USA TODAY.\n\nThe last known sighting of a pattern-less giraffe was in Tokyo over 50 years ago. The animal, considered an endangered species, was added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List in 2018.\n\nMutation in one or more genes might be the cause of Kipekee’s unusual coloring, Sara Ferguson, a wildlife veterinarian and conservation health coordinator at the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, told National Geographic.\n\nShe was also the only one of her siblings born with a solid brown coat.\n\nBrights Zoo Director David Bright confirmed with NatGeo in August that Kipekee’s coloring was definitely a surprise, but stated that “she’s healthy and normal.”\n\nThe zoo decided to make the announcement of the rare giraffe’s birth a tad more exciting by allowing the public to vote for one of four names on Aug. 22, landing on Kipekee a week later. Kipekee's name means \"unique.\"\n\nZoo officials hope all the attention Kipekee has gotten since her birth will help conservation efforts.\n\n“The international coverage of our pattern-less baby giraffe has created a much-needed spotlight on giraffe conservation,” Tony Bright, the founder of Brights Zoo, said in a press release. \"Wild populations are silently slipping into extinction, with 40% of the wild giraffe population lost in just the last three decades.\"\n\nSeptember: Baby burro rescued after its mother was killed\n\nA baby burro got a second chance at life after it was rescued by an Arizona state trooper.\n\nThe day-old foal in question narrowly avoided death after its mother was hit and killed by a car on Sept. 5 near Lake Pleasant, about an hour north of Phoenix, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThe baby burro had a few minor injuries and remained in the area where his mother was killed. As soon as Arizona Department of Public Safety trooper Sgt. Roger Hansen got the call, he went to pick him up.\n\nHe knew the young foal wouldn’t survive by itself in the wild so he contacted Stacie Thomas of One Step Wild Burros and Mustang Rescue in New River. Thomas agreed to take in the foal if Hansen could get him to the rescue, so Hansen carefully loaded up the little burro in the back of his patrol vehicle.\n\nThe baby burro settled in with a nursing burro not long after getting to the sanctuary.\n\n“The little guy quickly settled in and adjusted to his adoptive mom, and has been eating, running, and playing just like a little burro should,\" according to a Facebook post by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. \"Ms. Thomas’ grandson even named the little burro “Roger” in honor of Sgt. Hansen.\"\n\nOctober: Gallery of funniest animal photos showcased in global competition\n\nA host of animals from all over the world, including two tangoing horses and a kangaroo air guitarist, made the image and video lineup of the 2023 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards.\n\nThe global competition was made up of a “wonderful eclectic mix of hilarious wildlife,” USA TODAY reported.\n\nAll the photographs, taken by both professional and amateur photographers, were “all hilarious and sure to raise a cackle or a chuckle and wonder at the wonderful wildlife we share this world with,” officials said in a statement.\n\nThe shortlist consisted of 41 standalone photographs, three videos and three portfolio entries chosen from thousands of entries. Winners were announced on Nov. 23, with the top image winning a one-week safari in Kenya.\n\nNovember: Golden retriever farm in Vermont goes viral\n\nOne Vermont-based couple’s love of golden retrievers inspired them to create a one-of-a-kind experience for dog-lovers.\n\nA Golden Dog Farm in Jeffersonville, Vermont hosts an activity called \"The Golden Retriever Experience,\" also called a “happy hour,” where you get to hang and cuddle with a group of golden retrievers for a while, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nThe one-hour sessions allow guests to bask in the company of at least 10 dogs from Butternut Goldens, all while they enjoy snacks and refreshments.\n\nGolden Dog Farm owners Doug and Becca Worple said that the overwhelming success they have experienced so far did not seem like a given when they decided to take on the venture in early 2023, when bookings were few and far between.\n\nThat all changed when a video about the experience made it to the TikTok account of travel influencer @mydarlingpassport, racking up 5.6 million views.\n\n\"We went to bed on a Thursday night and Friday morning we woke up and everything was sold out,\" Worple said. \"We then immediately added more dates and those sold out. Then we added more dates.\"\n\nThe experience is currently booked through the last couple days of the year, but you might get a chance to hang with these goldens in the new year. If you book early.\n\n\"People are so happy when they're here, they have this childlike joy on their faces,\" Worple said. \"People cry because they're so happy.\"\n\nDecember: Young Indiana girl rescues Arctic duck\n\nA young Indiana girl is the reason why a rare Artic duck named Rosealini was able to make it back home.\n\nThe 1-pound, long-tailed duck was found in the middle of the road a couple days before Christmas Eve, according to Hancock Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation, a non-profit wildlife rescue and rehabilitation group that took in the displaced bird on Dec. 22.\n\nThe wildlife rescue group determined that Rosealini was a female sea duck, which are \"normally found in the Arctic and northern coastal regions, USA TODAY reported.\n\nAs for how Rosealini ended up in the area of from Greenfield – about 25 miles east of Indianapolis – much less on the road, is anyone’s guess.\n\n\"There are a few small retention ponds in the area where she was found, but no real bodies of water. She was literally in the middle of town,” Jen Hancock, founder and director of the rescue foundation, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nRosealini did not appear to be injured. but was immediately taken to the shelter.\n\nHancock told USA TODAY that the duck was very weak and was given \"TLC, R&R, anti-inflammatory medication, and some good food.\"\n\n\"Once she regained her strength and finished her meds, she was more than ready to be wild again,\" said Hancock.\n\nRosealini was released back into the water Tuesday, where she could be seen taking several dives and paddling in videos shared by the shelter on Facebook.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/24/early-retirement-5-downsides-no-one-tells-you/1553587001/", "title": "I retired at 34 with $3 million—here are the downsides no one tells you", "text": "Sam Dogen\n\nCNBC\n\nMany people have negative views on young retirees: They’re spoiled. They’re lazy. Their parents helped them. They won the lottery. But none of these things apply to me.\n\nI grew up in a middle-income household. I worked hard to earn good grades and pay for college. I was the first one in the office and the last to leave. Sure, I got lucky by landing a high-paying investment banking job and in some of my investments, but I live a frugal life and have always been diligent about staying on top of my finances\n\nAll of that played a huge role in my early retirement in 2012, at 34. By the time I quit my job, I had amassed a net worth of about $3 million that generated roughly $80,000 in investment income per year.\n\nI don’t regret my decision\n\nI won’t lie: Early retirement has been a dream come true. I gave up a healthy six-figure paycheck, but I gained something priceless in return: Freedom.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\nPeople told me I was crazy to leave a high-paying job at such a young age, but I was absolutely burned out and felt disillusioned by my industry of work. I never anticipated how miserable I’d be working in finance, especially after the financial crisis.\n\nEarly retirement isn’t for everyone. But from my experience, the pros outweigh the cons. I get to wake up whenever I want. I no longer have to endure unproductive meetings or put up with nefarious colleagues. I’ve traveled to more than 20 countries with my wife, wrote a book on how to negotiate a severance and get to coach high school tennis.\n\nI also became a dad in 2017. Being a parent has been the toughest full-time job I’ve ever had; it makes working in investment banking for 13 years feel like a walk in the park.\n\nAre you middle class?:Here are 5 traits you might have\n\nThe downsides of early retirement\n\nI will admit that there are a few downsides. (I finally understand why researchers say that, no matter how much of a boost we get in freedom or money, we eventually revert back to our normal baseline of happiness.)\n\nIn a 2017 CompHealth survey, 68% of the 400 late-career physicians surveyed said they were not excited about retirement. Some of the top concerns included losing social interactions at work, a loss of purpose, boredom and depression.\n\nThat said, here are the biggest negatives of early retirement that no one likes to talk about:\n\n1) You may suffer from an identity crisis.\n\nOne of the most common questions people ask when they first meet each other is: “What do you do for a living?”\n\nWhen you’ve spent at least a decade working in any job, you may find it incredibly jolting to no longer be identified as the marketing expert, the investment professional or the management consultant.\n\nIt was only after I left my job that I realized how obsessed I was with my profession. I often wondered: How is the business doing without me? I was there for 11 years. Were they really able to survive without my expertise?\n\nBut after months of no emails or phone calls begging for me to come back, I finally accepted the fact that I was no longer needed.\n\nTraveling this summer? 5 ways to save money and nab last-minute flight deals\n\n2) You may second-guess yourself.\n\nWhen you retire young, you may find yourself questioning whether you made the right choice and regret all the money and status you forewent.\n\nI still had a mortgage to pay and was worried that I made a grave mistake. But after some time, my retirement plans grew clearer. I started writing more on Financial Samurai, the personal finance website I started in 2009. It was a cathartic way of dealing any stress and uncertainty.\n\nFortunately, after writing three times a week for the past 10 years, Financial Samurai has grown tremendously. I reinvested 100% of the profits it made and generated a decent amount of passive income.\n\n3) People may treat you like a misfit.\n\nMaybe it’s because retiring early is unconventional. Or maybe they’re secretly jealous you’re not grinding away at a day job. Whatever the reason, people won’t always give you the same amount of respect as they would to a working-class citizen.\n\nEventually, I grew tired of explaining why I retired early or that I wasn’t a trust fund kid. To keep the discussion simple and regain a social identity, I’d simply say I was a writer and tennis coach.\n\nPrivacy, please:This $13 million self-sustainable private island near Manhattan is for sale\n\n4) You’ll be surprised that you aren’t that much happier.\n\nMany people think that once they achieve financial freedom or leave a job they hate, they’ll be permanently happier. But, as I mentioned earlier, research has found that any significant amount of elevated happiness is only short-term.\n\nOne a scale of one to 10, my happiness level skyrocketed to a 10 after I was able to negotiate a pretty solid severance. It was enough to pay for five years worth of living expenses. But not too long after that check hit my bank account, I reverted back to my normal post-retirement baseline of happiness.\n\n5) You may get really, really bored.\n\nRetiring early is like finishing the season finale of your favorite TV show. You’re glad it got a nice ending, but you’re also sad it’s over and left wondering what’s next.\n\nWith an extra 10 to 14 hours of free time every day, my productivity suffered and I grew less motivated to achieve great wins. It didn’t help that none of my friends or former colleagues were able to hang out. There were no more company holiday parties or various client events. Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed those things!\n\nNow, I try to attend various meet-up events in order to make new friends, but my social life mostly consists of the folks I meet through playing tennis and softball.\n\nIt wasn’t until three years later, when my wife joined me in early retirement, that my boredom began to dissipate. We did a lot of traveling, but more importantly, we became parents, which renewed my sense of purpose.\n\nJaws, Batman, Finding Nemo, and more:Biggest summer blockbuster each year since 1975\n\nEarly retirement won’t solve all your problems\n\nHere’s the truth: If you’re unhappy before you retire early, it’s likely that you’ll still be unhappy after you retire. It’s better to figure out what’s at the very core of your issues and fix them first. Then, have a clear vision of what you actually plan to do when you retire. Otherwise, you’re just treating retirement as a crutch — and that rarely ever works out.\n\nAfter seven years of retirement, I finally found my groove by regularly doing things that I enjoy:\n\nWriting on Financial Samurai\n\nInvesting in real estate\n\nCoaching high school tennis\n\nBeing a husband and stay-at-home parent\n\n(I consider the first two to be more like hobbies, even though I make some money off of them.)\n\nEarly retirement isn’t the elixir to everlasting happiness, but it sure beats commuting to work and sitting in meetings all day long!\n\nSam Dogen worked in investing banking for 13 years before starting Financial Samurai, a personal finance website.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume.

Biden wouldn’t invite Zelensky to Washington – and endure a risky trip outside Ukraine for the first time since the war began – if he did not believe something real could be accomplished meeting face-to-face instead of over the phone.\n\nEmerging from their talks, both men made clear they see the war entering a new phase. As Russia sends more troops to the frontlines and wages a brutal air campaign against civilian targets, fears of a stalemate are growing.\n\nYet as Zelensky departed Washington for a lengthy and similarly risky return trip to Ukraine, it wasn’t clear that a pathway to ending the conflict was any clearer.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Congress as Rep.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky's wartime visit to US Prev Next\n\nBiden and Zelensky try to figure out how the war ends\n\nGaining clarity on where Zelensky stands when it comes to ending the war was among the prerogatives in bringing him to the White House. The Ukrainian leader had previously expressed a desire for a “just peace” that would end the conflict – a point that US officials said would be at the center of their talks Wednesday.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Zelensky used bellicose rhetoric that suggested such a peace was not close, saying the road to ending the war would not involve making concessions to Russia.\n\n“For me as a president, ‘just peace’ is no compromises,” he said, indicating he doesn’t see any road to peace that involves Ukraine giving up territory or sovereignty.\n\nLater, in his address to Congress, Zelensky said he’d presented a 10-point peace formula to Biden – though US officials said afterward it was the same plan he offered to world leaders at the Group of 20 summit last month.\n\nAmong the Western nations that have rallied in support behind Zelensky, there have been lingering concerns about what Zelensky’s long-term plan might be.\n\nFor his part, Biden said it was up to Zelensky to “decide how he wants to the war to end,” a long-held view that leaves plenty of questions unanswered.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Zelensky's historic speech to Congress 26:43 - Source: CNN\n\nZelensky shows he knows his audience – and displays his showmanship\n\nZelensky peppered his address to lawmakers with references to American history, from the critical Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolutionary War to the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.\n\nHe delivered his address in English, a purposeful choice he telegraphed ahead of the speech. Even his attire – the now-familiar Army green shirt, cargo pants and boots – seemed designed to remind his audience they were in the presence of a wartime leader.\n\nOver the course of the conflict, Zelensky has demonstrated an acute ability to appeal to his audience, be they national legislatures or the audience of the Grammys.\n\nOn Wednesday, he sought to harness Americans’ emotional response to his country’s suffering, evoking dark winter nights as Russia seeks to interrupt Ukraine’s power supply.\n\n“In two days we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be – there will be no electricity,” he said.\n\nBut he also seemed aware that many Americans – including some Republicans in Congress – have wondered aloud why billions of US dollars are needed for a conflict thousands of miles away. He sought to make the cause about more than his own homeland.\n\n“The battle is not only for life, freedom, and security of Ukrainians or any other nation which Russia attempts to conquer,” he said. “The struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live in.”\n\nHe added, “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch Zelensky unveil flag during historic speech to Congress 01:59 - Source: CNN\n\nZelensky finally accepts the ride he was offered – and gets the ammo too\n\nAt the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Zelensky turned down an American offer to evacuate him from Kyiv.\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride,” Zelensky told the US.\n\nTen months later, he got both. When Zelensky touched down outside Washington in a US military plane Wednesday, his arrival capped a 10-day sprint by American and Ukrainian officials to arrange a risky wartime visit meant to rally support for Ukraine’s ongoing resistance to Russia’s invasion.\n\nJust ahead of Zelensky’s arrival, the Biden administration announced it is sending nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine – including a sophisticated new Patriot air defense system that Zelensky has been requesting for months.\n\nIn weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested to advisers he did not want to travel to Washington had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship with the United States, according to a source familiar with the matter. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nYet standing alongside Biden, he was frank that he did not view the single Patriot system as enough.\n\n“We would like to get more Patriots,” he said as Biden laughed. “I’m sorry but we are in war.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'This is Vladimir Putin's worst nightmare': Tapper reacts to Zelensky's speech 01:19 - Source: CNN\n\nA united front in one of the world’s most complicated relationships\n\nSpeaking later to Congress, Zelensky was again up front that he did not believe the American support was sufficient.\n\n“Is it enough? Honestly, not really,” he said of the artillery that the US has so far provided.\n\nZelensky’s candid request for more Patriots – and Biden’s lighthearted response – amounted to a window into one of the world’s most complicated relationships.\n\nOn the surface, Biden and Zelensky have maintained a stalwart partnership. And Zelensky was effusive in his praise of Biden as he went from the Oval Office to the East Room to Capitol Hill.\n\nYet it doesn’t take much to see tensions just beneath the surface. Zelensky has consistently agitated for additional US support, despite the tens of billions of dollars in military assistance that Biden has directed to his country.\n\nThat hasn’t always sat well with Biden or his team. But as he has with a host of other foreign leaders, Biden appeared intent Wednesday on translating physical proximity into a better understanding of his counterpart.\n\n“It is all about looking someone in the eye. I mean it sincerely. I don’t think there is any substitute for sitting down face to face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Listen to Zelensky's message to Americans from Oval Office 06:00 - Source: CNN\n\nA visit that symbolizes a ‘new phase’ in the war\n\nBiden invited Zelensky to Washington this week because he believes the war in Ukraine is entering a “new phase,” officials said ahead of the visit. As winter sets in and Russia continues targeting civilian infrastructure, the moment seemed ripe for Zelensky to make a dramatic public appeal for continued international support.\n\nYet the new phase isn’t only on the battlefield. Around the world, leaders are confronting the bitter fallout of Russia’s invasion. Higher energy and food prices, in part generated by tough sanctions on Moscow, have caused trouble for politicians in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn Washington, Republicans poised to take control of Congress have made clear they won’t rubber stamp each of Biden’s requests for Ukraine assistance – though fears funding will dry up completely appear unfounded. Congress is on the verge of approving almost $50 billion in additional security and economic assistance.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers, Zelensky repeatedly referred to members of “both parties,” seeking to frame his cause as a bipartisan one.\n\nStill, some Republicans refused to attend Zelensky’s address to Congress, a protest of what they claim are unrestrained dollars heading out of the US.\n\nIt was against that backdrop Biden insisted US support would continue for months.\n\nHe said it was “important for the American people, and for the world, to hear directly from you, Mr. President, about Ukraine’s fight, and the need to continue to stand together through 2023.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/06/14/russian-hopes-fears-tied-up-in-putins-showcase-world-cup/36025433/", "title": "Russian hopes, fears tied up in Putin's showcase World Cup", "text": "AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin claims soccer and politics have nothing to do with each other, yet the World Cup he kicked off Thursday is about much more than sports.\n\nIt's about proving to the world that Russia is a global power broker and not an outcast, that it's an open, confident and generous nation — and not an isolated, repressive place hobbled by sanctions.\n\nAnd the beleaguered Russian team's stunning 5-0 victory in the tournament opener Thursday against Saudi Arabia was just what Putin needed to make the point that Russia is ascendant again.\n\nSidestepping deep divisions between his strongman worldview and that of many Western countries, Putin welcomed fans to his \"hospitable\" nation by inviting them to \"make new friends with people who share the same values.\"\n\nBut critics fear the World Cup will legitimize Putin's autocratic policies at home and Russia's actions abroad, from alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election to annexing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. Moscow vehemently denies any interference in the American vote or involvement in the attack against a former Russian spy in Salisbury.\n\nRacism, homophobia, conflicts over Syria and Ukraine — \"all these rebukes have no relation to the World Cup,\" his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. \"Today the soccer dimension is the most important one.\"\n\nThe monthlong World Cup — the first Russia has ever hosted — is also about Putin proving to his compatriots that he's both their best global envoy and a man of the people, who brought the world's most-watched sporting event to ordinary soccer fans in 11 cities across Russia's expanse.\n\nThat's especially important for a country that prides itself on athletic prowess but whose last massive sporting event — the 2014 Sochi Olympics — was indelibly stained by revelations of doping so widespread that Russia was banned from this year's Winter Games.\n\n\"It's important for Russia to have this (tournament), we can show that we are a global football power,\" said Moscow financier Dmitry Finapetov, his face streaked with white-blue-red paint, as he nearly spilled his beer in excitement at his team's strong showing at Luzhniki.\n\n\"When I used to travel abroad I would think, 'why can't it be like this at home?'\" he said. \"But now I travel and I think things are better at home. ... Now foreigners can see that too.\"\n\nGeopolitics were front and center for Thursday's opener, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as Putin's star guest.\n\nPutin welcomed a \"friendly global family\" of soccer fans to celebrate the World Cup, but the Kremlin's guest list showed where Russia's allegiances lie: the head of the North Korean upper house of parliament, Lebanon's prime minister and the presidents of Rwanda, Paraguay, Bolivia, Panama and leaders of eight friendly former Soviet republics. Britain's royal family and top politicians are among those who pointedly stayed away.\n\nElectrical engineer Sergei Tabachnikov, who came to Moscow from the Pacific Coast island of Sakhalin for the opening match, welcomed the international scrutiny that comes with hosting an event of this scale and hoped Russia learns something from it.\n\n\"Criticism is necessary. It helps us improve,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities walked a careful line Thursday between hard-line security measures and a veneer of tolerance.\n\nA British gay rights activist was arrested for a protest action near Red Square, but quickly released.\n\nMinutes before the opening match, riot police hauled an unauthorized flag vendor into a police van just outside Luzhniki Stadium as he shouted \"Help me! Help me!\" and fans filmed on their phones. An officer then turned to the crowd, speaking in English and saying in a calming voice, \"Nothing to worry about, go enjoy the game.\"\n\nBritish pop singer Robbie Williams also played it safe in the opening concert. He revved up the crowd but diplomatically avoided singing his hit song \"Party Like A Russian\" — which is rife with stereotypes about Russian extravagance and includes a dig at an unnamed Russian leader who \"alleviates the population\" of its wealth.\n\n\"Football and love\" was the theme of Thursday's opening show, as a debate raged among Russian lawmakers about whether Russian women should hook up with visiting fans.\n\nBut mostly the mood was exuberant, with Saudi fans taking selfies with Russians in the stadium's corridors. Cheers of \"Ro-si-ya, Ro-si-ya!\" or \"Russia, Russia!\" roared throughout the match.\n\nAlexander Klimov, who came from the southern Russian city of Stavropol, summed it up by blowing kisses and saying, \"Thank you everybody for coming in our country.

So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Molotov cocktails and personal arms. See how Ukrainians are fighting back 02:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Zelensky called on citizens of the world also to join the fight against the “Russian war criminals.”\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend. Russian authorities have detained a total of 4,862 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country since the invasion of Ukraine was ordered independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová Laura Smith-Spark Julia Hollingsworth", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/politics/american-presidents-queen-elizabeth-ii/index.html", "title": "'One of my favorite people': What Queen Elizabeth II meant to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Princess Elizabeth landed at Washington National Airport on the last day of October 1951, she emerged from her airplane in a raspberry red coat, a new velvet-brimmed hat and, some people observed, more makeup than usual.\n\nIt was her first official visit to the United States, three months before she would become Queen.

He later wrote that he would \"cherish the memory of that delightful evening,\" in a birthday letter written to the Queen. He added: \"The people of the United States join with me in extending to your Majesty and to the people of the Commonwealth best wishes and hearty congratulations on the occasion of the celebration of your birthday. ...

Nixon also brought a signed headshot. \"I didn't bring my wife along this time, 'cause this trip was so hurried,\" he said. \"But we just had a picture taken of the two of us.

I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman. We will always remember our visit to Windsor Castle because of the Queen's and Prince Philip's warmth and welcoming hospitality -- they could not have been more gracious.\" Diana Walker/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images George H.W. Bush: Bush visited the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1989, and in May 1991, she was guest of honor at a state dinner in the White House. The pair exchanged toasts about the legacy of human rights and the rule of law bequeathed upon the United States by Great Britain. Meanwhile, the Queen spoke about her previous visits to the White House and the history of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Bush said during his welcome address: \"We have got a lot of things in common. Americans share the Queen's love for horses. ... Most of all what links our countries is less a place than an idea. The idea that for nearly 400 years has been America's inheritance and England's bequest: the legacy of democracy, the rule of law and basic human rights.\" Jerome Delay/AFP/Getty Images Bill Clinton: Clinton met the Queen more than once during his tenure. He said: \"She's a highly intelligent woman who knows a lot about the world. ... I always marvel when we meet at what a keen judge she is of human events. I think she's a very impressive person. I like her very much.\" During a trip to Europe in 2000, Clinton said he noticed that although the Queen's hair had turned gray, she had what he described as \"youthful eyes.\" He added: \"She has these baby blue eyes, just piercing.\" Paul J.

Ian Nicholson/AP Barack Obama: \"There's one last thing that I should mention that I love about Great Britain, and that is the Queen,\" Obama said at the end of his joint press conference with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown during a visit to the UK in 2009. \"And so I'm very much looking forward to meeting her for the first time later this evening. ... I think in the imagination of people throughout America, I think what the Queen stands for and her decency and her civility, what she represents, that's very important.\" Later, during a reception for G-20 leaders, Michelle Obama was seen to take the unusual step of putting her hand briefly on the back of the Queen. This was against protocol, but the monarch seemed to have reached out her hand first and didn't appear bothered by the first lady's gesture.

In a Fox News interview just after the trip to London, Trump called the Queen an \"incredible lady\" and said they had a lot of fun together. Some members of the British public and press were not amused, however, when Trump briefly walked in front of the Queen during a ceremonial inspection of the troops at Windsor Castle. The monarch had to do an awkward sidestep around him. Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images Joe Biden: Biden first met the Queen as a young senator in 1982. He returned nearly 40 years later, after his first G7 summit as President. They held private talks inside Windsor Castle, and Biden later said he wished he could have spoken to her longer. \"She was very generous,\" Biden said. He said he did not think she'd be insulted if he said she \"reminded me of my mother in terms of the look of her and the generosity.\" Chris Jackson/Getty Images All the Queen's presidents: From Truman to Biden Prev Next\n\nIt was the first time Elizabeth would encounter a sitting American president. Over her reign, she would meet 12 more, each man paying a degree of homage to the duty-bound woman whose very life charted a century of history.\n\nPerhaps no other person had met personally with so many American leaders or had witnessed at close range the upheavals of war, technology and politics that have defined the “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nRemoved from the politics of transatlantic relations, yet still at the very center of British identity, the Queen provided American presidents a connection to their predecessors, a reminder of what a life devoted to public service looks like and a bit of uniquely royal glitz.\n\nMany emerged enchanted, spellbound or starstruck.\n\n“Whenever anyone becomes acquainted with you,” Truman told Elizabeth that day in 1951, “they immediately fall in love.”\n\nIt was a sentiment that would be repeated, in so many words, for the next 70 years, as American leaders visited her at her palaces in the United Kingdom or when she traveled to the White House.\n\n“She is truly one of my favorite people,” then-President Barack Obama said during a visit to London in 2016, after the Queen and her husband drove in their Land Rover to pick him up at Windsor Castle. “She’s an astonishing person, and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.”\n\nSome presidents, like Ronald Reagan, bonded with the Queen over horses and country life. Others, like Bill Clinton, found themselves impressed by her political aptitude.\n\nIn recent years, as she aged, presidents saw in her their own pasts. President Donald Trump said after meeting her, his Scottish-born mother would be proud. When he visited the Queen at Windsor last year, President Joe Biden said she reminded him of his own mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s first state visit to Washington came in 1957, hosted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at an important moment for the new sovereign to represent her country with its most important ally.\n\nYet even Eisenhower, the commanding general of US forces in Europe during World War II, found himself humbled in the presence of the Queen.\n\n“There have been a few times in my life when I have wished that the gift of eloquence might have been conferred upon me,” he said during his toast at the state dinner. “This evening is one of those times.”\n\nAs it turned out, the Queen had a penchant for bringing out the relaxed side of the American leaders she encountered. After inviting Eisenhower to Balmoral, her estate in the Scottish Highlands where she died on Thursday, the Queen promised to provide him her recipe for scones. She followed up in a letter several months later.\n\n“Dear Mr. President,” she wrote in her scrawling, distinct hand. “Seeing a picture of you in today’s newspaper, standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail, reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe of the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral.”\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy arrived in London for a state visit in 1961, he and his glamorous wife Jacqueline were met with crowds of Britons lining the streets. The dinner was described as “pleasant,” though later there were rumors of tensions between the Queen and first lady over the guest list.\n\nKennedy, who was assassinated two years later, did not meet the Queen again. But when Britain dedicated a memorial to Kennedy in Surrey, around 20 miles outside London, the Queen paid tribute alongside Mrs. Kennedy and the slain President’s children.\n\nShe never met President Lyndon B. Johnson as his presidency became consumed by the war in Vietnam; he remained the only president she did not meet during her reign.\n\nThe Queen had already met Richard Nixon when he was serving as vice president, but met him again as president in 1969, when he paid a visit to the United Kingdom. Later, when the Queen’s children – Prince Charles and Princess Anne – visited the Nixon White House, observers thought the President seemed unusually interested, hiring bands and arranging a special ceremony.\n\nThere was even a hint of potential romance – though it didn’t pan out.\n\n“That was the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon,” Charles recounted in an interview with CNN in 2021.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was serving in office as the United States marked the 200th anniversary of American independence, a bicentennial that also marked its severance from Britain. Perhaps in a show of enduring US-UK ties, Ford hosted the Queen for a state dinner underneath a tent in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn a yellow chiffon gown and diamond tiara, the Queen was whisked around the dance floor by the President.\n\n“The Queen was easy to deal with,” then-first lady Betty Ford recounted in her memoir. “She was very definite about what she wanted and what she didn’t want. She loves Bob Hope and Telly Savalas, so we invited Bob Hope and Telly Savalas.”\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter had a somewhat more mortifying experience during his visit to Buckingham Palace in 1977: He kissed the Queen Mother on her lips.\n\n“Nobody has done that since my husband died,” she exclaimed. Her husband, King George VI, died in 1952.\n\nNo president appeared more comfortable with the Queen than Ronald Reagan, who became the first American leader to spend the night at Windsor Castle in 1982. A shared love of horses – she the English rider; he the Western cowboy (at least in movies) – seemed to cement their relationship.\n\n“I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman,” Reagan wrote in his memoir. He invited her the following year to his Rancho Del Cielo property in California, initially making plans for her to sail into Santa Barbara harbor on the royal yacht.\n\nA severe storm scuttled the maritime plans, forcing the Queen to arrive by airplane. At the ranch, Reagan wore a jean jacket and bolo tie to serve her and her husband a Tex-Mex lunch: enchiladas, chiles rellenos, refried beans, tacos, rice and guacamole.\n\nTheir friendship would stretch beyond Reagan’s presidency. In 1989, she granted Reagan honorary knighthood to recognize the US assistance during the Falkland Wars.\n\nWhen she came to Washington a few years later, President George H.W. Bush brought her to a Baltimore Orioles game and hosted her at the White House – where she ended up encountering another, future president.\n\nSpeaking with George W. Bush in 1991 about the new pair of boots he was wearing for her visit, the younger Bush revealed they’d been stamped with the words “God save the Queen.” That prompted her to ask if he was the black sheep of the family.\n\n“I guess so,” he acknowledged.\n\n“All families have them,” she replied.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton’s presidency, he met with the Queen during a tour of her palace and at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But during a visit to London in 1997, he and his wife Hillary turned down the Queen’s invitation to tea, preferring instead to “be a tourist,” according to documents released by the UK’s National Archives last year.\n\n“The Americans said that the President and Mrs. Clinton were very grateful for HM The Queen’s invitation to tea at the Palace, but would wish to decline politely,” a note from Blair’s private secretary, Phillip Barton, revealed.\n\nStill, Clinton was impressed by the Queen’s unique abilities.\n\n“Her Majesty impressed me as someone who but for the circumstance of her birth, might have become a successful politician or diplomat. As it was, she had to be both, without quite seeming to be either,” he wrote in his memoir.\n\nMore than a decade after their chance initial meeting in his father’s White House, George W. Bush meet the queen several times, including when he became the first US president to be received with a state visit to Britain in 2003.\n\nHe would host Queen Elizabeth’s final visit to the White House in 2007; it was a symbolic nod to her first State Visit as queen 50 years earlier and marked the 400th anniversary of the English settlement of Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nDuring his welcoming remarks, he inadvertently suggested the Queen had also visited the White House in 1776 – adding 200 years to her age.\n\n“She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,” he said after winking in the monarch’s direction.\n\nThe aging queen would not return to the White House again but continued receiving American presidents in Britain. When Obama and his wife arrived in London in 2009, they came bearing an iPod loaded with footage of her previous visits to Washington, along with recordings of some of Obama’s speeches.\n\nEtiquette hawks were aghast when Michelle Obama placed her hand on the Queen, but the Queen herself did not seem to care. Speaking with aides after a dinner at Buckingham Palace, Obama remarked she reminded him of his own grandmother.\n\n“She’s just like Toot, my grandmother. Courteous. Straightforward. All about what she thinks. She doesn’t suffer fools,” he said, according to a memoir by one of his aides.\n\nHis two predecessors also felt pangs of maternal memory when they encountered the queen in the final years of her life.\n\n“I was walking up and I was saying (to wife Melania): ‘Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle,’” Donald Trump told an interviewer afterward.\n\nTrump’s mother, born on the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, was enraptured by the Queen; Trump recalled her watching Elizabeth’s coronation on television. While his own visit to Windsor had awkward moments, like when he walked in front of the Queen as they were reviewing an honor guard, the Queen herself evinced no displeasure.\n\nWhen Biden visited the United Kingdom for a Group of 7 summit in 2021, the Queen made a surprise decision to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders, a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nWhen she hosted Biden later at Windsor Castle, she asked him about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nUnlike Trump or Obama, Biden is not an Anglophile. He’s a proud Irish American who has – sometimes jokingly – made references to the long British rule over his ancestors’ island.\n\nLast year also wasn’t his first time meeting the Queen; as a young senator, he’d received advice from his mother – an Irish American born with the surname Finnegan – ahead of a planned engagement with the monarch.\n\n“Don’t you bow down to her,” she told him in 1982, according to a memoir Biden published several years ago.\n\nWhen he met her last year, he did not bow. But he did remark on a familiar resemblance.\n\n“I don’t think she’ll be insulted,” he said, “but she reminded me of my mother.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/09/putin-xi-biden-g20-summit-india/70768098007/", "title": "No Putin. No Xi. Why Biden views the G20 as essential", "text": "WASHINGTON — For more than two decades, world leaders have gathered at the Group of 20 economic summit to deliver scripted and unscripted remarks behind closed doors and try to work through their differences to reach a consensus on how to best approach pressing global challenges.\n\nIn those unseen moments, officials from rival nations with diverging interests have a shot at building relationships and diplomatic cache that every so often results in a consequential agreement that could not have been forged if dignitaries and their aides had not gathered together in one room.\n\nAt this weekend's summit, the changing dynamics of the G20 will be in sharp relief as two of the biggest players, China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, skip the previously unmissable event. Their absence has not deterred President Joe Biden – who has been vigorously testing for COVID-19 after his wife contracted the virus – from making the long journey to India for the gathering that the U.S. is insisting has not lost its gusto.\n\nAmerican presidents have often seized on the forum as an opportunity to engage with authoritarian leaders and steer the outcome toward a more U.S-friendly policy agenda. But now, those same leaders are skipping the G20 as they grapple with economic problems at home and turn their attention to building out alternative multinational organizations and partnerships that they have more control over.\n\n\"For most of its history, the G20 lived up to its promise, but for it to function, the leaders of the major countries in the world have to show up,\" said Daleep Singh, former deputy national security adviser for international economics to Biden. \"Leadership starts with showing up, and there's no substitute for face-to-face communication at the highest levels of government to confront the world's biggest problems.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nXi and Putin are sending high-ranking representatives from their governments to the gathering of the world's largest economies and the European Union in New Delhi this weekend after expanding membership last month in an economic conglomerate of countries that are more to their liking.\n\n\"We remain committed to the G20 as a critical forum for all of the major economies of the world to come together for global problem-solving,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters last week, stressing that the United States is planning to host the G20 three years from now in 2026.\n\nThe last time Putin attended a G20 leaders' summit in person was in 2019, when Donald Trump was still in office. The gathering was held virtually in 2020. Putin and Xi also participated in the 2021 Rome summit virtually amid the pandemic. Biden attended the summit in person.\n\nA presidential priority\n\nBiden has made international summits such as the G20 and the smaller, more U.S.-aligned Group of Seven, a cornerstone of his foreign policy, taking full advantage of the opportunity to have formal and informal conversations with U.S. allies and countries with which his administration has difficult relations at the multiday functions.\n\n\"He works the room so that there's an element of trust, and then that trust is a form of diplomatic capital that you can trade for real things that matter to people back home. That's his style,\" Singh explained.\n\nAt last year's gathering, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, Biden met with his Chinese counterpart in person for the first time since the U.S. leader became president.\n\nAlthough they have had no direct communication since, high-ranking members of their respective governments have traveled between the nations' capitals, and Biden hinted at a meeting this fall with Xi, possibly at a conference for Pacific Rim countries the U.S. is hosting in November, as he expressed disappointment that the Chinese leader would not be in India.\n\n\"It would be nice to have him here, but no the summit is going well,\" Biden commented on Saturday.\n\n'You want to have the difficult conversations'\n\nXi's decision to skip the New Delhi summit comes amid an economic slump, local debt problems and a property crisis. China also faces questions about its relationship with Russia, as Putin wages war in Ukraine and seeks a potential arms deal with North Korea, and has strained relations with G20 host nation India, which has a growing economy.\n\nIf the Chinese leader is avoiding the summit to undercut the G20 as he tries to build up competitor organizations such as BRICS, which includes Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa, that would be a strategic mistake, said Josh Lipsky, a previous G20 sherpa and former adviser at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAs for Biden, he said, \"You want to have the difficult conversations with Xi at the table, because this is the best forum for you to do it, and one of the rare opportunities where it happens. And you do it in a room where you have allies sitting near you, including the rest of the G-7.\n\n\"So most everyone else in that room, including the U.S would prefer that Xi be there, and it is unfortunate that he isn't,\" Lipsky, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, said. \"I think it's a net negative for the G20, and a net negative, from a U.S. perspective, on what can be achieved out of this summit.\"\n\nBiden's pitch to fellow leaders will not change because the Chinese leader is not in attendance, Sullivan said ahead of the summit. He intends to ask countries in attendance to reform and invest in existing multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and IMF that loan money to developing nations, Biden's national security adviser said.\n\nSullivan said the visit also provided Biden with an opportunity to reconnect with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who the U.S. president met with on Friday before the summit upon his arrival in New Delhi.\n\n\"It's making the best of a bad job. It would be better if Xi were there,\" said Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States and a former U.S. diplomat in Beijing. \"But it's far from a total loss for the United States. It's a chance to see all of these allies, and one of the Biden administration's signature accomplishments has been strengthening our alliances, especially with reference to China, so he can use this meeting now to reinforce that.\"\n\nBiden has the chance at the G20 to make the case for why U.S. leadership abroad is indispensable for the world's peace and stability and why that will pay off for American households, Singh said. He will also be able to demonstrate Russia's isolation for its aggression in Ukraine with Putin and Xi forgoing the summit.\n\n\"The G20 is not going away,\" he said. \"There's too much important work that gets done that almost nobody knows about. But the countries do. Leaders do.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/europe/russia-ukraine-war-retaliation-intl/index.html", "title": "Moskva: Ukraine braces for new assault after sinking of Russia's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe war in Ukraine could soon enter a new, even more dangerous phase.\n\nRussia, angry over the loss of its Black Sea Fleet flagship, has warned of “unpredictable consequences” if the US continues supplying weapons to Ukraine, while Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky struck a somber note telling CNN the world should be prepared for the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See reaction on Russian state TV after major ship sunk 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nThe sinking of the guided-missile cruiser Moskva on Thursday is the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years – and a huge embarrassment for Russia.\n\nIt comes at a time when US intelligence officials are warning about Putin’s increasingly unpredictable behavior and willingness to take risks due to his anger over Russia’s failures in Ukraine.\n\nWhile Moscow has denied the Ukrainian version of events – that the Moskva sunk after being struck by Ukrainian missiles – it was nevertheless forced to admit the ship went down.\n\nRussia has insisted the reason for the sinking was a fire, but the US on Friday confirmed Ukraine’s account, with a senior defense official saying that the US believes that two Ukrainian Neptune missiles hit the Russian warship.\n\nAs the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war and its loss could impact the morale of Russian troops. Tellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visited the Moskva in 2015. This is what it looked like on board 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nRussia may have extinguished independent media, but the loss of the Moskva has likely made Putin even more furious about the situation in Ukraine. US officials believe Putin is angry over the failures of his troops in Ukraine. They believe Putin’s advisers have not been telling him the full truth and did not prepare him for potential setbacks.\n\nThe warship fiasco comes just weeks after top Russian military officials announced a shift in the focus of the invasion after their offensive appeared to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion.\n\nRussia was quick to strike back.\n\nUkraine’s Operational Command South said in a statement early Saturday that the situation in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions was “increasingly hostile.”\n\n“Desperately trying to gain a foothold and hold on to the positions of the southern front, the world’s most shameful army is pursuing civilians in Mykolayiv and Kherson regions. The work of snipers has been recorded in some areas.”\n\nThe statement said Russian forces were “enraged by the losses in the Black Sea” and had “intensified the missile threat” in the region.\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for the armed forces in southern Ukraine, said that the missile attacks since Thursday night were in retaliation for the Moskva sinking.\n\n“We all realize that we will not be forgiven,” she said, accusing Russia of using “cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.”\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has previously said it had received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine. The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has also confirmed Russia’s use of cluster munitions throughout the conflict.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See CNN's exclusive interview with President Zelensky 04:11 - Source: CNN\n\nZelensky has on Friday praised the Ukrainian armed forces for repelling Russian attacks, saying they were “doing it brilliantly.”\n\nZelensky has also praised the help Ukraine was getting from western countries, but has asked for more weapons to be shipped to the country. “The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come,” he said.\n\nMore weapons for Ukraine\n\nIn another sign that the war in Ukraine is not going the way Russia has planned, Moscow has formally protested America’s ongoing shipment of weapons to Ukraine. It sent a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of “unpredictable consequences” should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document.\n\nSome Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield.\n\nThe note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine.\n\nFor the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago.\n\nThese include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that’s likely to take place in the Donbas region — open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas.\n\nThe US is also shipping 40,000 artillery rounds, but that amount could be expended within several days if fighting in the east grows heavier. During previous battles, Ukrainian forces fired thousands of artillery rounds in a day, a US official said Saturday.\n\nThere are growing concerns about the need to get more ammunition, in particular artillery ammunition, to Ukrainian forces more rapidly, a US official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired general: This key town needs to be on everyone's mind right now 02:43 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there.\n\nGoing forward, US officials believe the likely Russia strategy is to move weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine from their current positions just north and then encircle and cut off Ukraine forces that are there, the official said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley are conducting daily phone calls with counterparts in the region to encourage them to ship more weapons and supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible.\n\nSerhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. “It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now.

It’s not clear how many of Mariupol’s roughly 400,000 inhabitants have been able to evacuate the strategically important port city or how many have been killed or injured.\n\nThe Russian assault on Mariupol comes as its forces also fight for control of the Black Sea city of Kherson. The mayor of Kherson indicated overnight that Russian forces had seized control of the city of about 300,000, although claims remain disputed.\n\nThe advance in Ukraine’s south shows Russian forces are attempting to create the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa in the west, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.\n\nMariupol’s deputy mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN’s “New Day” the southeastern city was now “surrounded” by Russian forces and was in desperate need of military and humanitarian aid.\n\n“Our Ukrainian army and National Guard is very brave, they stand and fight for Ukraine, for Mariupol. But the situation is quite critical,” Orlov said Thursday.\n\n“We are asking for help, for military help, and we are waiting for military help,” Orlov said. “Our internal forces are very brave, but we are surrounded by the Russian army, which has more people in their army.”\n\nFollowing a 90-minute phone call Thursday between Putin and Macron, an Elysee source told reporters that Putin had said he intended to continue his military operation.\n\n“Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come. The (French) President said so yesterday as well. There is nothing in what Putin said today that should reassure us,” the source said.\n\nPutin told Macron he was available for negotiations but emphasized that discussion must take place on the grounds of neutralization and disarmament of Ukraine, the source said.\n\nThe Russian leader also said that if Kyiv wanted to talk, it must act now – and if Ukrainians don’t accept these conditions, he will obtain the same result by the military path, the source said. Putin denied having bombarded Kyiv and warned that the situation would worsen, but that it was the fault of Ukraine, the source said.\n\nFrance estimates that Russia’s military ambition is to take all of Ukraine, the source added.\n\nMayor: Russians creating a ‘humanitarian catastrophe’\n\nOrlov warned that Mariupol was facing a humanitarian crisis after what he said had been 26 hours of continued shelling.\n\n“They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,” Orlov said.\n\n“We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating.”\n\nSmoke rises from an air defense base in the aftermath of an apparent Russian strike in Mariupol on February 24, 2022. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nMariupol’s mayor Vadym Boichenko accused the Russian military of creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” in the city in a post on his Telegram account Thursday.\n\n“These scum have found no other way to break us. They are blocking the supply and repair of electricity, water and heat. They have also damaged the railways. They have destroyed bridges and smashed trains so that we can’t evacuate women, children and the elderly out of Mariupol,” he said.\n\n“They are blocking food supplies, blocking us like in former Leningrad [during World War II], deliberately destroying the city’s critical life-support infrastructure for seven days. Again, we have no light, water or heat.”\n\nHe said the city was “working with international institutions to create a ‘green corridor’ for the humanitarian mission” and seeking to get a ceasefire so electricity supplies can be restored.\n\nA residential building which locals said was damaged by recent shelling is seen in Mariupol on February 26, 2022.

Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman, said in a video briefing. He repeated claims the military was not targeting civilian areas in Ukraine.\n\nA day earlier, Konashenkov outlined an evacuation corridor from Mariupol. “All civilians wishing to leave Mariupol, for security purposes, can go east along the Mariupol-Shirokino [Shyrokyne] road,” he said.\n\nRussia routinely denies causing civilian casualties in Ukraine.

The military will also continue to destroy enemy sabotage groups on the outskirts of Mariupol.”\n\nMariupol lies just to the west of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine that has been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Putin recognized the breakaway statelets of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in the Donbas last month.\n\n“It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,” NATO’s former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN. Russia illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014.\n\nShirreff said he feared the latest push could cause a humanitarian catastrophe as civilian deaths rise and cities become ruins.\n\nKherson: Food, medicines in short supply, looting reported\n\nThe situation in Kherson, about 260 miles to the west of Mariupol, also appeared to be worsening Thursday.\n\nOne resident told CNN there had been chaos and panic in Kherson as people tried to get basic necessities. According to the resident, the city is suffering a severe lack of food and medicine – particularly insulin – with pharmacies being looted.\n\nThe resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.\n\nKherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, called on civilians to stop looting and stealing food supplies Thursday.\n\nKolykhaiev said in a Facebook post the “city needs food and industrial products” and called on residents to let the city handle distribution of products. “We guarantee that it will reach where it is now most expected – hospitals, orphanages, pensioners, needy, families with many children, social categories, etc,” he said.\n\nOn Wedneday, the mayor said on his Facebook page that the Ukrainian military was no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of “armed people who came to the city’s administration” – indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.\n\nKherson resident Yaroslav Kontsevyi told CNN that Russian occupants have placed checkpoints and sniper points in key places of the city.\n\nKontsevyi said the Russian occupants were stopping civilian Ukrainian men and asking them if they were going to fight on the Russian or Ukrainian side in case of mobilization.\n\nAnother local resident also noted that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.\n\nA British military intelligence update released early Thursday noted that “some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson,” but cautioned that the military situation on the ground “remains unclear.”\n\nHennadii Lahuta, head of the Kherson Regional State Administration, said in a statement that Russian forces had “completely occupied” the regional state administration building.\n\n“We have not given up our responsibilities. The regional operational headquarters, which I lead, continues its work and addresses issues to help residents of the region. We are waiting for humanitarian aid,” Lahuta said.\n\nA senior US defense official said the United States could not independently verify that the city of Kherson has fallen under Russian control.\n\nMariupol is still under Ukrainian control, according to the US defense official, but Russian forces are advancing on the city from the north and from the coastline with the apparent intention of isolating it.\n\nThe official added that there had been no “appreciable” moves by Russia, naval or otherwise, on the city of Odessa, further to the west.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Olga Voitovych Laura Smith-Spark", "Tim Lister", "Olga Voitovych", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/01/10/world-news-to-watch-2023/11000615002/", "title": "Ukraine's fight against Russia.

Unexpectedly high food and energy costs pushed up global inflation to 8.8% from 4.7% during the last 12 months, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nPredictions, forecasts, future-gazing. These are pursuits that can often be, to use a British phrase, a mug's game. Something only a foolish person, armed with incomplete information, would attempt. At the beginning of this year it seemed unlikely that large-scale protests would erupt in Israel. Or that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich would be detained in Russia and accused of espionage. Still, there are some international story lines that are likely to dominate global headlines in 2023. Here's a selection to watch for.\n\nUkraine: Will there be a real ceasefire?\n\nThere appears to be no end in sight to a war that was started by Russia, has displaced millions of Ukrainians across Europe and led the West to supply ever-more-heavy weapons to Kyiv. \"The fighting is likely to be at least as intense in 2023 as it was in 2022,\" said Daniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington-based think tank. \"Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will talk about their interest in ending the war through a peace settlement, but the two leaders will have vastly different interpretations on what that peace will look like and what it will take to get there.\"\n\nRussians escaping Putin's war on Ukraine: A new home – and a moral dilemma\n\nIran's clerical regime in a corner\n\nNationwide protests about women's rights and a litany of social and economic grievances rocked the Islamic Republic in 2022. Meanwhile, Iran's nuclear capabilities appear to be increasing, it is supplying weapons to Russia for the war in Ukraine and the regime's leaders show no signs of willingness to nurture diplomatic channels to the West. \"For the last decade, Iran has been politically and economically stagnant,\" said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, a dual American-Iranian who runs Bourse & Bazaar, a think tank focused on Iran's economy. \"The country's future is less predictable than it has been in a long time, and this poses a challenge for Western policymakers worried about the threats an increasingly unstable Iran might pose.\"\n\n'Woman, life, liberty': Iranians on why they'll risk beatings and death for change\n\nClimate: 'It's going to get a lot hotter, and wetter'\n\nUnited Nations scientists believe there's a 50% chance global temperatures will rise, at least temporarily, to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels between now and 2026. Staying below 1.5C is the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement, an international treaty adopted by a majority of the world's countries in 2015. \"The climate story of 2023 is going to be about political backlash,\" said David Callaway, a former USA TODAY editor-in-chief who runs Callaway Climate Insights, a newsletter that analyzes what the global business community is doing to mitigate climate risks. \"In the U.S., Republicans will weaponize financial and political efforts to curtail global warming with hearings, investigations, litigation, and more penalties against Wall Street banks. In Europe, the EU's new carbon border tax will provoke international protectionist threats just as the continent is trying to scramble through the energy crisis caused by Russia. As for the climate, it's going to get a lot hotter, and wetter, with all the social and environmental pain that goes with that.\"\n\nClimate Point: No, it's not all China's fault, and other climate change myths\n\nTigray: An uncertain road to peace in Ethiopia\n\nA fragile peace has been established in one of last year's deadliest conflict zones, a civil war in Ethiopia's Tigray region. An estimated 383,000 to 600,000 people died in Tigray between November 2020 and August 2022, according to Professor Jan Nyssen and a team of researchers at Ghent University, in Belgium. \"The durability of the peace agreement will partly depend upon whether Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed manages to deal with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki’s destabilizing efforts in Ethiopia, as well as territorial claims by the Amhara militia to parts of Tigray,\" said Kjetil Tronvoll, a Norwegian expert on Ethiopia who has studied the region for decades.\n\nThe largest war in the world: Hundreds of thousands killed in Ethiopia's Tigray conflict\n\nChina vs. Taiwan: Combat or just drills?\n\nChina is unlikely to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan that Beijing considers part of its territory, according to analysts at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-headquartered think tank. But tensions have been rising as China has launched a series of increasingly aggressive war games in the Taiwan Strait and Taipei has bolstered its military defenses. In September, President Joe Biden said U.S forces would defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, comments that appeared to go well beyond long-standing stated U.S. policy on Taiwan of \"strategic ambiguity\" and followed a visit to the island by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that angered Beijing.\n\nNancy Pelosi visits Taiwan:U.S. tensions with China escalate\n\n\"Breaching Taiwan’s defenses would be a slog and, having seen the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Beijing likely grasps the international opprobrium and economic cost an offensive could trigger – even if the U.S. opts not to intervene militarily,\" the International Crisis Group wrote in a recent assessment of the issue.\n\nThreats to democracy: key 2023 votes\n\nThere are international elections of consequence every year. Two to keep an eye on in 2023 are in Pakistan and Turkey.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dominated that country's politics for two decades. \"Once a pillar of the Western alliance, the country has embarked on a militaristic foreign policy,\" Dmitar Bechev wrote in a recent analysis for Carnegie Europe, a foreign policy think tank. \"And its democracy, sustained by the aspiration to join the European Union, has given way to one-man rule.\"\n\nIn Pakistan, International Crisis Group analysts note, the country \"is entering an election year with a deeply divided body politic, as former Prime Minister Imran Khan whips up populist support against the government and the all-powerful military.\"\n\nAnd if threats to global democracy feel remote two years after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection on the U.S. Capitol, consider that over the weekend thousands of supporters of former Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the country's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace in an apparent attempt to oust Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro in an October election.\n\nThey carried flags, chanted slogans and stormed Congress:In Brazil this time\n\nThe list of global conflicts is long and winding\n\nOther stories to watch in 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/politics/biden-putin-russia-ukraine/index.html", "title": "American leaders are caught in Putin's guessing game | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nVladimir Putin is doing it again. He’s got Washington in a frenzy. Everyone’s got a theory about what the Russian president plans for Ukraine. But no one really knows. Maybe he doesn’t himself.\n\nWhile Americans across the country fret about high inflation and daily disruptions from the pandemic, Putin has once again forced a country many American foreign policy officials view as a creaking superpower in inexorable decline to center stage in the US capital.\n\nRussia is on everybody’s lips in DC – just as it was in 2016 when Putin created a political hall of mirrors in the US, distorting reality and truth with an election meddling operation that is still delivering discord and ripping the country’s divides ever deeper.\n\nFor President Joe Biden, foreign policy has come full circle. He first arrived in Washington in the Cold War deep freeze. Half a century later, he finds himself wrestling with a Russian counterpart who never regarded the superpower standoff as resolved.\n\nTheir confrontation over Ukraine might seem an arcane tussle of wills. But Putin is holding the independent democracy that used to be part of the Soviet Union hostage to try to force Biden to agree to pull NATO troops out of Moscow’s former orbit in eastern Europe. Their duel is about whether people can chose their own leaders and political systems and whether big nations can get away with invading smaller ones; whether democracy and international rules can prevail; and whether market economies can freely function or must exist under the heavy hand of the state or oligarchs.\n\nOnce again, as was the case late in the 20th century, members of Congress are huddled in secret briefings with US spy agencies trying to work out what the Kremlin is up to. But in this modern-day showdown, Putin has turned Republicans on Republicans as a split emerges between traditional hawks and pro-Trump populists. He’s forced the White House to pay attention to him by circling independent, western-leaning Ukraine with troops. He’s opened diplomatic tracks to try to pry NATO allies apart. His pressure last week caused a public meltdown between the US and Ukrainian governments over whether the Russians plan to invade. Putin has won adoring coverage in US conservative media – an achievement that would have been unthinkable for any Soviet leader. And rattled nerves over Russia even spilled over into a row between the State Department and its press corps Thursday, which was bizarrely accused of taking solace in Russian propaganda.\n\nAt any given moment, in the Russian leader’s reign of confusion, it’s hard to evaluate whether he’s blinking under Western pressure, doubling down by adding to his garrison or simply at a loss what to do himself with no clear endgame in sight to the showdown.\n\nPutin pressed some more American buttons on Friday when he met the rising foe that Washington really wants to focus on – President Xi Jinping of China. He’s sure to spook political analysts with hints of a Beijing-Moscow axis.\n\nXi and Putin vowed to deepen their strategic coordination, according to a readout of the exchange between the two leaders by Chinese state media Xinhua News on Friday.\n\nIf Putin’s aim with his build up opposite Ukraine is to tie the West in knots, to have everyone obsessing over Russia – whether he ends up invading the ex-Soviet state or not – it’s worked. In Washington on Thursday, the focus initially was on a US raid in Syria overnight that had led to the death of the leader of ISIS. But inexorably, the focus was dragged back to speculation over Putin’s intentions. No one can agree on what Russia is going to do, when it might do it, or what the US should do in response. And that might be exactly the point of Putin’s game.\n\nWashington has no idea what Putin might do next\n\nAfter previously saying that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was “imminent,” the US has stopped using that word since the invasion hasn’t come. That’s a small victory for the Russian leader, in the phony war of attrition that might or might not precede an invasion, which could last weeks or months. As an example of the confusion that Putin has sown on Capitol Hill, lawmakers are emerging from briefings after hearing the same classified information with differing interpretations of what might happen next.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it was a “near certainty” that Putin would invade Ukraine. But House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith disagreed. The Washington state Democrat told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Thursday: “I don’t think we know that yet.” And Senate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, suggested that nobody “knows whether Putin has made the ultimate decision.”\n\nThe lack of cohesion about Putin’s motives is beginning to be reflected in disputes about how the US should respond – another success for the Russian leader’s long-term push to stir angst that tarnishes Western democracy. Traditional national security Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been pushing Biden to take a tougher stand against Russia for weeks and have welcomed his decision to dispatch troops to Europe. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, whom ex-President Barack Obama mocked in a 2012 presidential debate for warning about Moscow’s threat, is suddenly in demand.\n\n“It’s very clearly a sign to our allies that we care about NATO, we care about Europe. And it’s a signal to Putin as well that we care about Europe and that we care about our allies as we do,” Romney said, backing Biden’s troop deployments.\n\nBut there are clear signs that the anti-NATO, “America first,” sentiment that is a hangover from the Trump administration is a growing force in the Republican Party. Indiana Sen. Mike Braun said that he is against sending more troops to Europe.\n\n“I think that’s a scrambling feature that we’re doing late in the game,” Braun said.\n\nIt’s also clear that the conservative media’s misinformation implying Biden is sending troops directly to fight Russia instead of defending US interests at home may be starting to soak in. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, for instance, coined a sentiment often voiced by pro-Trump opinion hosts. He said the Biden administration should send “troops to our southern border.” And Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall said he didn’t “want boots on the ground.”\n\n“Having a son that’s an enlisted man in the Army myself, it’s a big deal. I think economically, we need to know, does the European Union have any moxie? … They need to be leading on this. I think we need to be a participant, but it just feels like we’re escalating the situation.”\n\nEuropean diplomats might be advised to listen carefully to such senators, a rising block in the party that once celebrated its greatest Cold Warrior, President Ronald Reagan, for orchestrating victory over the Soviet Union. Any weakening of the transatlantic alliance would be a huge win for Putin.\n\nThe world looks different in Moscow\n\nTo Western eyes, Putin’s behavior often seems self-defeating and illogical. It looks like he’s making it up as he goes along. Even if that’s the case, it makes him harder to read. One view right now is that the Russian position is eroding, that Putin has backed into a corner with more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, and it will be difficult for him to climb down and save face.\n\nIf he invades, it’s hard for Washington to see how Putin could fashion a win for Moscow during what could be a bloody occupation and insurgency. The fierce punishments that the West is threatening to clamp on Russia’s economy also seem like a steep price to pay. Putin’s wider strategic dance seems to make little sense either. After all, his demands that NATO withdraw troops and arms from Eastern Europe caused Biden to call his bluff this week by ordering 3,000 troops to Germany, Romania and Poland.\n\nBut the logic of Putin’s worldview, rooted in a desire to restore respect, attention and status to Russia 30 years after the end of the Cold War, operates in a different universe from that of the West. The world looks different from Moscow. One theory in Washington is that Putin is now so isolated inside his own regime that’s he’s not getting good outside advice. But he’s keeping the West on edge – and that may be a goal in itself.\n\nThere is some hope that Putin’s willingness to talk is a sign he’s not serious about an invasion – he just spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance. But at the same time, Biden’s dispatch of troops to defend NATO allies is already being spun in Moscow as proof of Putin’s argument that the West is threatening Russia’s borders and security. Such arguments can be used to build legitimacy for his own strongman rule. The Russian leader often uses nationalism to prop up a government in perpetuity that relies on oppression, crushing media freedoms and locking up dissidents. And signs of political acrimony in the US, which Putin is by now an expert at whipping up, play into Russian notions that a state that prizes stability and order over democracy works best.\n\nWorrying signs\n\nWith his foreign policy under intense scrutiny following the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden has – a few instances of clumsy messaging aside – performed strongly in the Ukraine crisis, at least in the eyes of those who prefer a US President to behave as a traditional leader of the West.\n\nHe has signaled to Putin that NATO’s strategic alliance is inviolate and that its Eastern European members will be defended. He’s offered the Russian leader diplomatic offramps through diplomacy though hasn’t compromised Western strategic principles. And he’s rallied some reluctant allies into signing up for a package of unprecedented sanctions meant to deter Putin from an invasion.\n\nOne intriguing feature of this showdown has been the willingness of the US and Britain especially to play the Russians at their own propaganda game. In the latest use of declassified intelligence, Washington on Thursday accused Russia of preparing to “fabricate a pretext for an invasion” by creating a “very graphic propaganda video.” Officials said Moscow could stage an attack against “Russian speaking peoples” in Ukraine in order to justify moving across the border. This is especially worrying because it mirrors arguments that Russia used before annexing Crimea, sovereign Ukrainian territory, in 2014.\n\nRussian denied the allegation. And the problem with the West dealing with intelligence is that such material can be open to doubt and counter-propaganda, since a desire to protect sources and methods means it is difficult to back up such claims with evidence in public.\n\nThat issue caused a spat in the State Department briefing on Thursday when spokesman Ned Price said journalists just needed to trust the government – despite decades of previous examples of officials misleading the American people. “If you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is, that is for you to do,” Price said.\n\nIf he achieves nothing else, Putin’s success in setting Americans against themselves might be payoff enough for his thuggery over Ukraine.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated where in Eastern Europe 3,000 troops are being deployed.

For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire and the ongoing evacuations, check out our live updates file for Thursday, Aug. 10.\n\nMAUI, Hawaii − Wind-whipped wildfires in Hawaii forced hundreds of evacuations Wednesday, overwhelmed hospitals and even sent some residents fleeing into the ocean to escape the flames as parts of the popular tourist destination turned into a raging inferno in a matter of hours.\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening. Officials said earlier that 271 structures were damaged or destroyed and dozens of people injured.\n\nEntire blocks of homes and businesses went up in smoke in historic Lahaina Town in Maui, where blazes fueled by wind from a passing hurricane were concentrated. In addition, three wildfires were burning on the Big Island, though two of them were at least 60% contained.\n\nActing Gov. Sylvia Luke said residents had been preparing for Hurricane Dora, which skirted south of the islands, and had no reason to expect the quickly developing blazes.\n\n“We expect rain, sometimes we expect floods,'' she said. \"We never anticipated in this date that a hurricane which did not make impact on our islands would cause these type of wildfires.''\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement he has ordered “all available Federal assets” to help combat the wildfires, including Black Hawk helicopters provided by the Marines.\n\nCounty of Maui spokesperson Mahina Martin told USA TODAY the fires are affecting two areas of the island: Lahaina, a residential and tourist area with a commercial district in West Maui, and Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous upcountry region.\n\nOfficials said 2,000 travelers sheltered at Maui's Kahului Airport, and another 4,000 visitors wanted to leave the island. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLocals and visitors scrambled to get information and reach loved ones amid power blackouts and downed cellular and 911 service as well as phone lines in different parts of the islands.\n\nTiare Lawrence, who grew up in Lahaina, was trying to get in touch with her siblings while providing refuge at her home for 14 cousins and uncles who fled the heat, smoke and flames in Lahaina.\n\n“It was apocalyptic from what they explained,” she said.\n\nMaui county officials said multiple structures have burned and multiple evacuation orders are in place as emergency crews battle brush and structure fires. \"It's been an unprecedented incident striking large areas of our island, and it has been pretty much all hands on deck,\" Martin said.\n\nTourists turning around and leaving right after arriving\n\nThe sky over west Maui is hazy with smoke from the devastating wildfires still burning on the island, which continue to displace thousands.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, traffic was at a complete standstill on Honoapiilani Highway, the main road to access Lahaina, as it remains closed. Cars packed with people are parked along the side of the road waiting to return to their hotels or homes, but no time or date has been given yet.\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than 4,000 people − including residents and tourists from two hotels − evacuated to emergency shelters set up by the American Red Cross. On Wednesday, the organization said it was flying in additional volunteers and staff from the mainland to assist with the aftermath of the fires and get people safely to Oahu.Tourists arriving at Kahului Airport are turning around and trying to leave Maui. Alexis and Hector Palomar had their trip planned since May and landed on Wednesday morning.\n\n“We didn’t realize it was happening until we were on our way to the airport. We didn’t think it was that bad until we got here,” Hector Palomar said.\n\nThey immediately changed plans and booked a flight to Kauai, departing just three hours after they arrived on Maui.“Thankfully we’re able to get out,” he said. “I just don’t want to take resources from the locals since it’s an island.”\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'Everything is gone': Resident feels lucky, mournful after Lahaina escape\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay knew how fortunate he and his family were to escape the flames around them alive, having merely lost items that could be replaced.\n\nSaribay had seen homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them,’’ debris turn into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas trying to flee while carrying their prized possessions.\n\n“Everything is gone, every single one of our family homes,’’ Saribay said. “The entire Lahaina Town and the entire subdivision of Lahaina – gone.’’\n\nAnd much faster than anyone could have imagined. In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated a town center that traced its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGetting out of the danger zone made for a surreal journey of trying to find an unclogged escape route amid blistering heat that caused another car to explode, injuring a woman inside it.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nWhen he made it out, Saribay felt a pang of emotion seeing Lahaina on his rear-view mirror, wondering what would be left to go back to. “Just praying that a miracle happens,’’ he said.\n\n− Ashley Lewis\n\nGovernor has contacted White House, says 'loss of life is expected'\n\nGov. Josh Green said in a statement Wednesday that he expects to request a Presidential Disaster Declaration from the White House in the next 36 to 48 hours once officials have a better understanding of the scope of the damage.\n\nGreen was planning to be out of state for personal travel until next week but is expected to return Wednesday night to address the crisis. He said while the \"heroic efforts\" of first responders have prevented many causalities, \"some loss of life is expected.\"\n\n“Our state appreciates the incredible outpouring of concern and prayers from the mainland. We won’t forget the aloha you have already begun to share with us,” Green said.\n\nLifelong Maui resident had 'never seen anything like this'\n\nKyle Ellison, born and raised in Maui, returned to his Kula home Wednesday morning and started stomping out flames on the property.\n\nThe previous morning, he heard trees fall down into the gulch behind his house and, when a popping sound went off, he figured it was coming from an electrical transformer.\n\n\"A minute later, I ask my wife if the internet is out and if she can smell smoke.\" Ellison said. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this. I have friends in Lahaina who have lost everything.\"\n\nEllison and his family made it out with one truck full of belongings. Their house is still standing but their neighbors' is not. His wife and children went to the houses of three different friends to stay the night but kept having to move as evacuations spread.\n\n\"I think there are going to be a lot of people hurting,'' he said. \"We already have a housing crisis out here and we lost so many more homes.''\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHawaii National Guard activated\n\nLuke and Bissen have issued emergency proclamations in response to the fire. The Hawaii National Guard has been activated and is assisting the Maui Police Department at traffic control points, according to the Hawaii adjutant general.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Hurricane Dora, which was passing 500 miles south of the island chain, and a very strong high pressure north of the state produced powerful, damaging winds through the overnight hours.\n\n\"Very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon hours,\" the weather service said in a red flag warning for leeward areas issued Wednesday.\n\n'Chaos' trying to find shelter as people left with few possessions\n\nPeople in Lahaina described frantically trying to get to relative safety in one of the nearby emergency shelters. But they weren’t told by anyone where to go – just that they had to leave.\n\nThroughout the night, people were driving aimlessly and following other cars, just trying to head north, as police and firefighters dealt with growing flames.\n\nThe War Memorial Gymnasium in Wailuku opened to evacuees this morning. There is no capacity limit to how many people can stay there. The community has set up cots and are giving away clothing, food and pillows to evacuees. A medical team is checking for burns and smoke inhalation, and to aid anyone with existing conditions without access to medication.\n\nMauro Farinelli and his wife Judit arrived at the shelter around noon. They have lived right on Front Street in Lahaina for four years and described their evacuation as “chaos.”\n\n“No one told us we had to leave, it was getting bad and we had to leave with the clothes on our back,” he said. The couple went to the boat ramp where they were told they could jump into the ocean “if things got bad.” Farinelli said he can’t return home until the electric wires are assessed in Lahaina.\n\n“Nobody thinks it can happen to them,” he said. “Where I lived, it was like there’s no way a fire can get here because I’m not close to vegetation but the wind was so strong, it was like a blow torch.\"\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'We just lost a large part of our heritage,' official says\n\nWhile it’s still difficult to assess the damage, state Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran cited various landmarks that have reportedly been lost – historic businesses and buildings, temples and cemeteries where royal figures were buried.\n\n“It’s a real loss. Hawaii and Maui have tried really hard to preserve and protect those places for many, many years … not for the sake of tourism but because it’s part of our cultural heritage,” said Keith-Agaran, whose district includes Kahului in central Maui. Lahaina, where the largest fires are concentrated, was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.\n\n“We just lost a large part of our heritage,” he said.\n\nBrush and wildfires are not unheard of in Hawaii’s leeward regions during the dry season. In 2018, Maui suffered a massive brush fire on the same side of the island, primarily on the slopes. “This is so much worse,” Keith-Agaran said, pointing to the scope of the current blaze.\n\n“No matter how much you prepare, you’re not going to be ready for something that moves as quickly and as big as this,” he said. “I don’t think we had enough equipment or people to be fighting fires upcountry, small fires in central Maui and then this huge fire on the west side.”\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nBurn victims sent to other islands\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey, who was not aware of any deaths.\n\nLuke told CNN Maui's hospitals are overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation and it's been difficult to transport people needing care to other facilities.\n\n“We are already in communication with other hospital systems about relieving the burden – the reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment,” Luke said. “In addition to dealing with disaster, we're dealing with major transportation issues as well.”\n\nResident of nearby island searching for family in Maui\n\nLeomana Turalde's mother called him on the phone crying Wednesday morning, saying she never went to sleep on Tuesday night in Maui amid the massive fires.\n\nTuralde said he has several “aunties” who live on Maui, two blocks away from Lahaina’s popular Front Street. Wednesday morning, one of the women went missing, he told USA TODAY. It is impossible to get in touch with some people because cellphone infrastructure on Maui burned down, he said.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burnt down to ashes,'' said Turalde, 36, who runs a sunscreen company. \"Most of the families on Maui, if you never made contact with your family before sunset last night, you’re still trying to figure out where they are.”\n\nHe said he is boarding a plane on Wednesday to Maui from where he lives on the island of Hawaii to help family members search for missing relatives near their homestead property, which he said burned down.\n\n“I’m going to go to the first place that everybody would go to when they’re in trouble, and that’s the house, even though the house isn’t there,” he said. “Home is usually the first place you should start if people are missing.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nAll roads to historic Lahaina closed as Front Street burns\n\nAll roads into Lahaina, a town of roughly 13,000, and West Maui have been closed to public use, except for emergency services, county officials said Wednesday. Photos shared by the county overnight showed a line of flames blazing across an intersection in Lahaina and flames leaping above buildings in the town, whose historic district is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"Do NOT go to Lahaina town,\" officials warned.\n\nGreen said much of the area \"has been destroyed and hundreds of local families have been displaced.\"\n\nFront Street business owner Alan Dickar told CBS News buildings on both sides of the street in the popular tourist area were engulfed in flames. Dickar said it appeared the fire department was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Maui can't handle this,\" Dickar said. \"A lot of people just lost their jobs because a lot of businesses burned. A lot of people lost their homes. ... This is going to be devastating for Maui.\"\n\nLahaina’s historic Waiola Church and the neighboring Lahaina Hongwanji Mission temple were among the structures that caught fire Wednesday, the Maui News reported. The church was established in 1823, and its graveyard, believed to be the first Christian cemetery in Hawaii, is the final resting place for early members of the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, according to its website.\n\nUncertainty for many residents\n\nBeatrice Hoopai drove for hours in the middle of the night trying to find shelter before ending up at the Warm Memorial Gymnasium. She, her husband, disabled son and two infants were living at Ka Hale A Ke Ola (KHAKO), which is low-income housing, in Lahaina waiting to be told to evacuate as the fires were approaching. A friend told Hoopai a nearby transformer caught on fire and to leave as soon as possible.\n\n“We packed up what we could and left,” she said. “KHAKO didn’t turn on their evacuation, we didn’t know we was going to be evacuated. Nobody told us nothing.”\n\nThe family got in Hoopai’s car and started driving but kept going around in circles as roads were closed. Branches were catching on fire and tin roofs blew past the car, she said. “You could see black smoke, the flames, everything was falling down,” she said. “If you looked back in the mirror, everything was burning.” The ocean was black and eerie.\n\nHoopai has lived on Maui for her entire life and just moved to Lahaina in May. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Tourists, she said, can lose their luggage but still return back to their homes.

The Hawaii Department of Transportation said Wednesday that about 1,800 people sheltered in place overnight in the airport with many highways on the island's west site still closed.\n\n\"HDOT worked with airlines/TSA to shelter passengers for safety's sake as wildfires continue to burn in Lahaina and upcountry,\" officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNearly 100 firefighters have been on duty, including 11 from state airport rescue personnel, county officials said.\n\nTen public schools in Maui were closed Wednesday, including one that is being used as an evacuation shelter, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.\n\nStudent boarders at Lahainaluna High School were moved Tuesday evening to Maui High School, which was being used as a shelter for evacuees to be picked up by family members or emergency contacts, officials said. The Lahainaluna campus remained closed Wednesday because of a lack of power, wind damage and brush fire evacuations.\n\nAs the brush fire spread to Kihei, officials announced Tuesday that four public schools in South Maui would be closed in addition to schools in West, Upcountry and Central Maui.\n\nHomes destroyed; residents evacuated\n\nThe Coast Guard has been responding to areas where residents are \"entering the ocean due to smoke and fire conditions,\" county officials said. A Coast Guard boat rescued 12 people from the waters off Lahaina, officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nLawrence told Hawaii News Now people were running for their lives. She said the homes of everyone she knows in Lahaina have been down.\n\n“It’s just so hard. I’m currently Upcountry and just knowing I can’t get a hold of any of my family members. I still don’t know where my little brother is. I don’t know where my stepdad is,” she said.\n\nIn Kula, at least two homes were destroyed in a fire that engulfed about 1,100 acres, Bissen told The Associated Press. About 80 people were evacuated from 40 homes, he said.\n\nThe Red Cross has opened several emergency shelters for residents. Martin said one evacuation center alone had more than 1,200 people.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain they are very anxious at our evacuation centers,\" she said.\n\nLocal resident could tell something was brewing\n\nAlice Carillo lives about five miles from the fire that erupted in Kula, in a hilly, bucolic region of Maui known as upcountry.\n\nThe 79-year-old woke up in the middle of the night Tuesday to the smell of something burning. She opened the door of her Makawao plantation home, where she’s lived for more than half a century, and “it was like fog out there, so covered with smoke.” She could see a fire above the Kula shopping center.\n\n10 schools closed, including one converted to evacuation shelter\n\nConditions had been especially windy in the days leading up to the blaze, in part because of Hurricane Dora moving south of the island. Carillo could sense something was brewing as the gusts picked up. Now, as she looks out at the mountain, the sky is clear.\n\n“You wouldn’t have even known there was a fire,” she said.\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nWildfire smoke map:See where fires are burning in Hawaii and across the US\n\nThousands without power; 911 service no longer available in West Maui\n\nMore than 14,000 customers in Maui County were without power, according to Poweroutage.us. County officials advised residents to stay at least 30 feet from downed power lines, which at one point restricted travel along parts of Honoapiilani Highway. Part of the highway was reopened Tuesday evening to allow access in and out of Lahaina, but motorists were told to expect traffic to move slowly through the bypass.\n\nIn West Maui, 911 service is no longer available. Martin said it's been \"very difficult\" to manage evacuation orders in Lahaina because the area does not have cell service and only landlines are functioning.\n\nThe island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located, also was dealing with power outages, downed power lines and traffic problems, said Adam Weintraub, communication director for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nStrong winds are fueling the flames\n\nIn Kula, winds were recorded at 80 mph, \"which greatly affected the speed and the movement of the fire,\" Martin said.\n\nBecause of the wind gusts, helicopters weren’t able to dump water on the fires from the sky – or gauge more precise fire sizes – and firefighters were encountering roads blocked by downed trees and power lines as they worked the inland fires, Martin previously told the Associated Press.\n\nA high wind warning and red flag warning for dangerous fire weather issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu are expected to remain in effect through Wednesday.\n\nMaui fire officials warned that erratic wind, challenging terrain, steep slopes and dropping humidity combined with the direction and the location of the fire have made it difficult to predict its path and speed. The wind can also sends fire embers up and ignite sparks downwind, creating fires far from their source, officials said.\n\n“The fire can be a mile or more from your house, but in a minute or two, it can be at your house,” said Fire Assistant Chief Jeff Giesea. “Burning airborne materials can light fires a great distance away from the main body of fire.”\n\nFires also burning on the Big Island\n\nHawaii County officials said Tuesday that they were monitoring two brush fires burning in North and South Kohala. The fires prompted evacuations and power outages in the area.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday approved the state's request for a disaster declaration to provide assistance with \"the wind-whipped Kohala Ranch wildfire on the Big Island,\" according to a news release from the governor's office.\n\nThe fire, which began early Tuesday, threatened about 200 homes near the rural community of Kohala Ranch, a volunteer fire department, local electrical transmission lines and an AT&T cellular communications tower in the area, officials said The fire was uncontained and had burned more than 600 acres of land when the request for federal assistance was made.\n\nThe release said firefighters battling that fire and the two other uncontrolled fires on the Big Island and Maui \"have been hampered by the winds, which made it impossible to provide aircraft support for their efforts to contain the flames.\"\n\n“We’re trying to protect homes in the community,” Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said of evacuating about 400 homes in four communities in the northern part of the island. As of Tuesday, the roof of one house caught on fire, he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/10/those-path-woolsey-hill-fires-hope-best-but-fear-worst/1955992002/", "title": "Touched by fire: Stories of hope, loss amid Woolsey Fire and Hill Fire", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nAs the Woolsey and Hill fires burned in Ventura County, many residents evacuated or considered doing so. Others faced the loss of their homes and possessions. These are some of their stories.\n\n‘It’s all gone. It’s all gone.’\n\nThe fire hopscotched around the Oak Park neighborhood of 70-year-old Bill Bengston, leaving most houses untouched.\n\nThe home for 22 years of Bengston and his wife, Ramona, was the only house on his block that burned. And it burned everything.\n\n“It’s all gone,” he said softly as he sifted through the remains. “It’s all gone.”\n\nThe hardest to lose were the photos and the mementos handed down through the family — a cigar box that belonged to his great-grandfather; the handcuffs his father carried in World War II.\n\n“We’re somewhat devastated,” Bengston said. “Still a little bit numb.”\n\nVentura County wildfire coverage:\n\n‘I’ve built my home, and I didn’t want to leave.’\n\nIn smoke-choked Calabasas on Saturday, local residents and sooty firefighters gathered at the Starbucks inside the Albertsons supermarket in what appeared to be the only open business inside the evacuation area.\n\nThere was no outside electricity, only power from a backup generator. Residents, many wearing masks for protection against the smoke, shared videos that they taken on their smart phones showing flames engulfing their backyards.\n\nPaul Bancroft said he was not about to lose his house, which took him three years to build, in Old Agoura.\n\nThe fire burned “right up to the fence (and) started burning in my bushes.” he said. He managed to douse it with a garden hose.\n\n”I’ve built my home, and I didn’t want to leave,” Bancroft said.\n\n‘I don’t even have time to cope.’\n\nFor 36 hours, her world was tossed into turmoil.\n\nEven as college student Madison Means grieved Friday for four of her pals killed in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill, she was forced to react to another emergency: helping her sister suddenly leave home under mandatory evacuation orders as a wildfire approached.\n\nOn Friday morning, Means, 20, stood, dazed, outside a Thousand Oaks city building that had morphed into a wildfire evacuation center, in near disbelief of what the previous two days had brought.\n\n“There’s so much going on that I don’t even have time to cope – your focus is on one tragedy and then you’re torn away to deal with this,” said Means, a CSU Northridge senior majoring in hospitality.\n\nThousands of residents in Ventura County spent Friday scrambling to endure the back-to-back blows.\n\nOn Wednesday night, 28-year-old former Marine Ian David Long entered Borderline in Thousand Oaks and opened fire, killing 12 people and sending the tight-knit region into mourning. Then, on Friday the Woolsey fire grew to burn more than 14,000 acres, putting as many as 200,000 people in Ventura and Los Angeles counties under evacuation orders.\n\nNear the center of Thousand Oaks, a local teen center transformed with the rest of the city. On Thursday, it was the site where families went to learn if their loved ones had been killed in the mass shooting. By Friday, it held scores of people whom the wildfire had forced from their homes.\n\nMeans first learned of the shooting early Thursday morning when she received several frantic phone calls checking to see if she was alive. Her regular haunt had just been the site of a shooting, she learned. Then came the cruel news: her friends, acquaintances, and line-dancing companions Justin Meek, Kristina Morisette, Sean Adler, and Telemachus Orfanos had all been killed.\n\nMeans said she met the victims at Borderline since she began visiting the space a few years ago. At the time, the bar was one of the safest places she could imagine.\n\n“My mom would tell people, ‘I like it when she goes there because I can sleep and feel safe when she’s at Borderline,’” Means said.\n\n“It hasn’t fully hit me yet,” she said of her slain friends. “It might when the fire settles down.”\n\nMeans said she doesn’t know what’s next after such a tumultuous few days. She does know one thing: She wants the Borderline community to remain tight. Before the shooting, a group of the bar’s employees and regulars had planned to jointly attend the Stagecoach country music festival next year. Despite all the chaos and loss — and in some ways because of it — she said she hopes they still go, together.\n\n‘We packed quickly, grabbed what we could ...’\n\nMeghann O’Weger evacuated the Newbury Park home she shares with her husband, Ventura County Deputy Sheriff John O’Weger, their four children and two dogs, on Friday morning.\n\n“We saw the fire moving fast over the hills,” she said. “We packed quickly, grabbed what we could and headed to (a relative’s) house.”\n\nOn Saturday morning, their home remained in the mandatory evacuation zone and like so many others, they waited to see if they would have a place to go home to.\n\n‘Everything I have has turned to ash’\n\nAs Shane Clark assessed his newly incinerated Bell Canyon property on Saturday – one of more than a dozen houses leveled in the community by the aggressive, wind-fueled Woolsey Fire – four pieces of paper offered solace.\n\nThoughtful firefighters snagged many of the 28-year-old accountant’s belongings, including his most important possession: four ultrasound images of Clark’s unborn son, which the first responders nabbed off the fridge right before flames engulfed the home.\n\n“These are the only copies we have,” Clark said, as firefighters continued to spray water on his smoldering property. “We can rebuild, but the things they were able to take out were more valuable than the structure itself.”\n\n“I’m very thankful for what they could do,” he said.\n\nNo such memories were spared for some of Clark’s neighbors.\n\n“Everything I have has turned to ash,” said Greg Meneshian, after surveying his house – what little was left of it – on Saturday, mere hours after the Woolsey Fire swept through Bell Canyon, torching his home to the ground.\n\nAs neighbors slowly returned to the eastern Ventura County hillside community on Saturday in the wake of the windswept blaze, many learned for the first time whether they still had a home. The fire had skittered cruelly through the area, leveling some 15 to 20 houses at random, while ignoring others entirely.\n\nChimneys and stone masonry stood bare next to charred cars. Hillside homes disappeared into avalanches of smoldering debris. Live gas lines burned freely, shooting flames into the air. A noxious smell of burnt plastic pervaded.\n\nMeneshian first learned of the destruction via a text message video that showed his house ablaze. When he finally was able to survey the damage for himself, he said he could identify only three of his belongings. On Saturday, he wondered aloud how he’d keep his two daughters in their local school district now that his home was destroyed.\n\n“My kids are taking it really hard, especially my oldest, because all her memories are gone,” Meneshian. “I really don’t know what’s next.”\n\nFirefighters worked Saturday to extinguish spot fires around the Bell Canyon hillside neighborhoods.\n\nWhile most Bell Canyon residents left the neighborhood as the fire approached Friday, others stayed behind to fight the blaze.\n\nMark Leiss, 49, said he used his garden hose and buckets of water to battle the fire as it approache his property, even as three of his neighbors’ homes burned to the ground.\n\n“The whole back of the house dropped off, and it was pretty much like a bomb; and then a propane tank exploded, and that was another bomb,” Leiss said. “I’ve never been that scared in my life.”\n\nMicki Davidovicz, who left her home quickly with her fiancé and three dogs on Friday as flames approached, was told by a neighbor that her home had burned. But as she drove up her street Saturday, she learned for the first time that her friend had been mistaken.\n\n“We have a home!” Micki Davidovicz exclaimed, exiting her car. “I was crying that I didn’t get my daughter’s bat mitzvah photos,” she said.\n\nClark, who’d lost his home, said he’s already thinking about the next steps. He’s staying with friends for now, but soon he’ll have to file an insurance claim, find a rental house, and then begin the task of rebuilding on his torched property.\n\nBut for Bell Canyon residents whose houses escaped damage, many said they remain concerned about what might happen Sunday if the strong Santa Ana winds return as expected.\n\nLeiss, working on 48 hours with little food or sleep, said he was mentally preparing to once again fight for his home, if necessary.\n\n“I’ll be here,” Leiss said. “I have to. I’ve gone this far.”\n\n‘It just doesn’t feel real that it’s all gone.’\n\nJust a couple of days ago, Arik Fultz was feeding the horses on his 40-acre ranch near Malibu.\n\nNow, after wildfires roared through parts of Southern California, there’s nothing left of his ranch but charred remains. His family and his 52 horses survived. But two houses, two barns, three trailers and decades of accumulated possessions are gone.\n\n“It just doesn’t feel real that it’s all gone,” he said.\n\nAt the Fultz ranch near Malibu, all of the 52 horses survived after a wild scramble to save them.\n\nFultz’s mother, 61-year-old Tricia Fultz, said everyone expected the fire to stay well south of their property, but shifting winds forced them to take the horses out to open pastures as quickly as they could.\n\nThree were still in their pens when the adjacent barn caught fire, and Tricia Fultz just had to open the pens, burning her hands and hoping for the best.\n\nShe, her husband and six others rode out the fire in a tunnel a short distance up the road as the fire burned the hillsides above and all around them.\n\n“It’s so surreal because it’s so dark, and when we’re in the tunnel you can’t see anything,” Tricia Fultz said. “There was so much burning and so much black.”\n\n‘I’m hoping it’s going to miss us.’\n\nAs the Hill Fire burned nearby, the smoke was thick around a quiet, empty Camarillo Springs neighborhood Thursday evening.\n\nSome fire engines were stationed on a hill just south of Highway 101 and sheriff’s sport utility vehicles drove around to make sure everyone knew to leave.\n\nEdwin Wai and Frances Chow just moved into Camarillo Springs in June, five years after the Springs Fire burned down the mountain behind the homes there.\n\nA neighbor knocked on the door around 3:30 p.m. and then five minutes later a sheriff’s deputy was there to let them know about a mandatory evacuation order and urge them to leave.\n\nThey left, pulling over with over evacuees on a road just outside the small community.\n\n“I’m hoping it’s going to miss us,” said Lori Rangel, who retired to Camarillo Springs a few years ago.\n\nThey waited, watching the smoke as it blew across Highway 101.\n\nJudy and Hal Hyman had left their Camarillo Springs home when they got an emergency alert about 3:30 p.m.\n\n“I went outside,” Hal said. “There was smoke billowing up.”\n\nThey loaded up the car with their safe, clothes, medication and computer and left.\n\nThe community is no stranger to having to leave quickly. It was evacuated during the Springs Fire in 2013 as flames crept into backyards and storage areas.\n\nThen in December 2014, an intense rainstorm brought tons of mud and rocks down the fire-scorched hillsides and into the neighborhood. No one was injured, but 16 homes were damaged, 10 left uninhabitable.\n\n“This community is very prepared for emergencies,” Hal Hyman said Thursday.\n\nBy 5 p.m., the Hymans were inside their vehicle in a nearby parking lot waiting for friends trying to get home to get their dog. The Hymans didn’t have a key to their friends’ home.\n\nA deputy came over to tell them about a command center in the city of Camarillo where they could wait.\n\n‘There’s tons of fuel.’\n\nIt was about 5 a.m. Friday when Cliff Cole found himself standing on the Palo Comado Canyon Road overpass above Highway 101 with wind and smoke blowing in his face.\n\nFor 15 minutes, he nervously watched as Woolsey Fire flames burned just yards away along the north side of the freeway.\n\nHe and his family had been evacuated from their Agoura Hills home south of the freeway and he wanted to make sure it would be OK.\n\n“I’m here to see if this thing jumps 101. If it jumps, we have problems,” said Cole, 61. “It doesn’t usually threaten this far down, so there’s tons of fuel.”\n\nSeveral homes burned in the Oak Park neighborhood as hillside flames flowed during the early morning hours. Smoldering debris was visible, even though it was dark outside.\n\nCaravan after caravan of firetrucks, with their sirens blaring, made their way through Oak Park and Agoura Hills. Flames were widespread and not once did groups of fire trucks head in any single direction.\n\n‘We don’t know where we’re staying’\n\nAt a Shell gas station on the corner of Avenida de Los Arboles and Moorpark Road, evacuees lined up their cars to fill their tanks early Friday.\n\nIra and Elaine Blanchard, 64, were at the station with their son Matthew, 26, after leaving their home.\n\n“We had a hotel room, but they overbooked and kicked us out,” Ira Blanchard said. “We don’t know where we’re staying.”\n\nThe family was considering secondary options in Moorpark and Oxnard.\n\n“We’re a little bit shaken,” Matthew Blanchard said.\n\nOne of the evacuation centers was packed people early Friday.\n\nAmong those people was Judy Goodman, who said, ”There’s nowhere to stay other than here.”\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Helen Borland, of Lang Ranch, who said, ”No hotels were available all the way to Encino, and that was six hours ago.”\n\nJackie Lund was hoping for other accommodations soon.\n\n“I’m waiting for my son to arrive from Encino to pick me up — that is, if he can get on the freeway,” Lund said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/china/china-heat-wave-chongqing-wildfires-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Wildfires rage as China's Chongqing suffers unrelenting record heat ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThousands of emergency responders are battling to contain fast-spreading wildfires in China’s southwestern city of Chongqing amid a weeks-long, record heat wave in the region.\n\nThe fires, which have been visible at night from parts of the downtown area, have swept forests and mountains around the mega city in recent days.\n\nOn social media, residents in downtown Chongqing complained of smelling smoke inside their apartments, while others posted pictures of burning embers from the fires reaching their balconies.\n\nSince August 18, wildfires had broken out in multiple outlying districts, local authorities said. The municipality is home to more than 32 million people.\n\nMunicipal authorities have not yet reported any casualties and said the fires are being kept under control, according to an update on Tuesday morning.\n\nMore than 1,500 residents have been relocated to safe zones, while 5,000 firefighters, police, local officers and volunteers, and seven firefighting helicopters have been dispatched to help combat the blazes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nAs of Tuesday, all districts and counties in Chongqing have issued an order that forbids the usage of fire in the wild and activities that are prone to fires.\n\nThe fires in Chongqing were the result of “spontaneous combustion” mainly caused by extremely high temperatures, Bai Ye, a professor at China’s Forest and Grassland Fire Prevention and Extinguishing Research Center told state-run Beijing Daily.\n\nThe wildfires are another knock-on effect of a crippling heat wave – China’s worst since 1961 – that has swept through southwestern, central and eastern parts of the country in recent weeks, with temperatures crossing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in more than 100 cities.\n\nThey are also part of a global trend of wildfires that have ravaged areas from Australia to California, with scientists saying elevated global temperatures due to human-driven climate change increase the risk of these events.\n\nFirefighters combat a mountain wildfire in Chongqing, China on August 22.

The toll will probably surpass 60 and make the disaster the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959, Gov. Josh Green said.\n\nThe death count continues to climb and parts of coastal communities have been largely destroyed, including the historic town of Lahaina. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nGreen also said \"maybe upwards of 1,700 buildings'' were destroyed by the fires, which now appear to be mostly under control. Roughly 1,000 people remain missing, according to Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier.\n\nBut some fires are still burning in Lahaina and surrounding areas. “Lahaina, with a few rare exceptions, has been burned down,” the governor said.\n\nAt an afternoon press briefing, Green said damage to the area is in the billions of dollars and that it will take years to bring about repair. “It’s a profound change of landscape,” Green said of the massive fire damage to the area. He said that footage from the fires will be released late Thursday.\n\nHe pleaded with local hotels and others to come forward and help with the unprecedented need for temporary housing for people in need. He said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people displaced in the fires.\n\n“If you have additional space in your home, if you have the capacity to take someone in from West Maui, please do,” Green said.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nLater in the day, Maui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires are “100% contained right now,” and there are several small fires in between the large fires. There is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nRescue crews searched for survivors Thursday amid the devastation left behind in Maui by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in five years, which injured dozens.\n\nEntire blocks of homes, businesses and a 200-year-old church were destroyed or damaged in Lahaina Town. In less than two days, neighborhoods from a community that dates to the 1700s turned into smoky rubble, with charred bodies inside burned-out cars and scorched boats in the harbor as the grim remnants.\n\nThe fires − fueled by wind from passing Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − were so intense that the Coast Guard rescued 14 people who fled into the ocean to escape flames and smoke, including two children.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. Officials said they will provide daily updates on all AM and FM radio channels at 9 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. Hawaii time.\n\nNot since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, had a U.S. community endured such a deadly wildfire. The Hawaii toll is expected to rise as rescuers get to parts of the island that have been been unreachable because of fires or obstructions.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaps, before-and-after images of the destruction in Hawaii caused by Maui fires\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode.

Before delivering a speech in Salt Lake City, Biden addressed the catastrophic fires and said: “We’ll get aid into the hands of people who desperately need the help. Anyone who’s lost a loved one or whose home has been damaged is going to get help immediately.’’\n\nFederal aid will be available to support state and local recovery efforts after Biden made the declaration.\n\n\"Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,\" according to a statement from the White House.\n\nBiden said he instructed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who is expected to arrive in the state Friday, to streamline help processes. He encouraged those who want to find out if they're eligible for federal help to get information at disasterassistance.gov.\n\nCrowdsourcing effort helps friends, relatives reconnect\n\nTwo days after rapidly spreading wildfires began tearing through areas of Maui, some families and friends still haven't heard from loved ones believed to be living or traveling there. They’ve taken to a crowdsourced online effort to locate hundreds of people as of Thursday morning because power outages and loss of cellphone signal have left them out of contact.\n\nA spreadsheet created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media showed people from around the globe trying to reach those they know on the island, local station KHON2 reported.\n\n“I really hope that it can be kind of a place where if people are wondering about their friends, their loved ones, if they know somebody is safe they can come onto here and hopefully just give people peace of mind,” Erickson told the station.\n\nMany of the names on the list had been accounted for, scattered at emergency shelters, the airport or turning up with family members. But hundreds of people were still marked “not located” Thursday, and more were being added.\n\nAlexis Plume, a resident of Haiku – about 34 miles from Lahaina – was finally able to call her brother’s best friend in Lahaina Thursday morning. Plume said communication had not been possible with them because of disrupted cell phone service in the area.\n\n‘It’s a real big relief,” Plume said. “Everything is really hard to watch and we’re all just sort of trying to figure out what we can do.”\n\nNetblocks, a cybersecurity company, has been monitoring the network connectivity and found Lahaina still remains largely disconnected as of Thursday.\n\n“It's crucial to remain patient if you're trying to reach loved ones in the region,” Alp Toker, founder and director of the company, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Connectivity challenges may make communication sporadic but rescue efforts are ongoing so don't lose hope.”\n\n− Jeanine Santucci & Itzel Luna\n\nFamilies with nowhere else to go; concerns for the homeless\n\nOn Thursday, Leomana Turalde was at Maui's Maalea Harbor, about 16 miles east of the worst damage at Lahaina, where he was headed to help find missing people. “In every parking lot on the island” it seemed there were families sleeping in their rental cars Thursday morning with nowhere else to go, he said.\n\nThere were still some small fires burning throughout Maui on Thursday, Turalde, 36, told USA TODAY. There was also heavy traffic around National Guard checkpoints and chain stores are shut down, he said.\n\nTuralde said he's most worried about friends and one cousin who are homeless.\n\n“They’re all devastated,” he said. “If I can help out those people, that’s kind of my main concern because nobody really cares about the homeless person with no ID.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWhat travelers should know about the Maui wildfires\n\nHawaii's tourism arm is encouraging travelers with trips planned to areas impacted by the wildfires to reschedule if possible.\n\n“All nonessential travel to the Island of Maui is strongly discouraged,” acting Hawaii Gov. Sylvia Luke wrote in an emergency proclamation Wednesday, which extended the emergency period until Aug. 31.\n\nThe state of emergency is in effect for the entire state, though so far the fires have been limited to Maui and the northwest part of the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nTravel to other parts of the Big Island is still welcome, as well as to Kauai, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Travelers can check with their specific hotels and airlines for special waiver policies amid the wildfires.\n\n− Eve Chen\n\nOfficials work to suppress fire, restore power\n\nEvacuation efforts have been complicated by power blackouts, a lack of cell service, the loss of 911 service and downed power lines in different parts of the islands. More than 11,000 customers remained without power Thursday according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, commander general of the Hawaii Army National Guard, said Wednesday night that officials were working to restore communication, distribute water and possibly add law enforcement personnel. He said National Guard helicopters had flown for 13 hours and dropped 150,000 gallons of water on the fires.\n\nCounty officials said three active fires on Maui remained unchanged at the end of the day Wednesday. Firefighters have been dealing with multiple flareups and have requested additional personnel from Honolulu.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono said the priorities include fire suppression and restoring telephone access and electrical power as search and rescue efforts continue.\n\n“This is truly an all hands on deck situation,” Hirono said.\n\nTourists and residents fleeing to Maui airport\n\nAbout 11,000 visitors flew out of Maui on Wednesday, and at least another 1,500 expected to leave Thursday, according to Ed Sniffen, state transportation director. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay saw homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them.’’ Debris turned into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas tried to flee while carrying their prized possessions, he said.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nFirefighters could see some relief with winds letting up\n\nThe high winds fueling wildfires began to wane late Wednesday and will continue to ease during the day Thursday and into Friday, providing some much needed relief for firefighters battling the blazes, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY.\n\nZehr said wind gusts Thursday could occasionally get to 30-35 mph; local peaks of 40 mph were possible. Later in the day and into Friday, that should ease further with gusts not getting over about 20 mph.\n\n“It should be better conditions now for today, easier for the firefighters to be able to do what they need to do and hopefully get some better control over these fires,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nWhy devastated Lahaina Town is such a cherished place on Maui\n\nResidents and visitors are mourning the loss of cultural and religious sites in Lahaina Town that trace their roots back centuries.\n\nLahaina, which was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, has a population of around 13,000, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. Lahaina Town has also long claimed home to the largest banyan tree in the U.S., which was scorched by the fires.\n\nFor Francine Hollinger, a 66-year-old Native Hawaiian, losing Lahaina was \"like losing a family member.\"\n\nIn just a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated the town center, which traces its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burned down to ashes, the whole entire town − hotels, buildings, the historic sites,'' said Leomana Turalde, who said his mother worked for years as a dancer at Old Lahaina Luau, considered a \"well-preserved epicenter of Hawaiian culture and storytelling,\" according to its website.\n\nHow drought helped fuel Hawaii wildfires\n\nMuch of the state is in varying levels of drought, and parts of Maui are affected by moderate and severe drought conditions, including some areas around Lahaina, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. An estimated 263,948 Hawaii residents are living in drought areas, the Drought Monitor said Thursday.\n\nThe duration and severity of droughts in Hawaii have increased over the last century, the National Integrated Drought Information System has warned.\n\nA drought dries out vegetation, adding power to a wildfire, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY. That risk could continue, as there’s no rainfall expected soon for the part of Maui impacted by fire.\n\n“As long as you’re stuck in this pattern when you’re not getting a lot of rainfall, you’re going to continue to have these problems where it doesn’t take much to start a fire and it takes even less to make it spread,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nAerial photos show damage in Lahaina, Banyan Court\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nThe banyan tree, planted in 1873 after being imported from India, was threatened by the fires and suffered damage to trunks and limbs but remains standing, the Honolulu Civil Beat reported.\n\nWhat caused the Maui fires?\n\nHigh winds and low humidity likely contributed to the fires, but officials know little else, Hara said at a briefing Wednesday. Hurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean, fueled the strong winds overnight in Maui, with gusts of 60 mph damaging homes and knocking out power.\n\nBut some experts said they suspect human development on the island is at least partly to blame for the destruction.\n\nWildfires have quadrupled in Hawaii in recent decades, and many scientists say the culprit is unmanaged, non-native grasslands planted by plantations and ranchers and others unfamiliar with the island's native ecosystems. The grass is dry and prone to fires.\n\n“There is no doubt that fire-prone grasses have invaded drier Hawaiian ecosystems and brought larger, more intense fires,” said Peter Vitousek, a professor of earth sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nMaui death toll climbs\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening.\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey.\n\nMaui fire map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\n'Maui Strong': Here's how to help Hawaii fire victims\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, from the Hawaii State Department of Defense, asked those who want to donate supplies or volunteer to do so through the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. James Kunane Tokioka, director of the department of business, economic development and tourism, said the governor has also asked people with vacant homes or vacation rentals to provide shelter for those in need.\n\nSeveral shelters are open to assist those on the islands and several local organizations are collecting donations. USA TODAY compiled resources for Americans to help people and animals in Hawaii here.\n\nBy Wednesday, the Hawaii Community Foundation said its Maui Strong Fund had raised more than $1 million to support residents affected by the wildfires. Funding will be used for \"evolving needs, including shelter, food, financial assistance and other services as identified by our partners doing critical work on Maui,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Ashley Lewis and Kayla Jimenez, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2023/08/10/maui-tourists-stranded-wildfire/70570654007/", "title": "Tourists stranded, scramble to leave Maui amid wildfire devastation", "text": "MAUI, Hawaii – The Vega family spent the first night of a 10-day vacation in an emergency shelter.\n\nThe Portland, Oregon, family of five arrived on Maui on Tuesday morning and were staying at the Honua Kai Resort & Spa in Lahaina when wildfires caused by the dry nonnative grass and strong winds from Hurricane Dora started to rage and turn Lahaina into a “war zone.”\n\nAt 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday, an alarm went off in the hotel and all guests had to evacuate. “Nobody gave us directions on where to go,” said Sierra Vega, one of the daughters.\n\n“The smoke didn’t look bad from the hotel, but once we hit the street, it was pure red,” she said.\n\nShe said navigating the one road out of Lahaina was stressful with no street lights or cell service. “You just knew you had to stay calm,” Sierra added.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nThe family tried to find another hotel, but everything was booked.\n\nLater that morning, the family arrived at the emergency shelter at the War Memorial Gymnasium in Wailuku. They couldn’t contact the hotel to see if they could get their belongings back.\n\nThe family plans to get a flight out of Maui as soon as possible.\n\n“We feel for the island,” Vega said. “It’s tough for us today, but we’ll get on a plane in a couple of days. But these fires have ruined people’s lives.”\n\nThere were at least 55 fatalities recorded as of Friday morning, though officials expected that number to increase. Hundreds of buildings and homes were destroyed, including all of historic Lahaina Town, and thousands of residents lost nearly everything and were displaced.\n\nThe Vega family is among the many Maui tourists caught in one of the deadliest wildfires in the nation in recent years. Amid the devastation, tourists are scrambling trying to flee the popular destination – sometimes without their belongings or after sleeping in their cars – as residents plead for visitors not to come to the ravaged island.\n\nDeath toll is climbing:How to help victims in the Maui wildfires in Hawaii\n\nTourists scramble for safety\n\nMany tourists resorted to sleeping in their cars wherever they could park with the clothes on their backs because they couldn’t return to their accommodations in Lahaina. The main road to Lahaina continues to be closed to tourists on Thursday.\n\nA line of cars was parked on the side of the road with people waiting to see if they could return to their hotel room on Wednesday.\n\n“We have nowhere else to go,” one couple visiting Maui said.\n\nOther visitors who landed on Maui on Wednesday morning didn’t even leave the airport and immediately rerouted their Maui vacations to other unaffected islands, like Kauai. A few said they would continue with their trips to Maui, looking for accommodations in areas that are still open.\n\nAbout 11,000 visitors flew out of Maui on Wednesday, according to the State Transportation Director Ed Sniffen. About 1,500 more are going to fly out on Thursday.\n\nJanet Han and 10 other family members landed on Maui the Friday before the fires. She and her family evacuated their rental townhome in Lahaina on Tuesday afternoon when her sister saw “billows of big gray, black smoke.” Han managed to book an Airbnb in Kihei, located in south Maui, and her original rental will refund her for the nights her family didn’t spend there. She hopes the road to Lahaina opens soon so her family can get the medical items they need.\n\nHan said her family is “making the best” of their trip since they don’t get to see each other often.\n\nIs it safe to visit Hawaii right now?What travelers should know about the Maui wildfires\n\nPlease ‘leave Maui’\n\nHawaii is in a state of emergency until the end of the month, according to Acting Hawaii Gov. Sylvia Luke.\n\n“Visitors who are on nonessential travel are being asked to leave Maui, and nonessential travel to Maui is strongly discouraged at this time,” according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority on Thursday morning. Travel to Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and other parts of Hawaii Island remains unaffected.\n\nMany airlines are offering waivers for flights going to Maui. Passengers can check Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines to see if their flights can be changed for free.\n\nHawaiian Airlines has added extra flights to help get people out of Maui, and lowered main cabin fares to $19 “to facilitate urgent travel needs,” a Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson said.\n\nHotel brands like the Outrigger are relocating guests to other properties across the Hawaiian islands, a spokesperson said. Hotels and activities booked on the entire island of Maui via Expedia Group subsidiaries like Hotels.com or Expedia can be cancelled without penalty until Aug. 31.\n\nThose with vacation rentals booked on Maui through Vrbo will get a full refund for their cancellation and should've gotten a notification, according to Vrbo’s parent company Expedia Group. Airbnb said rentals can also be canceled for a full refund because the company has an Extenuating Circumstances Policy, which covers declared emergencies and other unforeseen events.\n\nOn social media, many Hawaii residents are asking tourists to cancel any upcoming trips to Maui so resources can be used to help locals who lost everything – especially as Maui was already facing a housing crisis.\n\nBeatrice Hoopai, who was living at the Hawaiian homeless shelter in Lahaina, had to evacuate with her family of five on Tuesday night to the War Memorial Gymnasium shelter. She said that even though tourists lost their luggage, they can still fly back to their homes, while the shelter and her belongings are gone.\n\n“The streets are my home now,” she said.\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii.

Smoke blanketed San Francisco, and could be seen from space, per satellites at the National Weather Service.\n\nIn all, Gov. Gavin Newsom said firefighters are battling 367 known wildfires across California, including 23 that are considered major fires. Of those 367 fires, \"the prospect of that number going up is very real,\" he said at a press conference Wednesday.\n\nNewsom blamed \"the extraordinary weather we're experiencing and all of these lightning strikes\" for the fires. He said the state has recorded nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours.\n\nA helicopter fighting the blaze crashed in Coalinga, California Wednesday morning, killing the pilot and sparking a new wildfire, which then merged into the nearby Hills Fire.\n\nThe blaze burning near Vacaville was dubbed the Hennessey Fire, but there are so many fires burning in the area that firefighters have put them all under one incident – the LNU Lightning Complex – for reporting purposes, Weather.com said. In all, those fires have burned around 72 square miles of land in Napa and Sonoma counties, and are 0% contained.\n\nResidents of Vacaville, a city of about 100,000 between San Francisco and Sacramento, awoke in the darkness Wednesday morning to frantic evacuation orders as an uncontrolled wildfire burned into the western edge of the city and destroyed at least 50 structures.\n\nIn Solano County, a rural area southeast of Vacaville, some residents fled for the first time ever.\n\n“I’ve lived here for 30 years, never had to evacuate before,” resident Tim Lukehart said. “There’s been fires of course, but not like this one.”\n\nThe air had an orange, smoke-filled hue for miles, with ash covering vehicles. Homes were burned down on both sides of Pleasant Valley Road, the street where Lukehart lives with his wife Sarah. Wooden fences were still in flames, and one family was chasing their cattle through a field as they tried to bring the animals home to safety as the grass smoldered.\n\nA rescue effort to save about 125 horses failed as owners could not get trailers to the area or access by foot.\n\nIn an alert issued just after 7 p.m. Wednesday, the Travis Air Force base commander ordered a partial evacuation of “non-mission essential personnel.”\n\nWednesday afternoon, the fire jumped Interstate 80, forcing highway officials to close a five-mile freeway section.\n\nThe LNU Lightning Complex is the second-largest fire burning in California on Wednesday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe largest fire burning in California, a blaze made up of 20 separate fires burning near San Jose, has been named the SCU Lightning Complex Fire. The fire ballooned from 54 square miles to burning at least 132 square miles over Tuesday night. It is 5% contained, and threatens more than 1,400 structures, according to the SCU branch of Cal Fire.\n\nAnother group of 30 fires in Chico, called the Butte Lightning Complex fires, has consumed 2 square miles with 10% containment, with Cal Fire, and are not expected to impact residents, according to a Cal Fire-Butte County news release.\n\nWill Powers, a state fire spokesman, said “throughout the state of California right now, we are stretched thin for crews” because of the fires. “Air resources have been stretched thin throughout the whole state.”\n\nMuch of California is enduring a sweltering late summer heat wave that has broken several record highs in recent days, including a 130-degree reading Sunday in Death Valley, Weather.com said. The hot, dry conditions are expected to continue at least into the weekend.\n\nCalifornia fire tracker:Map traces current fires burning across state in real-time\n\nThe extreme heat was being generated by a strong ridge of high pressure over the western U.S., which also produced an onslaught of thunderstorms and lightning that ignited many of the wildfires burning in California.\n\n\"We have a very large area of high pressure over the area,\" National Weather Service meteorologist David Sweet said. \"It's sitting right over us, and it's not moving.\"\n\nThere was \"no relief\" expected Wednesday from the sweltering heat, the Weather Service said, as temperatures were forecast to again soar above 100 degrees across much of the western U.S. In all, some 37 million people were under excessive heat warnings in the West, mainly in California, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nOne of the major consequences of the heat wave over the past several days has been the threat of temporary power outages, also known as rolling blackouts, to conserve electricity usage along the state's power grid.\n\nGrid managers again called for voluntary energy conservation during afternoon and evening hours Wednesday to try to avoid having to order utilities to cut power to selected areas, which happened twice last week but has been narrowly avoided since then.\n\nIn Northern California, police and firefighters went door-to-door before dawn Wednesday in a frantic scramble to warn residents to evacuate as fire encroached on Vacaville. Fire officials said at least 50 structures were destroyed and 50 were damaged and that four people were injured.\n\nTelevision footage showed some homes in flames and thick ash dropping in a rural area near Interstate 80 as the fire appeared to head toward more densely populated areas.\n\nDiane Bustos told KPIX-TV that she and her husband tried to drive out but their vehicle caught on fire and they had to flee on foot. “I got all these flames on me and I lost my shoe, but I made it. God saved me,” she said.\n\nDue to the Hennessey fire, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has issued a health caution because of the hazy conditions caused by smoke from the wildfires burning throughout California. Officials are asking Valley residents to reduce their exposure to particulate matter by remaining indoors.\n\nParticulate matter can trigger asthma attacks, aggravate chronic bronchitis and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Those with existing respiratory conditions, including COVID-19, young children and the elderly, are especially susceptible.\n\nCommon cloth and paper masks being worn because of COVID-19 concerns may not provide protection from wildfire smoke.\n\nMore:California avoids rolling blackouts for another night amid scorching temperatures, raging wildfires\n\nMore wildfires:Colorado is battling 4 major fires, including the fourth largest in state history\n\nIn Napa County, Gail Bickett, 80, loaded up her three dogs in a truck to evacuate as the fire burned behind houses across the road, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\n“It’s scary,” she said. “It’s overwhelming.”\n\nState Sen. Bill Dodd, who represents the area in the state Legislature, said the fires burning in Napa and Sonoma counties were mostly affecting less populated areas.\n\n“I think the people around here, even the people that have structures in harm’s way, understand that they’re in a more rural area and that the people in more densely populated areas have to get the resources first,” he said.\n\nSeveral fires were also were burning in northern coastline areas and in Southern California.\n\nThe cluster of wine country fires threaten an area that only last year grappled with another massive blaze that forced 200,000 to flee – a task made more complicated this year because of the pandemic.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Jeremy Childs, The Ventura County Star; The Redding Record Searchlight, James Ward, Visalia Times-Delta", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/11/maui-hawaii-fire-live-updates/70573053007/", "title": "Number of Maui wildfire deaths rises to 80: Live updates", "text": "Editor's note: This file is based on the news of the Hawaii wildfires on Friday, Aug. 11.

Fuel would not be distributed on Saturday, the county said in a statement.\n\nNew fire prompts Friday night evacuation on Maui\n\nPolice say a new fire burning on the Hawaii island of Maui has triggered the evacuation of a community to the northeast of the area that burned earlier this week.\n\nThe fire prompted the evacuation of people in Kaanapali in West Maui on Friday night, the Maui Police Department announced on social media. No details of the evacuation were immediately provided.\n\nTraffic was halted earlier after some people went over barricaded, closed-off areas of the disaster zone and \"entered restricted, dangerous, active investigation scenes,\" police said.\n\nIn an earlier post on Facebook Friday, police said many people were parking on the Lahaina Bypass and walking into nearby areas that were \"locked down due to hazardous conditions and biohazards.\" Police warned violators could face arrest.\n\n\"This area is an active police scene, and we need to preserve the dignity of lives lost and respect their surviving family,\" the post said.\n\nDeath toll in Maui fire disaster rises to 67 amid questions about warning system\n\nThe death toll from the Maui wildfire climbed to 67 Friday as Maui fire crews battled blazes still scorching parts of the island and rescue workers searched for about 1,000 people reported missing as questions began to swirl about Hawaii's emergency warning system.\n\nConfirmed deaths from the inferno that erupted Tuesday − fueled by winds from Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − now officially make the Maui natural disaster the worst that Hawaii has seen since becoming a state in 1959.\n\nThere is still no end in sight. Cadaver-sniffing dogs were brought in Friday to assist the search for the dead, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen Jr. said.\n\nThe death toll of 67 surpasses the state’s deadliest previous largest natural disaster, a 1960 tsunami that killed 61 people. An even deadlier tsunami in 1946, prior to Hawaii's statehood, killed more than 150 on the Big Island. The 1946 tsunami prompted the development of the territory-wide emergency system that includes sirens, which are sounded monthly to test their readiness.\n\nBut many fire survivors in this week's conflagration said in interviews that they didn’t hear any sirens or receive a warning that gave them enough time to prepare, realizing they were in danger only when they saw flames or heard explosions nearby.\n\n“There was no warning. There was absolutely none. Nobody came around. We didn’t see a fire truck or anybody,” said Lynn Robinson, who lost her home in the fire.\n\nThousands of people have been displaced, more than 1,700 structures have been destroyed, and the historic town of Lahaina was leveled.\n\n\"Without a doubt, it feels like a bomb was dropped on Lahaina,” Gov. Josh Green said after walking the ruins of the town with the mayor.\n\nGreen said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people and asked local hotels and others to help provide temporary housing for those in need.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nWidespread power and cellular outages have complicated evacuation efforts, and some residents who escaped the flames questioned why Hawaii's famous emergency warning systems didn't alert them as the blazes approached.\n\n\"We got warned, but the wind was faster,\" Leomana Turalde, a 36-year-old who runs a sunscreen company and has family who lived in Lahaina Town, told USA TODAY. \"I found out on social media. But there was no real warning.\"\n\nThomas Leonard, 74, told the Associated Press he didn't know about the fire until he smelled smoke. The retired mailman from Lahaina tried to flee in his Jeep but abandoned his vehicle when nearby cars started to explode. He took refuge behind a seawall for hours before being rescued by firefighters.\n\nHawaii AG announces 'comprehensive review' of wildfire decisions\n\nHawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced in a statement Friday that her office will conduct a “comprehensive review” of decisions and polices related to the wildfires this week.\n\n“The Department of the Attorney General shares the grief felt by all in Hawaiʻi, and our hearts go out to everyone affected by this tragedy,” Lopez said in the statement. “My Department is committed to understanding the decisions that were made before and during the wildfires and to sharing with the public the results of this review. As we continue to support all aspects of the ongoing relief effort, now is the time to begin this process of understanding.\"\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green told CNN earlier Friday that he had authorized a review of the state’s response, but power outages and phone network issues were disrupting the efforts.\n\nThe announcements come after some people in Maui said they didn’t hear alarms or warnings about the fire. There are also questions about whether the area had adequate resources to deal with the disaster.\n\nFriends and family still struggle to reach loved ones\n\nAnna Del Castello has been trying to learn more about the situation on the ground in West Maui, where she has a home and “quite a few” friends, but the San Francisco property manager told USA TODAY that Hawaii officials are not providing enough useful information, particularly for longtime residents on the ground who are “in a crisis right now.”\n\n“I’m finding out everything from Facebook and people’s comments, which is just crazy,” said Del Castello, 47, who visits West Maui every year. She has a family home two blocks away from Kapalua Airport that her father, a Pearl Harbor veteran, built in the 1980s.\n\nShe has not been able to get in touch with her tenant who lives there yet, she said. Del Castello believes the house is likely still standing because the fires stopped several miles south of it, according to the fire maps, she said. But cell service is still shoddy, she said, and residents near there have had to walk to nearby beaches just to text loved ones that they’re okay.\n\nDel Castello said emergency management officials need to get cellphone towers up and running more quickly and help devastated residents on the ground communicate with the outside world. “To me, it really feels like the priorities are not right,” she said.\n\nSome have taken to a crowdsourced online spreadsheet to locate hundreds of people created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media. As of Friday, over 1,500 names on the list were still marked \"not located.\"\n\nLahaina residents return to devastated remains of town\n\nFor the first time since the raging wildfires, Lahaina residents were allowed back to their town on Friday – only to be met with a scene of ash-ridden devastation.\n\nNearly every building on Front Street, the economic center of the island and heart of the community, was leveled to debris, according to Associated Press journalists who saw the area. Burnt remains from dozens of cars that didn’t make it out of the fires stood still in a frozen traffic jam.\n\n“It hit so quick, it was incredible,” Lahaina resident Kyle Scharnhorst told the AP as he surveyed the damage to his apartment complex Friday. “It was like a war zone.”\n\nWest Maui remains without power and water, officials said, and search efforts continue in Lahaina for victims of the fire. Across the island, about 1,000 people remain missing, and parts of Lahaina are burned to the ground.\n\nThere will be a daily curfew from 10pm-6am Hawaii time in the historic Lahaina town and other areas affected by the fire, Maui County officials said in a statement. Access to Lahaina will be limited “until hazardous conditions improve.”\n\nResidents will be required to show identification to prove they live in West Maui, and visitors will be asked for proof of their hotel bookings. Access to Lahaina will be closed daily during curfew hours.\n\nWater in Lahaina, Upper Kula may be contaminated from fire damage, officials warn\n\nThe Maui County Water Department warned residents of Lahaina and Upper Kula that water may be contaminated from fire damage.\n\nStatements on Friday said people in Lahaina and Upper Kula should not use tap water for drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth. For showers, officials said to use lukewarm water, limit length and ventilate the area.\n\nThe warning comes after a swift blaze destroyed some structures in the water systems, officials said, and some areas lost water pressure, which can cause harmful contaminants to enter the system.\n\nPotable water tanks in Lahaina and Kula are available for residents to fill containers with a maximum capacity of five gallons.\n\nThe notice is in effect \"until test data is available,\" the statement said.\n\nCoast Guard rescues 17 people in search across water\n\nIn an hours-long search across more than 450 square nautical miles, the US Coast Guard said in a statement Friday that it has rescued 17 people after the blaze sent some people fleeing into the ocean to escape the fire.\n\nAnother 40 survivors were found and assisted to shore, the agency added. There are currently no confirmed missing people in the water.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it plans to “transition to other missions later this evening, unless additional information warrants continuing searches.”\n\nThe agency has been searching for people since initial emergency reports Tuesday evening. Coast Guard officials previously estimated up to 100 people had fled into the water, NBC News reported.\n\nAnyone with information about missing people in the water can contact Coast Guard Sector Honolulu Command Center at 808-842-2600.\n\nLahaina's wildfire risk prompted worry in previous study\n\nLahaina’s wildfire risk is well known. Maui County’s hazard mitigation plan, last updated in 2020, identified Lahaina and other West Maui communities as having frequent wildfires and a large number of buildings at risk of wildfire damage.\n\nThe report also noted that West Maui had the island’s second-highest rate of households without a vehicle and the highest rate of non-English speakers.\n\n“This may limit the population’s ability to receive, understand and take expedient action during hazard events,” the plan noted.\n\nMaui’s firefighting efforts may also have been hampered by a small staff, said Bobby Lee, president of the Hawaii Firefighters Association. There are a maximum of 65 firefighters working at any given time in the county, and they are responsible for three islands – Maui, Molokai and Lanai – he said.\n\nThe blaze is the deadliest U.S. wildfire since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 people and laid waste to the town of Paradise.\n\nPower could be out for weeks in some places\n\nWhile power was restored to some essential services by Friday, officials warned some areas of the island could face power outages for weeks.\n\nThe County of Maui said early Friday morning that power was restored to Upcountry water pumping stations, and that water would be restored in that area after the lines were flushed.\n\nBut Hawaiian Electric said West Maui residents should be prepared for the possibility of \"extended outages that could last several weeks in some areas.\"\n\nCrews would start damage assessments and repairs as soon as areas are safe to access, the electric company said Thursday afternoon. There were about 12,400 customers without power Thursday.\n\nWildfire expert: This was foreseeable\n\nThough officials have said the wildfires sparked and spread so quickly there was little time to warn people, one Hawaii wildfire expert said the tragedy was foreseeable.\n\nElizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of the nonprofit Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, told the Honolulu Civil Beat she co-authored a report nearly a decade ago that identified an increased wildfire risk to Maui, with Lahaina in an extreme risk area.\n\n“We keep hearing from certain elected officials and other people being quoted in the media, ‘we had no idea, this is unprecedented,’” Pickens told the outlet Thursday. “But actually, those of us in the wildfire community, meaning our fire agencies, our forestry natural resource management community, we have long been working to increase our risk reduction efforts.”\n\nPickett said many recommended actions from the report to prevent wildfires have been implemented since its release, but only partially, and much more could have been done.\n\n“It might not have been 100% preventable, but it could have been mitigated. It could have been lessened,\" she said.\n\nThousands flee as officials continue evacuating Maui\n\nAs crews continued to work to evacuate residents, thousands of tourists and visitors to the island left on flights by Thursday evening, officials said.\n\nNearly 15,000 visitors left Maui on airplanes as airlines added flights to their schedules. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from Kaʻanapali-area hotels to the airport.\n\nTravelers were urged to book flights directly with airlines to Honolulu, and to the mainland U.S. from there. The Hawaii Tourism Authority said visitors traveling for nonessential purposes should leave the island, and nobody should travel there unless necessary.\n\nMaui firefighters stretched thin, hampering efforts\n\nThe effort to keep the fires under control could have been hampered by the relatively small firefighting crew in Maui, said Hawaii Firefighters Association President Bobby Lee.\n\nThere are a maximum of 65 firefighters working at any given time, Lee said, out of a total of about 280 personnel. They are equipped with just over a dozen fire engines, with 14 fire stations in the county serving the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, according to the county.\n\nCounty officials said in an update on Facebook early Friday morning that 21 firefighters, seven supervisory personnel and four vehicles from Honolulu were aiding crews in Maui, and an additional nine-member search-and-rescue team was also brought in to help.\n\nHawaii’s siren system didn’t sound during fires\n\nSurvivors of the fires and officials reported there was no activation of the state’s storied emergency warning system, which would have sounded blaring outdoor sirens.\n\nHawaii’s system, known as the All-hazard Statewide Outdoor Warning Siren System, is used to warn residents about emergencies including earthquakes, tsunamis, brush fires, flooding, lava, or terrorist events, according to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThere are over 400 sirens spread throughout the islands, including 80 in Maui County. The state says it’s the largest outdoor warning system in the country and the “largest single integrated Outdoor Siren Warning System for Public Safety in the world.”\n\nHawaii Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Adam Weintraub told The Associated Press that records don’t show the system in Maui being activated Tuesday when fire took over. Instead, alerts were sent out through Maui County residents’ phones, televisions and radios. It’s not clear whether that happened before or after the island was hit with widespread power and signal outages.\n\nMaui Fire Department Chief Brad Ventura said the fire moved so quickly from brush to neighborhoods that it was impossible to get messages to the emergency management agencies responsible for alerts.\n\n“What we experienced was such a fast-moving fire through the … initial neighborhood that caught fire they were basically self-evacuating with fairly little notice,” Ventura said.\n\nIn 2019, Oahu and Maui residents were sent into a brief panic when the outdoor siren system was mistakenly triggered during a training – after a 2018 incident when the text message alert system falsely told the whole state to take cover for an incoming ballistic missile that didn’t exist.\n\nNone of the fires are 100% contained\n\nMaui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires were “100% contained right now.\" Ventura said there are several small fires in between the large fires burning in Lahaina, Pulehu and Upcountry.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nVentura said there is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaui wildfires death toll will likely continue to climb\n\nMaui County reported at least 36 people had died in the Lahaina fire Wednesday evening. By Thursday, the total had reached 55, and it's expected to continue rising as emergency workers reach parts of the island previously cut off by the fires and other obstructions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday declared a major disaster in Hawaii, making federal aid available to support state and local recovery efforts. Green estimated damage to the area will likely cost billions and take years to repair.\n\nGreen said the disaster will likely become the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nThe Maui fire is also the deadliest in the U.S. in five years. Not since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, has a U.S. community endured such a tragedy.\n\nCelebrities including Oprah urge support for Maui\n\nThe BBC filmed Oprah Winfrey handing out supplies at the war memorial stadium earlier this week. \"I came earlier, just to see what people needed, and then went shopping because often you make donations of clothes or whatever, and it's not really what people need,\" Winfrey said. \"So, I actually went to Walmart and Costco and got pillows, shampoo, diapers, sheets, pillowcases.\" People magazine noted Winfrey is a part-time Maui resident.\n\n\"Fast X\" star Jason Momoa, who is Native Hawaiian, and Connie Britton, who starred in the first season of \"The White Lotus\" – which was shot in Maui – have also voiced their concerns for the island.\n\nProfessional golfer Collin Morikawa, whose paternal grandparents are from Hawaii, pledged to donate $1,000 to support the rescue efforts in Maui for each of his birdies in the FedEx St. Jude Championship as the tournament got underway Thursday in Memphis.\n\nBefore and after photos show Hawaii wildfires damage\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks, including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nMaui fires map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHow to help Maui fire victims\n\nMaj.

One massive fire has “advanced up the slopes of Mount Parnitha, a national park north of Athens and one of the last substantial forests near the Greek capital”.\n\n“If some people still doubt if climate change is real, let them come and see the intensity of phenomena here,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a televised briefing on Friday. The ongoing heatwave has “turned the country into a powder keg”, he added.\n\nMitsotakis has pledged to make reforestation a priority once the fires are contained, telling reporters on Saturday that “when this nightmarish summer has passed, we will turn all our attention to repairing the damage as fast as possible, and in restoring our natural environment again”.\n\nBut for now, the blazes are still raging. Reporting from Greece, The Guardian’s Helena Smith says that “little had prepared any of us on the Athens-bound flight for the sight of the great fire-induced clouds that swept either side of the plane as it made its descent on Friday”.\n\nFirefighters battle the blaze in northern Athens (Image credit: Milos Bicanski/Getty Image)\n\n“Infernos seemingly redolent of Dante’s hell” have seen areas in Athens “transformed into ash-laden no-go zones”, she continues. Flying above the capital city, “it was frighteningly clear that the city was under siege” from the “apocalyptic” fires, with “a cycle of insufferable heat fuelling conflagrations on terrain so parched it was ready to ignite at any moment”.\n\nAs extreme heat engulfs much of southern Europe, wildfires are also raging in Albania and Bulgaria, while “North Macedonia has declared a state of emergency over its own blazes”, the BBC reports.\n\n“And in southwestern Turkey, the heatwave has made local wildfires the most intense on record,” with at least eight people confirmed to have been killed and hundreds injured, says the broadcaster.\n\n‘We have to adapt’\n\nA team of 21 experienced UK firefighters have been sent to Athens by Home Secretary Priti Patel “to assist Greek emergency services battling blazes that have engulfed the city in thick smog”, The Telegraph says.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson told the paper that Patel “was in Greece earlier this week and saw the devastating effect the fires are having”, adding: “That’s why she is deploying these firefighters to help our international partners in their time of need.”\n\nA man inspects his fire damaged home in northern Athens (Image credit: Milos Bicanski/Getty Images)\n\nThe British firefighters will team up with experts from France, Ukraine, Cyprus, Croatia, Sweden and Israel. Fire crews have also been dispatched from Romania and Switzerland, while Egypt has sent two helicopters, and 36 Czech firefighters are expected to arrive today.\n\nAmid “darkness wrought by nature gone awry, extraordinary stories of valour” have emerged from Greece over the past week, writes The Guardian’s Smith. She describes how one resident of the Athens suburb of Thrakomakedones stayed behind to “defend” his property from the encroaching fires.\n\n“I am very attached to this house,” said Alexandros Rizos, who told Smith how he got his family to safety before “hiding when the order arrived to evacuate”. Rizos, a business development consultant, then stood on the roof of his home and hosed down his garden - an action that helped to prevent the blaze from taking hold of both his own and neighbouring houses.\n\nBut while his home has survived the blaze, Rizos believes climate change will bring further fires.\n\n“We love nature in my family and we want to protect the environment, not install air conditioners that will destroy it,” he said. “But with temperatures of 45C, that’s going to be hard. We have to adapt. For sure, I’ll be replacing pine trees with other trees that don’t burn so easily.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Devika Rao", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/09/hospital-homes-resort-evacuated-amid-roaring-california-fires/745406001/", "title": "California fires: Hospital, homes, resort evacuated in wine country", "text": "SAN RAFAEL, Calif. — Wind-whipped fires sweeping across California's wine country Monday killed at least 10 people, burned hundreds of homes and buildings and forced thousands to flee communities, hospitals and wineries ahead of the hard-charging flames.\n\nOfficials confirmed seven dead in Sonoma County, two in Napa, and another in Mendocino County to the north. That makes the day one of the deadliest in the state's wildfire history, although records are difficult to compare because Monday's deaths were caused by multiple fires burning in the same general area, rather than a single blaze.\n\nCalifornia State Forestry and Fire Protection chief Ken Pimlott conservatively estimated that 1,500 homes, businesses and other structures were destroyed in Northern California alone — and a separate fire was burning outside Los Angeles to the south.\n\nAbout 20,000 people were evacuated from the Northern California fires, Pimlott said. The fires continued burning Monday evening as firefighters poured into the area and air tankers hammered the flames from above.\n\nThe wind and smoke woke Santa Rosa resident Marta Ramos, 38, in the middle of the night, and she evacuated with her family at about 3:30 a.m. Monday evening, she anxiously awaited word of her home and community at the Marin Veterans' Memorial Auditorium in San Rafael, about 40 miles away. All the shelters closer to Santa Rosa were full.\n\n\"We think our house is OK but we haven't really heard anything yet. We are praying,\" Ramos said. \"We did find out that our children's' school was burned and destroyed. We're staying here at the shelter in Marin. At least here we'll be safe.\"\n\nAlong Highway 12, which runs between Sonoma and Napa counties, fires flared from the iconic, vine-covered rolling hills. A smell of burned vegetation hung in the air, and the sky was a smoky grey-brown. Charred vineyards were visible from the road, and it appeared that dozens of small fires were burning in the area.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in multiple counties, requested a major disaster declaration, and mobilized the National Guard to help combat the burgeoning crisis. CalFire also called in the world's largest firefighting air tanker, a Colorado-based converted 747 that made multiple drops in Northern California on Monday.\n\nIn Santa Rosa, 50 miles north of San Francisco in Sonoma County, the fires compelled authorities to continually expand the area of mandatory evacuations. More than a dozen evacuation centers were opened, though some quickly filled.\n\nAmong those who lost homes in Santa Rosa was Tom Welch, the fire chief in nearby Mill Valley, his friends and family reported Monday.\n\nThe Sutter Santa Rosa Hospital evacuated its 80 patients; the hospital reported on social media that \"all patients and staff are safe.\" Kaiser Permanente's Santa Rosa medical center evacuated 130 patients.\n\nMarian Williams said she caravanned with neighbors through the flames as one of the wildfires reached the vineyards near her home in Kenwood.\n\n“It was an inferno like you’ve never seen before,” she said. \"Trees were on fire like torches.\"\n\nAnother Kenwood resident, John Dean, said he drove past several burning houses.\n\n\"I mean blazing, falling down on fire,\" he said.\n\nMore:Wildfire scorches old-growth redwood forest\n\nMore:Remnants of Hurricane Nate soak Mid-Atlantic, Northeast as South cleans up\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a \"red flag\" warning — critical fire conditions — for the region, citing high winds and low humidity.\n\n\"Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly,\" the weather service warned.\n\nSan Francisco smelled like fire, and the city warned residents to close windows and keep children and pets indoors to avoid inhaling the smoke. Officials had no immediate word on the cause of the seven separate Northern California fires.\n\nIn Napa County, east of Sonoma, one fire burned 200 acres and forced evacuation of hundreds of homes and businesses. Another fire straddling the two counties ballooned from 200 acres to more than 20,000 acres.\n\n\"This fire exploded,\" state Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox told KTVU in Oakland.\n\nThe Silverado Resort and Spa, which hosted the professional golf tour's Safeway Open that ended Sunday, was evacuated, the San Francisco Chronicle and other media reported. Calls to the resort were not answered. Chris Thomas, 42, of Kirkland, Wash., told the Chronicle he arrived late Sunday with his wife, Marissa Schneider.\n\nThey smelled smoke, saw a fire truck roll by, then were ordered to evacuate via loudspeaker, Thomas said.\n\n\"It was surreal,” Thomas told the Chronicle. “When I started loading stuff into the car it was a hell-storm of smoke and ash. There were 30- to 40-mph winds. I couldn’t even breathe.\"\n\nIn Marin County, the sheriff's office said it was overwhelmed with calls based on smoke blowing into the county from wildfires burning to the north. The county fire department said it had dispatched 22 engines, five ambulances and other assets to battle the Napa and Sonoma fires.\n\nEvacuations also were ordered Mendocino County, north of Sonoma. The sheriff's department said at least one resident reported that his house burned down.\n\n\"Huge fire raging in Redwood Valley at this hour,\" the department said in a statement. \"Roads throughout the area closed and evacuation centers have been set up.\"\n\nCalifornia's deadliest single fire was the Griffith Park Fire, which killed 29 people in Los Angeles in October 1933.\n\nIt's been a fiery year in the West. So far this year, wildfires have scorched almost 8.5 million acres across the nation, an area about the size of the state of Maryland, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's about 2.5 million acres above the to-date average of 6 million.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/09"}]}

On a monthly basis, costs increased 0.4% following a 0.3% gain the previous month.\n\nWhat is the core inflation rate right now?\n\nCore prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items and are watched more closely by the Federal Reserve, increased 0.4% after a similar rise in January. That still lowered the annual increase from 3.9% to 3.8%, the smallest since May 2021.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nAre inflation rates going down?\n\nSince hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has slowed substantially. But after swift progress in the fall, price increases have become more volatile.\n\nMany goods, such as used cars, furniture and appliances, have gotten cheaper in the past year as pandemic-related supply chain snags have resolved. But the cost of services, such as rent, car insurance and transportation keep advancing, in part, because of sharply rising employee wages.\n\nBy the end of the year, Barclays expects overall inflation to slow modestly to 2.9% while the core reading drifts down to 3.1% – both still notably above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nWill the Fed lower interest rates in 2024?\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last week that the central bank will likely trim its key interest rate this year but not until officials see more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the Fed’s target. Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked its benchmark short-term rate from near zero to a 22-year high of 5% to 5.25% to corral inflation, though officials have paused since July.\n\nIn the past couple of months, futures markets have pushed out their forecast for the first Fed rate decrease from March to June and are now predicting four rate cuts this year, down from six.\n\nTuesday's index report could prompt Fed officials to wait a bit longer, depending on inflation's course over the next few months.\n\n\"While we thought a May rate cut was on the table, it is increasingly likely that the (Fed) waits at least until June\" before starting to lower rates, says Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.\n\n'I haven't seen it get any better'\n\nPat Baldwin, of Detroit, says she and her husband will fork over $418 for two round-trip train tickets to Chicago during the Thanksgiving holiday this year, more than double the pre-pandemic price tag.\n\n“It’s like astronomical,” says Baldwin, who is in her late 50s.\n\nThey’ll still take the trip, which will coincide with her husband’s birthday. But to offset the cost, they’ll forgo their traditional Christmas train ride to a small Michigan town.\n\nWhile many Americans have notched big raises in recent years, finally helping them keep up with inflation, Baldwin says her pay has gone up every other year and lagged inflation.\n\n“I haven’t seen it get any better,” says Baldwin, a program director for a foundation that develops classes and other activities for seniors.\n\nBaldwin says she regularly makes trade-offs. Instead of buying hamburger or chicken at the grocery store, she waits until a protein is on sale and then stocks her refrigerator. Last fall, she had her eye on a $99 pair of dress shoes online but bided her time until they were discounted to $39 and then bought four pairs.\n\nTo save electricity, she now washes the couple's clothes every three weeks instead of weekly and sometimes substitutes candles for lights.\n\nWhy are gas prices climbing again?\n\nGasoline prices rose 3.8% in February after four straight monthly declines. As spring draws closer, demand is rising and producers are switching to more expensive summer blends.\n\nWill food prices go down in 2024?\n\nGrocery prices were unchanged, lowering the annual increase to just 1% – the smallest since June 2021 – and providing consumers some relief from hefty price gains experienced over much of the past two years. The cost of commodities such as wheat, corn and soybeans generally have come down amid increased global production.\n\nBut the picture was mixed last month. Bread prices edged down 0.5%, pork fell 0.8% and chicken declined 1.3%.\n\nBut egg prices leaped 5.8% amid another avian flu outbreak, breakfast cereal rose 2%, and fish was up 0.4%.\n\nSome good news: Restaurant bills inched up just 0.1% after a flurry of sharper increases tied to big employee wage hikes in response to labor shortages.\n\nWhy is rent so high in the US right now?\n\nRent remains the biggest contributor to inflation, rising 0.5% in February after several smaller gains. That nudged down the annual rise to a still elevated 5.8% from 6.5%. Economists expect rent increases to moderate, based on new leases, but that has filtered through to existing leases far more gradually than anticipated.\n\nThe price of some other services also kept climbing in February. Airline fares jumped 3.6%. Car insurance rose nearly 1% and is up 20.6% over the past year. And car repair costs increased 0.4%.\n\nAnd while goods prices generally have been softening, some costs rose unexpectedly last month. Used car prices increased by 0.5% and apparel, by 0.6%. Other products continued their descent amid improved supply chains, with furniture and bedding prices slipping 0.7% and appliances sliding 0.9%.\n\nAmong voters, Democrats are more upbeat about the economy\n\nInflation has been a major worry for many Americans, but a growing number have recently begun to feel more positive about the economy according to a poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College.\n\nThe survey, taken in late February, found 26% of registered voters nationwide felt the economy was good or excellent, a six percentage point jump from July. The increased optimism was most common among older Democrats.\n\nPresident Joe Biden still faces significant backlash over inflation from voters, and a slower-than-anticipated return to normal price increases could hurt his reelection chances.\n\nIn a statement after the release of Tuesday's index report, Biden said, \"Inflation is down two-thirds from its peak and annual core inflation is the lowest since May 2021. Wages are rising faster than prices over the last year and since the pandemic.\"\n\nHowever, he added, \"As I said in my State of the Union, we have more to do to lower costs and give the middle class a fair shot.\" He said the federal budget he proposed Monday would address inflation by lowering prescription drug costs and rent, among other measures.\n\nBiden’s top economic adviser said the question of affordability will be a top priority for the president.\n\n“It is going to center on health care. It's going to center on housing. If you look in terms of the sources of affordability challenges, health care and housing are two of the biggest,\" Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, told USA TODAY on Tuesday. \"Of course, the president also is going to continue focusing on inflation at the grocery store where actually we saw prices being flat over the month.”\n\nIt's unclear how much Biden will benefit at the ballot box from improved inflation numbers. For example, although grocery prices overall have risen modestly in the past year, voters want lower prices at stores, says Gabriel Mathy, an economic professor at American University.\n\n\"As Trump was president in a period of low inflation before the pandemic, voters may feel some nostalgia for the prices we saw when he was president,\" Mathy added.\n\nAnd most voters' perceptions of the economy are influenced more by their partisan leanings than objective economic data, says Todd Belt, director of the political management program at George Washington University.\n\nBut Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, says Biden's argument for reelection will strengthen among independent voters if inflation numbers continue to improve in coming months.\n\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/17/food-banks-see-worst-rate-of-hunger/71505220007/", "title": "Food banks need your help.

The level of hunger is so great, some food bank CEOs compare the current moment to past economic recessions.\n\n“From where I’m sitting, after 28 years of food banking, what we have is the logical result of 40 years of dire economic inequality,\" said Susannah Morgan, president of Oregon Food Bank.\n\nFood bank budgets have been buckling under inflation in 2023, causing some nonprofits to buy less food and cut back on services.\n\nData released this fall from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed food insecurity increased in 2022 for the first time in more than a decade.\n\n\"This is the worst rate of hunger in my career,\" said Morgan, who has worked at food banks in Boston, San Francisco and Anchorage, Alaska. “It’s so large, it’s hard to wrap your head around.\"\n\nHolidays bring extra pressure\n\nDuring the holidays, parents, and especially moms, feel even more pressure to provide for their families, said Eric Cooper, CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank.\n\n\"The last year they’ve been falling behind,\" Cooper said, and when around 300 families left the San Antonio Food Bank with turkeys in-hand this month, he said, they felt \"reassurance\" that they could create positive memories during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nSo many parents recall holiday memories of their own, laden with the aromas of turkey and gravy, said Sherrie Tussler, CEO of Wisconsin's Hunger Task Force food bank network.\n\n\"All of us have these memories,\" Tussler said. \"We can see our parents cutting the food. We can taste it. We can see our grandma cutting a pie.\"\n\nWhen people can't afford all the ingredients that go into making a special holiday meal, \"that makes you sad – sadder than sad,\" she said.\n\nBehind the scenes, food bank staff and volunteers feel \"a lot of pressure at this time of year,\" as they frantically purchase turkeys and other food items to help satisfy the country's gaping need, Tussler said.\n\n“I don’t know if we can keep up,\" Morgan said. \"We’re going to keep up for the next six or nine months, but in three years, I don’t know if we can keep up.”\n\nHow can I donate food?\n\nDonating money or nonperishable food to food banks, pantries and soup kitchens in your local area or neighborhood will go a long way to bolster their budgets and allow them to help more people, Tussler said.\n\nThe more localized the organization is, the better, she said, explaining that smaller nonprofits have smaller budgets and less resources to begin with.\n\nNear Fort Myers, Florida, the Gladiolus Food Pantry this month is asking for donated frozen turkeys, stuffing, mashed potatoes, canned or jarred gravy, cranberry sauce, canned green beans, canned corn and chicken or beef broth.\n\nThe food pantry serves over 200 families living in Lee County once a week. Many are still recovering from tourism industry jobs lost to Hurricane Ian. In the past month, 40 new families came each week, said staffer Mary Burns.\n\n\"When you go into the supermarket and they're having a buy-one-get-one, get them. That way you can use one, and donate one,\" Burns said. \"Drive around your neighborhood and look for the signs that say, 'food pantry here on Sunday,' and see how you can help your neighborhood.\"\n\nYear-round, the pantry always needs food and kitchen items that people normally don't think of, and things that kids enjoy, Burns said, especially:\n\nKids cereal.\n\nShelf-stable milk that doesn't need to be refrigerated until after its open, like Parmalat, and some nut milks.\n\nCooking oil.\n\nPeanut butter and jelly.\n\nSpices.\n\nTuna.\n\nMacaroni-and-cheese.\n\nSpaghetti.\n\nCan openers.\n\nLocal news organizations, such as newspapers or radio stations, may have articles online listing different food banks and pantries in your area. Donating to church food pantries is also a great way to get started.\n\nThe homepage for FoodPantries.org lists tens of thousands of food banks across the country where users can search by state and city. The USDA's website lists more than 250 of the agency's eligible distributors here.\n\nFood bank demand points to economic problems\n\nIn Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, Tussler's network of 47 food pantries are an economic bellwether, she said.\n\n\"Right now, the numbers just look bad,\" she said.\n\nThis year across Milwaukee County, food pantries saw a 50% increase in visits after extra pandemic-era SNAP allotments ended in Wisconsin in March. During the same time period, and with the same SNAP cut-off, Morgan's food bank network in Oregon saw the same: a 50% spike in demand, she said.\n\nThose increases, combined with inflationary pressures on food banks mean the nonprofits are \"having to ration the food they provide because they see how long the line is,\" Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America, told USA TODAY.\n\nIn Oregon, Morgan said she worries how much longer current patterns can continue before something in the system breaks completely.\n\n“I worry about a vicious cycle,\" she said. \"I worry about 40 years of income inequality hitting a place where it’s very difficult for us to recover from – hitting an irreversible trend.”\n\nDonations, government resources dropped in 2023\n\nFood bank leaders said monetary donations from the public swelled in 2020 and 2021 during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. It felt like a moment when the nation came together to help those most in need, Tussler said.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, stimulus checks and the expanded child tax credit helped bring poverty in the U.S. to record lows. But when government resources began drying up in 2022, poverty rates swung back in the opposite direction.\n\nNow, food pantries across the country are getting less monetary donations from the public because everyone is feeling inflation's pinch too, Babineaux-Fontenot said.\n\nDue to the national health emergency in 2020 and 2021, the federal government flooded food banks with food commodities through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\nThis year, it feels like \"there is no additional food coming from the federal government,\" Tussler said, which is \"exacerbating some of the challenges we have.\"\n\n\"It's the perfect storm of things dragging things down,\" Babineaux-Fontenot said.\n\nOn the East Coast, the Food Bank for New York City had to scale back its longstanding low-income tax-refund filing assistance program due to budget constraints, said Zac Hall, who runs programs at the nonprofit.\n\n\"We weren't naïve to think the amount of support we received during COVID would be sustained, but the demand has still not gone back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hall said.\n\nIn the Alamo City, Cooper gave the same answer: “The need has stayed up and the support, year over year, has been shrinking.\"\n\nInflation hasn't eased for food prices\n\nAfter inflation peaked in June 2022, high prices have come down a little in 2023. But unlike most other consumer categories, inflation in grocery prices has remained stubbornly high.\n\nBecause a greater share of poor Americans' income is spent at the grocery store, inflationary food prices take a heavier toll on their budgets, Hall said, adding that seniors he works with have to decide between paying for medicine and procedures or having meals.\n\n\"Those are really hard and inhumane decisions to be made, and that's not something that we want to see be sustained,\" Hall said.\n\nIn San Antonio, Cooper said families he serves routinely report they can't afford apples, berries and tomatoes. When that happens, he said, people buy more of cheaper items that aren't as healthy.\n\n\"We’re still at such a high rate of inflation on so many food categories that diets have shifted,” Cooper said. “Families tend to move into more boxed dinners, carbs, starches, cheaper belly-fillers.\"\n\nPeople can improvise to save money at the grocery store, but other areas of a family's budget, like housing and gas, are much more fixed, he said.\n\n\"For every household budget, rent eats first,\" Cooper said.\n\nAmong other factors, food insecurity can be measured by lack of variety in one's diet, according to the USDA. In 2022, more Americans reported eating lower quality diets or skipping meals entirely, the agency reported.\n\nFood stamp program needs to be strengthened, food banks say\n\nFood banks can only support struggling Americans so much, because getting a bag of groceries is not the same as putting money in someone's pocket who needs it, Hall said.\n\n\"We are not a replacement for SNAP,\" he said. \"SNAP is the largest and best anti-hunger program we have in the country.\"\n\nCooper calls SNAP \"our nation's first line of defense\" against hunger, one that helps families in a direct way, while also filling some gaps food banks will never be able to satisfy.\n\n“It’s so dignifying for a family to be able to go to their grocery store and select the items that are culturally relevant,\" Cooper said. \"And it accommodates religious preferences.\"\n\nThis fall, as Congress delays talks on the Farm Bill, which funds SNAP, Babineaux-Fontenot said lawmakers shouldn't be allowed to get away with adding restrictions to funding meant for the most vulnerable in society.\n\n\"Isn't it remarkable that in the middle of a pandemic with supply chain crises and all that was going on, that we actually saw a decrease in food insecurity rates,\" she said. \"Let's not trick ourselves into believing we don't know that we know how to do this.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/08/10/cpi-report-live-updates-july/70544196007/", "title": "CPI data shows inflation edges higher in July", "text": "Inflation picked up in July, breaking a 12-month streak of slowing consumer price increases and underscoring that the rest of the battle to tame a historic spike in consumer costs could be more challenging.\n\nLast month, another decline in used car prices costs offset a further surge in rent.\n\nWhat is the current inflation rate?\n\nConsumer prices overall increased 3.2% from a year earlier, up from 3% in June, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index, a measure of goods and services prices across the economy. That rise in inflation was largely due to a technicality in the calculation of yearly price gains.\n\nIs inflation going down?\n\nThe small uptick still marks a significant pullback from June 2022, when annual inflation peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1%. The acceleration in yearly price increases was mainly due to the fact that inflation already had cooled some by July 2022 and so the gap in prices between that month and July 2023 was larger.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose a modest 0.2% following a similar increase in June.\n\nStill, the report points to a more gradual descent in inflation in the months ahead. Because of a projected rise in energy prices, Barclays expects annual inflation to end the year roughly unchanged at 3.2%.\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\n\"Inflation is cooling, but the path down is still expected to be bumpy and littered with potholes,\" says Diane Swonk, chief economist of KPMG Economics.\n\nMore critically, core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items and which the Federal Reserve watches more closely, are still elevated. They rose by a measured 0.2%, the same as in June. Yet that left the annual increase at 4.7%, down just slightly from June’s 4.8% increase and well above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nBroadly, prices for goods, such as used cars and furniture, have declined recently as pandemic-related supply chain snarls have resolved. But the cost of services, such as rent, car repairs, auto insurance and haircuts have risen briskly.\n\nWill there be more rate hikes in 2023?\n\nThe Fed is especially concerned about the cost of services, excluding housing, which are tied closely to wage growth. Pay increases remain strong and the Fed believes it can help contain them by raising interest rates to cool the labor market.\n\nWhile services inflation has eased recently, Barclays says that’s largely because of drops in hotel rates and airfares, which are volatile. Air fares have fallen in part because of lower jet fuel costs.\n\nAs a result, the research firm believes the Fed will decide to raise its key interest rate once more by the end of the year after hiking rates by more than 5 percentage points in 15 months. Other economists say there has been enough progress in the inflation fight for the Fed to hold rates steady.\n\n\"Overall, there’s nothing here to suggest the Fed needs to push ahead with further interest rate hikes this year,\" says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.\n\nWill rent go down in 2023?\n\nThe cost of housing again was the biggest driver of inflation, though the increases have slowed a bit. Rent picked up a solid 0.4% in July but that’s down from a flurry of stronger increases. Annually, rent eased to 8%. Economists expect rent increases to downshift substantially, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.\n\nMeanwhile, auto insurance costs are up 17.8% from a year ago, and car repair prices rose 12.7% annually.\n\nMore encouraging was a 1.3% drop in used car prices. They generally have been on a downward trend and costs are down 5.6% yearly after a sharp pandemic-related run-up. New car prices dipped 0.1% and largely have been stable in recent months.\n\nAirline fares tumbled 8.1%, largely on lower jet fuel prices, and are down 18.6% yearly, though that trend is likely to reverse now that fuel costs are headed higher. Hotel rates dipped 0.3%. Furniture prices fell 2.8% from a year earlier.\n\nWill Social Security checks get a bump?Social Security COLA 2024 estimate didn't increase with CPI report. Seniors still struggle.\n\nAre food prices going to go down in 2023?\n\nGrocery prices rose more sharply after a string of smaller increases or declines, climbing 0.3%. That still pushed down the yearly increase to 3.6%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn had been falling because of easing global demand.\n\nLast month, the price of rice and bread both rose 0.9%, uncooked ground beef jumped 1.5% and cookies increased 0.8%.\n\nBut chicken and fish prices both slid 1.1%, bacon was down 0.7% and eggs declined 2.2%. That’s the fifth straight monthly decline for eggs after a string of sharp bird flu-related increases, and costs are now down 13.7% over the past year.\n\nRestaurant prices, meanwhile, rose more modestly after several large increases tied in part to rapidly rising wages sparked by labor shortages. Costs to dine out are up 7.1% over the past year.\n\nWill gas keep getting more expensive?\n\nGas prices edged up 0.2% in July and are down 19.9% from a year earlier. Pump prices are well off their $5 peak a year ago but are expected to move higher this year on a brighter global economic outlook and OPEC oil production cutbacks. Nationally, regular unleaded gasoline averaged $3.82 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.54 a month ago.\n\nS&P 500\n\nStocks were up modestly in mid-day trading following the CPI report, paring earlier gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.18%, while the S&P 500 increased 0.23% and the NASDAQ climbed 0.16%.\n\nCurious about inflation? We've got you covered.\n\nUSA TODAY explores the questions you and others ask about inflation and how it affects your life, from \"What is inflation?\" to \"What happens during a recession?\" For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:\n\nMortgage rates today\n\nMortgage rates are staying about the same, with Thursday’s average 30-year fixed mortgage hovering at 7.40%, 15-year fixed mortgages averaging 6.69% and a 30-year jumbo home loan averaging 7.21%.\n\nGenerally, it’s roughly 20% more expensive to own a home than it was a year ago thanks to higher mortgage rates and sales prices.\n\nThe typical monthly mortgage payment for a homebuyer was $2,605 during the four weeks ending July 30, a $32 dip from July’s record high but a 19% increase as compared to a year earlier, according to a Friday report from real estate listing company Redfin.\n\ne Richmond Federal Reserve.\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nInflation is basically measured by comparing the current price of goods and services to their recent price history. Several government-released data sets help to determine those numbers.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, or CPI, is the primary gauge. It measures the costs of goods in an urban market, which represents more than 90% of Americans, and is issued each month by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe CPI looks at a ‘fixed basket’ of roughly 80,000 goods and services. What gets put into that basket depends on the Consumer Expenditures Survey which surveys consumers to figure out which goods are important. The primacy of those goods then sets their weight in the CPI. For instance, the price of gasoline, which is a key factor in many Americans’ cost of living, has a greater weight than most other items.\n\nThere’s another version of the CPI however. The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers is used to adjust tax brackets. That index notes the substitution of similar items, which often happens when prices rise amid inflation. That flexibility in which items are evaluated gives a more accurate snapshot of consumer spending and doesn’t overstate inflation.\n\nIs CPI the only measure of inflation the Federal Reserve considers?\n\nNo. The Fed’s favored inflation metric is actually the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE) from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. PCE also is split into headline and core, but it assesses a different basket of goods and services and polls a larger group of consumers.\n\nPCE looks at price changes for all direct and indirect consumer consumption, not just specifically what urban households are paying out of pocket like the CPI. For instance, CPI would only look at what urban households pay out of pocket for medical expenses, but PCE includes costs paid by employer-provided insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nPCE also factors in substitutions. “Thus, if the price of bread goes up, people buy less bread, and the PCE uses a new basket of goods that accounts for people buying less bread,” the Cleveland Fed said. “The CPI uses the same basket as before.”\n\nWhat is the wage growth rate?\n\nAverage hourly earnings increased 14 cents in July to $33.74, maintaining the annual wage increase at 4.4%. Pay hikes were over 5% in 2022, so wage increases have been slowing but they are still higher than the 3.5% rise the Federal Reserve would like to see at the most as it tries to lower inflation.\n\nCurrent unemployment rate\n\nThe U.S. continued to add more jobs in July, with the nation seeing 187,000 more positions despite steeper interest rates and inflation.\n\nThe jobless rate, determined by a different survey of households, ticked down slightly from 3.6% to 3.5%, according to the Labor Department.\n\nWhen is the next Fed interest rate decision?\n\nThe Fed’s meeting schedule is:\n\n◾ Sept. 19-20\n\n◾ Oct. 31/Nov. 1\n\n◾ Dec. 12-13\n\nWhat the Fed rate increases mean to credit card rates\n\nThe interest rates banks charge on their credit cards are connected to the prime rate. That, in turn, is largely pegged to the Fed funds rate.\n\nThere were limits set by state law in the late '70s and early '80s largely keeping credit card lenders from implementing an interest rate higher than 18%. In the mid-90s, with the prime rate ranging from 8% to 9%, credit card rates hovered at 15.5% to 16%.\n\nAs of last month, when the prime rate climbed to 8.25%, the average interest rate for a new credit card increased from 14.6% in February 2022 to 24.2% as of mid-July, said LendingTree. That's spiked monthly interest charges to $140 – roughly a $55 monthly increase – on the average American's $6,965 credit card balance.\n\nWhat's the difference between CPI and PPI?\n\nCPI gauges inflation as felt by consumers each day, while the PPI, or producer price index, measures the average shifts over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI, often referred to as wholesale price inflation, is measured at an earlier stage of the production and marketing cycle and does tend to impact CPI, according to th\n\nThere’s one more metric - ‘core inflation’ - which measures inflation but leaves out the costs of food and energy whose costs are more volatile.\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks generally pass on that additional cost, meaning it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow as rates rise on everything from adjustable-rate mortgages to credit cards. That makes the funds rate a key lever for the Federal Reserve to pull when it’s trying to control inflation.\n\nWhen rates rise and borrowing slows, an overheated economy cools down and that can put the brakes on the rate of price increases.\n\nU.S. inflation rate history\n\nThe inflation rate has tumbled, falling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June, 2022. But it remains above the 2% target favored by the Federal Reserve. Here's a snapshot of the U.S. inflation rate by month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\nJune 2022: 9.1%\n\nJuly 2022: 8.5%\n\nAug 2022: 8.3%\n\nSept 2022: 8.2%\n\nOct 2022: 7.7%\n\nNov 2022: 7.1%\n\nDec 2022: 6.5%\n\nJan 2023: 6.4%\n\nFeb 2023: 6.0%\n\nMar 2023: 5.0&\n\nApr 2023: 4.9%\n\nMay 2023: 4.0%\n\nJune 2023: 3.0%\n\nJuly 2023: 3.2%\n\nKey inflation report\n\nThe Federal Reserve decides whether to raise, lower or leave interest rates where they are based on achieving its twin goals of price stability and maximum employment. The CPI is a key measure the Fed uses to determine if prices are “stable.”\n\n\"CPI probably gets more press, in that it is used to adjust social security payments and is also the reference rate for some financial contracts,” the Cleveland Fed said.\n\nIn July, the Federal Reserve boosted its key interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years. It indicated another increase is a possibility even though inflation has been waning and is far below the four-decade peak it reached in June, 2022.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/04/10/cpi-report-march-inflation-data/73259923007/", "title": "In CPI report today, March data shows inflation rise", "text": "Inflation ran hot for a third straight month in March, raising questions about when the Federal Reserve will feel confident that price pressures are subdued and it can begin cutting interest rates.\n\nOverall prices increased 3.5% from a year earlier, up from 3.2% in February, driven largely by the rising cost of rent and gasoline, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. On a monthly basis, costs rose 0.4%, similar to the previous month.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items and are watched more closely by the Fed, increased 0.4% in line with February's rise. That kept the annual increase at 3.8%.\n\nIs inflation really going down?\n\nSince reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has slowed dramatically. But after rapid improvement in the fall, price increases have accelerated on a monthly basis to a range of 0.3% to 0.4% so far this year.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nProducts such as used cars, furniture and appliances have gotten less expensive as pandemic-induced supply bottlenecks have unwound, though goods prices jumped in February. But the cost of services such as rent, car insurance and transportation keep rising, in part, because pandemic-related pay increases have slowed only gradually as worker shortages have eased.\n\nIs inflation easing in your state?The 5 states with the highest inflation and the 5 with the lowest. See where yours ranks.\n\nBarclays expects the monthly price gains to slowly moderate, bringing down yearly inflation to 3% and core price increases to 3.1% by the end of the year – still well above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nAre interest rates going down in 2024?\n\nIn recent weeks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the uptick in prices in the first two months of the year could have been a blip and inflation is still heading toward the 2% target “on a sometimes bumpy path.”\n\nBut the larger-than-expected rise in March could set off more worries that market-friendly interest rate cuts will be pushed back, especially with the economy and labor market performing so robustly recently.\n\nThe futures market is now betting the Fed's first rate cut will be pushed back to September, with the Fed lowering rates just twice this year. It had been predicting the first cut in June and a total of three decreases in 2024, in line with Fed officials' median estimate last month.\n\nIn a note to clients Wednesday, economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics wrote, \"The third consecutive 0.4% (monthly) rise in core CPI pretty much kills off hopes of a June rate cut.\"\n\nAnd Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide's chief economist, said the report \"will undermine Fed officials’ confidence that inflation is on a sustainable course back to 2% and likely delays rate cuts to September at the earliest and could push off rate reductions to next year.”\n\nSince March 2022, the Fed has hiked its benchmark short-term rate from near zero to a 22-year high of 5% to 5.25% to tame inflation, though officials have paused since July. Higher rates increase consumer and business borrowing costs and tend to curtail economic activity.\n\nWhat is the US stock market doing right now?\n\nStock prices weakened in response to the higher inflation rate. As of 10:45 a.m. EDT, the S&P 500 fell 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.84% as investors grew concerned that expected interest-rate cuts may come later than hoped. Prices for 10-year Treasury bonds, which are sensitive to inflation, fell and pushed up their yields to 3.1%.\n\nInflation is shaping up a key issue in the presidential election. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the latest numbers show that while inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak, more still must be done to lower costs.\n\n“Prices are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago,\" Biden said.\n\nWhat is the reason for gas prices rising again?\n\nGasoline prices rose 1.7% in March, the second increase after four straight monthly declines. The Russia-Ukraine war has constrained Russian crude oil supplies. And demand is picking up as the spring driving season gears up and producers are switching to more expensive summer blends.\n\nWill rent go down in 2024?\n\nTogether, the cost of housing and gas accounted for more than half the monthly increase in overall prices\n\nRent increased 0.4% in March, easing slightly from the prior month but the latest in a flurry of hefty gains. That nudged down the annual rise to a still elevated 5.7% from 5.8%. Economists expect rent increases to moderate, based on new leases, but that has filtered through just gradually to existing leases.\n\nThe cost of some other services also kept drifting higher. Medical care increased 0.6%; car repairs, 1.7%; and auto insurance, 2.6%. Airfares, though slipped 0.4% on falling jet fuel prices.\n\nMore encouraging: Some goods prices dropped, with used cars falling 1.1%, new vehicles edging down 0.2% and appliances dipping 0.7%. Apparel prices, though, rose 0.7% and furniture increased 0.3%.\n\nAre food prices going up or down?\n\nGrocery prices were unchanged for a second month, nudging up the annual increase to a still modest 1.2% and providing consumers continued relief from big price gains during the pandemic.\n\nBreakfast cereal prices fell 1.6%, bread slid 0.9% and cookies dropped 1.2%.\n\nBut proteins generally climbed. The cost of uncooked ground beef increased by 0.7%, bacon jumped by 0.9% and eggs surged by 4.6% amid another bird flu outbreak.\n\nContributing: Michael Collins", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/10/12/september-cpi-report-live-updates/71141644007/", "title": "CPI data showed inflation stayed high in September as rent climbed", "text": "Inflation is headed in the right direction but the road remains bumpy.\n\nConsumer price increases stayed high in September after picking up over the summer as steady gains in rent and other services offset another decline in used car prices and a smaller rise in gasoline and food costs.\n\nInflation data this week\n\nPrices overall rose 3.7% from a year earlier, similar to August's increase, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4% following a 0.6% rise in August that was fueled by a surge in pump prices.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items and which the Federal Reserve watches more closely as it weighs interest rate changes, remained high. They rose 0.3% last month after 0.2% bumps over the summer. The advance still lowered the annual increase to 4.1% from 4.3% in August, marking the smallest gain since September 2021.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nHow long will it take for inflation to go down?\n\nAnnual inflation has slowed significantly after hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, including a sharp drop to 3% in the first half of 2023. But since then, the cost of some goods and services has accelerated or pulled back more slowly, pushing up the yearly rise.\n\nPrices for items such as used cars and furniture have dropped as pandemic-related supply-chain snarls have been resolved. But the cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance, have continued to drift higher in part because of briskly rising employee wages.\n\nAs a result, driving down inflation to the Fed’s annual 2% target is becoming a tougher slog. Barclays expects inflation broadly to dip to 3.3% in December and 2.6% at the end of 2024. Core price gains are projected to drift down to 3.7% at the end of the year and 2.8% at the close of 2024.\n\nWill the Fed raise rates again?\n\nBarclays expects the Fed to raise its key interest rate once more this year, by a quarter percentage point, after lifting it by 5.25 points in 16 months.\n\nBut other economists say tumbling wholesale costs will prompt a faster pullback in inflation.\n\n\"Overall, there is nothing here that will convince Fed officials to hike rates at the next...meeting, and we continue to expect a more rapid decline in inflation and weaker economic growth to result in rates being cut much more aggressively next year than markets are pricing in,\" says economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.\n\nHow did the Dow Jones react?\n\nStocks were mixed in late morning trading as investors digested the uncertain odds of another Fed rate increase. The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 70 points, or 0.21% while the S&P 500 index was up 2 points or 0.05%.\n\nHouseholds, meanwhile, are still struggling. Although price increases are moderating, costs are still high and many Americans say they aren’t feeling much relief.\n\nStanley Novack, 78, of Valencia, California, says he’s most frustrated by high gas and grocery costs. “It’s out there, wherever you go,” says Novack, who is semi-retired and works part-time as a hotel and restaurant consultant. “We’re not seeing it easing at all.”\n\nHe says he pays $6.50 a gallon for gas in California and as much as $135 for weekly groceries for him and his wife, up from $100 before the pandemic. “You just have to deal with it,” he says.\n\nWill gas be cheaper in the future?\n\nGasoline prices rose 2.1% in September after surging 10.6% the previous month and they’re up 3% from a year earlier. Pump prices are well below their $5 peak in summer 2022 and are likely to move lower in the short term following the busy summer driving season despite the Israel-Hamas war, which has pushed up oil prices.\n\nAre food prices declining?\n\nGrocery prices rose more modestly, inching up 0.1% and lowering the yearly increase to 2.4%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn generally have fallen as major producers Ukraine and Russia have found alternative shipping routes that skirt their 18-month war.\n\nLast month, the price of breakfast cereal fell 0.5%, while rice and fish both slid 1.3%.\n\nBut some proteins moved higher. Bacon rose 4.8% following a 4% rise in August; uncooked ground beef increased 0.6%; and eggs jumped 0.9% after a string of declines.\n\nWill rent go down in 2024?\n\nRent, which has been the biggest inflation driver, rose a sturdy 0.5% for the second straight month, though that’s down from a spate of stronger gains. That nudged up the yearly rise to 7.4%. Economists expect rent increases to pull back, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.\n\nGenerally, the pattern of rising service costs fueled by healthy wage growth and falling goods prices continued last month.\n\nCar repair costs rose 0.2%; auto insurance climbed 1.3%; and hotel rates leaped 3.7%. A key measure of service costs, excluding housing, that the Fed is following closely jumped 0.6%, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic\n\nMeanwhile, used car prices fell 2.5%; clothing dropped 0.8%; and furniture declined 1.2% as supply chain troubles eased further.\n\nDo I really need that?How American consumers are tightening purse strings amid inflation\n\nCurious about inflation? We've got you covered.\n\nUSA TODAY explores the questions you and others ask about inflation and how it affects your life, from \"What is inflation?\" to \"What happens during a recession?\" For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:\n\nCOLA 2024\n\nSocial Security recipients will get 3.2% more in their checks next year, a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, based on Thursday's consumer price report showing that annual overall inflation remained at the same level as the previous month.\n\nThe 3.7% rise in overall prices is nearly twice the 2% target favored by the Federal Reserve. But inflation has been mostly trending down, leading to the modest Social Security COLA increase.\n\nWhat’s the difference between CPI and PCE?\n\nMajor differences, according to the Cleveland Fed, are:\n\nBoth indexes calculate the price level by pricing a basket of goods, but their baskets aren’t the same.\n\nCPI is based on a survey of what households are buying; the PCE is based on surveys of what businesses are selling.\n\nCPI only covers out-of-pocket expenditures on goods and services purchased. It excludes other expenditures that are not paid for directly, for example, medical care paid for by employer-provided insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. These are, however, included in the PCE.\n\nPCE accounts for substitutions, which happens when consumers trade down or buy less during times of high inflation. For example, if the price of bread goes up, people buy less bread, and the PCE uses a new basket of goods that accounts for people buying less bread. The CPI uses the same basket as before.\n\nCPI tends to run “hotter,” or higher, than PCE.\n\nHow many times has the Fed raised rates?\n\nThe Fed raised its key rate at 10 meetings in a row starting in March 2022, the most aggressive run of rate hikes in four decades. It paused that streak in June, leaving the benchmark federal funds rate where it stood, but implemented another increase the following month lifting the rate by a quarter point to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other for overnight loans. If that rate rises, banks typically pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive to borrow as rates increase on services and items ranging from credit cards to home equity lines. That’s why the funds rate is the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve to try and put the brakes on inflation.\n\nWhen it costs more to borrow, businesses and consumers are less inclined to do it, and that means an overheated economy can cool and price increases may slow.\n\nWhen is the next Fed meeting 2023?\n\nThe Fed’s policy arm meets next on Oct. 31-Nov. 1. It will announce its interest rate decision at 2 P.M. ET on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Fed’s final meeting of the year is Dec. 12-13.\n\nU.S. inflation rate by month\n\nThe inflation rate has plunged, tumbling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June, 2022. But it’s still above the 2% target preferred by the Federal Reserve. Here's where the U.S. inflation rate has stood each month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\nJune 2022: 9.1%\n\nJuly 2022: 8.5%\n\nAug 2022: 8.3%\n\nSept 2022: 8.2%\n\nOct 2022: 7.7%\n\nNov 2022: 7.1%\n\nDec 2022: 6.5%\n\nJan 2023: 6.4%\n\nFeb 2023: 6.0%\n\nMar 2023: 5.0&\n\nApr 2023: 4.9%\n\nMay 2023: 4.0%\n\nJune 2023: 3.0%\n\nJuly 2023: 3.2%\n\nAugust 2023: 3.7%\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve watches two key measures of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, which are its main considerations in interest-rate decisions. The CPI gives the Fed guidance to assess whether prices are “stable.’’\n\nCPI is also used to inflation-adjust things like Social Security payments and income tax brackets. It’s also the reference rate for some financial contracts, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices leave out volatile food and energy items and therefore are a more accurate reflection of longer-term trends.\n\nWhere should we expect tamer prices?\n\nSeptember used car prices likely fell at least 2% from the prior month, while energy prices recorded a modest increase of 0.4% after a 5.6% jump in August, said Stephen Juneau, U.S. economist at Bank of America. Retail gasoline prices, he said, were nearly flat last month.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists forecast a 2.3% decline in used car prices and a 0.1% dip in new car prices last month.\n\nWhat prices are still rising a lot?\n\nRenters are still getting squeezed. Goldman Sachs economists see rents up 0.48% on the month, rising at about a steady pace. Shelter inflation, which includes home prices, rents and other lodging, comprises about a third of the consumer price index (CPI). However, Goldman says\n\nAirfares are also expected to post a gain, some economists noted.\n\nWill the Fed raise rates again this year?\n\nIt depends on the data.\n\nThe CME Fed watch tool that helps gauge the market’s expectation for a rate move puts the chances of a Fed rate hike at only 10%, but economists aren’t yet fully ruling one out, partly because the labor market remains strong. A strong job market puts money in people’s pockets, which can fuel spending and inflation.\n\n“With the surprisingly-strong September job report intensifying the debate on the further hikes, the near-term policy trajectory will be highly sensitive to Thursday’s CPI,” Deutsche Bank economists said in a note.\n\nThe last time the Fed met in September, it held rates steady at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% but signaled another hike is likely this year amid still elevated inflation and a sturdy economy.\n\n“Broadly, stronger economic activity means we have to do more with rates,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters then.\n\nHe also said, separately, “we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks.”\n\nWhat's the difference between CPI and PPI?\n\nCPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers going about their day-to-day lives, while the PPI, or producer price index, measures the average changes over time in the sale prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI, often referred to as wholesale price inflation, is gleaned during an earlier phase of the production and marketing cycle and typically impacts CPI.\n\nCore inflation, which assesses inflation but leaves out the more volatile prices of food and energy, is the other key price metric.\n\n10-year Treasury yield\n\nIn bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield, which tends to rise if inflation accelerates, was 4.64%, up a modest 0.046 points.\n\n2024 COLA Watch\n\nSocial Security recipients found out Thursday how much of a raise they will get next year. That’s because the consumer price index report contains data the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses to determine the cost-of-living adjustment or COLA for 2024.\n\nThose payments will go up 3.2%.\n\nWhat is the current inflation rate?\n\nThe annual overall inflation rate is currently 3.7%, but is expected to have slid by a tenth of a point in September.\n\nInflation definition\n\nInflation is a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C. The cost of items and services ranging from health care, to gas, to groceries can shift depending on inflation.\n\nDemand pull inflation\n\nWhen there are too few goods to meet the demand, prices are likely to rise, according to Investopedia. That disparity is called demand pull inflation.\n\nInflation calculator\n\nThe Department of Labor has a tool that enables consumers to find out shifts in their buying power.\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) looks at the average change in prices for particular products and services over a period of time, according to the Bureau of Labor Services.\n\nIt’s one inflation measure that the Fed and the economist use as a barometer to gauge price stability. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The next PCE report for September is due Oct. 27.\n\nMark your calendar:Why October 12 matters for Social Security recipients\n\nWages vs. inflation:US wage growth is finally outpacing inflation.

That’s the smallest yearly increase since March 2021. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1% following a 0.4% increase in April.\n\n\"The embers of inflation keep fading,\" says Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nWhat is the difference between core CPI and CPI?\n\nCore prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items and better capture longer-term trends, have been tougher to tame. They rose 0.4% for the third-straight month. Still, that lowered the annual increase from 5.5% to 5.3%, the lowest since November 2021.\n\nHow long will the Fed keep raising rates?\n\nThe report presents a quandary for a Federal Reserve that’s expected Wednesday to pause its 14-month campaign of aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at corralling inflation to assess their economic impact. While price increases broadly have eased, the Fed is more concerned about stubbornly elevated core inflation.\n\nAs a result, some Fed officials have said they were leaning toward skipping a rate increase this week but hiking again in July.\n\nEconomist Jason Schenker of Prestige Economics says overall price increases slowed so substantially in May that the Fed will likely hold off further rate bumps this year. But noting persistent core price gains, Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics expects another hike in July.\n\nInflation rates by region\n\nStock markets\n\nStocks ended higher on Tuesday after the inflation report cemented Wall Street’s bets for the Fed to hold off on hiking interest rates this week.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed up 0.7%, ticking further into heights it hasn’t touched since April 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 0.4% higher, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 0.8%.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has been on a roll amid hopes the economy can avoid a severe recession and inflation will fall enough for the Fed to take it easier on its rate increases.\n\n10-year Treasury\n\nIn the bond market, yields initially dropped after the inflation report, but later recovered. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.83% from 3.74% late Monday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.\n\nWhat is the outlook for the price of gasoline?\n\nGas prices fell 5.6% in May and are down nearly 20% from a year earlier. Pump prices have been choppy but have remained relatively low amid lingering recession fears that have held down global oil demand and prices. Nationally, regular unleaded gasoline averaged $3.59 a gallon Monday, up from $3.54 a month ago but down from a peak of $5 in June 2022.\n\nWill food prices go down in 2023?\n\nGrocery prices edged up just 0.1% after two straight declines, pushing down the yearly increase to 5.8% from 7.1%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn has fallen in recent months because of easing global demand.\n\nIn May, the price of eggs dropped by a whopping 13.8%, the fourth straight monthly decline after a string of sharp bird flu-related increases, and costs are now down 0.4% over the past year. Bacon prices fell 1.3%; fish and seafood costs dipped 0.9%; and fresh biscuits, rolls and muffins were down 1.1%.\n\nBut some costs drifted higher. Bread prices rose 0.4% and are up 12.5% annually. Uncooked ground beef jumped 2% and chicken, 0.3%.\n\nRestaurant prices increased by 0.5% and are up 8.3% over the past year.\n\nWill rent go down in 2023?\n\nRent again was the biggest driver of inflation, though the increase has slowed somewhat. Rent picked up 0.5% for the third straight month, down from a string of stronger gains. Annually, rent was up 8.7%, down marginally from the previous month. Economists expect rent increases to ease substantially, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.\n\nUsed car prices jumped 4.4% for the second straight month as a flurry of wholesale cost increases have finally showed up in retail prices but they’re still down 4.2% yearly. Prices had been tumbling after a pandemic-related run-up that pushed up costs by about a third. New car prices ticked down 0.1%.\n\nAnd apparel prices increased 0.3% for the third straight month.\n\nSome goods prices softened as COVID-related supply-chain snarls continued to resolve. New car prices fell 0.1%. Furniture and bedding costs were down 0.5% and appliance prices declined 0.3%.\n\nAnd some services became a bit less pricey despite Americans' return to pre-COVID travel and other activities. Airline fares fell 3% and hotel rates slid 1.8%. Medical care services dipped 0.1% and have declined for several months.\n\nTo hike or not hike:Fed likely to refrain from rate increase on Wednesday but signal it's not done, economists say.\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve makes interest-rate decisions based on achieving its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. The Fed looks at CPI as one measure to gauge if prices are “stable” even though its stated inflation goal is PCE around 2%.\n\n\"CPI probably gets more press, in that it is used to adjust social security payments and is also the reference rate for some financial contracts,” the Cleveland Fed said.\n\nThe Fed's next policy meeting ends on Wednesday, June 14. That afternoon, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision and issue a summary of economic projections of what it expects inflation, employment, interest rates, and economic growth to be in coming years. Most economists expect the Fed to keep rates steady Wednesday but project at least one more rate increase this year.\n\nWhat is the U.S. inflation rate by month?\n\nThe Inflation rate has gone down, falling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June of last year. Here's a look at the U.S. inflation rate in the U.S. by month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\n8.6% June 2022: 9.1%\n\n9.1% July 2022: 8.5%\n\n8.5% Aug 2022: 8.3%\n\n8.3% Sept 2022: 8.2%\n\n8.2% Oct 2022: 7.7%\n\n7.7% Nov 2022: 7.1%\n\n7.1% Dec 2022: 6.5%\n\n6.5% Jan 2023: 6.4%\n\n6.4% Feb 2023: 6.0%\n\n6.0% Mar 2023: 5.0&\n\n5.0& Apr 2023: 4.9%\n\n4.9% May 2023: 4.0%\n\nIs CPI the only measure of inflation the Federal Reserve considers?\n\nNo. Actually, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE) from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. PCE also is broken into headline and core but measures a different basket of goods and services and includes a wider group of people surveyed.\n\nPCE measures price changes for all direct and indirect consumer consumption, not just literally what urban households are paying out of pocket like in CPI. For example, CPI would only capture what urban households pay out of pocket for medical expenses, but PCE includes costs covered by employer-provided insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nAlso, PCE accounts for substitutions. “Thus, if the price of bread goes up, people buy less bread, and the PCE uses a new basket of goods that accounts for people buying less bread,” the Cleveland Fed said. “The CPI uses the same basket as before.”\n\nCPI tends to run hotter than PCE.\n\nWhat was PCE in April?\n\nPCE prices rose 0.4% from March to April, compared with up 0.1% the previous month. Measured year over year, prices increased 4.4% in April, up from 4.2% in March. The year-over-year figure is down sharply from a 7% peak last June but far above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nCore PCE rose 0.4% from March to April, the same as in the previous month, and 4.7% from 12 months earlier. Year-over-year, the core PCE has changed little since it first touched 4.6% in December.\n\nHow Dow futures are trading before the CPI report?\n\nFutures tied to the broad stock market gauge, the S&P 500 index, were up 0.09% at 4,346.50 early Tuesday morning, while futures connected to the blue-chip Dow were down 0.02% at 34,077 and the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 traded up 0.3% at 14,843.25.\n\nWhat is CPI and what is core CPI?\n\nCPI, short for the consumer price index, is an inflation gauge prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics each month. It measures the average change over time of what urban consumers pay for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nThere are two main parts to CPI:\n\nHeadline, or overall, CPI Core CPI, which excludes the volatile energy and food sectors\n\n“Over the short term, the core measure may give a more accurate reading of where inflation is headed, but people do buy food, fill up their gas tanks, and heat their homes, so headline inflation more accurately represents people’s actual expenses,” according to the Cleveland Federal Reserve.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/business/grocery-prices-august/index.html", "title": "Food prices are still soaring. Here's what's getting more expensive ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation may be slowing, but food prices are still through the roof.\n\nFood costs spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAmericans browsing the supermarket aisle will notice most food items are far more expensive than they were a year ago. Egg prices soared 39.8%, while flour got 23.3% more expensive. Milk rose 17% and the price of bread jumped 16.2%.\n\nMeat and poultry also grew costlier. Chicken prices jumped 16.6%, while meats rose 6.7% and pork increased 6.8%. Fruits and vegetables together are up 9.4%.\n\nOverall, grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8%.\n\nEgg prices have soared over the past year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nWhy there’s no relief at the grocery store\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to tame inflation, but the central bank says that food prices are largely out of its control.\n\nThat’s because food prices are affected by global events, such as the war in Ukraine, which affects the costs of wheat and other commodities. Prices also reflect the impact of natural disasters like crop-killing droughts and diseases such as avian flu, which has constrained the supply of eggs and turkeys.\n\nPlus, it takes time for changes, such as decreases in ingredient prices, to funnel down to consumers. That means that relief from the surge grocery prices could lag declines in other areas.\n\nAnd demand for food isn’t flexible — consumers may be able to skimp on other items, such as clothing or gasoline, but they have to eat. Even so, shoppers are increasingly making changes to their diets and shopping habits to cope with rising costs.\n\nPeople are pulling back on certain items. Sales of frozen dinners and entrees have fallen about 11% by volume in August compared to the year prior, according to a report this week from IRI, a market research company. Cookie volumes and volumes of refrigerated juices fell nearly 9% and about 8%, respectively, in that period. Lower-income households in particular are skipping items like juice, snacks and candy.\n\nRecently, Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers, who may be trading down from more expensive restaurants. And Tyson (TSN) has noticed higher demand for chicken as shoppers buy fewer pricey steaks.\n\nWhat got more expensive\n\nThe seasonally adjusted prices of most grocery items ticked up from July to August, but there were some standouts.\n\nMargarine spiked the most, up 7.3%. Eggs were 2.9% more expensive and sugar was 2.4% higher, while flour and bread edged up 2.2%. Canned fruit prices rose 3.4% while fresh vegetables got 1.2% pricier.\n\nHot dog prices jumped 4.9%, while ham was up 1.3% and turkey rose 2.2%.\n\nSome meat prices fell, however. Bacon was .5% less expensive, while the price of pork roasts, steaks and ribs fell 1.9%.\n\nAnd some fruit prices moderated as well, with apples getting 2.3% cheaper and citrus fruits falling 1.6%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2023/07/12/june-cpi-report-live-updates/70399319007/", "title": "Inflation cools again in June as gains in grocery prices slow, CPI ...", "text": "A year after U.S. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1%, it has fallen by about two-thirds. But bringing down annual consumer price increases the rest of the way -- to the more normal 2% level sought by federal policymakers -- is expected to be a tougher slog.\n\nInflation cooled for a 12th straight month in June as flat grocery prices partly offset a rebound in gasoline costs and still-hefty rent hikes. Core inflation, which the Federal Reserve watches more closely, eased more than expected.\n\nConsumer prices overall increased 3% from a year earlier, down from 4% in May, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. That’s the smallest yearly increase since March 2021. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% following a 0.1% increase in May.\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items and better reflect longer-term trends, have been tougher to subdue. They rose by a smaller-than-expected 0.2% after a three-month spurt of slightly stronger gains. That pushed down the annual increase from 5.3% to 4.8, the lowest since October 2021.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n\"Overall, while pockets of core price pressures remain, critical categories of inflation are slowly cooling,\" Contingent Macro Research wrote in a note to clients.\n\nBroadly, the inflation picture has been mixed. Prices for used cars and other goods have been inching up more slowly or even falling as pandemic-related supply chain troubles have eased. But the cost of services such as haircuts and auto repairs have continued to advance crisply as wages have climbed amid COVID-induced labor shortages\n\nHow much longer will the Fed raise rates?\n\nDespite the significant easing of core inflation, most economists reckon it won’t be enough for the Federal Reserve, which watches that key price measure more closely. As a result, forecasters expect the Fed to raise interest rates again this month after pausing in June to assess the economic impact of its aggressive hiking campaign since early 2022. But the pullback in core price increases could prompt the Fed to hold rates steady for the rest of the year.\n\nTough choices:How people are 'barely making it' work as prices soar.\n\nWhat is the outlook for gasoline prices?\n\nGas prices rose 0.8% in June but are down 26.8% from a year earlier. Pump prices have been volatile but stayed relatively low amid lingering recession fears that have curtailed global oil demand and prices. Nationally, regular unleaded gasoline averaged $3.54 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.59 a month ago but down from a peak of $5 in June 2022.\n\nS&P 500\n\nWall Street returned to its highest level in more than a year on Wednesday after investors saw that inflation continued to ease. The S&P 500 rose 32.90, or 0.7% to 4,472.16 to reach its strongest closing level since April 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 86.01, or 0.3%, to 34,347.43, and the Nasdaq composite gained 158.26, or 1.2%, to 13,918.96.\n\nHigh inflation has been at the center of Wall Street’s problems because it’s driven the Fed to jack up interest rates at a blistering pace. Higher rates undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices, and they’ve already caused damage to the banking, manufacturing and other industries.\n\nAre food prices going to down in 2023?\n\nGrocery prices were unchanged in June after either falling or rising modestly in the previous three months. That pushed down the yearly increase to 4.7% from 5.8%. The cost of commodities such as wheat and corn has fallen in recent months because of easing global demand.\n\nLast month, the price of eggs dropped by 7.3% following a 13.8% tumble in May. That’s the fourth straight monthly decline after a string of sharp bird flu-related increases, and costs are now down 7.9% over the past year. Bacon prices fell 1.7%; cookies dipped 0.7%; and fresh biscuits, rolls and muffins were slipped 0.1%.\n\nBut some costs edged higher. Breakfast cereal rose 1.1%. Bread prices ticked up 0.7% and are up 11.5% annually. Uncooked ground beef jumped 1.6% and chicken, 0.6%.\n\nRestaurant prices have not pulled back as much, largely because of rapidly rising wages sparked by labor shortages. Costs to dine out increased by 0.4% and are up 7.7% over the past year.\n\nWill rent go down in 2023?\n\nThe cost of housing again was the biggest driver of inflation, though the increases have slowed somewhat. Rent picked up a solid 0.5% following several similar gains but that’s down from a flurry of stronger increases. Annually, rent was up 8.3%, down from 8.7% the previous month. Economists expect rent increases to ease substantially, based on new leases, but that shift has been slow to filter through to existing leases.\n\nMeanwhile, apparel prices rose 0.3%, car repair costs rose 1.3% and auto insurance prices leaped 1.7%.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, used car prices fell 0.5%, resuming a downward trend after a spurt of increases, and costs are down 5.2% yearly. Prices had been tumbling after a pandemic-related run-up that pushed up costs by about one-third. New car prices were unchanged after dipping in the previous two months.\n\nAirline fares slid 8.7%, largely on lower jet fuel prices, and are down 18.9% yearly. Hotel rates dipped 2%, reversing May’s rise. Appliance prices, which have been falling in recent months, declined another 1%.\n\nThe Fed is especially focused on lowering price increases for services, excluding housing, which are driven by wage gains and have remained stubbornly high even as other categories have moderated. That measure was unchanged in June and rose 4.1% annually, down from 4.6% the previous month, according to an analysis of Labor's data by High Frequency Economics.\n\nCurious about inflation? We've got you covered.\n\nUSA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day. From \"What is inflation?\" to \"What happens during a recession?\" See our answers for more questions about today's inflation report and other economic trends that impact your life.\n\nWhat is the U.S. inflation rate by month?\n\nThe Inflation rate has gone down, falling by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June of last year. Here's a look at the U.S. inflation rate in the U.S. by month since May 2022:\n\nMay 2022: 8.6%\n\n8.6% June 2022: 9.1%\n\n9.1% July 2022: 8.5%\n\n8.5% Aug 2022: 8.3%\n\n8.3% Sept 2022: 8.2%\n\n8.2% Oct 2022: 7.7%\n\n7.7% Nov 2022: 7.1%\n\n7.1% Dec 2022: 6.5%\n\n6.5% Jan 2023: 6.4%\n\n6.4% Feb 2023: 6.0%\n\n6.0% Mar 2023: 5.0&\n\n5.0& Apr 2023: 4.9%\n\n4.9% May 2023: 4.0%\n\n4.0% June 2023: 3.0%\n\nHow is inflation measured?\n\nIn the most basic sense, inflation is measured by comparing the current price of goods and services against their recent history.\n\nThis is done by looking at a number of government-released data reports.\n\nThe CPI is the most prominent of these metrics. Released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index measures the prices of goods in an urban market, which represents over 90% of the American public.\n\nThe CPI looks at a ‘fixed basket’ of some 80,000 goods and services to come up with these numbers. What gets put in that basket depends on the Consumer Expenditures Survey which polls Americans to determine which goods are important. The importance of those goods then determines their weight in the CPI– for example, the price of something like gasoline, which forms an integral part of many people’s cost of living, will contribute more than other items.\n\nThe CPI does not just have one version though. Another version – the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers is used to adjust tax brackets. The virtue of the Chained CPI is that it takes into account the substitution of similar items, which happens often when prices go up amid inflation. In doing this, it provides a more accurate look at consumer spending and doesn’t overstate inflation.\n\nInflation can also be measured through the price index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). This metric, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, takes a more holistic view. Rather than calculating the change in prices for goods paid solely out of pocket for consumers, the PCE takes into account all expenses, including health care coverage compensated by insurance.\n\nThe Fed considers the PCE the gold standard for evaluating inflation. The central bank has a 2% inflation target.\n\nThe final piece of the equation is ‘core inflation,’ which measures inflation but doesn’t count prices for food and energy which are more volatile.\n\nHow does raising rates fight inflation?\n\nIn order to control inflation, one of the Federal Reserve's main tools is the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. If that rate goes up, banks generally pass on their additional cost.\n\nEven though the Fed does not directly control all interest rates in the country, when it raises the fed funds rate, other interest rates eventually follow, including those applied to adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards, home equity lines of credit, and other loans.\n\nHigher rates slow borrowing, cool off an overheated economy and ward off inflation spikes.\n\nWhat's the difference between CPI and PPI?\n\nCPI measures inflation as experienced by consumers each day, while PPI, or producer price index, measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI, often referred to as wholesale price inflation, is measured at an earlier stage of the production and marketing cycle and tends to influence CPI, according to the Richmond Federal Reserve.\n\n\"Movements in the PPI have long been viewed as reflecting pricing changes early in the pipeline, and some analysts believe that such upstream pricing changes could be an early signal of future movements in downstream consumer prices,\" Richmond Fed economists John O'Trakoun and David Ramachandran wrote last year.\n\nJune PPI is due at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time on Thursday.\n\nSo why is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve makes interest rate decisions based on achieving its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. The Fed looks at CPI as one measure to gauge if prices are “stable” even though its stated inflation goal is PCE around 2%.\n\n\"CPI probably gets more press, in that it is used to adjust social security payments and is also the reference rate for some financial contracts,” the Cleveland Fed said.\n\nThe Fed's next policy meeting ends on Wednesday, July 26. That afternoon, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision. Most economists expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point to bring its short-term benchmark fed funds rate up to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nIs CPI the only measure of inflation the Federal Reserve considers?\n\nNo. Actually, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE) from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. PCE also is broken into headline and core but measures a different basket of goods and services and includes a wider group of people surveyed.\n\nPCE measures price changes for all direct and indirect consumer consumption, not just literally what urban households are paying out of pocket like in CPI. For example, CPI would only capture what urban households pay out of pocket for medical expenses, but PCE includes costs covered by employer-provided insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nAlso, PCE accounts for substitutions. “Thus, if the price of bread goes up, people buy less bread, and the PCE uses a new basket of goods that accounts for people buying less bread,” the Cleveland Fed said. “The CPI uses the same basket as before.”\n\nCPI tends to run hotter than PCE.\n\nWhat was PCE in May?\n\nPCE prices rose 0.1% in May from April, compared with up 0.4% the previous month. Measured year over year, prices increased 3.8% in May, up from 4.3% in April. The year-over-year figure is down sharply from a 7% peak last June but far above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nCore PCE rose 0.3% in May from April and 4.6% from 12 months earlier. Year-over-year, the core PCE has changed little since it first touched 4.6% in December.\n\nFed rate hike: If inflation's easing, why does the Fed keep raising rates?\n\nThe Fed may be afraid inflation isn’t cooling fast enough. The labor market is weakening, but not enough to lower CPI’s services rate and achieve the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nLast month, the economy added 209,000 jobs and the jobless rate fell to 3.6%. Average hourly earnings rose 12 cents to $33.58, nudging up the yearly increase to 4.4% from 4.3% and way above the 3.5% or lower that the Fed sees as aligning with its 2% inflation target.\n\nIt’s important for the Fed to lower inflation because as it has said, “higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nStashing cash:Our family spent a month cash stuffing.

Recently, they’ve been relying mostly on one income. Their reduced earnings, coupled with inflation, have dealt a blow to their finances.\n\nAnd that has changed, radically, the way they eat. Altman is not alone in making big changes.\n\nWe asked CNN readers how inflation has impacted their eating habits, and many mentioned dining out less often, buying less meat and giving up splurges. Some said they are very worried about the future.\n\nFood prices have spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released in mid-September by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8% in that period.\n\nWith food prices soaring, people are changing how they shop and eat. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConsumers are responding by looking for deals and switching to generic brands, according to July data from the market research firm IRI. Companies like Tyson (TSN) have noticed customers are switching from beef to chicken, and Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers who are likely trading down from pricier restaurants. Some people may be dining out less often, or avoiding restaurants altogether.\n\nFor those who struggled to buy food even before prices shot up, rising costs could mean falling into food insecurity, a state of unreliable access to affordable food.\n\n“If food prices continue to increase at a rate that outpaces increases in wages, that is the inevitable consequence,” said Jayson Lusk, head of the agricultural economics department at Purdue University. “The last time we had a big run up in food insecurity rates was in the wake of the Great Recession.” Last year, about 10.2% of US households were food insecure, according to the USDA, slightly below the 10.5% rate in 2020 and 2019.\n\nEven for those not at risk of hunger, the surges in food prices are jarring.\n\nFood “matters a lot to our self esteem, our mood,” said William Masters, a professor at Tufts University’ school of nutrition science and policy who is also a member of the economics department faculty. “Not being able to buy the foods that people are used to — that your children are asking for, that your family wants — that’s a really hard thing,” he said. “Any disruption of habit is very, very hard.”\n\nGiving up on simple pleasures\n\nCarol Ehrman taking a Thai cooking class over Zoom during the pandemic. Courtesy Carol and Tommy Ehrman\n\nFor Carol Ehrman, cooking is a joyful experience.\n\n“I love to cook, it’s my favorite thing to do,” she said. She especially likes to cook Indian and Thai food, but stocking the spices and ingredients she needs for those dishes is no longer feasible. “When every ingredient has gone up, that adds up on the total bill,” she said.\n\n“What used to cost us $250 to $300 … is now $400.” Ehrman, 60, and her husband, 65, rely on his social security income, and the increase was stretching their budget. “We just couldn’t do that.”\n\nAbout six months ago, she realized she had to change the way she shops for groceries.\n\nIn an effort to bring their immediate costs down, Ehrman stopped shopping in bulk as often as she used to. Now, she hunts for sales, avoids buying beef, and opts for boxed wine instead of nice bottles when she buys wine at all. She’s also cooking simpler meals, and saying goodbye to dinner parties.\n\nEhrman haș even given up preparing basic items, like tomato sauce, because of the expense, opting instead for a pre-packaged version.\n\n“I know that I can make it much healthier,” she said. And “it always tastes so much better.” Those fresh ingredients are just too pricey now.\n\nEhrman’s husband is retired due to chronic health problems, and it’s been difficult for her to work because of her own health issues — she recently had pacemaker and heart catheterization procedures. The couple, who live in Billings, Montana, were frugal before the current spike in prices, enjoying simple pleasures. But now, even those are out of reach.\n\n“Before, we at least found joy in being home and having friends over and family over, cooking and sitting around the table and just being content,” she said. Now, “I’m not entertaining at all. It’s really sad.”\n\nFrom Coke to Pepsi\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Local markets, generic brands help family save money on groceries 01:25 - Source: CNN Business\n\nRick Wichmann, 64, and his wife have been dining out less often in recent years, due to the pandemic and in an effort to eat healthier. With menu prices rising because of inflation, they see no reason to change their habits.\n\n“Eating out is expensive,” he said, noting that he’s often happier with home-cooked meals than restaurant food anyway.\n\nBut grocery shopping is also more expensive. Over the past year, Wichmann noticed that he had been spending about 25% more shopping for groceries for himself, his wife and their son than he used to.\n\nTo help mitigate those costs, Wichmann, who lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, started going to different grocers. He avoids Whole Foods and Stop & Shop, opting instead for Costco and the local chain Market Basket.\n\nHe’s also switched to store brands, if he feels the quality is the same, and will sometimes choose products based on price rather than brand loyalty — like, for example, buying Pepsi when it’s cheaper, when he’d otherwise choose Coke.\n\nWichmann also pays attention to events like weather, and how they might affect prices. When he saw reports of a possible tomato shortage due to droughts in California, he took notice. The next time he saw tomato sauce on sale he stocked up on enough to last for months.\n\nA vegetable garden in the front lawn\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Turning to gardening to save money on food 01:33 - Source: CNN Business\n\nLike Wichmann, Jenni Wells, 38, pays attention to weather patterns and food systems. A former chef and rancher, she noticed price increases well before the current bout of inflation.\n\n“My alarm bells started going off for prices going up in 2019,” she said, when devastating floods in the midwest drowned livestock and destroyed grain stocks. Wells decided back then that she’d like to be more self sufficient.\n\n“I saw the food prices going up, and I realized that it was going to quickly overwhelm our budget,” she said. So in February, she ripped up the grass in the front lawn of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, which she shares with her husband and best friend, and planted a vegetable garden.\n\n“I just wanted to see what I could grow for myself,” she said. This year, she’s managed to grow broccoli, cauliflower, okra, tomatoes, peppers, squashes and more in her garden.\n\nThere are upfront and maintenance costs for the garden, of course. And it’s not easy to grow vegetables. But the household’s weekly grocery spending, excluding meat, has fallen from about $200 to $50, she said.\n\nWith the money left over, Wells and her household have been able to eat at restaurants, something that would have been “too much of a luxury” had they still been spending $200 a week on groceries. And there’s the satisfaction of growing your own food.\n\n“There’s a huge sense of reward,” she said. “I feel pride in every meal that I make with it.”\n\nChanging for good\n\nA recent weekly grocery haul for Lisa Altman. Courtesy Lisa Altman\n\nSome consumers have made changes because of current circumstances that they plan to hold onto.\n\nNow, Altman, the Austin parent of three, aims to keep her grocery bill to about $100 to $125 per week by buying store brands, lots of pasta and a limited amount of protein each week.\n\nInstead of ordering in or grilling steaks or ribs, Altman’s family eats more basic meals with smaller portions. “Now our meals consist of one primary dish, and that’s it, maybe some bread on the side, or a salad.” If they go out to eat, they’ll pick up a fast food meal with a few sides, like one burger and two fries, split the items and have beverages at home.\n\nWhen Altman is able to afford it, she’ll go back to buying more fruits and veggies. But she’s hoping some habits, like encouraging her children to avoid mindless eating and reducing food waste, will stick.\n\n“I’m not going to be spending $1,200 a month on groceries,” she said. “This has taught us that that’s not necessary.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/29/pce-inflation-report-february-fed-rate-impact/73133579007/", "title": "PCE inflation report: Key measure ticks higher for first time since ...", "text": "An annual inflation measure watched closely by the Federal Reserve crept higher in February, its first rise in five months and a sign the central bank could remain wary about cutting interest rates too soon.\n\nAn underlying gauge of price gains dipped but stayed elevated. And household spending surged more than expected, a development that could keep inflation higher for longer.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said last week the central bank would not overreact to disappointing inflation numbers so far this year, at least partly calming any jitters that could be set off by Friday’s report.\n\nConsumer prices overall increased 2.5% from a year earlier, above the 2.4% rise in January but well below the 40-year high of 7% in June 2022, according to the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. It marks the first time annual PCE inflation accelerated since September.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices increased 0.3%, down from a 0.4% jump the prior month, the PCE index shows. Both advances marked a notable pickup from a cooling trend late last year.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nWhat is the core PCE rate today?\n\nA measure of “core” prices that strips out volatile food and energy items and that the Fed tracks even more closely also rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, down from 0.5% in January but at a faster pace than in late 2023. That nudged down the annual increase to 2.8% from 2.9%, still above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nThe easing in core price gains is a positive and should help bolster the Fed's confidence that the surge in that measure in January was a blip, says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.\n\nIs US inflation still falling?\n\nInflation slowed dramatically last year as COVID-related supply chain snarls eased. But goods prices that had been tumbling rose in February. Meanwhile, the cost of services such as rent, car insurance and transportation keep rising sharply, in part because of healthy employee wage hikes.\n\nIn February, goods prices rose 0.5% with clothing up 1% and recreational goods and vehicles up 1.2%. The good news is services prices climbed 0.3%, half of January's advance. The cost of health care edged up 0.2% and finance and insurance increased 0.4%, notable slowdowns from the previous month. The Fed is particularly focused on reining in services inflation, which is fueled largely by wage growth.\n\nBarclays estimates core PCE inflation will decline just modestly by year’s end to 2.6%.\n\nWill the Fed lower interest rates in 2024?\n\nOn its face, the accelerated price increases in both January and February could dissuade the Fed from trimming a key interest rate until officials are convinced that inflation is headed “sustainably” toward 2%.\n\nBut after a meeting last week, Fed Chair Powell said policymakers would not “overreact…to the two months of data.” Another inflation measure called the consumer price index (CPI), already had shown stepped-up price gains the first two months of the year.\n\nPowell said the rise in January could be traced to challenges the government faces in seasonally adjusting the data. And the increase in February, though relatively hefty, was smaller than the previous month’s.\n\n\"The story is really essentially the same of inflation coming down gradually to 2% on a sometimes bumpy path,\" Powell said. He added, however, that the Fed would also not “ignore” the worrisome numbers as it weighs when to start shaving rates.\n\nThe stock market soared after Fed officials continued to predict three rate cuts this year. The futures market is still betting the first rate decrease will come in June.\n\nBut Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic says the stubbornly high inflation readings will likely mean \"the Fed waits to at least June to start cutting rates, with the odds of a July start rising.\"\n\nSince early 2022, the Fed has lifted its benchmark short-term interest rate from near zero to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% to fight a pandemic-induced inflation spike. Higher borrowing costs theoretically should curb economic activity and inflation. Officials have left the rate unchanged since July.\n\nIs consumer spending high right now?\n\nHousehold spending jumped a robust 0.8% after rising 0.2% the previous month. The increase was stronger than expected after retail sales were feeble in both January and February.\n\nPersonal income rose 0.3%, up from 1% in January.\n\nConsumption was strong last year, due largely to rapid wage growth, but appeared to be losing steam early this year amid high interest rates and inflation. The latest data, however, show that Americans are drawing heavily from savings to finance their purchases, a trend that's unlikely to persist.\n\nThe personal savings rate, the share of income that households are socking away, fell to 3.6% from 4.1% in January. That's the lowest since December 2022 and down from a recent peak of 5.3% last May and a pre-pandemic average of about 7%.\n\n\"This underscores that consumers have overextended themselves,\" Bostjancic says, adding that spending is likely to pull back in coming months as job growth weakens.\n\nThe more than $2 trillion cash trove that Americans amassed from stimulus checks and hunkering down during the pandemic is largely depleted, she says.\n\nRecord credit card debt and rising delinquencies are straining low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nWhat is the consumer price index?\n\nEarlier this month, the Labor Department said its consumer price index and core CPI rose 3.2% and 3.8%, respectively, in February.\n\nThe PCE index is based on the CPI as well as a separate measure of wholesale prices. But the PCE gives more or less importance than CPI to certain products and services.

The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed to CNN that she died by suicide and had multiple blunt impact injuries.\n\nThe NYPD will look into the circumstances surrounding Kryst’s death, Detective Martin Brown confirmed Monday. He declined to give more details. It is standard for police to investigate deaths by suicide.\n\n“In devastation and great sorrow, we share the passing of our beloved Cheslie,” Kryst’s family said in a statement. “Her great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength.

Kryst hastened to point out she and her fellow beauty queens were far from token victors based on race.\n\n“Three of the last four Miss USAs were women of color – there was Kara McCullough, there was Deshauna Barber – and that was important for me to see,” Kryst told CNN in December 2019.\n\n“People didn’t think, ‘Oh, that’s enough (Black winners),’” she said. “It’s still possible for us to be successful on your own merit. And it doesn’t matter if you look like the last winner, (if) you look like the last three. If you’re the best, you’re the best, and you can win.”\n\nKryst’s priorities and perspective on life and leadership also emerged during the 2019 Miss USA contest and her reign. She recalled her response when a judge at a legal competition once suggested she wear a skirt instead of pants because judges prefer skirts:\n\n“Glass ceilings can be broken wearing either a skirt or pants,” Kryst said during a video played during pageant activities. “Don’t tell females to wear different clothes while you give the men substantive feedback on their legal arguments.”\n\nSoon after, Kryst built a blog on fashion, White Collar Glam, and volunteered for Dress for Success.\n\nFor her last question in the final Miss USA round, Kryst was asked whether the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements had gone too far.\n\n“I don’t think these movements have gone too far,” she said. “What #MeToo and #TimesUp are about are making sure that we foster safe and inclusive workplaces in our country.\n\n“As an attorney, that’s exactly what I want to hear, and that’s exactly what I want for this country.”", "authors": ["Alaa Elassar Liam Reilly Mirna Alsharif", "Alaa Elassar", "Liam Reilly", "Mirna Alsharif"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/greenville-roots/2018/06/26/sen-strom-thurmond-spent-lifetime-public-service/721586002/", "title": "Sen. Strom Thurmond spent a lifetime in public service", "text": "Chris Weston\n\nFormer Managing Editor\n\nEditor's note: This story originally published on June 27, 2003. June 26 is the 15th anniversary of Sen. Strom Thurmond's death.\n\nStrom Thurmond's death Thursday in a country hospital near his Edgefield birthplace ends a century-long American saga of tumult, triumph and change.\n\nHe was until the end a lightning rod for the nation's continuing struggle over race, the issue that largely defined Thurmond throughout the 20th century and chased him into the new millennium.\n\nFriends and even former enemies said he was more complicated than the searing symbol of Southern racism he had become and that his life was a testimony to the power of redemption.\n\nBut his role as a warrior in the segregationist army never turned him loose. The incoming majority leader of the Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, reignited the controversy anew last year when he said at Thurmond's 100th birthday party that the country might have been better off had the segregationist Thurmond been elected president in 1948.\n\nOther news:Mellow Mushroom in Anderson gets new owners and is expected to reopen\n\nThe fierce national reaction to those comments drove Lott from his leadership position. And it wrapped the 100-year-old Thurmond in a renewed national memory of him.\n\nJust weeks before he died, a decision by the clerk of South Carolina's House of Representatives to honor his long career by featuring him on the cover of the Legislative Manual roiled the General Assembly in a rancorous debate, with black legislators saying they were offended because of his racist past.\n\nHis friends expressed sadness at the turn events took in the final months of his life. They said it obscured his remarkable history of service to the state and to the nation, as well as the good he had done.\n\nThurmond was the nation's longest-serving U.S. senator, at 48 years. And he was the oldest, retiring at 100. He climbed out of Edgefield County through a string of small campaigns to become a legislator, a judge and later governor. Thurmond was the only senator in the nation's history elected as a write-in candidate.\n\nEven into his 90s, before he became frail and wheelchair-bound, he remained oddly boyish. He wore inexpensive suits and black military lace-ups and never looked at ease dressed up. He stuffed his pockets with peanuts, ate like a country boy at Washington receptions and relished physical activity and the outdoors.\n\nHe was a Tom Sawyer figure who never lost his rural roots. He could describe how to castrate a rooster, run an egg farm and the tricks of breaking a horse. He told stories about the Alamo and the Edgefield men who fought there, as well as his own tales of war. Each flowed from his notions of bravery and honor.\n\nCold case:Who killed Tina Milford? 35-year-old case could be solved by DNA\n\nTo his enemies, he was mean and cunning. Admirers praised his unflagging toughness. He built his early political career on no small measure of macho bravura. As a judge, he sentenced four men to die and said later in life that he had no regrets. He fought another U.S. senator on the floor of the Capitol.\n\nThere was another side. Among the tons of his archived papers are tender love letters to his first wife. His eyes could well with tears when talking about children.\n\nRaised on politics\n\nHe was born Dec. 5, 1902, to Eleanor Gertrude Strom Thurmond and John William \"Will\" Thurmond -- county attorney, prosecutor, legislator and judge. Will Thurmond was a political lieutenant of \"Pitchfork\" Ben Tillman, the dominant figure of post-Civil War South Carolina, who led a farmers' movement and successfully campaigned for governor in 1890.\n\nThurmond could spin eyewitness accounts of Tillman. Walter Edgar, a South Carolina historian, author of \"South Carolina: A History,\" and a professor at the Uni- versity of South Carolina, said, \"How many people today can say they heard Ben Tillman on the stump? When you stop to think about that -- and Tillman had heard Revolutionary War characters -- I mean, that takes in three generations. It takes us back 200 years.\"\n\nThurmond prided himself on being a son of Edgefield, a land that had borne James Bonham and William Travis, who fought at the Alamo, and Pitchfork Ben.\n\nAs an old man, he talked about sitting in the Edgefield dust as a little boy at a stump debate during the 1912 race for governor. His father had taken his children to hear Ira Jones and Coleman Blease.\n\nOther news:As body cameras grow in popularity, Greenville police vehicles move away from dashcams\n\n\"I remember Jones spoke that day and made a fine speech, but he didn't demagogue and he didn't shout and he didn't quite make the impression that Blease did, because Blease was an able speaker and more dynamic,\" Thurmond said in an interview with The Greenville News.\n\nThurmond, who learned how to shout and how to demagogue, said the episode served as an example to him throughout his political life.\n\nHe graduated from Clemson in 1923. Beneath his photo in the Clemson yearbook are the words, \"One cannot always be a hero, but one can always be a man.\"\n\nThurmond taught agriculture and coached at high schools in McCormick, Ridge Spring and Edgefield from 1923 until 1929. His political career began that year with his election as Edgefield County's superintendent of education.\n\nHe also began studying, or reading, the law under his father and was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1930. By 1932, he was working for Franklin Roosevelt's presidential nomination. He was elected to the South Carolina Senate that year, serving until 1938.\n\nLater, as governor, he would underscore in the 1950 Legislative Manual his progressive record. He wrote of his work as a member of the Social Security Committee that sponsored the first law to help the blind, old and poor. He also wrote of his role in helping to write the first rural electrification act and working to create the Santee Cooper power and navigation project.\n\nThurmond singled out as accomplishments a longer school term, improved textbooks, mandatory school attendance and the \"prevention of chiseling ofteachers' salaries.\" He also supported new buildings at state colleges, the Soil Conservation Act, construction of the Wade Hampton state office building and \"legislation for the betterment of labor conditions andprotection of farmers.\"\n\nIt was a record of a big and active government, hardly representative of the second half of Thurmond's life. While the issues would change, though, his political performance would not.\n\nThrough five decades, Thurmond's style rarely varied -- clenched fists on the stage, shouting and rasping against the evils of \"kowtowing\" to outside forces. It was a tough image, full of energy and suspicion.\n\nOff the stump, there was the other Thurmond. At political rallies, funerals, dawn prayer services before inaugurations, and weddings, Thurmond was often the first there, shaking hands, asking about family, making a connection.\n\nAlmost the entire Thurmond infrastructure in Washington was about those connections back home. When a young would-be politician, lawyer or judge went to work for the senator, they spent time clipping obituaries for the senator's notes to families and serving as Thurmond's emissary on all manner of missions for constituents.\n\nA tough judge\n\nBy 1938, he was a state circuit judge. While on the bench, he sentenced four men to death, three blacks and one white.\n\nDavid Bruck, one of the nation's foremost opponents of the death penalty, examined Thurmond's death penalty cases. He wrote in The Washington Post in 1981 that Thurmond seated all-white juries to judge black defendants even though the U.S. Supreme Court had condemned the practice.\n\nBruck referred to a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision written by Justice Hugo Black of Alabama that racial discrimination in jury selection \"not only violates our Constitution ... but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling, Bruck wrote, came two months before Thurmond seated the jury in the trial of George Thomas, accused of raping a white woman in Georgetown. \"So it can't be said that judges like Thurmond had no way of knowing in 1941 that there was anything wrong with the all-white judicial system. Thurmond and his colleagues did what they did because there was not yet anyone to stand up to them,\" Bruck wrote.\n\nThurmond said five decades later that he had no regrets. \"I thought the jury came to a correct decision in all of those cases. I think that if I had been sitting on the jury, I would have reached the same verdict. It was merely my duty to impose the punishment as the law provided where they did not recommend mercy,\" he said.\n\nHis years as a circuit judge may have been the favorite in his life, Thurmond said. He had time to ride horses and read history.\n\nEven then, he probably had his eye on a wider game. U.S. District Judge Joe Anderson Jr., who's from Edgefield, said his grandfather was Thurmond's court reporter. He said Thurmond was an unorthodox judge.\n\n\"Judges traditionally just live in a bubble. They're very isolated,\" said Anderson. But Thurmond, he said, would ride the circuit and speak to civic clubs and visit local restaurants, making connections and shaking hands.\n\n\"He certainly didn't live in a bubble as a judge, in other words. I think he was looking toward a statewide political career, probably,\" he said. \"And, of course, there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nThe war\n\nPearl Harbor ended Thurmond's bucolic world of horseback rides and books in the afternoon. He took off his robes, got a leave of absence and joined the Army. He was a 39-year-old first lieutenant.\n\nHe was commissioned in the First Army and attached to the 82nd Airborne Division for the invasion of Europe. His war record was a vital part of his political resume, and he described his flight into France behind enemy lines in a glider. He served with the First Army through France, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg and Czechoslovakia. He fought on to Germany and the rendezvous with the Russians.\n\nHe listed in his war record five battle stars and 18 decorations, including the Belgian Order of the Crown, the French Croix de Guerre and a Bronze Star.\n\n\"We sat on the banks of the river waiting on the Russians to take Berlin,\"he said. \"I never have been so mad, and the others were, too, that we were not allowed to take Berlin.\"\n\nThurmond transferred to the Pacific, and he was in the Philippines when the war ended. He returned home to the bench before resigning and running for governor in 1946.\n\nHe continued to serve as an officer in the Army Reserve, and the military remained an essential part of his life. He retired as a major general.\n\nDon Fowler, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a retired officer in the Army Reserve, said Thurmond was interested in what was known as \"military government\" and is now called civil affairs. He said Thurmond personally organized the prominent 360th Civil Affairs Brigade.\n\nThurmond ran for governor as a populist and beat 10 men. He campaigned against the \"Barnwell Ring\" led by two Barnwell County politicians who controlled state politics -- state Sen. Edgar Brown, the Senate leader, and the speaker of the state House of Representatives, Solomon Blatt.\n\nEdgar, the historian, believes Thurmond's accomplishments as governor don't get the attention they deserve. \"He was a damn good governor, given what little power our governors have,\" he said. Edgar had lunch with Thurmond after the 1998 publication of his South Carolina history. He said the senator talked about his accomplishments as governor as a highlight of his career.\n\nEdgar said Thurmond had a progressive record -- creation of the state Probation, Paroles and Pardons Board, modernization of the Port of Charleston, the extension of the school year to nine months and the addition of the 12th grade. And he said voters repealed the poll tax, divorce was legalized and the Public Welfare Act was amended to provide aid to dependent children under 18.\n\nA governor marries\n\nHe was a 44-year-old governor, though, before he married. She was Jean Crouch, a former beauty queen and one of his secretaries.\n\nThurmond proposed in a letter, on his office letterhead, and she accepted in a typewritten note. \"My darling Jean,\" he wrote. \"You have proved to be a most efficient and capable secretary, and the high caliber of your work has impressed me very much. It is with a deep sense of regret that I will have to inform you that your services will be discontinued as of the last day of this month.\"\n\nThurmond wrote he couldn't live happily or accomplish what he needed to do for the state without her. \"As soon as you have made up your mind, I should thank you to please give me a decision and do not wait too long because my heart yearns for you, and I want you to be my wife without too much delay.\"\n\nThe same day, she replied, \"My dearest Strom, Yes!\"\n\nThe senator's archived papers at the Strom Thurmond Institute at Clemson include stacks of love letters between them. He calls her \"Sugie\" and \"Wifey.\" From a political convention in Philadelphia in 1949, Thurmond writes her about his day. \"Sweet dreams and good night. I love you -- I do -- I do. Forever yours, Strom.\"\n\nThe marriage lasted until 1960, when Jean Thurmond died of a brain tumor at the National Institutes of Health. They had no children.\n\nOpposing civil rights\n\nPresident Truman integrated the armed forces and called for an end to racial discrimination on the job. The Democratic Party adopted a civil rights plank at the 1948 Democratic National Convention and Thurmond led a delegate revolt.\n\nThe Southerners formed the States' Rights Party, or Dixiecrats, and nominated Thurmond to run for president, with Mississippi Gov. Fielding Wright as his running mate. He said his goal was to win enough states to throw the election to the House of Representatives, where he could bargain the presidency for concessions on civil rights.\n\nHe carried four states -- South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. It wasn't enough to make a difference.\n\nThurmond returned to Columbia and launched a campaign against U.S. Sen. Olin Johnston in 1950. Johnston was a former governor and a fellow populist. There are politicians still alive who remember how the two tried to outdo each other as race-baiters. At one point in the campaign, Thurmond challenged Johnston to fight outside a courthouse debate in Newberry. They never threw punches.\n\nIt was the only election Thurmond lost.\n\nFormer Gov. Dick Riley said the South of the 1950s practiced raw, uncomplicated politics. \"Things have gotten more complex and he, then, I think, has changed and gotten more complex himself,\" said Riley.\n\nWhipped by Johnston, Thurmond went home and began practicing law in Aiken.\n\nIn 1954, the executive committee of the South Carolina Democratic Party left Sen. Burnet Rhett Maybank's funeral and decided not to hold a primary election for the Senate seat. They chose one of their own, the leader of the Barnwell ring, Edgar Brown.\n\nFor Thurmond, it was another opportunity to go to war against a foe he had described before -- the elite attempting to force its will on others. He launched a write-in campaign, which collected wide newspaper support and, in the late days of the race, the backing of Gov. Jimmy Byrnes, an immensely powerful Democrat who had been a congressman, U.S. senator, U.S. Supreme Court justice and U.S. secretary of state.\n\nThurmond promised voters that he would resign before the next primary to allow them to choose a Democratic nominee. He won with 63 percent of the vote. Thurmond kept his promise, won the primary and returned to Washington, where he stayed.\n\nHarry Dent, who covered the 1954 race as a reporter before becoming Thurmond's top political aide, said the move sealed Thurmond's future success. \"He became the unbeatable politician from then forward.\"\n\nRacial politicking\n\nThurmond marched into the Senate at a moment in history when Congress, the political parties and the nation began confronting America's legacy of racial discrimination.\n\nPresident Eisenhower in his 1957 State of the Union address called for the passage of civil rights legislation. Lyndon Johnson had his eyes on the 1960 presidential campaign and understood the challenge of breaking out of the South to win national support. The Texas senator, the majority leader of the Senate, began moving for civil rights.\n\nThurmond opposed the legislation. Three decades later, the senator said he was fighting for states' rights, not for the continued oppression of blacks. But his raw language on civil rights left little doubt that he was an aggressive segregationist.\n\nRobert Caro, in the third volume of his examination of the life of Lyndon Johnson, \"Master of the Senate,\" writes that Thurmond was on his own in the filibuster. Even passionate opponents of civil rights such as Georgia Sen. Richard Russell, Caro wrote, compromised on the issue to advance Johnson's presidential ambition.\n\nThurmond filibustered against the bill and set a Senate record. He talked without interruption for 24 hours, 18 minutes. He stopped after a Senate doctor threatened to pull him off the floor. And his effort was in vain. He sat down and the Senate passed the bill that Eisenhower signed into law.\n\nIn his later years, Thurmond repeatedly denied that he was a racist. The thrust of his fight, he said, was against the domination of the states by the federal government.\n\nHis Senate speeches, radio addresses and campaign comments back home during the period are largely repetitive, focusing on states' rights. But he was strident and personal in his attack.\n\nThurmond said in 1964 that \"the enforcement of the recently enacted so-called Civil Rights Act will mean the upheaval of social patterns and customs more than a century old in many communities, both in the South and in other areas of the nation as well. To force people to change their pattern of living overnight, to require them to forget how they have acted and reacted over the entire span of their lifetime, creates a potentially dangerous situation.\n\n\"In many instances, the best advice which could be given would be for the integration groups to discontinue their demands and their agitation.\"\n\nHe railed against what he described as communist infiltration of the civil rights movement. Thurmond accused Northern congressmen of hypocrisy, saying the North had created a ruthless but effective ghetto system to segregate the races.\n\n\"Segregation in the South is honest, open and above-board,\" said Thurmond in a June 1964 Senate speech. \"Of the two systems, or styles of segregation, the Northern and the Southern, there is no doubt whatever in my mind which is the better. Our Southern system, too, has stood and passed the pragmatic test. It works.\"\n\nHe said passage of the civil rights legislation \"will mark one of the darkest days in history.\"\n\nThe Senate rolled over him in 1964, just as it did in 1957. Within weeks,Thurmond would become involved in one of the most famous incidents in Senate history, which has endured from its frequent retelling.\n\nPresident Johnson had nominated former Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to head the Community Relations Service, created by the Civil Rights Act to mediate disputes. Thurmond opposed him. In a July 1964 statement, Thurmond said Collins would offer advice on how integration could be best achieved, \"not whether it should be pushed or not.\"\n\nHe said Collins was one of the \"turncoats\" who had previously supported segregation and changed their position.\n\nCollins' nomination had to clear a committee vote, and Thurmond attempted to block it by preventing a quorum. He was in the hall outside the hearing room when Texas Sen. Ralph Yarborough tried to enter. Thurmond said years later that Yarborough ordered him inside.\n\nThurmond said he told the Texas Democrat, \"If you're man enough, do it.\" He said Yarborough grabbed him under his arms and Thurmond threw him to the floor.\n\n\"I held him there, just put a scissors on him and just held him there and laid back and took it easy,\" said Thurmond. Lying on the floor, he said, they worked out a plan. If Thurmond lost, Yarborough could vote. If Thurmond won, he couldn't.\n\n\"I let him up, but the rascal went in there and voted anyway,\" Thurmond told The News. He was far from embarrassed over it. \"He weighed about 200 pounds and I weighed about 170 then. But he hadn't taken exercise like I had. He wasn't tough and hard.\"\n\nChanging parties\n\nHis disenchantment with the Democratic Party was complete. Thurmond bolted from the party in 1964, throwing his support to Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater in his campaign to defeat Johnson. He went to work building the party in South Carolina.\n\n\"When he switched, it just made all the difference in the world,\" said Fowler. \"He made the Republican Party legitimate in South Carolina and by implication, the rest of the South.\"\n\nThe importance of the switch became clear in 1968 when Thurmond aligned himself with Richard Nixon and held Southern delegates for Nixon against a challenge by Alabama Gov. George Wallace. Thurmond had become a national political force. Fowler said Thurmond delivered several Southern states to Nixon.\n\nEdgar, the historian, said Thurmond's break to the Republicans in 1964 and his success in 1968 \"changed the course of American history\" in building the Republican Party in the South. His work for Nixon \"gave him an inside track that no other Southern senator had.\"\n\nThurmond's moves to keep Wallace bottled up and promote Nixon in the South signaled an important political shift. The last move away from open racial politicking, however, would come after the 1970 South Carolina race for governor between Republican U.S. Rep. Albert Watson and Democratic Lt. Gov. John West.\n\nWatson ran against busing, and the campaign whipped racist flames across the state. West said Thurmond worked harder for Watson than Watson worked for himself. Watson lost, and Thurmond began charting a new course.\n\nHe hired a black staff member in 1971, and he began working to change his image as a racist. He began broadening his legendary work for constituents to include black South Carolinians.\n\nModjeska Simpkins, a longtime advocate for civil rights in South Carolina, told The News before her death that she believed Thurmond had genuinely changed. \"Down there somewhere, there was something fundamentally all right\" about the senator. She said she asked Thurmond for help, and \"he has never refused to help, and he has helped in every case.\"\n\nI.S. Leevy Johnson was one of the first blacks elected to the South Carolina General Assembly in the 1970s. He said Thurmond was \"not forgiven for the obstacles he put in the path of African-Americans to exercise the rights and privileges taken for granted by others.\" But he said Thurmond worked to address black concerns and was a strong supporter of black colleges.\n\nAnother black political pioneer, state Sen. Kay Patterson, said Thurmond's early record on race is indefensible. But Patterson said he believes Thurmond had \"a change of heart on the road to Damascus, like Paul. He woke up and saw the light.\"\n\nA new wife\n\nThurmond added a new dimension to his image in 1968 when he married Nancy Moore, a 22-year-old former Miss South Carolina. The senator was 66.\n\nDent, Thurmond's longtime political aide, said the marriage added to Thurmond's already virile image. The couple had two sons and two daughters. One of his sons, Strom Jr., is now South Carolina's chief federal prosecutor.\n\nThe marriage lasted until 1991, when they separated. In his final months, however, she returned to his side to care for him.\n\nThurmond reached the height of his power in 1981 when Ronald Reagan swept into Washington with a Republican wave that captured the Senate. Thurmond was then president pro tem of the Senate and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He was third in line to the presidency after the vice president and House speaker.\n\nHe played critical roles in judicial nominations, crime bills and defense issues. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy said an important part of Thurmond's Senate legacy is his work with him to reform the nation's criminal sentencing laws.\n\nKennedy said he and Thurmond fought mandatory sentencing laws as a solution to sentencing disparities by crafting guidelines in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Kennedy said he and Thurmond \"came to the issue from different perspectives, but we agreed on the goal of fair sentencing laws. It took several years of debates, but Sen. Thurmond and I stood together.\"\n\nAt 90, the senator's 22-year-old daughter, Nancy Moore, was fatally injured in 1993 when she was struck by a car while crossing the street near her off-campus apartment in Columbia. She was a beauty queen and a student at the University of South Carolina. Thurmond was devastated. He and his wife were there for a 17- hour vigil before she died.\n\nThurmond ran his last campaign in 1996, and in his final years, he largely receded from the national stage. He still went to work and attended congressional hearings, but he was propped up by a retinue of loyal aides -- including his longtime chief of staff, the devoted Duke Short. At the end of his last Senate term, he was spending nights at Walter Reed Army Hospital.\n\nHis vast network of efficient aides and allies that had for so many years provided a sturdy cocoon slowly began to fade away. Thurmond spent much of his last 30 days as a senator receiving accolades from almost the entirety of official Washington -- from liberals such as Kennedy to President Bush.\n\nIn the end, he left amid the great cacophony of national controversy, defined again by his mid-20th-century opposition to civil rights for black Americans.\n\nSTROM THURMOND\n\nDec. 5, 1902 - Born in Edgefield, S.C.\n\n1923 - Graduates from Clemson University with Bachelor of Science degree\n\n1923 - 1929 - McCormick, Ridge Spring and Edgefield, S.C. teacher and athletic coach.\n\nJan. 9, 1924 - Commissioned 2nd lieutenant, U.S. Army Reserve\n\n1923 - 33 - Edgefield County, S.C. superintendent of education\n\n1930 - Admitted to South Carolina bar after studying law under his father, Judge J.

Albom said she was “born tough.”\n\nThen, when she was 5 years old, Chika was diagnosed with DIPG, an inoperable Stage IV brain tumor. Mitch and his wife, Janine, brought Chika to the U.S. in hopes of better medical care and an eventual return to Haiti. Instead, it became a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure.\n\nAlong the way the trio found something else: they had become a family.\n\n“Finding Chika,” to be released this week with all proceeds going to the Have Faith Haiti Mission & Orphanage, is Albom’s account of the joy, laughter, heartbreak and insight that Chika brought to so many lives. Twenty-two years after publishing “Tuesdays with Morrie” and 10 years after “Have a Little Faith,” this book marks Albom’s return to memoir non-fiction. In this exclusive excerpt for the Free Press, which includes an edited selection of passages from the book, we see how Chika changed the world for so many people around her, and why it is never too late to love a child.\n\nUs\n\n“Why aren’t you writing, Mister Mitch?”\n\nChika is lying on the carpet in my office. She flips onto her back. She plays with her fingers. She comes here in the early morning, when the light is still thin at the window. Sometimes she has a doll or a set of Magic Markers. Other times, it’s just her. She wears her blue pajamas, with the My Little Pony cartoon on the top and pastel stars on the bottoms.\n\nIn the past, Chika loved to choose her clothes each morning after brushing her teeth, matching the colors of the socks and the shirts.\n\nBut she doesn’t do that anymore.\n\nChika died last spring, when the trees in our yard were beginning to bud, as they are budding now, as it is spring again. Her absence left us without breath, or sleep, or appetite, and my wife and I stared straight ahead for long stretches until someone spoke to snap us out of it.\n\nThen one morning, Chika reappeared.\n\n“Why aren’t you writing?” she says again.\n\nI stare at the empty screen.\n\nAbout what?\n\n“About me.”\n\nI will.\n\n“When?”\n\nSoon.\n\nShe makes a grrr sound, like a cartoon tiger.\n\nDon’t be mad.\n\n“Hmph.”\n\nDon’t be mad, Chika.\n\n“Hmph.”\n\nDon’t go, OK?\n\nShe taps her little fingers on the desk, as if she has to think about it.\n\nChika never stays for long. She first appeared eight months after she died, the morning of my father’s funeral. I walked outside to look at the sky. And suddenly, there she was, standing beside me. I said her name in disbelief — “Chika?” — and she turned, so I knew she could hear me. I spoke quickly, believing this was a dream and she would vanish at any moment.\n\nThat was then. Lately, when she appears, I am calm. I say, “Good morning, beautiful girl,” and she says, “Good morning, Mister Mitch,” and she sits on the floor or in her little chair, which I never removed from my office. You can get used to everything in life, I suppose. Even this.\n\nI glance at the calendar. Can it really be a year since she’s gone? It feels like yesterday. It feels like forever.\n\nAll right, Chika, I say. I’ll start writing.\n\n“Yay!” she squeals, shaking her fists.\n\nOne condition. You have to stay here while I do. You have to stay with me, OK?\n\nI know she cannot do what I’m asking. Still, I bargain. It’s all we really want, my wife and I, since Chika has been gone; to be in the same place with her, all the time.\n\n“Tell me my story,” Chika says.\n\nAnd you’ll stay?\n\n“I’ll try.”\n\nAll right, I say. I will tell you the story of you and me.\n\n“Us,” she says.\n\n“Us,” I say.\n\nYou\n\nOnce upon a time, Chika, I came to your country. I wasn’t there the day you were born. I arrived a few weeks later, because a really bad thing happened. It was called an earthquake. An earthquake is when —\n\nUs\n\n\"— Mister Mitch. Stop.”\n\nWhat’s the matter?\n\n“Don’t talk like that.”\n\nLike what?\n\n“Like I’m a baby.”\n\nBut you’re only 7.\n\n“Nuh-uh.”\n\nYou’re not 7 anymore?\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nShe shrugs.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n“Talk like a grown-up. Like you talk to Miss Janine.”\n\nYou’re sure?\n\nShe takes my wrists and guides them back to the keys. I feel the warmth of her little hands and I revel in it. I have learned I cannot touch Chika, but she can touch me. I am not sure why this is. I don’t get the rules. But I am grateful for her visits and hungry for every little contact.\n\nI start again.\n\nYou\n\nI wasn’t there the day you were born, Chika. I arrived in Haiti a few weeks later, to help after a terrible earthquake, and since you tell me I should talk like a grown-up, then I can say it was seismic enough in 30 seconds to wipe out nearly 3% of your country’s population. Buildings crumbled. Offices collapsed. Houses that held families were intact one moment and puffs of smoke the next. People died and were buried in the rubble, many of them not found until weeks later, their skin covered in gray dust. They never did get an accurate count of those lost, not to this day, but it was in the hundreds of thousands. That’s more people killed in less than a minute than in all the days of the American Revolution and the Gulf War combined.\n\nIt was a tragedy on an island where tragedy is no stranger. Haiti, your homeland, is the second poorest nation in the world, with a history of hardship and many deaths, the kind that come too soon.\n\nBut it is also a place of great happiness, Chika. A place of beauty and laughter and unshakable faith, and children — children who, in a rainstorm, will hook arms and dance spontaneously, then throw themselves to the ground in hysterics, as if they don’t know what to do with all their joy. You were happy there in that way once, even very poor.\n\n* * *\n\nThe story of your birth was told to me as follows: on Jan. 9, 2010, you entered this world inside a two-room cinder block house by a breadfruit tree. There was no doctor present. A midwife named Albert delivered you from your mother’s womb. From all accounts, yours was a healthy birth, you cried when you were supposed to, you slept when you were supposed to.\n\nAnd on your third day of life, Jan. 12, a hot afternoon, you were sleeping on your mother’s chest when the world shook as if the dirt held thunder. Your cinder block house wobbled and the roof fell off and the structure split open like a walnut, leaving the two of you exposed to the heavens.\n\nPerhaps God got a good look at you, Chika, because He didn’t take you that day, and He didn’t take your mother, even though He took so many others. Your home was destroyed, but you were both left intact — naked to the sky, but intact. All around, people were running and falling and praying and crying. Trees lay on their sides. Animals hid.\n\nYou slept that night in the sugarcane fields, on a bed of leaves, under the stars, and you slept there for many days that followed. So you were birthed into the soil of your homeland, Chika, all its roiling rage and beauty, and maybe that is why you sometimes roiled and raged yourself, and were so beautiful.\n\nYou are Haitian. Although you lived in America and died in America, you were always of another place, as you are now, even as you sit here with me.\n\nYou\n\nOnce, late at night, Miss Janine and I were crouched next to your bed and you said to us, quietly, “How did you find me?” I thought it was such a sad question that I could only repeat it. “How did we find you?” And you said, “Yes.” And we said, “You mean how did you come to us?” and you said yes, again. But I think you meant it the way you said it, because life before the orphanage was foggy in your memory, like being in a misty forest, so “How did you find me?” makes sense, because to you, I suppose, it felt as if you were found.\n\nBut you were never lost, Chika. I want you to know that. There were people who loved you before we loved you. Your mother, Resilia, from what I have been told, was a tall, strong woman with a broad face and a stern expression, like you have sometimes when you do not get your way.\n\nShe had a friend named Herzulia, and they would take walks together and laugh about men and eventually your mother got involved with a man of her own, an older man with sad eyes whose first name was Fedner and whose last name was Jeune, which is your last name, too. Jeune, in French, means “young,” so it suits you.\n\nYour mother and Fedner had two girls who preceded you, your older sisters, and when your mother got pregnant with you, she told Herzulia that you would be her last child. Together they chose an elegant name for you, Medjerda, although very soon everyone was calling you Chika. Someone said it was because you were a stocky baby. Someone else said Chika is a term of endearment. It doesn’t really matter. We have names we are given and names that just attach to us, and Chika was yours.\n\nAnd had your mother been right, had you been her last child, she might be alive and I might never have met you.\n\nBut she and Fedner had one more baby after you, two years later, a boy. He arrived in the hottest month of the year, August, in the early hours before the sun came up. Albert, the midwife, was again present, but this time something went wrong.\n\nYour new brother lived.\n\nYour mother died.\n\nI know it makes no sense to have birth and death in the same bed, Chika, but that is what happened, and that was the last you saw of your birth family for a long time.\n\nHerzulia carried you off after the funeral. She said your mother had chosen her as your godmother and had insisted, “If I ever die, you must take Chika.” So she did. She took you and two sets of your clothes and together you rode off in the back of a Haitian tap-tap bus.\n\nThose clothes were all you got to keep from your first home, Chika. It is not a lot, I know. I can only say that God was merciful by not letting you remember those days. Your mother was buried in a large grave with other people, and there is no marker for her anywhere, nothing with her name that you can visit or pray over, although you can always pray wherever you are, you know this from your teachings.\n\n* * *\n\nYour next home did not last long. Less than a year. It was a single-room apartment in a cinder block structure that you shared with Herzulia’s family. There was no bathroom inside. At night, when the electricity went off, it was total darkness, and in the mornings, you would carry dirty bedsheets up the stairs to the rooftop, a dangerous undertaking for a child not yet 3 years old. A woman saw you doing this and grew concerned for your safety. She suggested to Herzulia that you might be better off in an orphanage. She knew of one not far away, in the section of the city known as Delmas 33.\n\nThat is the orphanage I have operated since 2010, the year of the earthquake, the place you called misyon an, “the mission,” specifically, the Have Faith Haiti Mission, a rectangular piece of land behind a high gray gate on Rue Anne Laramie, a terribly potholed street that gathers water like a small lake when it rains.\n\nAnd that, Chika, was the beginning of providence moving our lives together, or the continuance of it, I should say, since the Lord doesn’t get ideas partway through a life.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Herzulia brought you to us, she said she had three children of her own and no money. As we talked you watched in silence, Herzulia occasionally straightening your dress.\n\nHere is what I remember the most. After a while, you crossed your arms, as if you were getting impatient, and I looked at you and you looked back, and I stuck out my tongue and you stuck out yours, and I laughed and you laughed in return.\n\nMost new children, when brought to our mission, are shy and nervous and look away if I catch their glance. But you went eye-to-eye with me, right from the start.\n\nAnd even though I knew so little about you, Chika, I could tell that you were brave, and I knew that being brave would help you in this life.\n\nI did not know how much.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is August of 2013. I have been operating the orphanage for three years. We have functional water, healthy food, and many new children. And while much of Haiti remains a mystery to me, coming here every month has made certain things routine.\n\nI land at the Port-au-Prince airport, go through passport control, shuffle past a small Haitian band, descend the escalator, which, per usual, is not working. Alain Charles, our Haitian director, stands at the bottom. We retrieve the bags and push out the doors, which is like entering a tunnel of burning air. Sweating men in button-down shirts grab at my luggage and yell, “Hello, sir! . . . I help you, sir!”\n\nAs we weave through heavy traffic, we pass piles of earthquake rubble, still visible after three years, and mounds of trash, some of it on fire. A stray goat. A skinny dog. Potholes that could swallow a vehicle whole. Finally, with a horn honk, a security guard opens the gate of our orphanage.\n\nAnd suddenly, the whole world changes. I hear the most wonderful sound — squealing children — running my way. They are led by our newest arrival, Chika Jeune, who has only been here a few weeks. The others yell, “Mister Mitch!” but she doesn’t really know me yet. Still, she seems determined to be first. She raises her arms, so I lift her up. I am often amazed by how little a child needs to know you to want your embrace.\n\n“And how are you, Chika Jeune?”\n\nShe doesn’t answer. She speaks no English.\n\n“Sak pase?” I try, a Creole expression akin to, “What’s up?”\n\nShe grins and grabs my neck and buries her head.\n\n“It’s OK,” I say, “you’ll talk later.”\n\nUs\n\n“Mister Mitch?”\n\nYes?\n\n“Can I have a piece of paper?”\n\nI hand her a yellow pad.\n\n“Can I have something to draw with?”\n\nI hand her a marker.\n\n“Mister Mitch? Did I ever teached you something?”\n\nTeach me. Yes. You taught me many things.\n\n“Then here!”\n\nShe slaps the pad and marker on my desk.\n\n“Now I am the teacher! You have to write what I teached you! And don’t stop” — she wags a parental finger — “until you are finished!”\n\nWhy?\n\n“Because then I can stay.”\n\nWait, I say. Forever?\n\nBut she is gone.\n\nLESSON ONE\n\nProtection\n\nIn the early months of operating the orphanage, Chika, I was determined to protect our kids from anything, just as I was determined to protect you. I had to consider things I never thought about before, like how slippery the floors were, or how potholed the concrete was where the kids played soccer, or how to intercept tiny toys that could be swallowed, or containers of diesel fuel for the generator that might get into the wrong young hands.\n\nI thought if I only focused more, I could guard against anything. But like walking into a swarm of bees, the more you swat at dangers, the more of them seem to appear. As we admitted more children, I worried about our building (still not earthquake-proof), our upper level (what if someone fell?), our water tanks (what if something poisonous got in them?).\n\nIt was overwhelming. Gradually, I had to face the fact that I could not control everything, no matter how fast my eyes darted from spot to spot. This was hard. I am not good at being vulnerable, Chika, or relying on the Lord to handle it all, even though many around me in Haiti were at peace under His watch. Protecting our kids became the biggest and most anxious priority in my life.\n\nBut because you were all so young, I thought more about accidents and mishaps, not long-term health.\n\nThen, one day, when I was back in Michigan, I got a phone call from Mr. Alain, our Hatian director.\n\n“Sir, there is something wrong with Chika.”\n\n“What’s wrong?” I said.\n\n“Her face. It is drooped. And she is walking funny.”\n\n“Did you take her to the doctor?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What did he do?”\n\n“He gave her eye drops.”\n\n“Alain, it’s not her eyes. Can you find a neurologist?”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“A nerve doctor.”\n\n“I will find one.”\n\nI remember hanging up and feeling unsettled, as if something ominous was coming, like the rolling thunder on Haitian afternoons before the heavy rains fall. We never needed a neurologist before, Chika. A skin doctor, yes. A dentist, sure. Cough medicine, diarrhea medicine, children’s Tylenol. But a neurologist?\n\nHow serious is this? I wondered.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen we finally found that neurologist, he noted the droop of your mouth and your left eye, and how your gait was slightly off. He ordered an MRI. At the time, there was only one MRI machine in Haiti, and it cost $750 cash for an appointment.\n\nMr. Alain took you there. You left before sunrise. Six hours later, a nurse finally called your name. She made you drink a syrup that put you to sleep. You were placed inside a large cylinder, where radio waves and a magnetic field were generated around your head. The results were images that showed you from the inside.\n\nAnd while I would have told people that on the inside, Chika, you were warm and curious and confident and funny, the MRI analysis was more clinical:\n\n“The child has a mass on her brain. We don’t know what it is. But whatever it is, there is no one in Haiti who can help her.”\n\nI read that.\n\nAnd everything I knew about protection changed.\n\nYou\n\n“Mister Mitch?”\n\nHmm?\n\n“Tell me about when I came to America,” she says.\n\nAll right. Here is what I recall. You were the first child we ever brought to this country, and the day of your departure, the other kids at the mission lined up to hug you. They waved goodbye as the car left the gates. I imagine some thought they would never see you again.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Alain, you flew to Miami and on to Detroit, wearing a white sweater, even though it was June. In your first American bathroom, you turned the faucet and jerked your hands back, because you had never felt hot water from a sink before. So before you even slept a night here, this country was a wonder to you.\n\nMiss Janine and I were waiting at the house, with colorful blankets and dolls to make you feel welcome. At the time, we hoped the doctors would diagnose the problem and treat it quickly, and you would heal under our watch. Then you could return to Haiti.\n\nLooking back now, we really knew so little.\n\nI should say you did not seem scared when you got here, Chika, but you did not speak much, either. Or show much emotion. Mostly you looked around. Who could blame you? Virtually everything you saw was new: traffic lights, highways, houses with yards, mailboxes, televisions in different rooms. The input had to be overwhelming. I often wondered, when you went to sleep that first night, how far you imagined yourself from the orphanage.\n\nThe day after your arrival, we went for tests at Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor. It was the tallest building you had ever seen. We approached the front desk. A man said hello and gave you a wristband, which you admired like a bracelet.\n\nThen the man turned to me and asked, “What is your relationship to the patient?”\n\nFor a moment, I hesitated. All around were mothers and fathers, many looking similar to their children, same hair, same skin color, same facial features. I felt as if I’d been caught trying to fool someone. I answered by saying, “legal guardian,” because those are technically the correct words, and the man wrote something down and asked me to stand before a camera.\n\n“Mister Mitch!” you suddenly yelled. “Look!” You pointed to a large Superman figure in the lobby. I released your hand and you ran to it, just as the man handed me a sticker with a grainy photo of my face.\n\nAbove the photo was one word: Parent.\n\nI stuck it to my shirt.\n\nUs\n\n“Mister Mitch?”\n\nHmm?\n\n“Then what happened?”\n\nI don’t like this part.\n\n“How come?”\n\nBecause it was bad news.\n\n“Nuh-uh.”\n\nIt wasn’t bad news?\n\nShe shakes her head no.\n\n* * *\n\nHow could she determine that? I never told her this story, the moment Janine and I entered a small consultation room a few days after Chika’s initial brain surgery.\n\nAnyone who has sat through that slice of time, when you don’t know something awful and then you do, will confirm that it is literally a bend in your life, and what is critical is what you choose next; because you can view a diagnosis many ways — as a curse, a challenge, a resignation, a test from God.\n\nWe had been cautiously optimistic that morning, based on doctors’ earlier analysis, that the mass in Chika’s brain could be manageable. The hope was for a grade one tumor, most easily dealt with, but we were braced for a grade two, which they warned could involve some radiation and long-term surveillance.\n\nInstead, Dr. Hugh Garton came into that consultation room, sat down, and, in a soft but direct voice, said the news was not good, worse than they’d thought, that Chika had something called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG.\n\nWhen I asked if that was a grade one or two, he said it was “a four.”\n\nA four?\n\nHe began to lay out options, which included radiation therapy and experimental medications, but all I heard was “four.”\n\nFour? I felt like I was stumbling, even as I was sitting down. Four? I kept listening for the part where the surgeons go back and take the whole monster out, but it never came. Apparently, if they did that, there would be nothing left of Chika’s brain to function.\n\nDr. Garton shared some ominous truths about DIPG: there are only around 300 cases in the United States every year: it usually strikes children between 4 and 9; it quickly debilitates them — their walking, their mobility, their swallowing. And the kicker: its long-term survival rate was, basically, zero.\n\nI could see Janine tearing up. I blurted out the question before I lost the courage to ask it.\n\n“How long does she have?”\n\n“Maybe four months,” he said, softly, then added, “maybe five.” He said radiation could extend that time frame, although her quality of life might be affected and personally he wouldn’t choose it, because she’d have to stay here in America, and in the end, it would not make a difference.\n\n“What if she were your child?” I mumbled.\n\n“Well,” Dr. Garton said, exhaling, “I would probably take her back to Haiti, let her enjoy the summer, be with her friends, until ...”\n\nIt’s in the “until” that everything awful lies.\n\nNow, generally, I am inclined to heed doctors’ advice. But I found myself growing defensive, like a manager whose boxer was being underestimated.\n\n“No, she’s a fighter,” I finally said, looking over at Janine, who nodded. “And if she fights, we’re gonna fight.”\n\nDr. Garton leaned back. “All right,” he said.\n\nAnd then, for a few moments, we all just sat there, staring at an invisible battle plan.\n\nLESSON TWO\n\nTime Changes\n\nDo you remember the first morning you woke up at our house, Chika? I was already down in my office, because mornings are when I write. Suddenly, my phone rang; it was Miss Janine, calling from the bedroom. In a raspy, just-woke-up voice, she said, “Mister Mitch, Chika is hungry for breakfast. Can you help her?”\n\nI came upstairs and led you to the kitchen, and we found eggs and butter and some cheese and tomatoes. I showed you the frying pan, the burner, and you stood on your tip-toes and helped move the spatula around. I poured juice. We said our prayers.\n\nAnd I watched you eat.\n\nAnd I watched you eat some more.\n\nTo call it “leisurely” doesn’t come close. You chewed. You looked out the window. You put down your fork, yawned, and picked up your fork again. You swayed back and forth to some internal rhythm. It took nearly an hour. I would compare this to the pace that I eat breakfast, except I don’t eat breakfast.\n\nBut the next morning, when I heard your feet thumping down the steps at 7 a.m., I rose from my desk, met you at the door, lifted you as you said, “Mister Mitch, I am hungry!” and carried you up to the kitchen.\n\nA child is both an anchor and a set of wings.\n\nMy old way of doing things was gone.\n\n* * *\n\nDo you know how old I am, Chika? You used to guess “Thirty!” and when I said no, you tried “A hundred!” Relative age must be so mysterious to children, who count their time in half years. (“I’m five and a half!”) But we were in our late 50s when you came to live with us, young enough to maintain our routines, old enough to bristle at changing them.\n\nNot surprisingly, Miss Janine was faster at adapting than me. I think she was always, in some manner, preparing for this day.\n\nOn the other hand, when I was younger, I was afraid of becoming a father. I saw how it ate up the hours. I worried that I wouldn’t give it the proper time and would wind up being a bad dad. Also, to be totally honest, I thought it would hinder my career. I was advancing fast and wanted to keep up that pace. Ambition is not something I ever warned you about, Chika, but I have learned it can overtake you gradually, like clouds moving across the sun, until, consumed by pursuing it, you get used to a dimmer existence.\n\nI was a foolish man in many ways, Chika, when I look back on things.\n\nAnd then you, with your unhurried ways. You were 5 years old, but such a curious 5-year-old. If you saw squirrels darting up a tree, you shouted “Squirrels!” then asked where they were going, then asked if they could see you. You had questions about books. Questions about food. Questions about clouds and angels. You examined your entire inventory of clothes before getting dressed.\n\n“Those red socks are good,” I’d suggest.\n\n“I think I want the green ones.”\n\n“The green ones are good.”\n\n“No, wait, wait. The blue.”\n\nWith little choice, we slowed to your rhythm. We kneeled to your sight line. Before you came to us, we would watch TV in bed, and often fall asleep with the TV still playing. Once you arrived, we shut the lights and tiptoed around you in the darkness. Often, in the dead of night, you would wake us up.\n\n“Mister Miiiitch?” . . .\n\n“Hmm?”\n\n“I have to go potty.”\n\nI would guide you to the bathroom, then wait, yawning, outside the doorframe. I’d hear you flush, help you wash your hands, then guide you to your bed, which was nice and low so you could tumble into it.\n\n“Is she OK?” Miss Janine would whisper as I crawled back in beside her.\n\n“She’s fine,” I’d mumble, closing my eyes. “She’s good.”\n\nThe most precious thing you can give someone is your time, Chika, because you can never get it back.\n\nWhen you don’t think about getting it back, you’ve given it in love.\n\nI learned that from you.\n\n* * *\n\nAs time passes, Chika acquires clothes, some that we buy her, some that our friends bring her. She likes to dress up, the frillier the better. She marches around in Janine’s high heels. She drapes herself in multiple necklaces. She wears two hats at the same time.\n\n“She likes to gild the lily,” Janine jokes.\n\nOne day Chika and I are heading out.\n\n“Hold on,” I say. “You have something on your face.”\n\n“What?” she says.\n\nI grab a napkin. I pat the area around her lips.\n\n“You’re kind of wet here. How did you get all wet?”\n\n“Mister Mitch!” She throws up her hands. “That’s my lip gloss!”\n\nLESSON THREE\n\nA Sense of Wonder\n\nWe took you to Disneyland once, Chika. Do you remember? It was after the radiation treatments. We flew to California. I bought tickets for a weekday. We arrived before the park even opened.\n\nWhat I remember most is what you did first. We entered through Main Street, passing souvenir shops. The rides were up ahead, and I wondered which would make you scream, “Can we do that one?”\n\nInstead we passed a small pond, and a gray duck wandered out of the water. And with Astro Orbitor to your right, Thunder Mountain to your left, and Sleeping Beauty’s Castle straight ahead, you pointed down and yelled, “Look! A duck!” And you chased after it and giggled wildly, “Duck! Duck!”\n\nWith all those amusement park attractions calling, you got low to marvel at another living creature.\n\nOne of the best things a child can do for an adult is to draw them down, closer to the ground, for clearer reception to the voices of the earth. You did that for me, Chika. We buried in leaves. We studied ants in the driveway. We rolled in snow — which astonished you the first time you saw it — and made your very first snowman. You put me on the other end of a magnifying glass or a toy telescope, and through those lenses, I could marvel at the world the way you did. You were an unfailing antidote to adult preoccupation.\n\nAll you had to say was, “Look!”\n\nChildren wonder at the world. Parents wonder at their children’s wonder. In so doing, we are all together young.\n\nUs\n\nSummer is over before Chika appears again. I switch from shorts to long pants, and turn off the ceiling fans in the office. Chika always liked this office. When she came through the door she would lift her eyes to the tall bookshelves. She knew this was where I wrote, and that I needed quiet when I did. Perhaps getting to enter made her feel special.\n\nThis time, when she arrives, she taps me from behind and I nearly jump out of the chair. She laughs hysterically.\n\n“What are you doing?” she asks.\n\nWriting.\n\n“About me?”\n\nLike you wanted me to.\n\n“Hmmph.”\n\nShe spins to the piano behind us.\n\n“Let’s play something.”\n\nI have always had a piano in my office, owing to my earlier days as a musician. Chika starts whacking the keys, making the same cacophony she made when she was alive.\n\n“Don’t bang,” I used to scold. Then one day, I brought her to visit a friend, a jazz musician, who listened as she pounded, then stood over her and created a bass line with his left hand and chords with his right, a tuneful bed to envelop her wanderings. That was the last time I told Chika what to play. Everything in this world is music if you can hear it. Make a joyful noise, the psalm says.\n\nWe sit and tap out “Jingle Bells.” I sing, Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh, over fields we go —\n\n“Through the fields,” she corrects.\n\nThrough the fields?\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nNot “over” fields?\n\n“No. See.” She sings, “Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh, through the fields we go ...”\n\nI start to sing with her, but she puts her hand over my mouth, then finishes with, “laughing all the way, ha-ha-HA!”\n\nYou have to do that? I ask, smiling.\n\nShe grins. Most times we sang, Chika cupped her palm over my mouth, a clear sign that her act was solo. It made me laugh then. It makes me laugh now.\n\nYou\n\nI want to write about your voice, Chika, because I think about it often, and I hear it all the time.\n\nEvery child has a feature that jumps out when you meet them. The kid with the long curls. The kid with the weird laugh. Yours was your voice. It reflected you perfectly. It was a chameleon, ever-changing. High-pitched and booming during the day. Lilting and tender at night. A sweet sandpaper in the mornings, so scratchy that Miss Janine and I would privately joke, “She hasn’t been smoking, has she?”\n\nIt was a drawled-out “Yeaaaah” when you reluctantly agreed with us; it was a cannon shot “WHY?” when you didn’t get your way. It was the whimper of a fairy when you said, “I’m sorry,” and a peacock’s squawk when you won a game. (I remember us playing tic-tac-toe and you cooing, “Bye-bye!” when you won. Trash talk from a 5-year-old.)\n\nYour voice was made for music, Chika, you had great pitch, and you often sang softly to yourself in the evenings; but when you wanted to, you could belt like Ethel Merman. One time, Miss Janine was helping you put on your nightgown, and as you wiggled through the sleeves, you were singing “L-O-V-E” by Nat King Cole, which they use in the movie The Parent Trap. When you got to the end, and sang that love was meant for me and “YOUUUUU,” you spread your arms and threw back your head, as if a massive concert hall audience were wildly applauding. What joy you brought to your performance!\n\nYour voice was a weather vane, it told us how your wind was blowing. When we flew to New York for an experimental medical treatment, you were particularly verbal: you asked me many questions, you were funny with the flight attendant, and you counted down from 20 until the wheels touched the tarmac. As we rose to deplane, a man who’d been sitting behind us said, “Excuse me, I just have to tell you, your daughter has the sweetest voice.”\n\nI was so touched by that. I made sure you thanked him for the compliment, never mentioning the effect the words “your daughter” had on me.\n\nThey say eyes are the reflection of the soul, Chika, but your voice was its echo, and we miss it every day. It was all the things you are, or were, or are still somewhere else, when you are not here with me in the mornings, rolling on the maroon carpet.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter six months in America, we take Chika back to Haiti for Christmas.\n\nShe is giddy with excitement. The night before, she crawls on the bed and tickles me until I beg her to stop. Then she asks what’s going to happen, step by step.\n\nAs I go through it, her eyes drift away. She doesn’t look like she did when she left Haiti. She’s lost hair. She’s lost teeth. The operations. The steroids. I ask if she is scared to be going back.\n\n“A little scared,” she says, making a small space between two fingers. “I’m crying happy tears.”\n\nShe has never used that phrase before. Happy tears. I wonder where she gets such insight.\n\nThe next morning, for the big day, she wears white tights and sneakers, with a lime-green hoodie over a sleeveless top. We board the plane and she glues to the window.\n\nAs soon as we land in Port-au-Prince, she runs up the jetway, all but leaving me behind. The airport band starts playing, banjo, accordion, guitar, bongo drums, and she dances in the hallway, shaking and twirling in a way that proves she is home, because only home could liberate such joy.\n\nAlain, our Haitian director, meets us in baggage claim. We load in his vehicle, and Chika hides behind his seat as we drive through the mission gates. The kids have been informed of her return and they are chanting “Chika! Chika!” as we pull in. Alain looks back in amazement and says, “Do you hear this?”\n\n“Don’t look at me, Mister Alain!” she squeals. “Look at something else!”\n\nWhen the car door opens, there is a massive rush and the nannies are shouting and the little kids are jumping and there are so many hands around her, lifting her up, as her face is smacked with kisses. When they finally put her down, she wiggles her little black shoes in the dirt. Then she pulls off the hoodie and runs to the swing set, jumps on a swing, and pushes herself higher, as the other kids gather and watch.\n\nIf I could freeze any moment and give it to her as a gift, it might be this one, flying over the happy expressions of her brothers and sisters as they marvel at her return. I rub my eyes. Happy tears.\n\nMe\n\nI should tell you where my notions of fatherhood come from, Chika.\n\nMy father was a good man. He lived to be 88. You met him once, when he was gray and stooped and confined to a wheelchair. But when he was younger, he looked a good deal like I do now, although his whiskers were thicker and he combed his hair back in the style of the day.\n\nHis name was Ira, and he grew up in Brooklyn, a middle child, like me, between a sister and a brother. His father, my grandfather, was a Polish immigrant, a plumber, who taught his son to work with his hands only until he could work with his mind. My father went from high school to college to the Air Force to an accountant job. He was not one to wander.\n\nMy grandfather was quiet, and my father would follow suit, and we, his children — my brother, sister, and me — grew up expecting the words that came from his mouth to matter. I can never recall the man going on about anything. He said what he had to say and was done with it. He had a deep, baritone voice (he once dreamed of being an opera singer), which made even his simple remarks sound serious. He was serious most of the time.\n\nBut there was, beneath his efficiencies, a warm, protective aura, a soul upon whom others could rely. When my mother’s father died of a heart attack — she was 16 at the time — it was my father, only 17, who stepped in and took control of the household. Although they’d been dating less than a year, he cooked breakfast for my mother’s family, did chores in the afternoons, and became a dad to her young brother. That’s a lot of responsibility for someone still in high school, but if you knew my father, you would say it suited him.\n\nI always felt safe around my father. I have a memory of swimming with him in a local lake when I was maybe 6 years old. We would go there on hot summer days, many families did, and I was paddling away to explore, the way children do.\n\n“Don’t go too far now,” my father said, but I kept going until it felt like I’d reached foreign waters. Suddenly, some older boys who were horsing around pointed at me and yelled, “Let’s get him!” I don’t know what motivated them, or how serious they were, but I remember feeling terrified, acutely aware of the distance I had drifted from my dad. I swam as I had never swum before, splashing wildly, gulping water, certain those older boys were going to grab my legs and pull me to some hidden underwater prison. As I reached my father, I hurled my arms around his midsection, gasping for air. When I peeked out, the boys had gone.\n\nMy dad barely moved. He never asked what happened. But to this day, I can still feel his waist in my wet grip, and the comfort it gave me. For many years, that was my perception of fatherhood, a place where a child can find sanctuary. Perhaps this is why I took over the orphanage. Perhaps I’ve grown into my father that way.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen my father died, Chika, I felt rudderless in this world, with a deep, anguished yearning for a comfort no longer there. I missed him more than I even imagined I would, and my brother and sister told me the same thing.\n\nThey say as you age you become more and more like your parents. And perhaps that is true. If so, if I ever offered you security the way my dad offered it to me, then I am glad. I know I tried. I remember times when you and I were walking and, without prompting, you reached out and took my hand, your little fingers sliding into mine. I would like to tell you how that felt, but it is too big for words.\n\nI can only say that it made me feel like a father, and nearly all of what I learned about that role, I learned from the man who raised me, and the rest I learned from you.\n\nLESSON FOUR\n\nKid Tough\n\nChad Carr passed away.\n\nThe cherubic little blond-haired boy whose father carried him onto the Michigan football field died exactly 14 months after his DIPG diagnosis. I shivered when I heard the news. Janine started crying.\n\nBecause his grandfather, Lloyd, was the famous Michigan football coach, Chad’s death made news across the country, and brought a rare spotlight to this horrific disease. People were reminded that Neil Armstrong, before he ever walked on the moon, lost his 2-year-old daughter to the same affliction in 1962. Little had changed in all those years. DIPG remained a wrathful thief, preying on children, robbing families of their present and their future.\n\nThe Carr family started a foundation in their son’s memory. They called it ChadTough. And while you are not here for me to read this to you, Chika, I want to say what I have learned about that word, tough, because children, especially sick children, have a toughness unique to their young souls, one that can comfort even the fretting adults around them.\n\nThis is something you taught me. This is fourth on my list.\n\nLet me share an example. There was a night in Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, during our second try at the CED process, when you were again being infused with the radioactive iodine antibody. It traveled from a large box, through a long tube, and down the catheter into your head. It took 12 hours.\n\nAround 3 a.m., I was sleeping in a chair across from your bed. For some reason, my eyes flicked open, and in the darkness, I saw you standing right in front of me, your head tilted, like something from a horror movie. The catheter was poking up from your cranium, its cord stretched back as taut as a tightrope.\n\n“Chika!” I screamed.\n\n“I want to go to the toy store,” you rasped.\n\nI rushed you back to the bed, praying you hadn’t yanked the catheter loose. I yelled for the nurses, who raced in, stunned. For the next hour, we waited anxiously until Dr. Souweidane arrived. He, too, was astonished. None of his patients had ever gotten out of bed during that procedure, let alone walk across a room.\n\nThankfully, you did no damage, and we all collapsed with relief. Come morning, you barely remembered it.\n\nKid Tough.\n\nUs\n\n“Mister Mitch?”\n\nHmm?\n\n“Christmas is coming.”\n\nShe sits in her little chair, wearing a blue dress, slippers, and a pink earflap hat. She pulls the flap cords down around her cheeks. She has appeared several times since vanishing on Thanksgiving morning, but her visits are shorter now, and she wears different clothes each time.\n\nDo you remember all your Christmases? I ask.\n\n“How many did I have?”\n\nWell, you had two with your mommy.\n\n“But I was so LITTLE!”\n\nAnd one with your Godmommy.\n\n“How many at the mission?”\n\nThree.\n\n“How many at your house?”\n\nOne.\n\n“When?”\n\nThe last year.\n\nShe lets go of the earflaps.\n\n“I know, I know.” She sighs.\n\nWhat?\n\n“That’s not a lot of Christmases for a little girl.”\n\nI didn’t say that.\n\nShe taps her head. “You said it here.”\n\nYou\n\nOne day I came home to find you playing a card game with our friend Nicole. You drew a card and she drew a card, and she made a joke and you laughed. It seemed perfectly normal, except Nicole was 38 years older than you.\n\nAnd she was on the younger end of your American playmates.\n\nYou went camping with our friends Jeff and Patty, who were already grandparents. Miss Janine’s sisters Kathy and Tricia, in their 50s, would take you to get your nails painted. Our friend Dr. Val, in her 60s, would take you home to play with her dog.\n\nYou had a network of companions who ranged from two to five decades older than you, and while they were mostly our work colleagues or familial connections, you called them “my friends.” You were a pied piper of grownups, many of whose children were out of the house and who found in you a brief reconnection with the wonder of little souls.\n\nOf course, you would have preferred some little souls of your own. And had Miss Janine and I been of normal parenting age, our nieces and nephews would have been your mates. But they were grown now, too. We tried taking you to places with other children— fairs, church events, holiday celebrations at a local health club. But sometimes other kids didn’t know what to make of you and your challenges, and you’d walk back to us and say, “They didn’t want to play with me.”\n\nYou missed going to school. We tried to re-create that, but, given the constant medical attention, we could only homeschool you with lessons sent by my sister, Miss Cara, who runs our school at the orphanage, and friends like Miss Diane, a retired teacher who sat with you for hours doing spelling and mathematics. We even dressed you in your Haitian school clothes, a purple shirt, navy blue skirt, white socks and black shoes, so it would feel more like the mission.\n\nBut it wasn’t the mission. The mission would have meant dozens of children, laughing and yelling and racing to their classrooms, not a lonely kitchen table overlooking our backyard.\n\n* * *\n\nOf course, there were a few children you befriended in America. One of them was our nephew Aidan, who was 8 when you arrived, and who took to you immediately. A soft-spoken, gently mannered boy, with thick, cowlicked brown hair, he played anything you wanted to play, and watched whatever you wanted to watch. And it was pretty clear, after several months, that you were, as my grandmother used to say, “sweet on him.” You dressed up when he was coming over. You got bashful when he arrived. You were quieter, even deferential.\n\nYou and Aidan went on boat rides together and to the aquarium together, and one time at his house you danced together to a video of the Cha-Cha Slide, and when he fell down you slapped him on the butt.\n\nWhen you spoke about growing up and getting married, which you did all the time, we would tease you and mention Aidan’s name and you would get a silly grin or say, “I dunno ...” or “Maybe ...”\n\nAnd then one summer night, more than a year after you’d been with us, when your walking had deteriorated and your left eye no longer blinked and your therapies included sitting for hours with a needle in your arm, you were lying in bed, having just watched a princess movie. And you asked if you could one day marry a prince.\n\nMiss Janine said, “What about Aidan? He’s not a prince, but he’s a really nice boy. Would you want to marry him?”\n\nYou made a face. “Aidan will not marry a girl like me.”\n\nWe looked at each other.\n\n“Why do you say that, Chika?”\n\n“Because Aidan will not marry a girl who cannot walk.”\n\nYou said it so innocently, so matter-of-factly, that it robbed us of our breath. And while we recovered to offer the standard adult response, that love doesn’t care about sickness or health, inside we were trembling, because we saw in you something, with your disease, that we were terrified of seeing in ourselves.\n\nAcceptance.\n\nUs\n\nChika? I say.\n\nI don’t see her. But I hear muffled laughter.\n\nI get out of my chair. I walk around the room. It is more than a month since her last visit.\n\nWhere is Chika? I say.\n\nThis was a frequent game we played. Finding Chika. She would hide when she heard the front door open, under a blanket or beneath the kitchen table, and you’d have to yell, “Where is Chika? We lost her! Where is she?” until your voice displayed enough panic that she would burst forth and shout in her budding English, “Here is me!” Then she’d crack up laughing and throw her shoulders forward in hysterics. I have never witnessed a child happier to be discovered.\n\nNow, apparently, we are playing the game again.\n\nWhere is Chika? I intone. Where did she go?\n\nI see a blanket spread over a futon, which I sleep on sometimes when I write into the night. I grab the blanket. I make my voice playful.\n\nIs she under ... here? I say, yanking it up.\n\n“Nooooo,” she answers, from across the room.\n\nI turn. She is standing by my desk, reading the yellow pad. So I guess the game is over.\n\n“What does it mean?” she asks.\n\nLESSON FIVE\n\nWhen children are yours and not yours\n\nOccasionally, even friends of ours would use the “yours” word. “It’s great what you’re doing for a child that’s not yours.” It stung me to hear it, and puzzled me to think there would be a difference in our efforts if somehow you had our DNA. I remember once we stood by a mirror, studying our reflections, and you held your arm up next to mine. I thought you were comparing our skin color. Instead, you pointed to a mole near my wrist and said, “Mister Mitch, why do you have that bump?” That’s all you were interested in.\n\nYours, not yours. The paperwork at the orphanage is signed by me. It obligates us to nurture, feed, educate, and protect the children — all things mothers and fathers are supposed to do. But in the end, it is a document of responsibility, not parenthood. I am, for all our kids, just Mr. Mitch, their “legal guardian,” the words I used at the first hospital you and I went to, Chika. It feels sometimes like a diminished title. Still, when I look around, it is me, or Miss Janine, or our compassionate staff at the mission, kissing the children good night, waking them every morning, tying their shoes, cutting their sandwiches, reading them books, racing them to the doctor if something happens.\n\nWe did not bring any of these little souls into the world. That truth can never be overstated. But recently, one of our oldest kids, for whom we arranged a college scholarship in the U.S., honored a request to see his biological father in Haiti, who had never been a part of his life. The man quickly dragged him to his friends and bragged, “Look at my son! He’s so smart he’s in American college!” The young man said it made him resentful, as if this person, despite a lifelong absence, deserved credit for how he’d turned out.\n\nI wonder, Chika, if anyone has blind claim over a child, save for God. I have witnessed the purest connection between an adoptive mother and her children, and I have witnessed helpless infants shunned by those who birthed them. The opposite also happens. After a while, you make peace with the truth: love determines our bonds. It always comes down to that.\n\nThe day we arrived in Haiti for a second visit, you vomited. And that night, you cried yourself to sleep. The next day, you seemed so weak, that when the time came to leave, you didn’t even say goodbye to the kids. You just took my hand and led me to the car.\n\nAt the Port-au-Prince airport, you complained about walking, so I carried you through the lines, one arm tucked beneath you, one arm wheeling my roller bag. When we boarded the plane, I put a pillow on the armrest.\n\n“Go to sleep, sweetheart,” I said, softly.\n\nYou lay your head down. After a few seconds you mumbled, “Mister Mitch?”\n\n“Yes, Chika?”\n\n“What will you do while I sleep?”\n\n“I’ll read,” I said. “And think about how much I love you.”\n\nYou nodded, your eyes glazed.\n\n“That’s what I’ll do, too.”\n\nAt that moment, I didn’t care about who belonged to whom. I was yours, even if you were not mine. And as I stroked your forehead, which was hot to the touch, I knew I always would be.\n\nYou\n\nI want to speak about joy.\n\nWhen I look back on our journey, there were times we didn’t give enough weight to it. In the later stages, your daily needs were so great. Dressing you took longer. Bathing you was a meticulous process. Your PICC line needed to be flushed and kept sterile. Lifting and carrying you required me or someone else always to be present.\n\nBecause of this, we sometimes overlooked the fact that, despite the physical challenges, your mind kept growing. Your thoughts deepened. And we might have missed the joy of your blossoming into a fully formed young person — had you not made sure to reveal it in unique linguistic ways.\n\nOne time I was reading a long email, and I sighed and mumbled, “Oh, boy.”\n\n“Why do you say, ‘Oh, boy?' ” you asked. “There are no boys here.”\n\n“It’s just an expression, Chika.”\n\n“Why don’t you say, ‘Oh, girl?' ”\n\nAnother time, you asked for a glass of water. I warned you it was cold.\n\n“Cold water, warm heart,” you said.\n\nOne morning, down in my office, my phone rang. It was you calling on the other line.\n\n“Mister Mitch, do you want to come play fluffy, cozy bed camp?”\n\nI entered the bedroom to find you and Miss Janine beneath the covers. When I crawled under, you said, “These are the rules of fluffy, cozy bed camp. I am the boss. Miss Janine is the second boss. You can be the third boss. Now. Let’s play.”\n\nIf I could change anything from those moments, Chika, it would be to stay in them a little longer. Immerse ourselves so we never forget. I rarely use the word rejoice in daily life, but it is the word I am looking for here. Rejoice. Revel in the funny business. It is quite something, when I look at photos of those days, to see your tireless crooked smile while miniature golfing, although you could barely swing the club, or on trips to the supermarket, although you had to sit in the basket, or a visit to the state fair, although I had to carry you from ride to ride.\n\nNo matter how engrossed we got in the medical struggle, you were indefatigable when it came to fun.\n\nTo paraphrase Emily Dickinson, because we could not stop for joy, you kindly stopped instead.\n\nYou awed us with your spirit.\n\nMe\n\nAs I write deeper into these pages, I find I am growing physically ill. My feet tingle. My hands get clammy. My head feels clogged and slightly dizzy. One morning, sitting at the keyboard, I begin to tremble, my pulse races, and I feel sweat beading on my forehead. My cheek goes numb. I wonder if I am going to pass out, or worse, suffer a stroke.\n\nIt happens several times. I visit doctors. Their tests come back clear. MRI. EKG. Blood work. I am told to hydrate more, drink less caffeine, get sleep. Perhaps not sit so long hunched over the screen, writing this story, as my spine and hips and neck are paying a price. But I continue to feel out of sorts, and sometimes my blood rushes and I feel as anxious as an accused man awaiting a jury.\n\nJanine has her own diagnosis. “You’re sitting there every day, revisiting a really hard time. It’s emotional. You’re grieving. You can’t be surprised that your body is reacting to that.”\n\n“But why now?” I say, pushing back. “I made peace with all this already, didn’t I?”\n\nJanine looks at me as if I’m being naive.\n\n“You loved her, Mitch.”\n\nThat is all she says.\n\nAnd that is what makes telling this last part so hard.\n\n* * *\n\nWe had a routine about love, Chika and me. I’m not sure when it started. I would slide in front of her if she seemed sad, and I’d say, “Chika, have I told you today how much I love you?”\n\nAnd, knowing what was coming, she would play coy. “Nooo,” she’d answer.\n\n“This much!” I’d reply. And I’d stretch out my arms.\n\nWith each passing week I’d stretch farther, because I knew she was measuring. In time, I advanced to hooking my arms behind my back, and spinning to show her my grip.\n\n“Thisssss muchhh,” I’d warble, straining.\n\nIt brought a laugh, a satisfied laugh, because she knew I had gone the limit for her. She was always a little happier after that. A little calmer. And so was I.\n\nI still remember the first time Chika said “I love you.” It took a while. She would welcome the words from me or Janine, but she seemed in no rush to return them.\n\nOne night, when she had been with us maybe four months, I was in an airport and called home. Chika was energized. She enjoyed having Janine to herself. They were playing some sort of game.\n\n“OK,” I said at the end, “you be a good girl.”\n\n“I will,” Chika said.\n\n“I love you.”\n\n“I love you, too!”\n\nI blinked and felt a rush of joy. I wanted to shout to Janine, \"Did you hear that? Did she really just say it?\"\n\nBut Chika hung up the phone, in a hurry to return to playtime, and I was left staring at the cell in my hands. It felt wonderful, just the same.\n\n* * *\n\nOne afternoon, we hear her singing from the bedroom. Janine gets a camera. It’s a gospel song called “No Longer a Slave” that the kids in Haiti do in devotions. Chika is singing it verse after verse, sitting up in bed, wearing a yellow T-shirt and pajama pants.\n\nNormally, when an adult enters a room, children will stop singing, especially if that adult is trying to film them. But when Janine enters, Chika doesn’t stop. Her eyes are almost glazed, and she seems in communion with something invisible.\n\n“I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\n\"I am a child of God.”\n\nShe sings it for eight minutes. Nonstop. Even with the camera inches away from her face. When she finishes, she lies down and closes her eyes.\n\nJanine emerges from the room, stunned.\n\n“She sang to herself all that time?” I ask.\n\n“Not to herself,” Janine answers. “She was talking to God.”\n\nLESSON SEVEN\n\nWhat We Carry\n\nOne afternoon, when you could no longer walk on your own, we were coloring at the kitchen table. I glanced at my watch and realized I was late. I stood up.\n\n“Sorry, Chika, I have to go.”\n\n“No, no,” you protested. “Stay and color.”\n\n“Chika, I have to work.”\n\n“Mister Mitch, I have to play.”\n\n“But this is my job.”\n\n“No, it’s not!” You crossed your arms. “Your job is carrying me.”\n\nI have thought about that sentence more than you could imagine. At the time, I laughed it off as you being your lovable, bossy self. But the more you weakened, the more you needed me to transport you even across the room, the more I realized the wisdom of your words. Your job is carrying me.\n\nThat line became the underpinning of the final item on my list, maybe the biggest lesson you taught me.\n\nWhat we carry defines who we are. And the effort we make is our legacy. It can be the burden of feeding your family, the responsibility of caring for patients, the good that you feel you must do for others, or the sins that you will not release.\n\nWhatever it is, we all carry something, every day. And for all your time with us — as you so defiantly stated, Chika — my job was carrying you.\n\nMy job was — and is — carrying your brothers and sisters in the orphanage.\n\nMy job, it turns out, after so many years without them, is carrying children.\n\nIt is the most wonderful weight to bear.\n\n* * *\n\nOne night, while she can still speak, Chika takes a small stuffed bear to bed. A gift from the hospital. A Care Bear, they call it.\n\nThe bedroom is dark. I kneel down next to her.\n\n“Well, hello,” I whisper to the bear. “Do you belong to Chika?”\n\nChika puts the bear in front of her face.\n\n“Yes,” she murmurs.\n\n“You’re a lucky bear. I think Chika is a really special girl.\"\n\n“Uh-huh.”\n\n“But don’t tell her. That’s between you and me.”\n\n“I am Chika’s bear,” she says, “so I have to tell her everything.”\n\n“Well, don’t tell her how much I love her. It’s a secret.”\n\n“Chika already knows how much you love her.”\n\n“She does?” I say, skeptically. “How much?”\n\nChika takes the arms of the bear and does what I always do, pulling them around until they touch behind its back.\n\n“Thiiisss much.”\n\nMy eyes tear up.\n\n“That’s right,” I whisper. “That much.”\n\nFROM “FINDING CHIKA” copyright (c) 2019 by ASOP Inc.

It was a year that saw the president open up trade wars, meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, spar with the press and defend hush money payments to women he allegedly had affairs with, all while new revelations and indictments poured out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\nPolicies and politics divided us. We found ourselves embroiled in a fierce immigration debate. Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ascended to the high court despite sexual assault allegations from Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nNature humbled us. California burned as the Camp Fire became the most destructive in state history. Hurricane winds and floods battered the Carolinas. But other stories made us proud. Team USA brought home 23 Olympic medals from Pyeongchang, South Korea. Teachers fought for better pay.\n\nWe exercised our rights, voting in the most tumultuous midterms in years. Democrats gained control of the House, Republicans expanded their Senate majority, and voters made history, ushering into Congress many firsts for women and minorities.\n\nThen, we ended the year with a solemn goodbye. Funeral services for George H.W. Bush were a farewell not only to a former president, but also to a generation.\n\nAfter another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state that moved us – the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.\n\nMore:Our most-read stories of 2018\n\nPassages:Aretha Franklin, Stephen Hawking, George H.W. Bush and other luminaries: A look at legends we’ve lost in 2018\n\nMore:Striking images: A photo a day from 2018\n\nAlabama\n\nJeff Sessions, the Russia investigation and high-profile White House departures\n\nThe former Alabama senator's beleaguered tenure as U.S. Attorney General finally ended in November, one day after the midterm elections. While Sessions was one of President Donald Trump’s earliest supporters, he was berated by the commander-in-chief for recusing himself from the investigation into Russian meddling of the 2016 presidential election. Sessions' departure was just one of the many notable firings and resignations from the Trump administration in 2018, including chief of staff John Kelly and secretary of state Rex Tillerson. As for the Russia investigation: Trump has denied wrongdoing, and repeatedly called special counsel Robert Mueller's looming investigation a \"witch hunt.\" Earlier this month, Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison – the first sentencing for a member of the president's inner circle, and one that could hold legal perils for Trump.\n\nAlaska\n\nMassive quake turns disaster into a learning experience\n\nA magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck near Anchorage on Nov. 30 sliced opened roads, knocked out power and damaged buildings. Over 3,000 aftershocks have rattled the region, though no deaths or serious injuries were reported. Meanwhile, recovery efforts, made more difficult by the cold, have become the envy of the nation after work crews repaired major road damage within four days after the quake. Delivery of food supplies, fuel and other cargo has not been interrupted, according to officials, who said that crews will redo the majority of their work in the summer to ensure long-term sustainability.\n\nArizona\n\n'You're telling me that my assault doesn't matter': Contentious Kavanaugh hearings\n\nChristine Blasey Ford testified with quiet, measured emotion that Brett Kavanaugh forced her onto a bed and tried to remove her clothes at a party when both were teens. Kavanaugh yelled, cried and interrupted when it was his turn in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A day later, a protester who said she was sexually assaulted approached outgoing Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator. \"You're telling me that my assault doesn't matter,\" the audibly emotional woman told Flake. The moment seemed to matter, as it was Flake, alongside Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who called for a week-long FBI investigation. Ultimately, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nViral photo shows a brother saying goodbye too soon\n\nAn Arkansas family's tragic photo captured hearts around the nation in June as it showed the moment a brother said goodbye to his dying little sister. Adalynn Sooter, 4, lost her battle with a rare brain tumor, but her siblings got one last chance to spend time together. Jackson, 6, rubbed his sister's head as she grasped his hand. Then Jackson said goodnight. Addy was Jackson's \"playmate, his best friend, his little sister,\" father Matt Sooter wrote on Facebook. \"This isn't how it's supposed to be.\" Though her condition worsened and the rare tumor took her life hours later, the family found hope: \"She wasn't in any pain at the end,\" her father wrote.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWildfires devastate the Golden State\n\n6,228 wildfires. Over 876,000 acres charred. At least 100 deaths. California was devastated by historic blazes this year which will likely impact the state for decades. In Northern California, the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history, killed nearly three times as many people as the Griffith Park Fire – a record that stood for 85 years. And the worst may be yet to come: According to a new study, wildfires in California may be more commonplace with the brutal combination of hot and dry weather linked to climate change. Meanwhile, homeowners affected by the deadly blazes face dilemmas on whether to rebuild in high-risk areas repeatedly ravaged by fires.\n\nColorado\n\n'Most inhumane and vicious crime': No parole for dad who killed pregnant wife and 2 kids\n\nChristopher Watts gave an emotional TV interview the day after his pregnant wife and two daughters were reported missing in August, pleading for their safe return. Shortly after, he was arrested and charged in their gruesome deaths. Watts drove the bodies to an oil field and buried his wife in a shallow grave. He shoved Bella and Celeste in two separate oil tanks, pushing their bodies through openings that were only 8 inches in diameter. In November, the suburban Denver dad was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison and 84 additional years with no possibility of parole.\n\nConnecticut\n\nTeacher fired for running student 'fight club'\n\nA former substitute teacher at a Connecticut high school was fired and faced charges after police discovered he was running a \"fight club\" inside of his math class. Ryan Fish, 23, encouraged high school students in Montville to physically battle as students recorded the fights and cheered. Police became involved when a social worker reported a 15-year-old student was traumatized after being robbed and beaten by his classmates. Fish was fired from his position at the school and faced felony and misdemeanor charges associated with child endangerment. Those charges will be dropped if Fish completes the state's accelerated rehabilitation program, a judge ruled in October.\n\nDelaware\n\nVirtual reality lets chemo patients ditch sterile hospitals for tranquil woods\n\nAs poison dripped into her veins, Kathleen Krakowski heard birds chirping and watched leaves sway in the wind. Krakowski, a breast cancer patient, sat in chemotherapy at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute in Newark, but she gazed into a serene forest within a virtual reality headset. \"It doesn't look fake at all,\" she said. Patients could also sit on the beach or admire a mountainside, forgetting – if only for minutes – the sterile hospital room and deadly illnesses, nurses said. More health-focused VR programs are coming to ease challenges for women in labor and those in chronic pain, too, VR companies VRHealth and Oculus announced in September.\n\nFlorida\n\nThey witnessed a mass shooting at school. Then they marched for their lives\n\nParkland became the site of a mass school shooting when a former student killed 17 people, including students, a football coach and an athletic director, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day. Police arrested Nikolas Cruz, who now faces the death penalty among other charges. Cruz was known to police, who had received 18 calls between 2008 and 2017 warning about him – some directly concerned about him opening fire at school. Amid criticism, an armed school resource officer who never went into the school during the shooting retired. But Parkland students emerged from the tragedy fueling a movement and marches against gun violence across the nation that also targeted NRA-backed candidates in midterm elections. The students were recently awarded a global peace award and praised as \"true change-makers.\"\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrian Kemp wins, Stacey Abrams sues\n\nWhen many Americans were asking who to vote for on election day, claims of voter suppression left some Georgians asking whether their votes would be counted fairly. In a close race, Democrat Stacey Abrams vied to become the nation's first black woman governor, while Republican Brian Kemp sought to maintain his party's control of the office. Kemp won, but both sides claimed foul play by the other. Abrams accused Kemp of trying to suppress Democratic votes as secretary of state by removing voters from the rolls. Kemp's office said it was investigating Democrats for what it called a \"failed attempt to hack\" the registration system. And the fight isn't over: An Abrams-backed group recently filed a federal lawsuit asking a judge to order fixes to what it says are deep-seated problems in the state's election system.\n\nHawaii\n\nFalse alarm: Ballistic missile alert rattles Hawaii\n\nHawaiians were sent scrambling one January morning after an emergency alert notification warned of an incoming ballistic missile threat. Residents and vacationers ran for cover and called loved ones thinking death was imminent. The only problem? The alert was an error. Officials knew within three minutes that the error had happened, but it took 38 minutes to send out the false alarm message. The unsettling notification came after months of aggressive rhetoric from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who had threatened to strike the United States. President Donald Trump later met Kim to discuss denuclearization at a much-hyped summit in Singapore. A historic handshake between the two represented the first time a sitting U.S. president met with a North Korean leader and a major breakthrough in decades of tensions.\n\nIdaho\n\nInspiring photo shows an Idaho boy's simple, patriotic gesture\n\nAn Idaho boy who protected the American flag with his body stirred the patriotism of a nation in September. Fifth-grader Jack LeBreck lay on the ground under the flag as two other boys struggled to fold it on a windy day. The moment of respect was captured by a passerby who shared the image to Facebook, where it soon made national headlines. The image was so iconic that some questioned its authenticity. \"Was it staged?\" some asked photographer and Facebook user Amanda Reallan. Most certainly was not: \"These boys had no idea I was taking the photo,\" she said. \"They took it upon themselves to protect the flag.\"\n\nIllinois\n\nHe was stopping a gunman at a bar. He was shot by police anyway\n\nJemel Roberson was doing his job when a suburban Chicago police officer fatally shot him. The 26-year-old armed guard, who was black, had detained a suspected gunman at the bar where he worked and was waiting for police help when an officer, who is white, opened fire on him. Police say the officer ordered Roberson to drop his gun. Witnesses say they shouted that Roberson was a security guard. Roberson's death prompted cries for justice from civil rights advocates and a federal lawsuit filed by his mother against the still unnamed police officer and Midlothian, where the officer is from. And his death was just one at the hands of police 2018.\n\nIndiana\n\nAftershocks from Larry Nassar upend USA Gymnastics\n\nThe fallout from the sexual abuse committed by Larry Nassar further engulfed Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics in 2018, threatening to swallow up top executives and the sport governing body itself. Criminal cases ended in February against Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor convicted of sexually assaulting young gymnasts. USA Gymnastics' CEO resigned in September, forced out under heavy criticism. The organization filed for bankruptcy protection in December, sagging under the weight of lawsuits from survivors of Nassar's abuse. The next week, a chief for the U.S. Olympic Committee was fired after a report found both the committee and USA Gymnastics failed \"to adopt appropriate child-protective policies\" to prevent abuse.\n\nIowa\n\nMollie Tibbetts went missing. Her story gripped a nation\n\nMollie Tibbetts was last seen running along Boundary and Middle Streets in her hometown Brooklyn on July 18, surveillance footage shows. The 20-year-old University of Iowa student was reported missing the next day, sparking a monthlong search that gripped Americans from Iowa to the White House. \"I just want Mollie's family to know: You're on the hearts of every American,\" Vice President Mike Pence said Aug. 15. Authorities found her body in a cornfield southeast of Brooklyn six days later, and charged Cristhian Rivera, a 24-year-old Mexican national, with first-degree murder. Rivera, who led police to the body, said he \"blocked\" his memory after pursuing Tibbetts during her run. He pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nKansas\n\nArmy officer’s adopted Korean daughter forced to leave US\n\nA South Korean-born teenager who was adopted by her aunt and uncle in Kansas will soon be forced out of the country. Now-retired Army Lt. Col. Patrick Schreiber and his wife Soo Jin delayed a formal adoption of daughter Hyebin, in large part because Schreiber, a 27-year Army veteran, was deployed in Afghanistan where he served as an intelligence officer. Following poor legal advice, the parents formally adopted their daughter a year too late, when she was 17 – one year after the cutoff for a foreign-born child to derive citizenship from an American, according to immigration law. In September, a federal judge said the girl must leave the country immediately after she graduates Kansas University. The family said if their daughter is deported, they will move to South Korea.\n\nKentucky\n\n'It is such a shock': Two die in shooting in Kroger grocery store\n\nMinutes after trying to break into a predominately black church, a shooter gunned down two black shoppers at a Kroger grocery store in Jeffersontown in October. The suspect, Gregory Bush, was charged with federal hate crimes, and reportedly told another man who shot at him in the store's parking lot, \"Don’t shoot me. I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites.\" The community mourned the deaths of Vickie Lee Jones, 67, and Maurice E. Stallard, 69, who was shopping with his grandson at the time of the shooting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMothers keep dying in childbirth. The simple solution is ignored\n\nMore than 50,000 American women are severely injured during childbirth each year. About 700 die. Why? Medical workers skip safety practices known to head off disaster. And the deadliest state for pregnant women and new mothers is Louisiana, according to a USA TODAY investigation, \"Deadly Deliveries.\" There were 58.1 deaths for every 100,000 births in the Pelican State from 2012 to 2016. Half of these deaths could be prevented, best estimates say, and half the injuries reduced or prevented with better care. Through our investigation, USA TODAY contacted 75 hospitals in 13 states to ask if they followed certain nationally recognized safety practices. Half wouldn’t answer.\n\nMaine\n\nSmoked lobsters? Restaurant tries marijuana to ease crustacean pain\n\nAt Charlotte's Legendary Lobster Pound, your lobster might get smoked before it gets steamed. The restaurant in Southwest Harbor experimented with using marijuana to ease lobsters' pain before the steaming process. Owner Charlotte Gill said she tried it with a lobster named Roscoe, placing him in a covered box with two inches of water as marijuana smoke was pumped inside. Gill said Roscoe was more calm following his smokeout. PETA is not convinced, though. \"There is a well-established, foolproof way to prevent crustaceans from suffering, though, and that's by not eating them.\"\n\nMaryland\n\nIt was 'like a war zone,' but they still put out 'a damn paper'\n\nThe shooting was \"like a war zone.\" Five newspaper employees were killed when a gunman with a grudge opened fire on the Capital Gazette in the Annapolis. The victims: assistant editor and columnist Rob Hiaasen, special publications editor Wendi Winters, writer John McNamara, editorial page editor Gerald Fischman and sales assistant Rebecca Smith. Jarrod Ramos, now charged with five murder counts, had sued the paper over a 2011 article about his guilty plea for harassment, and he had unleashed vitriol on social media against the paper and its staff for years. But the tragedy didn't stop Capital Gazette journalists from doing their jobs after their colleagues had been killed and \"putting out a damn paper\" the next day. In December, they, along with murdered Saudi Arabian writer Jamal Khashoggi and other journalists, were named as TIME magazine's 2018 Person of the Year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nHidden dangers lurk underneath from aging gas pipes\n\nThe natural gas industry and government regulators have known the dangers of leaking gas pipelines for decades. Repairing those pipes is not only difficult and expensive, but also sometimes perilous. In September, utility crews upgrading cast iron pipes inadvertently caused fires and explosions in three northern Massachusetts towns, killing one person, injuring 21 others and leaving hundreds homeless. Investigators say Columbia Gas issued faulty work orders that contributed to the blasts. The Merrimack Valley, the area north of Boston shaken by explosions, is served by some of the nation's oldest and most leak-prone pipes, according to a USA TODAY analysis.The explosions could become the most expensive natural gas disaster ever for a utility that was already spending $80 million this year to upgrade an aging infrastructure.\n\nMichigan\n\nAretha Franklin: America says goodbye to a queen\n\nAretha Franklin, the \"Queen of Soul\" whose music shaped the American songbook for over 50 years, died of pancreatic cancer in August. Franklin was a transcendent cultural figure of the 20th century. She sang for presidents and royalty, and befriended high-profile leaders such as the Revs. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson. Amid the global glitter and acclaim, she remained loyal to her adopted home, living in the Detroit area for decades. Her marathon, 8-hour funeral featured speakers like Former President Bill Clinton and legendary record producer Clive Davis and included musical tributes from Stevie Wonder, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson. Rev. Al Sharpton called Franklin’s career the soundtrack to the Civil Rights Movement, saying \"We don’t all agree on everything, but we agree on Aretha.\"\n\nMinnesota\n\nWashington welcomes a younger, more diverse Congress\n\nIn a historic midterm season, Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar to the House of Representatives in November, where she will serve as one of the first ever Muslim women in Congress. Omar, a Somali-American former refugee, was elected alongside Rashida Tlaib in Michigan, Congress's only other Muslim woman. And they weren't alone as the 2018 elections were marked by groundbreaking firsts around the country. Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids will serve as the first Native American women in Congress. New York elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will be the youngest woman in Congress. In Colorado, Jared Polis was the first openly gay man to win a governor’s race in American history. Here are all the firsts from the 2018 midterms.\n\nMississippi\n\nSearching for answers: The FBI reopens the Emmett Till case after six decades\n\nSixty-three years have passed since Emmett Till’s gruesome murder, but the FBI announced in July it was reopening investigations into the black teen’s historic death \"after receiving new information.\" Till was visiting relatives in Money in 1955 when a white woman, Carolyn Bryant Donham, accused him of sexual harassment. Till’s body, beaten and shot, was found three days later, igniting a national debate about race and violence. Today, his family is still searching for the truth. \"We want the process to work, and we want justice to prevail for Emmett,\" Deborah Watts, Till's cousin, told USA TODAY. \"This cannot just be forgotten.\"\n\nMissouri\n\nDuck boat tragedy: 17 people die, including nine from same family\n\nIn July, an amphibious duck boat capsized during a severe storm on Table Rock Lake in Branson, leaving 17 dead, including nine members of the same family. \"My heart is very heavy,\" said Tia Coleman, who lost her husband and three kids and was one of the surviving members of the Coleman family aboard the boat. Duck boats have a long history of serious accidents, leaving more than 40 people dead since 1999. As part of an investigation into the incident, the duck boat’s captain was indicted on criminal charges last month. In September, Tia Coleman filed a lawsuit against the boat operators and manufacturer.\n\nMontana\n\nBorder Patrol agent questions women for speaking Spanish\n\nTwo U.S. citizens at a northern Montana gas station were questioned by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer for speaking Spanish earlier this year. Ana Suda captured video of the now viral encounter, where she and her friend were asked for identification because of the language they were speaking inside a convenience store gas station about 35 miles south of the U.S.-Canada border. Suda accused the agent of racial profiling. Responding to questions about the incident and whether or not to speak Spanish publicly, acting CBP commissioner Ronald Vitiello later said \"It’s not something people should be concerned about if they’re here legally.\"\n\nNebraska\n\n'Please forgive me': First-ever fentanyl execution in Nebraska\n\nThe first person ever executed in the U.S. using fentanyl had three last words for his witnesses: \"I love you.\" Carey Dean Moore died Aug. 14 from a fatal mixture including the drug, the first such execution in the United States and Nebraska's first lethal injection of any kind. Moore, 60, had faced death after killing two cab drivers in the summer of 1979. Death penalty opponents feared that the mixture with fentanyl – an opioid more potent than heroin – could have inflicted extreme pain had the substances not worked as planned. In a last statement, Moore apologized to his brother, a witness to the first murder: \"Please forgive me, Don, somehow.\"\n\nNevada\n\nDennis Hof – dead, bombastic, legal brothel owner – elected to Nevada’s state assembly\n\nNevada voters elected a legal pimp who had died several weeks prior in a November state assembly race. Dennis Hof was known as a flamboyant and notorious brothel owner, reality TV star and later Republican politician. A rally for Hof’s campaign took place just hours before his Oct. 16 death at the age of 72 – that rally attracted high-profile conservative speakers including Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Fox News personality Tucker Carlson. Following his death, Hof remained on the ballot and cruised to an easy victory in his Assembly District race. His win kicked off a lengthy and competitive process to appoint a living Republican to the seat.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMystery lotto winner can stay anonymous\n\nA mystery New Hampshire lottery winner who won a $560 million Powerball prize can remain anonymous, a judge ruled in March. The woman won the Powerball drawing Jan. 6, and the state Attorney General's Office had argued that her identity must be revealed because she signed her name on the back of the ticket. The woman, who filed a suit under the pseudonym Jane Doe, said she made a \"huge mistake\" when she signed her real name before contacting a lawyer. The woman could remain anonymous had she established a trust, then had a trustee sign the ticket, her lawyers argued. In October, the ticket for an even bigger prize – a whopping $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot – was sold in South Carolina, but the prize was still unclaimed in November.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey Shore is back in a year of reboots\n\nSnooki, The Situation and the rest of Jersey Shore's cast returned for a two-season reboot filled with plenty of \"duck face\" and nostalgia for the reality show that premiered in 2009. The cast partied in Miami Beach, Florida and Las Vegas before heading to – where else – Atlantic City. This time around, the cast dealt with more than just the cabs being here, as the show touched on issues like sobriety and parenthood. And Jersey Shore wasn’t the only reboot this year. The Ocean’s franchise, A Star is Born and a spooky new take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch all made their way back to our screens in 2018.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSearch for missing child leads to grisly New Mexico compound\n\n\"We are starving and need food and water.\" The message from inside a \"third-world\"-like compound in New Mexico led authorities to a gruesome discovery in August. Eleven children were rescued amid a search for three-year-old Georgia boy Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, whose father allegedly abducted him. Police found the children with a group of heavily armed Muslims living on property they didn't own in a compound built from wooden pallets, clear plastic tarps and dirt-filled tires. The toddler's body was later found buried on the site. One of the rescued children told authorities the group's leader believed the dead child would be reincarnated to launch an attack on banks, schools and other \"corrupt\" institutions. Now, five adults from the compound face firearms-related charges and accusations that a group member had been training children and others in military tactics.\n\nNew York\n\nTrump Foundation to fold under pressure from state\n\nDid President Donald Trump turn his Trump Foundation into a political tool? Allegations \"sufficiently support a claim that Mr. Trump intentionally used Foundation assets for his private interests knowing that it may not be in the Foundation's best interest,\" New York Supreme Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla said in a ruling last month that cleared the way for a civil lawsuit against the Trump Foundation. An investigation led New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood to allege Trump used the foundation as \"little more than a checkbook\" to promote his businesses and presidential campaign. The lawsuit spurred an investigation of the organization's tax practices by the state Tax Department, and the Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve in December. Add to that the alleged tax evasion and \"outright fraud\" by the Trump family as reported by the New York Times in October. The Times' investigation sparked a separate state inquiry into Trump.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFlooding from Hurricane Florence ravages North Carolina\n\nHurricane Florence brought catastrophic flooding to North Carolina and surrounding states in September, causing billions of dollars in property damage and shattering all-time rainfall and flood records in the Carolinas. More than 50 people died in the storm, despite warnings from local authorities to evacuate. One North Carolina mayor warned residents to notify their next of kin if they planned to weather the storm. In the storm's wake, flooding cut off access to towns both large and small. After the rain stopped, residents began to grapple with the devastation, including heavy losses to agriculture and animals. More than a million chickens died, fish carcasses needed to be hosed off of roads and overflowing pig waste created a disgusting, hazardous mess.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMiss America pageant embroiled in controversy\n\nMiss North Dakota Cara Mund won the title of Miss America 2018 – the first from her state to take the crown – but less than three weeks before the 2019 pageant this September, Mund publicly accused Miss America CEO Regina Hopper and chairwoman Gretchen Carlson of bullying and silencing her. Carlson, a former Miss America winner and Fox News host, said the organization lost $75,000 in potential scholarship funds as a result of the accusations. The Miss America Organization had been taking public steps in the name of female-empowerment, but infighting and controversy surrounding the pageant has been making headlines ever since Carlson announced the ceremony would no longer feature a swimsuit competition for the first time in its 98-year history. After the overhaul, the pageant lost one million television viewers, and many were unhappy with the changes.\n\nOhio\n\n'They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully': One family allegedly massacred another in Ohio custody dispute\n\nIn November, Ohio authorities charged six family members in connection with one of the state’s most heinous crimes: A massacre that left eight members of another family dead in four different locations. Authorities allege that a child custody dispute motivated members of the Wagner family to murder Rhoden family members in April 2016, leaving some experts stunned that a custody dispute could lead to such a crime. \"They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully, but not carefully enough,\" Pike County Sheriff Charles S. Reader said of the charges. Four Wagner family members have pled not guilty to murder charges, while two other family members face related charges.\n\nOklahoma\n\nSooners QB wins the Heisman, then apologizes for old homophobic tweets\n\nKyler Murray became the second Oklahoma quarterback in a row to win the Heisman Trophy. But then, homophobic tweets from when he was 15 years old resurfaced. Murray, 21 now, apologized, and joined several other famous athletes thrust into a negative light in 2018 for previous social media activity. Milwaukee Brewers' Josh Hader had racist, homophobic and misogynistic tweets resurface. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen saw racist tweets resurface from his teenage years ahead of the NFL draft. Villanova Final Four Most Outstanding Player Donte DiVincenzo had a profane tweet surface right after he helped the Wildcats win a national title. In the world of entertainment, comedian Kevin Hart refused to apologize in December for past offensive tweets, and the resulting crisis led him to recuse himself from hosting the Oscars.\n\nOregon\n\nProtesters who tried to occupy ICE were arrested as immigration backlash continued\n\nDays before the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy sparked nationwide marches in June, protesters in Oregon were arrested after setting up a makeshift camp on the grounds of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland. A few dozen protesters confronted police with profanities and chants such as \"No justice, no peace, no racist police.\" Federal police arrested several demonstrators on June 28, but protests and arrests at the location continued into July. The backlash was tied to calls by some progressives on the left to abolish ICE – a message that helped propel some Democrats, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to victory in the midterms. The movement also helped boost some Republicans, who argued against lax law enforcement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\n'The Nazis are here again': 11 worshipers gunned down at Tree of Life synagogue\n\nBarry Werber hid in a storeroom. Judah Samet was four minutes late. Both survived what would become the deadliest attack in U.S. history targeting American Jews when a gunman hurling anti-Semitic epithets fatally shot 11 people on the Sabbath at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Even before the attack, violence and harassment of Jewish people and institutions was rising sharply. There were at least 1,986 incidents motivated by anti-Jewish bias – including physical assaults, vandalism and attacks on Jewish institutions – in 2017 in the United States, a 57 percent spike in incidents over the year before, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nRhode Island\n\nMexican restaurant takes heat for anti-Trump '86 45' t-shirts\n\nA Mexican restaurant in Westerly got some backlash for selling T-shirts it says advocated impeaching President Donald Trump. The shirts, which read \"86 45,\" were worn by restaurant staffers on Election Day. That was just one showing of how the man not on the ballot (Trump) was actually a big factor in this year's midterms. Trump didn't shy from making the Nov. 6 election a referendum on him, holding huge rallies in a string of red and swing states and telling crowds that a vote for the local Senate or House candidate was \"a vote for me.\" Midterms are often a judgment about the sitting president, but never in modern times did one campaign so hard to make sure it was.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDeadly prison riot serves as rallying cry for reform\n\nA bloody, seven-hour riot at Lee Correctional Institution, a 1,785-bed maximum security prison in rural South Carolina, put the state's criminal justice system back in the national spotlight. The April melee left seven inmates dead and over a dozen others injured in what is considered the nation's deadliest prison riot in a quarter-century. While state officials attributed the deaths to gangs, some blamed the outbreak of violence on living conditions. A 2010 criminal justice reform package allowed the state to close three maximum-security prisons and slash millions of dollars in annual prison spending from its budget – making the state's prison system among the country’s cheapest for taxpayers but also one of the deadliest for inmates. In August, a nationwide prison strike, created in response to the brutal brawl, aimed to raise awareness on the lack of mental health and rehabilitation programs in the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHow a South Dakota man was tied to an alleged Russian spy\n\nVermillion native Paul Erickson made national headlines when accused Russian spy Maria Butina, his business partner and roommate, was arrested and charged in Washington in July for allegedly seeking to exploit political groups to try to advance Russian interests. Once a political provocateur, Erickson had virtually disappeared from South Dakota's political scene in recent years, but in March 2015, Butina reached out to an American matching his description, prosecutors said. Erickson, 56, reportedly helped shepherd the alleged Russian operative to the National Rifle Association and conservative political group meetings. And Butina’s goal to build a backchannel communication line between Russia and the United States appeared to show some success. Erickson allegedly provided contacts while a Russian official directed her. In December, Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an agent for the Kremlin without registering in the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\n50 years since King's death: Gone, but never forgotten\n\nIn April, thousands of admirers of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gathered at his memorial to mark 50 years since the assassination of the civil rights leader whose message of non-violence continues to resonate across racial and religious divides in our nation. King was shot on April 4, 1968, as he stood on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. The night before his death, witnesses like Clara Ester heard King all but give his own eulogy, saying he had seen the Promised Land but he \"may not get there with you.\" Yet some civil rights leaders have questioned if the U.S. is moving backward on race relations, saying if King was alive today \"he’d be confounded by how little has changed.\"\n\nTexas\n\nUS troops at the Mexico border, migrant caravans: The year in immigration\n\nA large caravan of thousands of Central American migrants brought immigration front and center. The Trump administration vigorously pursued options to restrict or block outright migrants' ability to enter the country, including denying asylum. President Donald Trump also ordered thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the summer, Trump enacted (and then back-tracked on) an ill-fated \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to more than 2,500 family separations along the border. At the time, the eyes of the world focused on the small city of McAllen – a town with Border Patrol's busiest station for apprehending and detaining immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally. In 2018, the USA TODAY Network also won a Pulitzer Prize for its project The Wall, a landmark multi-platform project that examined Trump's campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nUtah\n\nUS Olympians train in Utah before medaling in Pyeongchang\n\nBefore Team USA brought home 23 medals from the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, its skiers and snowboarders trained hard in Utah. Park City plays home to U.S. Ski and Snowboard's Center for Excellence facility, where star athletes like Lindsey Vonn readied for the 23rd Games. While Vonn, widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, returned with just one bronze medal, snowboard halfpipe prodigy Chloe Kim and Shaun White, perhaps the best to ever ride a board, both brought home gold – a cementing of snowboarding's status from outcast to darling of the Winter Olympics.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont legalizes marijuana. There are now 10 states with legal pot\n\nIn 2018, Vermont became the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana and the first to do so through its state legislature. (Later in the year, Michigan became the 10th.) Marijuana has become big business in other states that have legalized it, generating an estimated $1.6 billion in tax revenue. But Vermont has taken a different approach. The state will continue to ban marijuana sales to the general public, and the law leaves open a murky question about marijuana \"gifting.\" In Massachusetts, which legalized marijuana in 2016, the state opened its first commercial pot shops in November.\n\nVirginia\n\nAmazon chooses Virginia and New York for two new headquarters\n\nAlexa, what’s National Landing? Pretty soon, the answer will be the site of one half of Amazon’s HQ2. The tech giant chose the Northern Virginia region straddling Arlington County and the City of Alexandria, and Long Island City, New York, as the locations for its two new headquarters. The November announcement came after 14 months of intense jockeying by more than 230 cities vying for the honor of playing host to the Amazon’s second headquarters. Amazon is expected to bring 25,000 high-paying jobs and invest $2.5 billion in each location. The decision left many cities wondering what could have been and current residents worried their new neighbors might bring public transport nightmares and skyrocketing housing prices. Under CEO Jeff Bezos, who is now the richest person in the world with a net worth of an estimated $166 billion, Amazon also became the second publicly traded company in the U.S. with a stock market value above $1 trillion this year.\n\nWashington\n\nThe year people decided plastic straws suck\n\nThe days of the plastic straw are numbered. In July, Seattle became one of the largest cities to ban plastic straws. Coffee giant Starbucks, headquartered in Washington state, said they would phase plastic straws out by 2020, too. And some chains like Red Lobster chose only to give out plastic straws upon request. The changes are part of a growing national trend to rid ourselves of what some perceive as an environmental waste. The nonprofit group Sailors for the Sea said plastic straws are among the top 10 marine debris collected during the International Coastal Cleanup. But we really seem to love them: Americans use an estimated 500 million single-use straws daily, according to Eco-Cycle. Fortunately, we have plenty of eco-friendly alternatives.\n\nWest Virginia\n\n'There is no incentive to stay, except this is home': West Virginia teachers strike\n\nEducators in West Virginia went on strike for nine days in February and March, capturing the national spotlight and forcing school closures across the state with more than 30,000 teachers and support staff demanding pay raises. Gov. Jim Jordan signed a contract agreeing to a five percent raise for state educators, but West Virginia teacher salaries are still some of the lowest in the nation, according the American Federation of Teachers. Meanwhile, teachers discontent across the country bubbled up this year as educators struggled to keep up with early days and to pay for classroom supplies out of their own pockets. From Arizona to Kentucky, similar protests broke out, demanding better pay and benefits.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin left shell-shocked by Trump's trade wars\n\nFew states fell into the crossfires of President Donald Trump's trade wars more than Wisconsin. \"It's been catastrophic,\" Rob Parmentier, CEO of a Wisconsin-based boat manufacturer, said in October. Retaliatory tariffs from China, Europe, Canada and Mexico came in response to Trump's tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. Those trade barriers affected everything from manufacturing to farming, including the state's iconic dairy industry: Wholesale cheese and butter prices slumped in the summer as farmers faced an oversupply of milk and tensions with Wisconsin's top two trading partners, Canada and Mexico. House Speaker Paul Ryan urged fellow Wisconsinites to \"be patient\" with the tariffs. Meanwhile, hundreds of dairy farms closed across the state – about 430 by September.\n\nWyoming\n\nMatthew Shepard's ashes find a home\n\nTwenty years after Matthew Shepard's death, his ashes found a home at the Washington National Cathedral. Shepard has become an international symbol of the violence LGBTQ people in America face after his death in 1998, when two men savagely beat him then tied him to a fence near Laramie. In their confessions, the assailants said they targeted Shepard because he was gay. Since Shepard's death, same-sex marriage was legalized as well as the ability of transgender Americans to serve in the military. But LGBTQ advocates say more work needs to be done. \"Violence against us continues to this day,\" said Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson, the openly gay former bishop who presided over a service remembering Shepard in October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nCaps claim the Cup for the District\n\nThe Washington Capitals ended D.C.'s more than 20 year drought without a major pro sports title when the team took down the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup Finals in June. It was pandemonium in the streets of the nation's capital after the team's 4-3 victory in Game 5, followed by a boozy championship parade and rally on the National Mall days later. The win also marked the first Stanley Cup title in the franchise's 44-year history, and Caps great Alex Ovechkin won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, leading his team with 15 postseason goals.\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.\n\nCredits: Alia Dastagir, Josh Hafner, Ashley May, Ryan Miller, Brett Molina, Marina Pitofsky, Cara Richardson, Joel Shannon, Charles Ventura and N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/02/ollie-camel-cactus-juice-walls-can-crown-news-around-states/111388938/", "title": "Ollie the camel, cactus-juice walls: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Fifty-five years after the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, the third and final interpretive center along the 54-mile route is finally set to open on the Alabama State University campus. ASU President Quinton Ross announced the grand opening will be held March 25, the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. leading tens of thousands of marchers to the steps of the Alabama State Capitol at the conclusion of the five-day march in 1965. Ahead of the official opening – a day more than a decade in the making – the center opened for a sneak peek to the community Saturday and Sunday. The National Park Service selected ASU as the site for the third center in 2008 and began construction in 2014. While the other two centers, in Selma and White Hall, have been opened, setbacks including a federal government shutdown have continued to stall the Montgomery project until now.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: While many locals escape harsh winter temperatures in February, Matthew Santiago embraced them. Matthew, 8, of Orlando, Florida, is a cancer survivor who expressed a desire to the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make a snowman in Alaska. His dream was fulfilled last week at the Fairbanks Ice Art Park, television station KTVF reports. Matthew has battled Stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells, with chemotherapy, multiple surgeries, stem cell transplants, radiation treatment and months of immunotherapy. The ice art park features ice sculptures and activities for children such as ice slides. Park officials offered Matthew more than a tour. They let him help harvest a thick block of ice from a pond. Matthew was lifted into a telescopic forklift. With assistance from a heavy equipment operator, he jerked the machine forward and lifted a massive cube of ice for sculpting.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Mission San Xavier is set to undergo its biggest preservation project in more than a decade. The Arizona Daily Star reports scaffolding could go up by late fall around the iconic church’s east tower. Workers will spend the next two years carefully removing and replacing problematic plaster around the structure’s centuries-old brick walls. Patronato San Xavier has overseen preservation and fundraising for Arizona’s oldest intact European structure since 1978. During the 1940s and 1950s, the mission’s well-meaning stewards covered the building with concrete plaster made from Portland cement. But decades later, caretakers discovered that moisture trapped by the concrete plaster was being drawn by gravity down through the building, damaging the walls and interior. The old stuff will be replaced with new coats of traditional lime-washed plaster mixed with cactus juice, which allows the walls to breathe and release moisture.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of a state law to expand the procedures optometrists may perform filed a new lawsuit Friday to prevent an effort to repeal the measure from appearing on the ballot this fall. The group, Arkansans for Healthy Eyes, asked the state Supreme Court to disqualify the referendum on the eye surgery law from the November ballot. The law approved by the Legislature last year would allow optometrists to perform several procedures that previously only ophthalmologists could, including injections around the eye, removing lesions from the eyelids and certain laser eye surgeries. The lawsuit contends that signature-gatherers gave out misleading information about the law. It also challenges the wording of the referendum and the validity of thousands of signatures submitted. A Pulaski County judge last month dismissed another lawsuit by Arkansans for Healthy Eyes aimed at blocking the referendum effort.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A baby hippopotamus born at the San Diego Zoo last month has a name. The zoo says the river hippo calf will be called Amahle, which means “beautiful one” in Zulu. The name was announced Friday on “Good Morning America,” which held an online poll asking viewers to choose among three African names. Amahle, born Feb. 8, weighs about 100 pounds and is “active and healthy,” a zoo statement said. Amahle is the ninth hippo calf born at the zoo and the 13th to her mother, Funani. Amahle’s father, Otis, is an East African hippo who arrived at the zoo in 2009 specifically to breed with Funani, zoo officials said. Zoo visitors can see Amahle and her mother in the hippo habitat on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An elected prosecutor for the state’s northeastern rural plains surrendered to authorities Friday, one day after being indicted on drug charges following an investigation by the state’s attorney general. Brittny Lewton, 40, was charged with three drug felonies, including conspiracy and possession, as well as official misconduct, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. She turned herself in to authorities in Logan County, one of seven counties in the 13th Judicial District where she serves as the district attorney. Online court records did not specify the type of drug or drugs in the indictment, which has not been made public. Lewton’s attorney, Stan Garnett, said the charges appear to be based on one incident in July 2019 involving an alleged exchange of prescription medication. Garnett, a former district attorney in Boulder County, said he could not elaborate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An expert on torture with the United Nations is calling out the use of solitary confinement as punishment in the state’s prisons, saying it could amount to psychological torture. Nils Melzer, special rapporteur on torture for the U.N., criticized on Friday the use of solitary confinement in the United States but specifically mentioned Connecticut’s Department of Correction’s practices. “The DOC appears to routinely resort to repressive measures, such as prolonged or indefinite isolation, excessive use of in-cell restraints and needlessly intrusive strip searches,” Melzer said in a statement. “There seems to be a State-sanctioned policy aimed at purposefully inflicting severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, which may well amount to torture.” He said the alleged practices can trigger and exacerbate psychological suffering, especially for those who may have experienced previous trauma or have mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A 12-year-old boy was arrested Thursday after he ordered Chinese food, then stole the delivery driver’s car, New Castle County Police said. Officers were dispatched to the Paladin Club Apartments for a vehicle theft, police said. When they arrived, they spotted the vehicle driving through the complex. The officers turned on their emergency lights, and the vehicle began to slow down. Before the vehicle stopped, the boy got out and ran, police said, and the driverless vehicle then drifted into a marked patrol car. Police caught the boy in a neighboring apartment complex. No injuries were reported, and both vehicles sustained minor damage. The boy was arrested and charged with vehicle theft, resisting arrest, reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident, an official said. He was arraigned and released to his parent on $1,450 unsecured bail, an official said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital will soon have two statues on display in the nation’s Capitol, just like the 50 states, after a concerted effort lasting more than 10 years, WUSA-TV reports. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Wednesday that she will accept a second statue to be displayed on the House of Representatives’ side of the Capitol. Pierre L’Enfant, the architect of D.C.’s layout and the National Mall, will be memorialized among the Capitol’s statue collection. In 2013, D.C. got to display its first statue in the Capitol. Famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass’ likeness sits in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. The L’Enfant statue is currently on display in the lobby of 1 Judiciary Square, a D.C. government building. It will be the sixth statue listed under “other statues” that are on display at the Capitol. Neither L’Enfant’s or Douglass’ statue will be considered part of the official National Statuary Hall Collection.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: Spring breakers be forewarned: You still can’t drink booze in March on the beach in this town seeking to curb rowdy parties. The Panama City News Herald reports that the monthlong ban is paired with a 2 a.m. deadline to buy alcohol anywhere within city limits. Panama City Police Chief Drew Whitman says a zero-tolerance policy originally enacted in 2015 has helped the city transition from a national spring break hot spot to a more family-friendly destination all year long. Whitman says enforcing the ban includes extra officers on the beach, some on all-terrain vehicles. Violators can be fined or even jailed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state Supreme Court justice announced Friday that he plans to resign in November, citing family obligations. Justice Keith Blackwell, 44, said in a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp that he has decided to return to private law practice, according to a statement from the court. “Our oldest daughter will leave for college in only a couple of years, and her sisters will follow not long behind,” Blackwell wrote. “I have decided that it is best for my family that I return to the private practice of law.” Blackwell was appointed to the high court in 2012 by then-Gov. Nathan Deal after having served for two years on the state Court of Appeals. His last day on the Supreme Court will be Nov. 18, and Kemp will appoint his replacement. Justice Robert Benham announced earlier this year that he would retire March 1. The process to find his replacement, also to be appointed by Kemp, is underway.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The speaker of the state’s House of Representatives said Friday that he wants to form a committee to examine the potential economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak so lawmakers can be prepared to cut spending if tax revenue drops sharply. Scott Saiki recalled the state had to slash $2.1 billion in spending from state budgets over a three-year period when tax revenue sank during the recession a decade ago. That led to furloughs for government employees, a four-day week for public school students, and dramatic cuts to mental health and other services. The speaker said he wasn’t proposing to cut spending and build up financial reserves but wanted to assess the economic effect of the outbreak before taking such steps. But such cuts are a possibility, he said. Saiki said House members would vote Tuesday on a resolution that would create a select committee including government officials, industry leaders and union members.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill that would ban any public money from going to organizations that provide abortions was approved Friday by a panel of state lawmakers despite opposition on both sides of the abortion debate, including some who complained that it still allowed exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest. The House State Affairs Committee sent the legislation to the full House with a “do pass” recommendation. Federal and state law already ban public funding for abortion except in certain circumstances. But health care providers who perform abortions can receive public funding for other medical services. The bill aims to prevent any public funding from going to health care providers if they perform abortions except for in certain situations. Those exceptions are narrower than the ones already set by state law, and the Idaho attorney general’s office has warned lawmakers that the legislation would likely draw lawsuits.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A spike in crime on the city’s rail system and some recent high-profile outbursts of violence have prompted the police department to put 50 more officers in trains and on platforms and assign four detectives to investigate nothing but Chicago Transit Authority crimes, officials announced Friday. Hours after the new security plan was unveiled, Chicago police said an officer shot a man on the platform of a CTA station in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. Officers confronted the man after he was observed moving from car to car of a moving train, a city ordinance violation, said Deputy Superintendent Barbara West. The wounded man was taken to a hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition after surgery, West said. Days before the announcement by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Interim Chicago Police Superintendent Charlie Beck, riders began seeing more police SWAT officers boarding trains and manning platforms on the nation’s second-largest public transit system.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: One of the state’s largest school districts canceled bus service Friday after too many drivers called in sick in an apparent labor dispute, and parents were warned over the weekend to find “alternative ways” to get their kids to school Monday morning. Indianapolis Public Schools said schools remained open, but students unable to get to them because of no buses would not be marked absent. The city’s public schools will open Monday, regardless of whether bus service is restored for all of its students, the district said Saturday evening. Superintendent Aleesia Johnson and other district leaders were meeting with representatives for the bus drivers’ union to resolve the situation, district spokeswoman Carrie Cline Black said. IPS announced Jan. 30 that it would not renew a contract with bus vendor Durham School Services that expires June 30 in a cost-cutting move.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Warren County supervisors have approved construction of a long-sought justice center in the city. The board on Thursday backed a trimmed-down plan for the $30 million-plus project. Construction is expected to begin this summer with a goal of completion in the next 18 to 19 months. The new plan retains the four courtrooms and 88-bed jail. Voters had approved $29.9 million for the project in 2018, but the bids came in more than $7 million higher. A referendum to let the county borrow an additional $3.5 million for the project gained support from nearly 56% of the voters, but the referendum required approval from 60%. The state had ordered the county to close the jail. Among its problems: failing a state fire marshal’s inspection, inadequate water supplies, inmate escapes, mold, cleanliness. The jail was on the third floor of the Indianola courthouse, which has since been torn down.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A foul-mouthed judge who cursed at courthouse employees so often that a trial clerk kept a “swear journal” documenting his outbursts should be publicly censured and receive professional coaching but not kicked off the bench, a disciplinary panel recommended Friday. The Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct unanimously concluded that Montgomery County Judge F. William Cullins violated central judicial canons of independence, integrity and impartiality. Its recommendations will be sent to the Kansas Supreme Court, which will ultimately decide his fate. An admonishment or a “cease and desist” order was not sufficient discipline, the panel concluded. His attorney, Chris Joseph, had argued during disciplinary proceedings that his speech is protected by the First Amendment and does not diminish his integrity. But Cullins’ use of foul, derogatory words directed at women manifested a clear bias based on sex, the panel found.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: More than 150 members of the local Cuban community snaked through the city Saturday in a caravan of U.S. and Cuban flag-draped cars, calling for an end to Cuba’s socialist government. With horns blaring and Cuban music blasting, the rally came in the wake of presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ praise for Cuba’s high literacy rate. Critics said it lacked context, partly because Cubans aren’t free to read and write what they want. At the rally Saturday, signs read “No Socialism in America,” “Cuba Libra” and “Make Cuba Great Again,” mixed in with signs supporting President Donald Trump. Others said they were Democrats, reflecting the Cuban community’s political diversity. The attendees gathered outside a Cuban market, giving fiery speeches denouncing the Cuban government, before driving through the city to a parking lot near Louisville Slugger Field downtown, where they they sang the old Cuban national anthem.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three state historic sites are open for additional days to visitors starting this month, the Office of State Parks announced. The Audubon State Historic Site in St. Francisville, Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site in St. Martinville and Port Hudson State Historic Site near Baton Rouge will operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week. The expanded visiting hours start Monday. “This goes a long way in fulfilling our mission to provide the best possible experience of all of Louisiana’s treasure to both our residents and our visitors,” Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who oversees the state parks and historic sites, said in a statement. The three facilities join Poverty Point World Heritage Site and Rosedown Plantation State Historic Site in operating seven days a week.\n\nMaine\n\nFort Kent: Thirteen mushers have launched their annual dash across the wilderness of northern Maine. The 250-mile Can-Am Crown kicked off Saturday in Fort Kent with mushers from Maine, Minnesota, Iowa and several Canadian provinces. The grueling course takes mushers to Portage Lake and then to the town of Allagash before looping back to Fort Kent by Monday morning. Each race is different. The temperature plummeted to minus-38 during the first Can-Am Crown and then soared to 61 degrees a year later. But the weather is cooperating this year. A winter storm on Thursday left a fresh layer of 10 inches of snow on the course, and temperatures were dipping to single digits at night, ideal conditions for the dogs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A $3.2 million study that was supposed to evaluate the city’s risk of storm flooding was suspended after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to secure federal funding. The agency’s Baltimore division announced Tuesday that work would be halted on the risk management study. It would have, in part, assessed the vulnerability of Baltimore’s port terminals, highways, evacuation routes, hospitals, public utilities and local airport facilities in the case of severe storms, the Corps said. The Baltimore region was identified as a focus area due its high susceptibility to flooding outlined in a 2015 report in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to the agency. The Corps said it will request the funding again during the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: New England Aquarium officials have expressed opposition to a proposed 600-foot skyscraper that would be built in place of the Boston Harbor Garage. A crowd gathered Thursday at the first public meeting to discuss concerns for Don Chiofaro’s proposed $1.2 billion, 42-story skyscraper, the Boston Herald reports. The proposed tower, called “The Pinnacle,” would have two floors for retail and dining, 22 floors of office space, and 200 apartments on the top 18 floors, according to plans filed with the Boston Planning & Development Agency. “The New England Aquarium stands in staunch opposition to this proposed development,” said Vikki Spruill, the president and CEO of the New England Aquarium. “Climate change is at the heart of our concerns about this development. … This is about the future of our downtown waterfront.” The aquarium is located on Central Wharf behind the garage.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The outlook on the city’s debt has been upgraded from “stable” to “positive” by Moody’s Investors Service. The adjustment means the city’s finances are pointing in a positive direction, and there is a higher chance the city will be upgraded in the next year or two, Moody’s said in a news release. The rating and new outlook apply to $135 million of general obligation debt. Moody’s affirmed the city’s Ba3 bond rating and added that the rating remains three notches below investment grade. Moody’s said the revised outlook reflects the city budget’s ability to finance service improvements and capital investments and to accommodate an increase in pension contributions. The city emerged from bankruptcy in December 2014, having restructured or wiped out $7 billion in debt.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Janitors who work at Twin Cities commercial buildings are striking as part of a push for higher wages and better benefits in their contracts. The Star Tribune reports more than 100 janitors walked off the job Thursday and rallied along Nicollet Mall, waving signs and beating drums outside the skyscrapers they clean each day. They were joined by a separate group of youth climate strikers who marched in solidarity. The Service Employees International Union, which represents 4,000 janitors who clean Twin Cities commercial buildings, organized the daylong strike before a bargaining session Friday. Members have also been pushing for paid sick days and a program to expand the use of nontoxic cleaning chemicals, among other things.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Authorities on Saturday released the identity of one of two inmates who died earlier in the week at a penitentiary that is under U.S. Justice Department investigation. The Mississippi Department of Corrections said Timothy R. Sharpe, who was serving a 20-year-sentence for sexual battery and child molestation, died Friday at the prison hospital at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. He was 61. The statement said the name of another inmate who died Thursday at Parchman’s prison hospital hasn’t been released pending notification of relatives. The statement didn’t give any details about the deaths. In a news release Friday, Sunflower County Coroner Heather Burton said there was “no evidence of foul play” in either death. Autopsies were planned in both cases. With those included, at least 21 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Democrats in the state House want to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but their proposals have yet to be assigned to a committee for a hearing. The sponsor of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act, state Rep. Greg Razer of Kansas City, told St. Louis Public Radio he’s frustrated about the lack of progress. State law already bans discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex and disability. Past proposals to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity have fallen flat in the Legislature. Opponents say they believe businesses should be able to create their own policies. Democrats are also concerned about a proposed constitutional amendment that would require all public school athletes to compete against students of their biological rather than chosen sex. Opponents fear it would unfairly exclude transgender students or put them at risk of harassment.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: For the first time in a decade, schools in the state are using fewer emergency authorizations than the year before as small, rural schools continue to struggle finding teachers. The state’s “last resort” option effectively allows teachers to work in a school for a year despite not being qualified to do so under state law. Its numbers have mushroomed in recent years as the state encouraged schools to use the option instead of taking an accreditation ding. In 2019-2020, it dropped to 84 compared to 94 last school year. Montana’s small rural schools have long struggled to attract and keep qualified teachers, but the shortage has reached “crisis” levels in recent years, according to experts. The decrease is far from a sign that the issue is solved, and it’s still the second highest figure in recent years.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Selling the natural gas generated at one of the city’s wastewater treatment plants will produce $2 million of new revenue annually, the mayor said. The sales also will further the city goal of environmental sustainability, Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird said Thursday. Lincoln has used the gas to produce electricity that helped power the wastewater treatment plant. City officials decided in 2017, however, that upgrading the system at the Theresa Street plant and selling the biogas locally or nationally would provide a greater return on investment. The $8 million upgrade will be complete this summer, and city officials plan to begin sales under an agreement with a Utah-based energy management company, Blue Source. The Blue Source contract is set for public hearing and a council vote Monday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s casinos continued a hot streak in January, topping $1 billion in house winnings for the second consecutive month and eighth time in the past year. The state Gaming Control Board on Friday reported the statewide “casino win” figure was slightly lower than in December but was up almost 5.5% compared with the same month in 2019. Board analyst Michael Lawton said casinos reported increases in all categories, including table games, blackjack, roulette, sports betting, slot machines and baccarat. Baccarat winnings sometimes jump or drop significantly in a month. They were up 17% in January, totaling more than $112 million. Lawton noted the game is a favorite of Asian tourists, and the Chinese Lunar New Year fell in January this year. The holiday was in February last year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials will use federal funds to examine the effects of rising seas on major highways and connecting routes along the coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is funding a “vulnerability assessment” for the I-95, Route 1 and Route 1A corridors and local connector roads, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Researchers will combine traffic models and climate change projections to determine what areas have a higher risk of flooding from rising sea levels. A 2015 report by the Rockingham Planning Commission found that a 1.7-foot rise in sea levels would flood 5 miles of New Hampshire coastal roads. A 4-foot rise would flood more than 23 miles of roads. A state report released last year estimated that a 1-to-3-foot rise is “likely” by 2100 under most scenarios and that there is a 1-in-20 chance that a 4-foot rise could happen by the turn of the next century.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Orange: A dozen sea turtles that nearly froze when they were too far north last fall as water temperatures abruptly plunged off the state’s coast survived that ordeal but remain threatened by the pneumonia most of them developed afterward. Sea Turtle Recovery, a nonprofit group operating out of the Turtle Back Zoo in northern New Jersey, got the turtles through their initial medical crisis, with two needing CPR. But 11 of them went on to develop pneumonia, a common problem in turtles that survive so-called cold-stunning and one that could yet kill some of them. The turtles are being treated with medications, and their progress and conditions are checked daily in a hospital on the grounds of the turtle-themed zoo that is popular with children. Ten of the 12 are green turtles, along with one loggerhead and one endangered Kemp’s Ridley turtle.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. land managers on Friday made public a list of possible alternatives for managing development in one of the nation’s oldest oil and gas basins, but environmentalists and others say the options fail to take into account the cumulative costs of increased drilling and threats to Native American cultural sites in northwestern New Mexico. Officials with the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs indicated their preference for an alternative that would “balance community needs and development” while limiting impacts on the traditional, socioeconomic and cultural way of life of those who call the area home. The alternative emphasizes local and tribal perspectives and includes a range of options for limiting development around Chaco Culture National Historical Park, the officials said. The World Heritage site has become the focal point in a decades­long fight over oil and gas.\n\nNew York\n\nSeneca Falls: People threw punches and were dragged to the ground Saturday as a long-simmering leadership dispute in the Cayuga Indian Nation flared up for a second time in a week. The altercation followed a news conference by a group of chiefs who oppose the authority of Clint Halftown, the federally recognized leader of the roughly 500-member western New York tribe. Halftown on Feb. 22 sent bulldozers to demolish a convenience store and other buildings controlled by tribe members who oppose him. The seven chiefs called a news conference Saturday adjacent to a disputed property to address the incident and brought supporters from other American Indian nations that make up the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. A group that crossed the caution tape and walked onto the property after the news conference was immediately confronted by a large group wearing Cayuga Nation Police jackets, and fighting broke out, according to The Citizen of Auburn.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The shuffling of Gov. Roy Cooper’s original Cabinet became official Friday with changes at the transportation and information technology departments. Eric Boyette, the new Department of Transportation secretary, and Tracy Doaks, secretary of the information technology department, were sworn in to their posts by Court of Appeals Judge Reuben Young in a private ceremony, Cooper’s office said. Doaks, most recently the chief deputy state chief information officer, suceeded Boyette as secretary at the state IT office. At DOT, Boyette succeeded Jim Trogdon, who retired from state government. Boyette previously worked in DOT as inspector general and the Division of Motor Vehicles commissioner before going over to information technology in 2015. Cooper announced the changes last month. The other eight members of Cooper’s Cabinet from 2017 are still in their original jobs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man shot and killed by police last month did not fire at officers as authorities initially reported, though he did point a handgun at them, justifying the use of deadly force. The Bismarck Tribune reports an investigation found Cody Carnes, 30, of Bismarck, also had a handful of encounters with police in the two weeks leading up to his death that were tied to alleged drug use, mental health issues and threats against law enforcement. Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer on Monday said the shooting of Carnes was justifiable. Authorities said Carnes pointed a gun at officers outside his window after police were called to a noise complaint at his residence Jan. 9. A report that Lawyer sent to Bismarck Police Chief Dave Draovitch stated that one of the two firing officers “believed he saw and heard Carnes fire a round from the handgun and returned fire,” but the other officer “stated he did not believe that Carnes had fired the handgun.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A proposed constitutional amendment that would set 16-year term limits on legislators serving in the state House or Senate has cleared its initial hurdle. Ohioans for Legislative Term Limits is the group seeking to close a loophole that’s allowed multiple legislators to jump back and forth between the House and Senate after reaching the current eight-year limit in one or the other chamber. The group’s goal is to place the amendment on the Nov. 3 ballot. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost’s office certified the campaign’s first 1,000 signatures Thursday and also certified that the summary petition language is “fair and truthful.” The issue goes next to the state Ballot Board, which must determine whether it contains a single issue or multiple issues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: Dozens of students at the University of Oklahoma have ended a sit-in outside the school’s administrative offices following two instances in which professors used racial slurs in their classrooms. The three-day sit-in organized by the Black Emergency Response Team ended Friday with the student group saying progress had been made. OU Dean of Students David Surratt said in a statement Friday that the students “raised legitimate concerns,” and their demands “were actually solutions” the university has included in a strategic plan to be presented to OU regents. One idea was the creation of a student advisory committee. BERT co-director Miles Francisco told The Oklahoman that the student advisory committee will provide “insights and advice to the office of the senior president and provost.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A federal judge said he wouldn’t block new city housing screening and security deposit rules that took effect over the weekend because a rental industry group waited too long to file a legal challenge. U.S. District Judge Michael Simon on Thursday said he was denying a request from Multifamily NW for a temporary restraining order to delay two Fair Access in Renting ordinances. He said it was because the almost yearlong gap between when the City Council approved them and when the group sued Feb. 21 “implies a lack of urgency or a lack of irreparable harm,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Multifamily NW and two landlords sued the city, claiming the new rules were unconstitutional and ultimately should never go into effect. Simon said he didn’t believe U.S. District Court was the appropriate venue to sort out the constitutionality of city policies.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man stole an ambulance and tried to run over an officer who shot him three times, leading to a low-speed chase through the city that lasted more than an hour Friday night, authorities said. Authorities were called to a motel in northeast Philadelphia about 9:20 p.m. for reports of a domestic disturbance involving a man and a woman that necessitated medical attention for one or more parties, Staff Inspector Sekou Kinebrew of Philadelphia police said. The man became combative and jumped into the ambulance, driving at one of the officers who medics called for backup, Kinebrew said. The officer fired his weapon four times, striking the man three times: twice in the left leg and once in the side. The officer was struck by the ambulance and hospitalized with injuries that Kinebrew described as non-life-threatening.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Former British Prime Minister Theresa May is speaking at Brown University this week. May is giving an address about global affairs at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday at the university’s campus in Providence. University President Christina Paxson will lead a discussion on the successes, challenges and inspirations behind May’s decades­long government career. The event is free and open to the public, but attendees must register in advance, and tickets are limited. May served as prime minister for three years. In her final months, Parliament repeatedly rejected the Brexit divorce deal with the European Union that was the cornerstone of her administration. She finally accepted that her Conservative Party was hopelessly divided on the issue and succumbed to pressure to step down. May’s address is titled “Politics, Populism and Polarization: Perspectives on the Global Economy.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTravelers Rest: Investigators shut down an entire state park Saturday as they searched for a man wanted for murder, but they didn’t find the suspect. Greenville County deputies found an SUV they think was driven by Ryan Kedar just outside Paris Mountain State Park and decided to close the park, sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Ryan Flood said. About 100 officers searched all day Saturday at the park north of Greenville but did not find Kedar or anything else except for the SUV tying him to the park, Flood said in a statement. Kedar allegedly shot and killed 58-year-old Mark Jermon at a park in Taylors on Wednesday, authorities said. The men knew each other, but deputies aren’t sure what led to the shooting, Flood said. Kedar, 49, is an avid camper and hiker at state and national parks, Flood said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: A motorcycle club is opposing a move by the city to annex some of the club’s property on the western edge of town. Jackpine Gypsies Motorcycle Club President Brett Winsell said the annexation goes beyond the potential for higher property taxes. He said the club is more concerned with current and future city ordinances concerning noise, signage and other issues that may prevent the club from staging its races and other events on the grounds. The Jackpine Gypsies and founder J.C. Pappy Hoel began the Sturgis motorcycle rally in 1938 and have hosted motorcycle races, hill climbs, motocross and other events. City Manager Daniel Ainslie said the Jackpine Gypsies property and other parcels under consideration for annexation benefit from city services and should pay for them. The Rapid City Journal reports a public hearing is scheduled Monday, followed by a council vote on the intent to annex.\n\nTennessee\n\nManchester: More than three months before the start of the 2020 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, the event is already sold out in record time. That includes all general admission passes and VIP packages, plus the new mid-tier “GA+” tickets. Bonnaroo says this is the quickest sellout in the festival’s 19-year history. For comparison’s sake, last year’s event was also a rare sellout, but that didn’t happen until the day before the music began. It also continues an impressive commercial rebound for the fest. Last year marked Bonnaroo’s first sellout since 2013 and came three years after a dismal 2016, when ticket sales hit an all-time low of roughly 46,000 in 2016. The 2020 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival takes place June 11-14 at Great Stage Park in Manchester. Lizzo, Tool and Tame Impala headline, alongside Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey, Vampire Weekend, Bassnectar, The 1975 and Flume, among 100-plus acts.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: State health officials say people who visited the cattle barn at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo may need to be assessed for possible rabies exposure because a cow there had the virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Saturday that people who visited the barn Feb. 11-14 may need to be assessed. Health officials say they’ve been in contact with the people who were caring for the cow and the animals in nearby stalls. The cow was being shown by a student. Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals. It can be prevented if treatment is started before symptoms begin; however, once symptoms start, it’s almost always fatal, health officials said. If someone is exposed, it usually takes between three weeks and three months for them to get sick.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Polygamy wouldn’t be a felony crime in the state for the first time in 85 years under a bill that passed the Legislature on Friday and appears to be supported by the governor. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly for the proposal that supporters said will allow the 30,000 or so people living in the state’s polygamous communities to come out of the shadows and report abuses such as underage marriage by other polygamists without fear of prosecution. “It seems so surreal; you’re so used to it not being this way,” said Joe Darger, a Utah polygamist who has three wives. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert has indicated he will likely sign the proposal that makes polygamy between consenting adults an infraction, like a traffic offense, that carries no possible jail time. “This one has overwhelming support, though it’s not without some controversy,” Herbert said during his monthly news conference at PBS Utah on Thursday.\n\nVermont\n\nFerrisburgh: Oliver the camel, a quirky roadside attraction and social media darling, has died at age 17 in Vermont. “Ollie” delighted travelers along Route 7 in Ferrisburgh for nearly two decades. Many motorists stopped for photos and selfies with the friendly creature, which sported two humps. Oliver Camel’s Facebook page anounced Friday that he died Feb. 21. It did not cite the cause of his death. The Facebook post noted that “Ollie” was loved and spoiled and looking forward to an afterlife. “My next adventure is ahead and I am ready to take it on – to go where no camel has gone before!!” the post said. Ollie lived on a sheep farm. He was a Bactrian camel that’s native to Asia, so the cold weather didn’t bother him. His owner didn’t immediately return a message Saturday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Officials from southwest Virginia have mounted a last-minute push to oppose the possible early closure of one of the country’s newest coal plants. A Dominion Energy facility in Wise County that opened eight years ago and is frequently touted as the cleanest of its type could close decades sooner than expected under a sweeping rewrite of the state’s energy generation policy that Democrats are advancing through the General Assembly. Advocates of the bill say Virginia needs to move away from fossil fuel-fired generation in order to address climate change. But Republican lawmakers and local officials in southwest Virginia have called its potential early retirement a “tragedy” that would blow a hole in the budgets of two localities and devastate a region that’s been working to revitalize an economy built on coal mining but isn’t there yet.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man who recently served prison time on a gun charge amassed an arsenal of homemade “ghost guns” after his release even though he was on federal supervision, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court. Nathan Brasfield, 40, of Edmonds, was sentenced to four years in prison after a 2014 arrest for being a felon in possession of a firearm. He began a three-year term of supervised release in October 2017. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle said in a federal complaint unsealed Thursday that when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives searched his home and vehicle Feb. 6, they found dozens of guns as well as several machines used in home manufacturing of firearms: a 3-D printer, drill press and computer numerical control machine – also known as a “ghost gunner.” Agents reported finding 17 pistols, 24 rifles and 10 silencers, with most of the guns being homemade and having no serial numbers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state may soon stiffen fines for restaurants that fail to secure the lids of grease pits after a young girl fell into one of the collection traps last year. The House of Delegates on Friday unanimously approved a measure to increase fines from $5 to $50 per day for businesses that don’t secure the grease pit lids. The proposal, which was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier this month, now goes back to that chamber with some minor amendments. The bill followed an incident last November in which 5-year-old Kambria Cvechko stepped on one of the lids outside a Charleston restaurant and fell into the pit’s narrow opening, submerging into the dark, putrid grease. Her panicked mother scurried down the hole headfirst as two other children anchored her feet, clawing through the slick liquid for her daughter’s arms as she could hear the girl gasping for air. Eventually, Kambria was lifted out of the pit without any major injuries.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Gov. Tony Evers vetoed Republican lawmakers’ tough-on-crime legislation Friday. The vetoes were hardly a surprise, as the governor campaigned on cutting the state’s prison population in half. The bills would have required the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person’s extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; expanded the list the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be an adult felony; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and blocked violent criminals from participating in early release programs. Evers said in his veto messages that the revocation recommendation bill would have cost the state $200 million in just the first two years. The DOC has projected the bill would force the agency to build two new prisons to handle the influx of new inmates.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A measure to impose a 5% statewide lodging tax appears likely to pass the Legislature after the state Senate approved it. The Senate, which defeated a similar bill last year, passed the lodging tax measure Friday by a 16-13 vote. The measure had previously passed the House. A committee must negotiate differences in the versions that each chamber approved before the bill advances to the governor. Gov. Mark Gordon has previously endorsed the bill, saying a lodging tax is the only new tax he would support. Wyoming is seeking ways to shore up its budget amid declining energy production revenue, but the Republican-dominated Legislature is reluctant to support tax increases. Other tax bills have been defeated in the legislative session or failed to generate enough support to be introduced.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/op-ed/philboas/2020/02/12/new-hampshire-primary-leaves-no-consensus-how-stop-trump/4601967002/", "title": "How long will coronavirus last?

It’s based on modeling of the novel coronavirus that now informs policy in the United Kingdom and other nations.\n\nAnd it endeavors to answer the question everyone is asking:\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nWhy are we shutting down our daily lives, our economies, our human interaction?\n\nAs almost all of us retreat to our homes for a long period of social separation from others in our communities, we’re asking another important question:\n\nJust how long is this going to last?\n\nThe paper with the interminable name, whose lead researcher, Neil M. Ferguson, is an epidemiologist at Imperial College and professor of mathematical biology who specializes in infectious disease spread in humans and animals, has an answer.\n\nWe’re in for a long slog.\n\n“The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound,” writes Ferguson and 29 others, “and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic.”\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nA new virus, unleashed on the world in Wuhan, China, is now spreading across the globe. Its destructive power is such that it very rapidly sickens people, particularly the elderly, to the point that large percentages require critical care at hospitals to save their lives.\n\nThe numbers of patients have been so large in some regions of the world that they have completely overwhelmed health-care systems and forced war-time like triage decisions of life and death.\n\nIn Italy some patients can’t even get into the hospitals and die at home.\n\nIn dealing with this problem, there are two fundamental strategies to employ: “mitigation” and “suppression,” write the authors.\n\nMitigation works to slow, not stop, the spread of disease, by encouraging home isolation of those believed infected, home quarantine for those living in the same home with them and social distancing of the elderly and other at-risk populations.\n\nSuppression requires social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their family members. It can require closing schools and universities.\n\n“Each policy has major challenges,” write the authors.\n\nAccording to their U.K. and U.S. modeling, mitigation would reduce health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half. It would still result in “hundreds of thousands of deaths” and would still overwhelm the intensive care units in our hospitals “many times over.”\n\nSuppression would require strict adherence until a vaccine is developed and scaled up for the larger public. That could take “potentially 18 months or more.” If relaxed before that time, “transmission will quickly rebound.”\n\n“We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.”\n\nIf social distancing is effective, it “may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound,” the authors write.\n\n“… while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.”\n\nOn Sunday, The (U.K.) Guardian newspaper reported that secret briefing papers delivered to National Health Service officials project the epidemic will infect 80% percent of all Britons and last until the spring of 2021.\n\n“The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.\n\nIt also suggests that health chiefs are braced for widespread infection. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told The Guardian:\n\n“For the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that. … A year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn’t well appreciated or understood. “I think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up.”\n\nTHE VIRUS DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOUR POLITICS\n\nWe are in the middle of both a global health-care crisis and a presidential election. It would have been impossible to keep politics out of the decision-making as we ramp up to confront the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut we have to try to keep it out, writes Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the New York City Health Department.\n\nFrieden’s observations are noteworthy because they are published on the VOX news and opinion website that is generally projecting a liberal slant – a slant that more than not agrees with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Republican White House has made a number of missteps on testing, and the president as erred repeatedly with some of his public comments, notably his criticism of the U.S. Centers for Disease controls, notes Frieden.\n\nBut the White House has also done good, he argues:\n\n“Whatever your view of the current administration, some of its actions have saved lives. The ban on travel from China undoubtedly reduced the number of Americans who became infected with Covid-19. The new ban on travel from the EU could have some benefit — but only if we understand that this delays disease spread and does not prevent it, and is justified only if we use the time it buys ...”\n\nThe administration has made key mistakes on testing. It failed to quickly recognize and break through the bureaucratic labyrinth at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration that was blocking rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 tests.\n\nBut a lot of the criticism, while legitimate, has overlooked the limitations of testing, Frieden explains.\n\n“A surge in people being tested could actually spread disease, because people can become infected by someone else waiting to be tested. Getting tested today is no guarantee you won’t get infected tomorrow — and may give you a false sense of security. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that testing of throat swabs may miss as many as two-thirds of infections.”\n\nTesting is vital in many scenarios, particularly used in places where there are few confirmed infections, Frieden explains. In such cases, testing can inform containment and isolation strategies. Seattle, in fact, might have avoided full-fledged breakout had the federal government provided them the testing authority or test kits they needed.\n\nThe American health-care system is facing an enormous challenge. It will need the help of all of the American people to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the overload of emergency rooms and hospital wards.\n\nBoth sides have been guilty of playing politics with this issue. Given the stakes, Frieden writes, we need to put down our swords.\n\n“Partisanship has no place when lives are at stake. Covid-19 might even help all of us realize that we are all connected, and although we need to increase social distance, we also need to increase solidarity to help each other get through what has quickly become a national and global crisis.”\n\nMEXICO TALKS OF TIGHTENED U.S. BORDER\n\nMexico’s Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a news conference Friday that novel coronavirus in the United States more likely poses a threat to Mexico than Mexico poses to the United States, reports Yahoo News:\n\n\"If it were technically necessary to consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance we would have to take into account not that Mexico would bring the virus to the United States, rather that the United States could bring it here.\"\n\nThe Mexicans are likely responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s foolish assertion that a wall is needed “more than ever” because of coronavirus.\n\nCORONAVIRUS MORE LIKE 1957 PANDEMIC\n\nNicholas A. Christakis, physician and Sterling Professor of Social & Natural Science at Yale, who was famously caught in the maelstrom of identity politics at Yale in 2015 (you can see it here and here), argues in a Twitter thread that our more relevant parallel to the past is not the Spanish Flu of 1918 but the 1957 Influenza-A (H2N2) pandemic.\n\nThat outbreak killed 1.1 million people globally and 115,700 in the United States.\n\nYou can read his thread here.\n\nChristakis in 2009 was named to the TIME 100 list of the magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. In 2009 and 2010, Foreign Policy magazine named him in its list of top global thinkers.\n\nBRITAIN PUTS MANUFACTURERS ON WARTIME FOOTING\n\nThe British government is calling on carmakers and other manufactures to shift to producing medical ventilators now in short supply with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Ventilators are necessary to assist breathing and save lives of many, especially elderly, infected patients, reports The (U.K.) Times.\n\nMatt Hancock, the U.K. secretary for health and social care, explained the situation:\n\n“We start with around 5,000 ventilators, we think we need many times more than that, and we are saying if you produce a ventilator then we will buy it. No number is too high. “They are relatively complicated pieces of kit, I couldn’t make one, but they’re not so complicated that the advanced manufacturing that this country is so good at now can’t be able to turn its production lines over to.”\n\n“HOW MUCH WORSE THE CORONAVIRUS COULD GET”\n\nThe New York Times demonstrates through adaptive graphics how the novel coronavirus might evolve in the United States given the various strategies we might employ. This modeling was developed by Nicholas Kristof (mentioned above) and Stuart A. Thompson, head of The Times Opinions visual journalism department.\n\nOn current track we’re headed for 100 million Americans (one-third) infected and one-million deaths, according to the graphic simulation. See it here.\n\n“WE NEED TO STOP ASSUMING WE ARE DIFFERENT”\n\nIt is still the lull before the storm, but the United States and a number of European nations, including Spain, France and Germany, should expect “very serious outbreaks” of COVID-19 soon, writes Helen Jenkins, assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health, whose research focuses on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.\n\nIn an article on the Medium online site, Jenkins warns:\n\n“Wuhan was caught unawares, and Italy was unlucky to have the first big outbreak in Europe, although it is unclear why. The United States and European countries must learn from this very quickly. We need to stop assuming we are different and start introducing measures to protect our communities.” “How? The countries not yet seriously affected must start testing seriously. It’s not enough to test those returning from an ‘affected area.’ We have to realize that the virus is already present and we ourselves are an ‘affected area.’ Another essential measure is social distancing, which could include things like stopping all large (and some small) gatherings, closing schools, working from home, limiting not only international but also domestic travel, even isolating specific cities or regions.”\n\nJenkins argues that South Korea is the model to follow with its “widespread” testing, contact tracing and aggressive quarantine protocols.\n\n“All countries and localities need to throw as much effort as they can at this thing. Individuals and governments need to show decisive leadership and break their paralysis by indecision. Speed is everything — and we are all in this together.”\n\nShe offers this last bit of advice: “Wash your hands like your life or someone else’s depends on it.”\n\n* * *\n\nDespite barren shelves in grocery stores and all the shutdowns in workplaces and sports and entertainment venues, many young Americans are still socializing as if nothing has changed. Journalist and author Rod Dreher has been tweeting the observations of an unnamed doctor who is dealing with the viral outbreak in this country:\n\nCRITICAL PLACES REMAIN OPEN IN FRANCE, INCLUDING… “TOBACCONISTS”?\n\nWith 4,469 people confirmed infected and 91 deaths, France is feeling the escalation of coronavirus. That has led to extraordinary measures, reports The Times of London:\n\n“Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, ordered the closure of restaurants, bars, cinemas and nightclubs. All shops were also shut, except for food stores, pharmacies, banks and tobacconists. He asked people to stay home.”\n\nI searched for a story that would tell us why tobacconists are essential in disease-ridden France, but could find none. I did, however, find a reader comment in this story in The Australian that, while obviously not authoritative, offers a reason:\n\n“Tobac shops sell newspapers, transport tickets not just smokes.”\n\nISIS TRAVEL WARNING: AVOID EUROPE\n\nThe Middle East terror group ISIS is warning its cohorts through its al-Naba newsletter to “cover their mouths when yawning and sneezing,” to wash their hands regularly and to stay out of Europe, where the coronavirus infection rate is high, reports The (U.K.) Times.\n\n“Having previously urged its supporters to attack European cities, the group is now advising members to “stay away from the land of the epidemic” in case they become infected.”\n\nThis legitimate front-page story provoked some cheeky responses from British readers:\n\n“Wimps.” * * * “The silver lining!” * * * “Terrorist newsletter? Is there an ISIS app?” * * * “Do ISIS have all the toilet rolls?” * * * “The next thing will be the West offering medical assistance.” * * * “Allah works in mysterious ways.” * * * “She certainly does.”\n\n‘LA DOLCE VITA’ LIVES ON IN ITALY\n\nThe Italians are making glorious music in the Age of Coronavirus with all of its social dislocation. Some of it is truly beautiful. Some of it is very funny. Enjoy.\n\nTWEETS ON THE PANDEMIC\n\nSome interesting observations both sober and silly.\n\n“CORONAVIRUS CALLED AMERICA’S BLUFF”\n\nAnne Applebaum, staff writer with the Atlantic Monthly and former member of the Washington Post editorial board, argues that America is in for a rude awakening:\n\n“The United States, long accustomed to thinking of itself as the best, most efficient, and most technologically advanced society in the world, is about to be proved an unclothed emperor. When human life is in peril, we are not as good as Singapore, as South Korea, as Germany. And the problem is not that we are behind technologically, as the Japanese were in 1853. The problem is that American bureaucracies, and the antiquated, hidebound, unloved federal government of which they are part, are no longer up to the job of coping with the kinds of challenges that face us in the 21st century. Global pandemics, cyberwarfare, information warfare—these are threats that require highly motivated, highly educated bureaucrats; a national health-care system that covers the entire population; public schools that train students to think both deeply and flexibly; and much more.”\n\nPLACES IN THE PATH OF THE VIRUS ARE BEATING IT, HERE'S HOW\n\nThe epicenter of the novel-coronavirus pandemic is Hubei Province in central China, with a population of nearly 60 million people.\n\nIn that region, whose capital city is Wuhan, the COVID-19 outbreak has proven catastrophic with 67,790 confirmed infections and 3,075 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Live Dashboard.\n\nOn Friday, Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and former senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations tweeted out this graph:\n\nIf you look at the lines, shown here in the larger graphic, you’ll see what is nearly a universal spike in COVID-19 diagnoses after certain countries in the world hit their first confirmed 100 people infected.\n\nSerious upsurges are felt now in Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, France and Germany. The United States trend line is also worrisome.\n\nJust as interesting are two lagging trend lines, whose COVID-19 cases are climbing more gently, with none of the critical overload that has hit China and Italy.\n\nThese locales in Southeast Asia and in proximity to Mainland China puts them directly in the path of the rapidly spreading pathogen.\n\nOne is Singapore, an island city-state of about 5.7 million people off southern Malaysia. The other, Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, with a population of 7.5 million.\n\nA third locale not shown on the graph, but also trending gently, is Taiwan, an island of 23.5 million people off the coast of Mainland China.\n\nTaken together the three locations have used fast-acting and aggressive measures to successfully control the spread of novel coronavirus.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nThe answer goes back some 16-18 years to another coronavirus – SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-2004 -- that infected 8,000 people and killed 774 globally.\n\nChina and Southeast Asia were particularly hard hit, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which experienced among the highest SARS death rates in the world.\n\nThe SARS devastation left a lasting impact on these three population centers not far from China’s mainland and still influences how people live their lives today.\n\n“Take me,” writes Bloomberg Opinion columnist Nisha Gopalan, who lives and works in Hong Kong and did so at the time of the SARS epidemic.\n\n“I still compulsively wash my hands, 17 years after the outbreak. I have friends that have been using toothpicks to press elevator buttons for years. Some use tissues to open the doors of public washrooms, or carry spare masks in their handbags in case they catch the sniffles. This is all evidence of the indelible impact SARS has had on Hong Kong’s psyche. For many of us, advice from health officials on how to minimize the risk of Covid-19 infection has been superfluous.”\n\nMore importantly, governments in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan learned from the 2002-04 SARS contagion to react quickly when they realized a new and deadly coronavirus was on the loose.\n\nHere’s how they kept the spread of the disease low and are managing to outperform the emergency actions of governments in China, western Europe and the United States.\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n* Population: 5.7 million * Infected: 200 * Deaths: 0\n\nSingapore took immediate action to secure its borders and to perform contact tracing – the identification and tracking of infected people and other persons they came in contact with.\n\nIt was among the first countries to end inbound flights from Wuhan and then began putting travelers from affected areas of the world in quarantine, according to a New York Times op-ed by Benjamin J. Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology, and Wey Wen Lim, a graduate student in infectious disease epidemiology, both at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nHospitals and governments in Singapore created a united front to track the movements of infected people. While health workers surveyed all coronavirus patients about their movements, the state used data from transport companies, hotels and security footage to track whereabouts, according to The Times op-ed authors.\n\nA paper published by Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease reports:\n\n“Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection.”\n\nHowever, the nation has been heavy-handed imposing quarantine and rules that “may not be directly translatable elsewhere,” reports TIME Magazine.\n\n“Since independence in 1965, it has been ruled by a single party that maintains tight control and is rarely subject to public criticism. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, quarantine and isolation protocols are strictly enforced. A permanent resident who breached quarantine rules lost his status, while a couple was charged in court with providing false information about their travel history.”\n\nInterestingly, Singapore has largely kept its public schools open to avoid large disruptions in people’s lives, according to The Times op-ed. Instead the nation has chosen to screen students and staff regularly.\n\nTo that end, a large social safety net is in place to help families affected by the disease, TIME reports.\n\n“No Singaporean has to fear affording treatment. Testing is free, and the government foots the hospital bills for Singaporean residents who have suspected or confirmed cases, TIME reports. “To make quarantine less onerous, the government offers self-employed people $100 Singapore dollars ($73) per day, while employers are prohibited from detracting quarantine days from staffers’ annual leave.”\n\nHONG KONG\n\nPopulation: 7.5 million * Infected: 140 * Deaths: 4\n\nSimilar to Singapore, Hong Kong very quickly put in place strong travel restrictions and controls to stop the flow of people from infected regions of China, The Times reports. It did close its schools, but perhaps because it would not create the kind of disruption it would cause in other lands. The region enjoys cultural advantages Singapore does not:\n\n“Hong Kong has a social structure that helps cushion some of the burden: Many families with two working parents already rely on domestic helpers or grandparents for child care.”\n\nThe memory of SARS still resonates and is driving reaction to coronavirus today, reports TIME.\n\n“In a city deeply scarred by the SARS outbreak—and still populated with hand sanitizer stations—familiar reflexes, like proper hand hygiene, have snapped back into practice. “People are quite cautious now when they face a major outbreak of an infection,” says David Hui, director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.”\n\nTAIWAN\n\nPopulation: 23.6 million * Infected: 53 * Deaths: 1\n\nAfter SARS, Taiwan decided not to be taken by surprise again and created a central command center of epidemics, TIME reports.\n\nWhile other countries worldwide were still building the scaffolding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan was out of the blocks with action items, policies, communications and health-care plans at the ready.\n\nIt used high tech and big data to track patients, identify hot zones and pinpoint supplies, reports ABC News.\n\n“In a single day, Taiwan's government was able to combine data from the National Health Insurance Administration and Immigration Agency to identify patients' 14-day travel history. In addition, with data from citizens' household registration systems and foreigners' entry cards, individuals at high risk were identified, self-quarantined and monitored through their cellphones.\n\nWhile big events were generally cancelled, the schools closed for two weeks but opened again on Feb. 25, The Times authors noted.\n\nAuthorities created a toll-free national hotline for people to report suspicious symptoms in themselves and others and provided support for families dealing with infection, reports the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n“…as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine.”\n\n* * *\n\nThree population centers at high-risk in this pandemic are proving the upward trend lines of the novel coronavirus are not a given - that smart, aggressive human intervention can save lives and spare national health systems the devastation of this global emergency.\n\nITALIANS ARE AT VIRUS OVERLOAD AND THEY'RE TALKING TO US\n\nIn Europe, Italy is enduring the largest outbreak of COVID-19, with 15,113 people infected and 1,016 deaths.\n\nTwo Italian academics, one a doctor, one an engineer, have published their observations of the enormous strain the new coronavirus is putting on the health-care system in northern Italy.\n\nEven as Italy has put in place strong measures to cut off social contact among its population, the infection trend lines continue moving upwards so sharply they are on the verge of overwhelming the health-care system, write Giuseppe Remuzzi, chairman of the Department of Transplantation at Bergamo Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, and Andrea Remuzzi, professor in the School of Engineering, University of Bergamo.\n\n“If the change in the slope of the curve does not take place soon, the clinical and social problems will take on unmanageable dimensions, which are expected to have catastrophic results,” they write in the British Medical Journal “Lancet”.\n\nThe two report that 9% to 11% of all infected patients in Italy between March 1 and March 11 had to be placed in intensive care units, putting enormous strain on hospitals.\n\nThey predict given current trends Italy will need an extra 2,500 ICU beds in a week to treat the most serious coronavirus patients. You can sense their frustration with Italian bureaucrats who still haven’t figured out the gravity of the situation inside the hospitals:\n\n“In the meantime, the government is preparing to pass legislation that will enable the health service to hire 20,000 more doctors and nurses and to provide 5,000 more ventilators to Italian hospitals. These measures are a step in the right direction, but our model tells us that they need to be implemented urgently, in a matter of days. Otherwise, a substantial number of unnecessary deaths will become inevitable. Intensive care specialists are already considering denying life-saving care to the sickest and giving priority to those patients most likely to survive when deciding who to provide ventilation to. This attitude has already been criticized by the current President of the Italian Comitato di Bioetica (Bioethics Committee) who, in a recent declaration to lay press stated that the Constitution recognizes the right of every individual to receive all necessary health care. They might not recognize that the reality is that intensive care wards are overflowing with patients and that COVID-19 is not a benign disease. Our doctors and nurses are modern heroes in an unexpected war against a difficult enemy. In the near future, they will have no choice. They will have to follow the same rules that health-care workers are left with in conflict and disaster zones.”\n\nToday, The New York Times is reporting that epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and universities around the world began building scenarios on how the coronavirus outbreak might affect the United States:\n\n“Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. \"And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.’s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.”\n\nThose projections would be altered by the actions of states, businesses and individuals to employ social distancing and other measures to slow the spread of the virus, The Times reports.\n\nFACING A PANDEMIC: 'THERE ARE NO EASY OPTIONS'\n\nWednesday was a watershed moment in the United States as a torrent of news on the new coronavirus shook the American people from their slumber and the fantasy that this is just another flu bug.\n\nThese were the stunning news items in a single day:\n\nGerman Chancellor says up to 70% of Germans could get infected.\n\nWorld Health Organization declares a pandemic.\n\nNBA game is shut down, fans sent home.\n\nNBA season indefinitely suspended.\n\nNBA player infected with COVID-19.\n\nActor Tom Hanks and wife announce they are infected.\n\nTrump suspends travel from Europe.\n\nOn Wednesday, coronavirus finally got America's attention.\n\nToday, the prevailing strategy in the western world is to flatten the coronavirus curve, to put in place social distancing (reduce public interaction) and stop the rapid spread of disease. The goal is to make COVID-19 run its course more gradually so it does not overwhelm hospitals and health-care systems.\n\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, an expert on infectious disease and vice-dean of academic development at Imperial College London, talked about the limits of the containment strategy, now in place in China, and the mitigation strategy. The United States is doing a mix of both.\n\nAs you will see, there are enormous, “dislocating” consequences to both and “no easy options.” Listen in particular to how long he believes the containment strategy, now in place in China and recommended by the World Health Organization, would have to remain in place.\n\nThe relevant portion of this video begins at 01:30. Transcript below.\n\nTranscript (01:30 on)\n\n“I think kind of fundamental decisions have to be made by countries as to whether they’re going to follow what WHO (World Health Organization) is recommending and what the Chinese did, namely to attempt to suppress all transmissions or alternatively try to mitigate, sometimes control an epidemic, but short of completely stopping its spread. “It’s an important distinction because in the former case effectively that’s the strategy, in theory if it works, could largely prevent deaths from this infection, but would really have to be kept in place for 12-18 months until we have a vaccine available at scale. That has enormous feasibility issues and can you actually have any society really maintain those sort of controls for that long? It clearly has huge economic and social issues associated with it. “I mean the alternative is in some sense no easier, the idea of kind of mitigating an epidemic which is though fundamentally allowed to run its course until basically it stops because it runs out of people and develops herd immunity – not everybody in the population get infected. We estimate the best you can do is that half the population though get infected. We’re still talking about an enormous epidemic in each country, and even if we do our best to protect those most vulnerable, the elderly, people with pre-existing health conditions, it still could potentially have a very high health burden, both in terms of deaths and in terms of demands on hospitals and health-care systems. So there are no easy options here. In the next few months you’re going to see, almost regardless of these particular strategies adopted, we’ll see many countries in the world, if not all countries in the world, see kind of major, dislocating social changes, just as a result of the interventions that need to be put in place.”\n\nWHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO GET COVID-19?\n\nPatients are experiencing a range of reaction to Coronavirus. From mild illness to extreme illness and death.\n\nHere's how one young man describes the experience:\n\nIt began like a cold, then I felt better and then it got a lot worse ...\n\nCan Coronavirus heal America's political divide?\n\nSomething extraordinary happened on Monday. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of the State of California, leader of the land that calls itself “The Resistance” to the Republican White House in Washington, D.C., had many nice things to say about Donald Trump.\n\nYou have to watch the video to understand the depth of Newsom’s words, but they are genuine and heartfelt.\n\nThe federal government had been working with California to repatriate passengers from the coronavirus-infected Grand Princess cruise ship. And now media were teeing up questions for Newsom to drive Trump into the stratosphere.\n\nInstead, Newsom left his driver in his golf bag and described his discussion with the president thus:\n\n“We had a private conversation, but he said, 'We're gonna do the right thing' and 'You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise.’ … He said everything I could have hoped for. And we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.\"\n\nIt seems improbable that the new coronavirus could bring Democrats and Republicans together, especially in a presidential election year, and especially after the White House is widely believed to have squandered precious days and weeks when it might have produced and widely distributed reliable test kits.\n\nBut America is awakening to a kind of slow-moving earthquake, that judging from China, South Korea and Italy, will soon escalate to a rapidly moving calamity that will require all of our wiles and cooperation to manage.\n\nIn Italy, where coronavirus has infected 10,149 and killed 631 people, a nation divided politically and culturally between north and south is rallying around a fragile coalition government to get it through what can now be called a disaster.\n\nNorthern Italy is desperately trying to provide care to rising numbers of infected patients and dying elderly. Doctors in Italy are warning other nations, including our own, to resist complacency and reject soothing notions that this is no worse than the flu.\n\nAnd what is truly extraordinary is that the tables have turned on a country in which the north for decades has sneered at the south for its so-called dirty ways – an attitude exacerbated by a cholera epidemic in 1973 that plagued southern Italy, reports The Times of London.\n\n“The snobbery was best expressed in 2009 by the politician Matteo Salvini when he was filmed joining fellow northerners in a song accusing Neapolitans of being ‘cholera sufferers’ who never washed with soap. “‘Smell that stink, even the dogs are fleeing, the Neapolitans are arriving,’ sang the group gathered around Mr Salvini, who was an advocate of secession for Italy’s wealthy north at the time, before he became a latter-day patriot when he took over the anti-migrant League party, which is now in opposition.”\n\nMr. Salvini, who has become more popular, is decidedly taking a back seat to the more boring leaders of the coalition government. A survey of his countrymen last week showed that 58% want opposition parties to rally around the government, The Times reported, while only 12% backed Salvini’s proposal to form a new national unity government.\n\nIn Italy, the stirring of national fellowship expressed itself when tourists from northern Italy were found to be infected while visiting Sicily in the south. They were treated “wonderfully well” in a southern hospital, The Times reported.\n\nDiscussions have begun about transferring patients with conventional ailments from hospital beds in the north to beds in the south to clear more beds for coronavirus patients in desperate northern hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile the nation’s physicians, the virus experts that the Italian newspaper La Stampa has dubbed “The Magnificent Eight,” have become Italy’s new superheroes as they keep their country informed on the coronavirus.\n\nAs Newsom demonstrated on Monday, we’re in a moment when we need to try to put aside simmering animosities, and start working together to help all of our fellow Americans. That attitude needs to begin on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWHY CORONAVIRUS IS NOT THE 1918 SPANISH FLU\n\nTake a moment and appreciate how much better off we are than our ancestors who in 1918 had to manage a much more deadly pandemic without the wonders of advanced medicine.\n\nThe New York Times has noted that many comparisons have been made to the Spanish Flu of 1918 and the Coronavirus of 2019-20. But the differences are profound.\n\nBack then …\n\n“Doctors knew viruses existed but had never seen one — there were no electron microscopes, and the genetic material of viruses had not yet been discovered. Today, however, researchers not only know how to isolate a virus but can find its genetic sequence, test antiviral drugs and develop a vaccine. “In 1918, it was impossible to test people with mild symptoms so they could self-quarantine. And it was nearly impossible to do contact tracing because the flu seemed to infect — and panic — entire cities and communities all at once. Moreover, there was little protective equipment for health care workers, and the supportive care with respirators that can be provided to people very ill with coronavirus did not exist.”\n\nThe Times points to the recent data from South Korea, which is enduring one of the worst Coronavirus epidemics and is doing the most aggressive testing of any country.\n\nAwash in new data, South Korea reports a fatality rate of .65%. The Spanish Flu had a fatality rate of at least 2.5% and killed 50 million people (the equivalent of 200 million today).\n\nBut if modern medicine is our armor, modern connectivity is our challenge.\n\nDrawing on the same numbers from South Korea, British historian Niall Ferguson in The Wall Street Journal compares the new coronavirus to the more recent H1N1, also known as swine flu, that killed 12,469 people in 2009. Its fatality rate was 0.02%.\n\nIf as many Americans catch COVID-19 as caught swine flu, the death toll could exceed 440,000, writes Ferguson. He further cautions:\n\n“Standard epidemiological models tend to understate the threat posed by a virus such as 2019-nCoV, because they don’t take account of the topology of the social networks that transmit it. ... we now understand the extraordinary power of modern transportation networks combined with the social-network hubs known as “superspreaders.” “Network effects are the reason it is anything but dumb to worry about the novel coronavirus. Not only is it spreading much faster than most Americans realize; it is also disrupting global manufacturing supply chains as well as all the economic activities that depend on travel and proximity. It could set off a cascade of defaults in the corporate bond market, disrupting the global financial network. “… That aspect of the panic is indeed dumb. But that doesn’t make it smart to underestimate the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic — a perfect illustration of the vulnerability and fragility of our networked world.”\n\nIRISH PHYSICIAN TO HER GOVERNMENT: DON'T SQUANDER THIS MOMENT\n\nDr. Carmen Regan, a senior lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology with a clinical base in Coombe Women’s Hospital, Dublin, has been warning the Irish government to stop flights from Italy, where Coronavirus has infected large swaths of the population.\n\nIn an open letter to the government, she begins:\n\n“I write as a consultant specialist in maternal medicine with 30 years of experience in caring for high-risk pregnant mothers. I have never written to the media nor made public comment on matters of policy in relation to healthcare. I do so now out of grave concern.”\n\nShe goes on to say…\n\n“We are only at the beginning of this journey. I, for one, do not want to look back with regret at what I should have done on behalf of our people in the early stages of this epidemic.”\n\nShe's a compelling voice. Listen to her interviewed here:\n\nTHE GLOBAL FORCES THAT SHAPE OUR POLARIZED NATION\n\nI went on KJZZ to discuss “WhiteShift,” a book by University of London political scientist Eric Kaufmann. He connects the dots on Brexit and Donald Trump, framing the big picture on today’s right-wing populism and polarized politics. You can hear my discussion with KJZZ’s Mark Brodie here.\n\nWe invited Kaufmann to write for The Arizona Republic’s Sunday Viewpoint section. He tailored his piece to Arizona.\n\nHis book describes the worldwide influences that have created political upheaval in western societies. I find his thesis optimistic, that in time the immigration wars will settle down and we'll have a multi-ethnic society that generally embraces a national identity and that gets a long. Eventually all Americans will be multi-ethnic and multi-racial.\n\nDEMOCRATS HAVE A BIG PROBLEM: THEIR BORDER POLICY IS LOCO\n\nYou didn’t expect this discussion to start in The New York Times, but here it is:\n\nThe American left is headed for the jagged rocks of 2020 electoral defeat if it doesn’t soon find its bearings on border issues. If not, it may lose the White House because of immigration radicalism.\n\nIn a long essay headlined “The Open Borders Trap,” Times senior writer Jason DeParle reminds readers that in 2008 the Democratic Party platform argued, “We cannot continue to allow people to enter the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked. We need to secure our borders.”\n\nThat now “sounds like an artifact of a long-ago age,” writes DeParle, because the “progressive vanguard” since then has been proposing a series of extreme policies that would move aside long-standing laws and policies and open wide the border.\n\nDeParle catalogues the promises 2020 Democrats have made to immigration rights groups. Taken together they’re breathtaking:\n\nDecriminalize border crossing.\n\nBan deportations.\n\nEnd detention.\n\nAbolish ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nProvide undocumented immigrants universal health insurance.\n\nProvide free college.\n\nExpand school meals.\n\nExpand other safety net programs.\n\nAdds DeParle:\n\n“Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the progressive standard-bearer, likens detention facilities to “concentration camps.” Eight advocacy groups have released an immigration plan they call “Free to Move, Free to Stay,” a slogan that suggests no limits. “… what’s notable about the progressives’ stance isn’t just the retreat on enforcement. It’s also the lack of an affirmative case for immigration — an argument for how it strengthens the economy, invigorates the culture and deepens ties to the world.\"\n\nDeParle believes the left has abandoned these significant arguments for why immigration is important to the country: “It has powered the rise of Silicon Valley, brought entrepreneurs to the inner city and staffed hospitals in the reddest and bluest of states.”\n\n“Yet some on the left say economic arguments commodify immigrants or denigrate the native work force.\"\n\nThe looms of progressive activism are weaving an immigration policy that cannot be sustained, given the economic imbalance between North and Latin America. It is creating a moral dilemma, writes DeParle:\n\n“There are more potential migrants than the country can accept. To the extent that they’re fleeing poverty and violence, it’s unfair to keep them out. But with nearly two billion people living on less than $3.20 a day, it’s impossible to let them all in. Hence the need to set limits and enforce them humanely.”\n\nMany on the left believe Trump’s cruel border policies are turning votes against him, particularly his mistreatment and separation of migrant children, argues DeParle.\n\n“But the more immigration becomes part of the culture wars, the more its supporters have to lose. Immigration propelled Britain from the European Union and left Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany a lame duck. Immigration’s value can’t be assumed. It has to be defended.”\n\nEnergized by DeParle’s essay, political scientist and Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira writes on his blog:\n\n“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Once it comes time to face Donald Trump in the general election, Democrats will need much clearer and more salable positions on immigration than the ones Democratic candidates drifted into in the primary season. Otherwise, Trump will do real damage to the Democratic nominee on the issue.\"\n\nTeixeira, made famous by his 2002 book “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” derides the immigration-rights activists that DeParle quotes in his essay for taking “one nutty position after another on various immigration issues. You read through them and just shake your head: what planet are these people living on?\"\n\n“The Democratic nominee in 2020 needs to decisively reject the open borders talk and utter lack of realism on border security and what a workable immigration system might look like that appears to dominate these advocates’ thinking. Otherwise Trump will have a field day and immigrants will be worse off, not better off.”\n\nTHE VIEW ON MARS\n\nThe latest images from the Curiosity Mars Rover sure look familiar. I half expect to see a saguaro.\n\n'ELECTION NIGHT 2016' WITH THE PROGRESSIVES\n\nIt's an American conceit that every generation believes its cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" is the best of all time. I'm a child of the Seventies so, of course, I stand by John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray. I've never seen anything Will Ferrell did that I found funny.\n\nYeah, I'm a Boomer.\n\nBut I have to admit this bit from SNL's more recent past is pretty darned great.\n\nWHAT WOULD A CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK LOOK LIKE IN ARIZONA? WASHINGTON STATE TELLS US\n\nThe Coronavirus got a beachhead in the United States in the state of Washington, scene of the first large U.S. outbreak of COVID-19. As of Friday, there have been 79 confirmed people infected in four Washington counties and 15 deaths, according to the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nThe World Health Organization hasn't yet labeled the Coronavirus a pandemic, but many epidemiologists are convinced it is and are calling it that.\n\nIf COVID-19 behaves in the Pacific Northwest the way it has in other parts of the world, the infections will radiate outward. We can’t know what will happen in Arizona, but we have to prepare for the possibility that such an outbreak could occur here.\n\nHere’s the picture in Washington State:\n\nHEALTH SYSTEM STRESSED\n\nThe Seattle Times reports, “Less than a week after diagnosed cases of COVID-19 grew rapidly in the Seattle area, health care providers say medical supplies are growing scarce, threatening to further stress a system already scrambling to control the coronavirus outbreak.”\n\nValley Medical Center in metro-Seattle put out an email telling its health workers:\n\n“Limit mask use to on the patient only. …Staff will no longer wear masks, unless providing a care procedure requiring removal of the patient’s mask. …Masks are in critical supply (and) “due to disaster conditions VMC will be implementing alternate standards of care to conserve masks for critical and surgical use.”\n\nHealth-care authorities fear emergency rooms, clinics and community health centers could be overrun with requests for testing. They’re telling everyone to call ahead if they suspect they have COVID-19, the Times reports.\n\nFEAR IN HOSPITALS\n\nHealth care workers are beginning to worry about their own health as more and more patients are admitted with the disease. Olga Ramirez, a nurse at Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center, told The Times she is worried about ending up in a hospital bed. “I’m human, too — it does make me nervous. I have underlying health care issues. I have asthma, I have diabetes and some heart problems. So, I’m concerned that going to work is going to somehow affect me medically, physically, mentally.”\n\nLOST CONVENTIONS\n\nOrganizers have canceled three major events at the Washington State Convention Center, including the Emerald City Comic Con, reports The Times.\n\n“The cancellations and postponement represent a significant economic loss for the downtown hospitality sector, which has already been hit by a wave of cancellations since the deaths last week of Seattle-area residents from the coronavirus outbreak, the first in the U.S.”\n\nVULNERABLE POPULATIONS STAY HOME\n\nPeople older than 60 and pregnant women are being urged to stay at home and avoid contact in public, reports the Everett, Wash. Herald.\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nK-12 officials are weighing whether to close the public schools in affected counties. Some 13,000 people have signed petitions demanding the schools be closed, The Herald reports.\n\nUNIVERSITIES\n\nA number of the universities are now operating remotely, providing online classes while cancelling on-campus classes and events, including commencement.\n\nTECH EMPLOYEES WORK FROM HOME\n\nAbout 10,000 people employed at Amazon’s buildings in Seattle and Bellevue are now working from home. The buildings are almost entirely empty, The Times, reports.\n\nLEGAL FIGHT OVER QUARANTINE\n\nThe City of Kent, Wash. called a press conference and filed a restraining order to stop King County from using a vacant motel in its community to begin quarantining people exposed to the virus. The courts eventually denied the City of Kent’s petition, reports The Times. The county is using the motel to quarantine 10 potentially infected Kirkland Firefighters who had answered the call to a nursing home where the infection was present.\n\nCITY COUNCIL GOES REMOTE\n\nThe Seattle City Council is planning to conduct its regular City Council meetings remotely and has cancelled all committee meetings until further notice, The Times reports.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE HOME OPENER COULD MOVE\n\nThis may concern Arizona. The sports pages of the Seattle Times are reporting that the Seattle Mariners still intend to play their home opener March 26 against the Texas Rangers at T-Mobile Park. But Times sports writer Ryan Divish reports that contingency planning is underway.\n\n“What could the Mariners do if Seattle is deemed an unsafe location to open the season? Sources indicate a variety of contingencies have been discussed on the periphery but nothing concrete. There could be games without fans in attendance. The Mariners and Rangers could remain in Arizona and play those games in the area at a spring-training facility. “The Arizona Diamondbacks also open the season at home. So Chase Field in Phoenix will be used. But if the need for an MLB field is demanded, the Mariners and Rangers could play day games there.”\n\nOUR BEST POLITICAL HUMORIST SINCE MORRIS UDALL\n\nYears ago, I was telling our then national-political reporter Dan Nowicki that the best writer on Twitter is a guy named @exjon. Funny and really smart.\n\nDan said to me, “He’s local. He’s Phoenix. He’s Goldwater (Institute).”\n\n“No way!” I said.\n\nNot long after, one of our then Opinions editors, Carrie Watters, had the great good sense to recruit him as a guest columnist for The Arizona Republic Opinions pages.\n\nJon Gabriel is the best political humorist in Arizona and every bit on par with the late, great Morris Udall. Their styles are similar. Usually easy-going. Always fall-down funny.\n\n@exjon is so skilled at wielding 140 characters he has a national following on Twitter. He’s been retweeted by the president of the United States, and, as you’ll see in this response to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar today, he’s apt to go viral:\n\nSign up to his Twitter feed here.\n\nAs for the legendary Arizona congressman Morris Udall, here's a sample of his humor over the years:\n\n“Let's turn inflation over to the post office. That'll slow it down.”\n\n“Presidential ambition is a disease which can only be cured by embalming fluid.”\n\n“I have learned the difference between a cactus and a caucus. On a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.”\n\n“If you are a United States senator and are not under indictment or in detoxification, you automatically consider yourself as a potential candidate for the presidency.”\n\nBERNIE WORLD IS ALREADY HERE AND IT’S A DISASTER\n\nWonder what the country would look like if Bernie Sanders ever got the levers of power to construct his socialist paradise?\n\nWonder no more, writes National Review columnist Christopher F. Rufo. The socialists have taken over one of the great cities of the Pacific Northwest and have begun their reordering of society.\n\n“Seattle has effectively become the nation’s laboratory for socialist policies,” writes Rufo.\n\n“Since the beginning of the year, the socialist faction on the Seattle City Council has proposed a range of policies on taxes, housing, homelessness, and criminal justice that put into practice the national democratic-socialist agenda. \"In the most recent session, socialist councilwoman Kshama Sawant and her allies have proposed massive new taxes on corporations, unprecedented regulations on landlords (including rent control and a ban on “winter evictions”), the mandated construction of homeless encampments, and the gradual dismantling of the criminal justice system, beginning with the end of cash bail.”\n\nThe progressive bloc of the City Council is already consolidating authority, reports Rufo, with bans on corporate spending in local elections and with $100 taxpayer-funded “Democracy Vouchers” that Seattle residents can use to support their local candidates. The vouchers “are easily collected by unions, activists, and socialist groups.\"\n\nLooming in the background are “black-bloc activists and Antifa militants” who “intimidate any potential opposition by disrupting events, vandalizing homes, and even orchestrating death threats against political adversaries.”\n\nAmerican business needs to wake up, stop appeasing political ex and start understanding that socialism will need to be opposed on many fronts, he argues.\n\nCORONAVIRUS YANKS THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nOn Feb. 28, the Harvard Business Review forecast that in mid-March the impact of the COVID-19 virus would be felt on global supply chains, “forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe.”\n\n“The most vulnerable companies are those which rely heavily or solely on factories in China for parts and materials. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.”\n\nOn Thursday, The Daily Breeze in Torrance, Calif. reported the supply chain at nearby Southern California ports has already been seriously yanked.\n\n“Jobs on the docks are drying up, leaving many workers without steady work, as empty cargo containers stack up at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, officials said this week. “It’s all a casualty of an ongoing drop in ship calls from Asia as the coronavirus continues spreading. Factories in China have remained closed or operated at below-capacity levels for weeks now as the virus has taken its toll. About half of the cargo coming into the ports comes from China.\n\nThe ports together have seen a more than 50% job loss over 2019, said Ray Familathe, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union, reports The Daily Breeze. “It’s a tremendous loss of cargo.”\n\nPort of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka disputed those numbers.\n\n“It is substantial, but we have not eliminated half the jobs at the port,” he said, referring to the union’s 50% figure.\n\nForty-one ships have canceled cargo deliveries scheduled between mid-February and early April, Seroka said.\n\nWILL ARIZONA’S SUMMER HEAT KNOCK DOWN COVID-19?\n\nPeople in warm-weather climes in the United States and around the world are asking if their hot weather can be the firewall to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizonans are asking the same.\n\nWe all dread our Arizona summers and the triple-digit heat. Will this be the first time we actually appreciate it?\n\nThe answer at the moment is unclear.\n\n“Unfortunately, no one knows for sure — and even experts can't seem to agree on whether or not warmer weather will slow down the coronavirus,” reports Health.com.\n\nBut if COVID-19 behaves like normal viruses it will be vulnerable to heat.\n\nInfluenza and cold infections trend sharply downward during summer months, reports TIME magazine. “Warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,” says Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nWe don’t have enough information to know if high temperature will knock down COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as reported by The Dallas Morning News.\n\nHowever, we do know that its opposite – cold weather – weakens the immune system.\n\nDr. Susan Mathai, a pulmonologist at Baylor Scott & White Health, told The Morning News that cooler weather has the following effects on the human body:\n\n\"For one, cellular strands in the respiratory system, called cilia, are less effective during cold weather. Cilia work to keep airways clean. She said that’s important because when people breathe, particles in the air can get caught in their noses. But if the strands are less effective, more particles get caught, including germs. \"The body’s immune system also doesn’t function as well in cold weather. Drier air, which can come with cooler temperatures, can increase the viscosity of the normal mucus your body needs, making it less efficient in fighting off disease by building up in the sinuses. “‘We think of mucus as a bad thing, but it’s actually super important in keeping our bodies healthy,’ Mathai said.\"\n\nOf course, Arizona summers are extremely dry when we're not in monsoon. Would that be a detriment? Again, too early to know.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, apparently with little scientific evidence, said COVID-19 will die in warmer summer temperatures. “The heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus.”\n\nSpeculation of this sort is actually detrimental at this point, said.Thomas Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“Policymakers and health officials should not rely on warmer temperatures to save us from COVID-19. The only things that can do that are public health preparedness and level-headed policies to reduce the number of people infected, protect health-care workers, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of those who do get ill.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped government leaders and other stakeholders around the world from asserting their hot weather has made a difference.\n\nINDONESIA\n\nIndonesia officials credit their lack of COVID-19 outbreak to their warm climate, TIME reports. But Health officials there are more guarded.\n\nThat’s unknowable until we better understand the characteristics of COVID-19, Vivi Setiawaty, head of a biomedical research center at Indonesia’s Health Research and Development Agency, told the Jakarta Post.\n\n\"She said that although viruses would be inactivated at temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees Celsius (122 and 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and that more cases were confirmed in countries with cooler weather, there had also been confirmed cases in tropical countries with similar weather to Indonesia. The Philippines, for instance, had recorded the first death from the novel coronavirus outside of China.\"\n\nAFRICA\n\n“Some observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there,” reports The (London) Guardian. “The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.”\n\n“The disease has only just arrived in Africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there,” Mark Woolhouse, a professor at Edinburgh University told The Guardian. “We will just have to wait and see.”\n\nHe further added,\n\n“I would not be surprised if we now have a virus that we will have to deal with forever. However, in such cases the first major outbreak is always the worst one. After that it should settle down and become part of a regular repertoire of winter viruses, I would imagine.”\n\nINDIA\n\nOne of that nation’s health-care officials is highly optimistic, perhaps too optimistic, that India’s climate will stop the pathogen.\n\nK.K. Aggarwal, president of Heart Care Foundation of India, told the Economic Times that India is largely safe because its weather acts as a defense.\n\n“Aggarwal, also a former president of the Indian Medical Association, traces the origin and spread of the epidemic thus: Viruses prefer lower temperatures, which is why they have spread speedily in cooler and less humid areas like Japan and South Korea. In India's case, an outright outbreak seems unlikely because of the heat and humidity, he says.”\n\nOther international experts reject that kind of thinking.\n\nThe National Geographic reports:\n\n“Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch doesn’t think any weather changes will put a big dent in how the virus spreads. COVID-19 has now been documented around the world. If the virus is anything like a typical flu virus, it may worsen in Southern Hemisphere regions as the seasons change. “David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says not enough is known about this new virus to predict how it will change with different weather conditions. “‘The risk of making predictions without an evidence base is that they could, if they prove to be wrong, be taken as verity and give a false security,’ Heymann says via email. ‘The emphasis today should continue to be on containment to elimination where possible,’ he cautions.”\n\nATTACKING THE CORONAVIRUS - TEXAS STYLE\n\nLESSONS FROM A PANDEMIC A CENTURY AGO\n\nST. LOUIS VS. PHILADELPHIA – LEARNING FROM THE 1918 FLU\n\nAs we prepare for the larger outbreak of Coronavirus, there are lessons to be learned from the Spanish Flu of 1918 that killed some 50 million people worldwide, writes Claire Lehmann, British journalist and founding editor of the libertarian online magazine Quillette.\n\n“In early October 1918, when the Spanish flu hit the east coast of the United States, the health commissioner of St Louis, Max Starkloff, ordered the closure of schools, movie theaters, saloons, sporting events and other public gathering spots. While the measures were protested by some citizens, the quarantine went ahead. A month later, as the pandemic raged on, he ordered the closure of all business, with a few exceptions, such as banks. “While drastic quarantine measures were being implemented in St Louis, the health commissioner of Philadelphia, Wilmer Krusen, gave permission for a parade for the war effort to go ahead in his city. It is reported that within 72 hours of the parade, every bed in Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals was filled, and in the week ending October 5th, 1918, 2,600 people in Philadelphia had died, with the figure almost doubling a week later. At the end of the outbreak, St Louis had the lowest recorded death rate in the U.S., while in Philadelphia mortuaries overflowed and “bodies [were] piled up on sidewalks.”\n\nQUOTE: \"PANIC IS WHEN...\"\n\n“These bureaucrats and politicians who think panic is lines at Costco and angry parents when a school is closed, may find out that panic is when you are taking mom to the emergency room and she dies in the parking lot because no one can see her. I hope this does not happen and we get lucky, but all signs point the other direction.”\n\n- Robert Nelson, biomedicine expert and managing director and co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners, a biotech venture-capital firm, to Quillette\n\nHOW ONE NATION PREPARES FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nFive interesting factoids from today's Times of London:\n\n1. “With six million — one in five UK employees — likely to be sick during the worst of the outbreak, ministers are looking at changing sick pay rules that unions say risk public health by encouraging employees to work while unwell.”\n\n2. “Hospitals have been told to see as many patients as they can via video calls because their beds will be needed to treat coronavirus sufferers.”\n\n3. “The sickest patients could have treatment withdrawn to prioritize those with a higher chance of survival.”\n\n4. “The virus ‘could occur in multiple waves,’ potentially causing a second severe outbreak in the future.”\n\n5. “Perhaps more likely, the virus will become like seasonal flu and return every winter.”\n\nBARBRA STREISAND GOES SCORCHED EARTH, AGAIN\n\nBarbra Streisand is coming unglued as she imagines the horror that will descend on America if it elects a Republican for president.\n\nThe GOP hopeful is Donald Trump, so many will sympathize. But Streisand has gone scorched earth on every GOP nominee of the last two decades.\n\nOne of them, John McCain, got his revenge.\n\nDONALD TRUMP – “IT CAN’T BE WORSE” (2020)\n\n“Every morning I wake up, holding my breath while I turn on my phone to see the latest news. I think to myself, “It can’t be worse than yesterday.” But when the news loads, I think, “Ohhhhh, yes, it is worse.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand (Variety)\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH - “SUCH A DESTRUCTIVE MAN” (2001)\n\n\"Look at his ratings - how could such a destructive man be so popular with the American people? Not only is he poisoning our air and water by withdrawing his promise to enforce emissions standards and arsenic regulations, but he's poisoning our political system as well.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand (The Guardian)\n\nMITT ROMNEY - “AS EXTREME AS IT GETS” (2012)\n\n“Gov. Romney would take us backwards and is as extreme as it gets when it comes to a woman’s right to choose and giving America’s wealthiest even more tax cuts on the backs of the middle class. …Mitt Romney does not share our values.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand, Politico\n\nJOHN MCCAIN – “OLDEST PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN HISTORY (2008)\n\n\"Maybe he was sick of the lack of media attention…maybe he had enough of the late night talk show hosts poking fun at his age…maybe he realized that belonging to a party that has been associated with rich, white men was not going to connect with voters in this historical election year.\"\n\n- Barbra Streisand, TopNews\n\nMcCAIN'S REVENGE\n\nStreisand had been doing this tap dance on McCain’s head for years. In 2002 he struck back. He went on Saturday Night Live and said, “I’ve been in politics for over 20 years, and for over 20 years, I’ve had Barbra Streisand trying to do my job. So I decided to try my hand at her job.”\n\nJOE BIDEN NOW DRAGS BETO O'ROURKE'S BAGGAGE\n\nIt’s possible Joe Biden is considering making Beto O'Rourke his running mate when he says, “If I win, I’m coming for him.”\n\nHe might also be referring to Beto as a cabinet member or chief adviser. You can see the merits in this. O’Rourke has the look of RFK and electrifies young people the way Bobby once did. He's also a beacon to Latino voters who adore him.\n\nBut bringing Beto on the journey, no doubt to try to win the Texas primary, means you also bring his baggage, and Beto accumulated a lot in his short-lived run for president.\n\nExamples:\n\nGUNS\n\nModerator: \"Are you proposing taking away their guns?

The sense he’s a flake is so broadly held that it was a relief Tuesday night when he didn’t jump on the podium and denounce himself for being a slave owner in a former life. You get the impression that if he admitted to himself that this isn’t working it would become a self-extinguishing event that he could not tolerate. But at some point optimism becomes narcissism. He has reached that point.”\n\n- Peggy Noonan (Wall Street Journal)\n\nPOLICE\n\n“That injustice … continues to persist today. That system of suspending somebody, solely based on the color of their skin; searching that person solely based on the color of their skin; stopping that person solely based on the color of their skin; shooting that person solely based on the color of their skin; throwing the book at that person and letting them rot behind bars solely based on the color of their skin, is why some have called this, I think it is an apt description, the new Jim Crow.”\n\n- Beto O’Rourke (Texas Monthly)\n\nRELIGIOUS LIBERTY\n\nModerator: “Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities — should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?” O’Rourke: “Yes …There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us. So as president, we’re going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.”\n\n- The Los Angeles Times\n\nSTORIES I NEVER KNEW ABOUT MLK AND GUNS\n\nI’ve read enough about Martin Luther King, Jr. to know he didn’t like firearms. When white racists blew up the porch of his home in Montgomery, Alabama, a number of his lieutenants began gathering weapons to defend him. He told them to put the guns away.\n\nMy former Republic colleague Jennifer Dokes posts many interesting black-history stories on her Facebook page. Those have led to reading and discovery.\n\nFor instance, I didn’t know that six years after Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination that his mother was murdered by a gunman:\n\nIn 1974, as she played the organ during Sunday services at Ebenezer (Baptist church), Alberta Williams King was shot by Marcus Chenault, a 21-year-old man from Ohio who claimed, “All Christians are my enemies.\" Alberta Williams King died later that day at the age of 70.\n\nThat led to this Medium article about how Martin Luther King, Sr., MLK’s father, was held hostage with other Morehouse College trustees by a group of college-student activists. Among them was a guy named Samuel L. Jackson, yes, that Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nThe future actor was part of a radical Black Power group that was gathering guns for the struggle ahead, reports Parade Magazine.\n\n“In 1969, Jackson and other radical students held members of the Morehouse College board of trustees hostage on campus, demanding reform in the school’s curriculum and governance. The college eventually agreed to change, but Jackson was expelled. He stayed on for the summer in Atlanta, where he got to know Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown and others in the Black Power movement. ‘I was in that radical faction,’ Jackson said. ‘We were buying guns, getting ready for armed struggle. “‘All of a sudden,’ he said proudly, ‘I felt I had a voice. I was somebody. I could make a difference. But then one day,’ he added quietly, ‘my mom showed up and put me on a plane to L.A. She said, ‘Do not come back to Atlanta.’ The FBI had been to the house and told her that if I didn’t get out of Atlanta, there was a good possibility I’d be dead within a year. She freaked out.’”\n\nHis life changed dramatically (so to speak).\n\nHe talks briefly about the hostage taking here (begin at 04:00)\n\nHere is Jackson in the 2005 Parade article explaining how he seethed at the white-dominated, racist culture of his childhood:\n\n“I had anger in me. It came from growing up suppressed in a segregated society. All those childhood years of ‘whites only’ places and kids passing you on the bus, yelling, ‘******!’ There was nothing I could do about it then. I couldn’t even say some of the things that made me angry—it would have gotten me killed. But I had a dream of my own. I was determined to get out and make my family proud.”\n\nThere's another great story that depicts the intersection of guns and Martin Luther King, Jr. that shows his strength of character as a young seminary student. Stephen B. Oates tells it in his marvelous biography \"Let the Trumpet Sound\":\n\n\"...at the seminary, King had another brush with violence when a North Carolina white student came banging on his door one day. The student was well known for his racial views: he couldn’t accept Negroes as his schoolmates and called them “darkies.” Somebody had messed up his room—a prank called a “room raid”—and he blamed King. He was in a tirade, shouting at King, hurling maledictions at him. Then he drew a pistol and threatened to shoot King dead. But King would not be rattled. Looking the maddened student in the eye, he calmly denied having anything to do with the room raid. By now the racket had attracted other students: they yelled at the North Carolinian, made him put his gun down. Afterward they brought the matter before the student government; but to everybody’s surprise King refused to press charges. With students and faculty alike clamoring against him, though, the North Carolinian publicly admitted he was wrong and extended King an apology.\n\nAfter that King became the most popular student at Crozer, widely admired not only for his scholarship, but for his courage and grace as well.”\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS RUN ON DRUG- AND GROCERY STORES\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nGovernment officials in South Korea are warning its citizens to not “hoard” face masks and hand sanitizers as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus — which has caused a sharp rise in demand for such items — continues to spread. Officials with the South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance on Tuesday approved the stricter penalties, which went into effect on Wednesday and will be enforced until April 30, The Korea Herald reported. Those who are accused of hoarding such products could see up to two years of jail time or a fine of 50 million won, about $42,000.\n\n- FOX News\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapanese officials tried to flush away “rumors” of a coronavirus-fueled toilet paper shortage in the country Friday, according to reports. Residents should quit stockpiling rolls because the country’s supply is strong — despite reports that it has been nearly wiped out, industry ministry officials said, according to the local outlet NKH. Last week, panicked Japanese folks rushed to stores to buy the bathroom staple.\n\n- New York Post\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman magazine Der Spiegel reported (link in German) on Feb. 28 that the “first signs of (hoarding)” had been seen in Germany, citing discount retailers Aldi and Lidl. Among the items being hoarded are tinned goods and pasta, as well as toilet paper and disinfectants.\n\n- Quartz\n\nIRAN\n\n…The hoarded supplies, including 28 million medical gloves, were found in two warehouses in Kahrizak, a town about 25 km south of Tehran, a Revolutionary Guards commander, Hassan Hassanzadeh, told the Fars news agency. Pharmacies are short of gloves and other supplies. Anyone found hoarding medical supplies will be dealt with harshly, Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday, according to Mizan, the news site of the judiciary.\n\n- VOA News\n\nHAWAII\n\nWorries over coronavirus have people in Hawaii stocking up on supplies. At a Costco store in Honolulu on Thursday, there was a long line of people just trying to buy toilet paper. It took between 10 to 15 minutes just to get into the store's parking lot. Then there was a huge wait just to get into the store, with a line extending out of the door. People across the island are continuing to rush to stores since the health department urged people to prepare an emergency supply kit for coronavirus. Costco was limited toilet paper purchases to five packs per person.\n\n- FOX 5 – New York\n\nMARIE OSMOND'S LIFE IMITATES ART\n\nSo Marie Osmond announces she'll be leaving none of her fortune to her children.

Nonetheless, fear is changing the way people go about their daily lives, writes Beppe Severgnini, editorial writer and editor at “Corriere della Sera” (“Evening Courier”) in Milan. In today’s New York Times, he explains:\n\n“We see more masks on TV and online than on the streets of Milan — half-deserted streets, with many people staying home. Schools and markets are closed, and many events canceled. “...People have stopped shaking hands, let alone greeting each other with a kiss. If you sneeze or cough in public, people jerk away and show genuine alarm. Conversation is monopolized by coronavirus, and in the absence of clear rules, companies and organizations behave randomly.”\n\nCoronavirus will probably not be stopped from gaining a foothold in the United States, reports The Atlantic Online, after talking to leading U.S. epidemiologists.\n\nEfforts to quarantine cities, as the Chinese have done, or to quarantine yourself are probably fruitless. They just delay the misery. The majority of us are going to be exposed, health-care experts tell The Atlantic.\n\nEventually, the magazine reports, Covid-19 is likely to become a seasonal bug.\n\nTIP: A great site for following the real-time global advance of Coronavirus is the Johns Hopkins University Interactive Map.\n\nTHINK OUR SUMMER HEAT WILL BURN OFF CORONAVIRUS? THINK AGAIN\n\nThe Philadelphia Enquirer reports that summer heat isn't likely to slow the spread of Coronavirus as it moves deeper into the United States.\n\nUnlike with the seasonal flu, the change of seasons may not matter much to the coronavirus. ...While it is possible that this virus, like many other respiratory viruses, will not survive as readily in warm temperatures, it will be encountering a “completely susceptible” U.S. population, said Maciej F. Boni, an associate professor of biology at Penn State University. Hardly anyone in this country has been exposed to the new virus, so there’s been no chance to develop immunity. That means the coronavirus has plenty of opportunity to infect people and get passed along, Boni said.\n\n15 HEADLINES THAT TELL YOU YOU’RE LIVING A DISASTER MOVIE\n\n“THE CORONAVIRUS GOES GLOBAL”\n\n- The New York Times\n\n“DOW PLUNGES NEARLY 1,200 POINTS AS CORONAVIRUS FEARS SEND MARKETS DIVING”\n\n- NBC News\n\n“CORONAVIRUS SPREADS IN THREE CONTINENTS: MARKETS BRACE FOR GLOBAL RECESSION”\n\n- Rueters\n\n“THE CORONAVIRUS SEEMS UNSTOPPABLE.

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan is writing about her fears again. Some 22 years ago, she almost dead-on predicted the Sept. 11 attacks, three years before they happened. Today she is worried about Coronavirus and its eventual impact on the United States:\n\n“Punditry 101: It’s bad when you don’t write about what you’re thinking about. All week I was taking notes knowing I’d be looking at South Carolina, Super Tuesday and this week’s debate. …But my mind kept tugging in another direction. So I’ll write what I’m thinking, and it may be ragged but here goes. “…I’ve got a feeling the coronavirus is going to be bad, that it will have a big impact on America, more than we imagine, and therefore on its politics. …If coronavirus becomes a formally recognized world-wide pandemic, and if it hits America hard, it is going to change a lot—the national mood, our cultural habits, the economy. “…In a public-health crisis the role of government is key. The question will be—the question is—are the president and his administration up to it? Our scientists and health professionals are. …Is Donald Trump? Or has he finally met a problem he can’t talk his way out of? I have written in the past questioning whether he can lead and reassure the nation in a time of crisis. We are about to find out. …It is in crisis that you see the difference between showmanship and leadership.”\n\nHere's why you shouldn't dismiss Noonan's fears: In the summer of 1998, well before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, she wrote forebodingly about a terror mega-strike on the United States in the Nov. 30, 1998 “Big Issue\" of Forbes maga\n\n“Something's up. And deep down, where the body meets the soul, we are fearful. We fear, down so deep it hasn't even risen to the point of articulation, that with all our comforts and amusements, with all our toys and bells and whistles . . . we wonder if what we really have is . . . a first-class stateroom on the Titanic. Everything's wonderful, but a world is ending and we sense it. “I don't mean: \"Uh-oh, there's a depression coming,\" I mean: We live in a world of three billion men and hundreds of thousands of nuclear bombs, missiles, warheads. It's a world of extraordinary germs that can be harnessed and used to kill whole populations, a world of extraordinary chemicals that can be harnessed and used to do the same. “Three billion men, and it takes only half a dozen bright and evil ones to harness and deploy. What are the odds it will happen? Put it another way: What are the odds it will not? Low. Nonexistent, I think. “When you consider who is gifted and crazed with rage . . . when you think of the terrorist places and the terrorist countries . . . who do they hate most? The Great Satan, the United States. What is its most important place? Some would say Washington. I would say the great city of the United States is the great city of the world, the dense 10-mile-long island called Manhattan, where the economic and media power of the nation resides, the city that is the psychological center of our modernity, our hedonism, our creativity, our hard-shouldered hipness, our unthinking arrogance. “If someone does the big, terrible thing to New York or Washington, there will be a lot of chaos and a lot of lines going down, a lot of damage, and a lot of things won't be working so well anymore.”\n\nOAKLAND'S WARNING FLARE TO PHOENIX\n\nThe timing could not be more striking. The city of Phoenix approved a plan to create a citizen’s commission to watchdog its police department at the very moment the City of Oakland, Calif. was turning sulfuric with the actions of its own independent police commission.\n\nA week ago, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced she was firing Oakland Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick, the person she had hired in 2017. She was firing her “without cause” and praising her lavishly on the way out.\n\nWhat?\n\nPressed by Bay Area media to explain, Schaaf said Kirkpatrick had lost the confidence of Oakland’s 7-member independent police commission. The commission is very powerful, she said, made so by the voters of Oakland, and it is incumbent on any police chief of Oakland to maintain the trust of the commission.\n\nThe now terminated chief was stunned. “The mayor praises me but I’m terminated. I don’t understand. …I am saddened. I’m embarrassed. I’m humiliated by it,” she told San Francisco’s ABC 7 News.\n\n“I like my mayor but leaders stand up for their people, they stand up for you when they are serving you well,” Kirkpatrick told The Mercury News. “I came with these mandates to reduce crime and to have these culture shifts, to stabilize this police department. I have more than exceeded those expectations.”\n\nNo doubt playing into the chief’s departure was the 2018 police-involved shooting of a homeless man. Reports the Mercury News:\n\n“Kirkpatrick’s relationship with the commission, which represents Oakland residents and has authority over the chief and police force, has been frosty for months. Police commissioners had called for the firing of five officers involved in the fatal 2018 shooting of Joshua Pawlik, challenging the suspension recommended by Kirkpatrick, Internal Affairs and the department’s Executive Force Review Board.”\n\nOakland Police Commission Chair Regina Jackson explained that the police department had failed “to increase compliance with the court-ordered reforms required under the Negotiated Settlement Agreement.”\n\nThe department has been under federal court oversight since the 2003 settlement of a civil rights lawsuit that accused officers of assaulting suspects and planting evidence.\n\nKirkpatrick said, “Even the federal monitor, who was here with me three weeks ago, says to me in his closing meeting, one-on-one; he said, ‘Anne, you are deep in the red zone. If you are a football fan like I am, it means you’re real close to the goal line.”\n\nAfter the city fired Kirkpatrick, hundreds of Oakland police officers and support staff gathered to say their goodbyes to her and to criticize the mayor and independent commission for removing a leader they respected.\n\nToday the city of Oakland faces the following:\n\nTheir former chief is weighing a lawsuit against the city.\n\nShe has called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate.\n\nPolice department morale is spiraling downward, and one employee tells ABC 7 News that others in the department are considering leaving with the ex-chief.\n\nKirkpatrick is now revealing in 2018 she feared retaliation from one commission member because she rebuffed her demands to drop the commissioner's towing fees. The then-chief was so concerned she made a record of it with the city’s personnel department, the Mercury News reports.\n\n“In claiming retaliation from the commission over the towing fee dispute, Kirkpatrick and (her crisis manager Sam) Singer pointed to a 2018 internal city document recently made public that states police Commissioner Ginale Harris demanded the department and the chief pay her back for towing fees Harris owed the city. Kirkpatrick notified city officials at the time, and the request was included in an investigation of Harris that had been initiated by City Administrator Sabrina Landreth. At the time, the chief told the lead investigator she was concerned about retaliation, according to the document.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC 7 News the former chief was asked what she would say to anyone contemplating becoming the next Oakland P.D. chief:\n\nA: “Do not come to Oakland because they won’t have a job for long.”\n\nQ. Is it toxic?\n\nA. “Yes.”\n\nPUBLIC REACTS TO END OF ENDORSEMENTS\n\nAs we reported on azcentral this morning, The Arizona Republic will no longer endorse candidates for office. Executive Editor Greg Burton and I explain why here.\n\nHere’s a sample of reaction:\n\nDavid Boyles, ASU instructor\n\n\"As endorsing Republican candidates has become morally and intellectually untenable, Arizona's largest newspaper, which has historically been a mouthpiece for the state's GOP power structure, has decided to punt and no longer endorse candidates at all. This is moral cowardice.\"\n\nPeter Hamby, Vanity Fair contributor\n\n\"Hope more newspapers follow their lead.\"\n\nTim Agne, Digital Editor, KJZZ Phoenix\n\n\"Newspaper endorsements are a helpful tool for voters, especially in smaller local races where we don’t have as much information about the candidates.

Times\n\n\"Bold move by the Arizona Republic.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS STORIES THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION\n\nPREGNANT WOMEN NEGLECTED\n\nThe New York Times reports that expectant moms in China are being neglected by a health-care system overwhelmed by Covid-19.\n\n“In the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, pregnant women have faced the daunting prospect of figuring out where to give birth. Their community hospitals are closed, the city’s public transport is shut down and no one is allowed to leave because of quarantine rules.”\n\nAs of Wednesday, the toll in China is 80,000 people sickened, 2,600 killed.\n\nCHILDREN SPARED\n\nThe Times of London reports that Coronavirus is behaving differently than other bugs. Deaths do not follow the classic U-shaped curve in which the young and old face the highest mortality rates.\n\n“With coronavirus the death rate is not u-shaped. Yes, it rises sharply among the old but among those under 40 it is 0.2 per cent. Among those under ten it is zero. “With coronavirus something else is going on and researchers confess that they are stumped. It may be that the old are succumbing not so much because their immune systems can’t cope but because their bodies can’t. Afflicted with dodgy hearts and weakened lungs, in a way that newborns are not, they are an easier target. The more robust newborns on the other hand, even without strong immune systems, can weather the virus.”\n\nS. KOREAN HEALTH WORKERS ARE QUITTING\n\nThe Republic of Korea is now in a full-fledge epidemic that is stressing hospitals and health-care workers. The Wall Street Journal looks at the enormous stress they face.\n\n“In the hard-hit city of Daegu, South Korea, hospitals warned that they don’t have enough doctors, nurses and medical investigators to keep up with the constant stream of infected and at-risk patients. Government measures aimed at reducing infection, like discarding bedsheets and blankets after a single use, have depleted critical supplies. Employees are quitting as their families beg them to resign. “‘We can’t last long like this. All medical staff will burn out,’ said Nam Sung-il, a doctor treating patients at two Daegu hospitals. ‘Space is so scarce at one of them,’ Dr. Nam said, ‘that nurses have nowhere to rest but on the floor.’”\n\nTHE PRICE OF STOKING RESENTMENT\n\nIf you want to see where’s America’s obsession with identity politics can lead, look north to Canada, where protesters for three weeks have paralyzed the national rail system and cut people of from fuel to heat their homes, food to feed livestock, chemicals to clean drinking water, etc. etc.\n\nFinally Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded the removal of railroad barricades that indigenous protesters and radical environmentalists erected. But when one barricade goes down another goes up. Much of the protest centers on historic wrongs committed against First Nation peoples.\n\nJonathan Kay, columnist for the National Post, writes “While it’s convenient to blame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s indecisive leadership for the crisis, these events do not arise in a vacuum. Rather, they follow on years during which our political, academic and journalistic elites denounced Canada itself as an ugly scar on traditional Indigenous lands. Trudeau himself has spent much of his time in office pledging himself to somehow absolve Canada of this original sin.”\n\nCanadian nationhood is wobbling, and Kay asks the essential question, “Is it possible for Anglo Canada to rebuild some kind of positive national identity:\n\n“If so, I think we will need to take stock of how our modern self-conception fell to pieces in the first place. Until roughly the late 2000s, Canada’s identity was rooted largely in the idea that we were a poorer but more conscientious sidekick to America. Our whole multilateral (and occasionally pacifistic) shtick on the world stage, not to mention our system of cultural subsidies, was based on the conceit that our relative smallness and poverty compared to the United States masked some kind of well-hidden reserve of moral superiority. It was an insecure, passive-aggressive posture that often expressed itself as peevish anti-Americanism. But at the very least, it acted as a binding agent for an English-speaking Canadian intellectual establishment whose common culture otherwise was confined to hockey, cold weather and universal health care. “But during the Obama years, all of this was thrown into confusion, because the housing-loan crisis smashed America without much affecting Canada. Suddenly, we were no longer the poor cousin. At almost exactly the same time, Barack Obama’s election in the United States, coupled with Stephen Harper’s rise in Canada, reversed the left-right political valence that had powered Canadians’ sense of moral superiority since the early years of the Cold War. Suddenly, we were the bad guys, and the whole organizing principle of Canadian intellectual life began to collapse. Into this vacuum came Idle No More, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the MMIWG report, the Indigenous backlash to Canada 150 — and Trudeau, whose political instincts are rooted in the confessional, self-lacerating spirit of political correctness that began to infect campus life at McGill University (and elsewhere) in the late 1980s and early ’90s. Twenty years ago, we bashed America. In 2020, we bash us.”\n\nTHE STEEL TO CONFRONT THE CAMPUS MOB\n\nHeather Mac Donald is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank and person of real stature. She’s a lawyer with degrees from Stanford, Cambridge and Yale. She has written widely against extreme ideologies and concepts that range from radical feminism to critical race theory to implicit bias to social justice to transgender radicalism. Many of these are authoritarian in their nature and sprouting from campuses that are hot houses for daft, unchallenged social theories.\n\nIt takes courage to stand in the breach and endure the mockery of college students, but she does it with real poise. She answers the hissing crowd with details, facts and citations that damn the mob by contrast.\n\nIt’s impressive to watch, and you can see it here as students confront her at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. last Thursday:\n\nLET’S RUB THEIR FACES IN IT\n\nThere are many reasons why political comity has broken down, not least being the loss of grace.\n\nI don’t understand the human instinct to bat an opponent over the head once they’ve agreed with you.\n\nWhy not graciously thank them for their sudden ray of good judgment and be done with it.\n\nBut that seldom happens in today’s politics.\n\nCase in point, this past week Gov. Doug Ducey gave in to supporters of “sanctuary cities” and pulled the brakes on a proposed constitutional ban on the designation.\n\nChris Herstam, a liberal commentator and partisan who opposed Ducey’s ban, decided this was the moment to rub the governor’s face in it.\n\n“So, once again, Ducey rolled out the immigration controversy,” Herstam wrote in the Arizona Mirror. “And, once again, an Arizona governor stained Arizona’s reputation and potentially harmed our economy.”\n\nAt the Capitol, about 40 Latino activists and lobbyists gathered to spike the football.\n\n“The response from the governor last night shows the power we have after 1070 and the power we have now,” said Hugo Polanco, a lobbyist for Living United for Change Arizona, to the Arizona Mirror.\n\nPeople are entitled to their moment of triumph, but what greater purpose does it serve? My guess is they only harden their opponents for the next round and ensure their noses get rubbed in the ground when it’s their turn to retreat.\n\nThis stuff happens because both left and right do it.

The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza on May 16.\n\nThe Gaza pier is providing delivery access for ships bringing supplies and humanitarian aid through the island of Cyprus. About 90 trucks will use it per day at the start, 150 when it becomes fully operational.\n\nCost of the pier is estimated at $320 million. Construction began April 25.\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea route is being opened because food deliveries to Gaza by truck are “unpredictable and insufficient,” U.N. officials say. Land routes have been restricted by Israel over security concerns, The Washington Post reported.\n\nAll 2.2 million people in Gaza face food insecurity, and at least 1.1 million people are at risk of “catastrophic hunger,” according to a report by U.N. agencies on March 18.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced plans for the pier in his State of the Union address on March 7. U.S. service members will build, operate and defend the pier, The Washington Post reported. Biden said no American troops would be deployed into Gaza, however.\n\nWhat is the Gaza pier?\n\nThe Pentagon designates the Gaza pier as a Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore structure. Past versions have been used for disaster relief in Kuwait, Haiti and Central America, the BBC reported.\n\nJLOTS is a group of floating platforms arranged to allow equipment and supplies to reach areas without port facilities, according to the U.S. Transportation Command. The platforms consist of giant floating metal blocks that are maneuvered into position and secured together.\n\nHow will the Gaza pier be used?\n\nThe transfer system will work this way:\n\n(1) Food and other supplies for Gaza will first be delivered to Cyprus. All cargo will be inspected – including by X-ray technology – to make sure no weapons are being delivered.\n\n(2) Cleared cargo is loaded aboard ships, which will deliver them to the first JLOTS platform, called a discharge facility, about 200 miles from Cyprus.\n\nThe discharge facility is 270 feet long and 72 feet wide and will be anchored about 3 miles off the Gaza shore.\n\n(3) Supply pallets will be offloaded there and transferred to smaller support ships.\n\n(4) The support ships will take supplies to the second platform, known as a Trident Pier. It's named after the staff of the Greek god Poseidon.\n\nTogether, the Trident and its driveway-like causeway are about 1,800 feet. The causeway connects the Trident Pier to shore, and trucks will cross it to deliver supplies and return for more.\n\n(5) Israeli forces will again examine the supplies on shore before releasing them for distribution.\n\nHow much food will the Gaza pier handle?\n\nThe Pentagon has estimated daily food delivery capacity based on the operational status of the pier:\n\nCompleted: 90 truckloads\n\nFully operational: 150 truckloads\n\n150 truckloads is about 2 million meals a day, according to the Pentagon. By comparison, an average of 200 trucks a day entered Gaza in April, Reuters reported.\n\nWhy is the Gaza pier needed?\n\nThough many in Gaza are hungry, there's enough food near its borders to feed them, the U.N. says.\n\nThe problem is getting the food into Gaza. Humanitarian workers told The New York Times that difficulties hamper deliveries, including Israeli checkpoints and fighting inside the country.\n\nHamas, which killed an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others when it invaded Israel on Oct. 7, has been in control of Gaza since 2007.\n\nIn response to the invasion, Israel has limited food and medicine shipments into Gaza. It inspects every truckload for contraband that could aid Hamas. This causes delays, and some trucks wait weeks to enter.\n\nIn turn, Hamas has threatened those who help Israel distribute aid within Gaza.\n\nSeven humanitarian workers from the World Central Kitchen died in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza on April 4. Israel later said the strike was a mistake.\n\nNearly 200 aid workers have died in Gaza since the war began, according to the Aid Worker Security Database.\n\nThe U.S and its allies have conducted nearly three dozen airdrops of food into Gaza since March 2. Some aid organizations said the missions were a more expensive and less efficient method than bringing in food by truck.\n\nWho is building the Gaza pier?\n\nThe U.S. Central Command is overseeing construction of the Gaza pier, which is a joint effort between the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, including:\n\nSoldiers from the Army's 7th Transportation Brigade at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.\n\nfrom the Army's 7th Transportation Brigade at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. Sailors from Naval Beach Group 1 at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California.\n\nAbout 1,000 U.S. service members worked on the platforms. Those who stay to maintain operations will live aboard the Cardigan Bay, a British navy amphibious ship that will be anchored miles offshore.\n\nNo U.S. forces are going ashore as truck deliveries continue.\n\nIsraeli troops connected the causeway with a point on the Gaza shore. Truck drivers will be from an undisclosed nation and will provide their own security.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nSource: USA TODAY Network reporting and research; U.S. Central Command; U.S. Transportation Command; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/03/09/israel-hamas-war-live-news-updates/72909715007/", "title": "Israel, Hamas war updates: US scrambles to build dock for Gaza aid", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Saturday, March. 9. For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our live updates file for Sunday, March 10.\n\nU.S. military personnel are scrambling to build a temporary floating dock off Gaza to help distribute food and other aid to Palestinians by way of the sea, a new route for supplies after months of Israel's intense restrictions on aid delivered by land.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the assistance to Gaza during his State of the Union Thursday night, as Army personnel were already pulling plans and equipment together. On Friday, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, told reporters it would take over 1,000 soldiers weeks to create the structure.\n\nBiden said there will be no U.S. forces in Gaza for the mission, which will likely involve other allies, contractors and aid agencies.\n\nIsraeli forces have blocked routes and slowed aid deliveries for inspections over the five months since the war started after Hamas militants killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took 250 people hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nState of the Union:President Biden on hot mic says he needs a 'come to Jesus' meeting with Netanyahu\n\nIsrael’s attacks in Gaza have killed about 31,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe U.S. has already begun airdrops of aid to Gaza, where the United Nations says nearly all 2.3 million people are struggling to find food, while more than a half-million people face starvation. On Friday, Ryder said the U.S. has delivered over 124,000 meals to date.\n\nCalled a Joint Logistics Over the Shore, the temporary dock resembles LEGOs, with 40-foot-long pieces of steel that lock together to form a pier and causeway.\n\nDevelopments:\n\nFive children in Gaza were killed by a humanitarian aid drop from an unknown foreign country on Friday, the Gaza health ministry said. On Friday evening, the U.S. Central Command said in a statement that it was not an American airdrop.\n\nU.S. Central Command said on Saturday that American C-130 airplanes dropped more aid equivalent to more than 41,400 meals and 23,000 bottles of water in northern Gaza.\n\nAt least 20 people have died from complications related to malnutrition in northern Gaza. The deaths come after warnings about the risk of famine during the bombardment and siege of Gaza.\n\nSweden has joined European Union and Canada in restoring funding to the U.N. agency responsible for aiding Palestinians. The announcement comes after a pause in aid weeks ago as Israel accused a dozen of the thousands of workers for the U.N. agency of participating in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Several countries, including the U.S., stopped million in funds after the allegations.\n\nUS, allies down at least 28 Houthi drones during attack in Red Sea\n\nAmerican and coalition forces shot down at least 28 drones during a Houthi attack on Saturday morning in the Red Sea, according to U.S. Central Command.\n\nIn one attack, U.S. and coalition forces downed at least 28 Houthi unmanned aerial vehicles between 4 and 8:20 a.m. local time in the Red Sea, CENTCOM’s statement said. The drones didn’t damage any U.S. or coalition vessels in the attack, and no commercial ships were damaged.\n\nIn a statement, Yahya Sarea, a Houthis spokesperson, said the rebel group sent 37 drones to target American destroyers in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group in Yemen, have targeted ships in the Red Sea in what militants call opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. The first fatalities from the Houthis' attacks occurred Wednesday when an anti-ship ballistic missile hit a Liberian-owned cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden, killing three crew members and wounding four others. Houthis claimed responsibility for that attack.\n\nCyprus becoming hub for aid delivery\n\nThe European Union announced on Friday it would open a shipping corridor in the Mediterranean Sea to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza from the island nation of Cyprus.\n\nCyprus, located about 250 miles from the Gaza Strip, is poised to become a key part of food delivery and other humanitarian assistance to the war-torn Palestinian territory as Israel has limited other aid deliveries by truck. The shipping corridor is established in partnership with the European Commission, the U.S., the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus and others, a joint statement from the countries said on Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, the European Commission said a ship with humanitarian assistance planned to leave Cyprus for Gaza as the pilot voyage through the corridor. The vessel from the Spanish aid group, Open Arms, would deliver aid to northern Gaza from World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit headed by celebrity chef José Andrés.\n\nThe aid is expected to arrive in two to three days at an undisclosed location in northern Gaza, where cases of hunger and starvation are most severe.\n\nLior Haiat, a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign affairs ministry, said on social media that Israel welcomed the maritime aid, but cautioned it would need security checks.\n\nA World Central Kitchen news release said it had delivered over 32 million meals to date, via trucks and airdrops. The shipping corridor allows the charity group to increase the amount of aid it delivers, the news release said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/05/16/israeli-war-updates-gaza-hamas/73712032007/", "title": "Israeli war updates: World court told Israel 'must be stopped'", "text": "South Africa asked the top international court Thursday to order a halt to the Rafah offensive, accused Israel of genocide and said the country's war effort \"must be stopped\" to protect the Palestinian people.\n\nSouth Africa’s legal representatives at the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, said Israel's shutdown of the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings have plunged Gaza into \"unprecedented levels of humanitarian need.\" They demanded Israel completely withdraw from Rafah, a city of 250,000 before the war that swelled to more than 1 million as refugees fled fighting elsewhere in Gaza.\n\n“From the onset, Israel's intent was always to destroy Palestinian life and to wipe them off the face of the earth,\" said South African law professor Max du Plessis. \"Rafah is the final stand.\"\n\nIsrael will provide a response in court Friday. Israeli officials have previously denied in court claims the country's military campaign violates the 1949 Genocide Convention, arguing that it stepped up efforts to provide humanitarian aid for Gaza in accordance with previous court orders.\n\nThe court's rulings and orders are binding, but it has no way to enforce them. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly claimed Israel is defending itself after the Hamas-led attack Oct. 7 that resulted in almost 1,200 deaths and the seizing of more than 250 hostages.\n\nEgypt rips Israel:Says nation is deflecting blame for Gaza crisis\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Arab League called for a U.N. peacekeeping force in Gaza. The “Manama Declaration” issued by the 22-member bloc meeting in Bahrain said the force is needed until a two-state solution is implemented.\n\n∎ On back-to-back nights, including Thursday, Israeli settlers physically assaulted and injured truck drivers in the occupied West Bank under the belief they were delivering humanitarian assistance to Gaza, the Times of Israel reported, citing Hebrew media reports. Also Thursday, Canada sanctioned what it called four \"extremist Israeli settlers'' for acts of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\n∎ The World Food Program said it is providing hot meals to thousands of families in central Gaza, but that remaining stocks of food parcels will run out within days. And distributions in Rafah have \"come to a halt,\" the agency said.\n\n∎ Israeli forces killed three men in raids across the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, during a search of money-changing shops, the Palestinian Health Ministry and Palestinian officials said.\n\nUS-built Gaza pier:Aid delivery to population isolated by war starting\n\nMore aid goes into Gaza, but misery lingers\n\nThe number of aid trucks entering Gaza, which had dwindled substantially since Israel began its so-called limited military operation in Rafah last week, has increased recently at President Joe Biden's urging, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday.\n\nStill, State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said moments before that the humanitarian situation in the territory continues to deteriorate, and travel and the flow of desperately needed fuel have \"come to a complete halt.\" Israel said on the X platform that 20,000 gallons of fuel were brought in Thursday.\n\nMore than 7,000 trucks carrying humanitarian assistance have gone into Gaza since April 5, Jean-Pierre said. That's an average of 180 a day, considerably below the 500 that were common before the war. Jean-Pierre said trucks are entering through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south and a new one, Erez West in the north, but that operations through the critical Rafah access point remain limited.\n\n\"We need to get more aid into Gaza because we know how dire the humanitarian situation is,\" she said. \"We have seen some progress; we need to get more in.\"\n\nIn its daily update Wednesday, the United Nations said the \"number of drivers and trucks cleared by Israel to use (the road to Kerem Shalom) is insufficient to meet demand, causing delays and fewer aid deliveries than planned.''\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers\n\nNetanyahu to confront Defense Minister Gallant about his Gaza comments\n\nNetanyahu said Thursday he'll have a talk with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who warned the previous day that he would stand in the way of Israel establishing a military or civil government in Gaza after the war, comments that defied the prime minister's expressed plans.\n\nIf Netanyahu intends to fire Gallant for the apparent insubordination, he'll get popular opposition. A survey by Israel's Channel 12 revealed 60% of respondents are against Gallant getting fired, compared to 23% in favor.\n\nSpeaking on television Wednesday, Gallant said Netanyahu should make a public commitment for Israel not to play a role in ruling Gaza after Hamas has been driven away, suggesting it would be better for Palestinians and \"international actors'' to take over the territory's government, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nDuring a meeting with reporters near the Gaza border Thursday, Netanyahu was asked whether he and Gallant − two of three voting members of Israel's War Cabinet, along with Benny Gantz − could still work together. According to the Times, he responded: “If you’re talking about what the defense minister said yesterday, then what I have to say to him I’ll first say one-on-one, and not here.”\n\nNetanyahu, who said that meeting would take place soon, already fired Gallant once in March 2023 when the defense minister raised concerns about the impact of a judicial overhaul Netanyahu pushed for. After an outcry, Gallant was brought back.\n\n5 Israeli soldiers killed in friendly fire tank attack\n\nFive Israeli soldiers were killed and seven wounded in a northern Gaza incident when Israeli tanks fired shells \"for unclear reasons\" at a building being used by Israeli troops, the military announced Thursday. An initial investigation revealed the tanks, a few dozens yards from the building, identified a weapon and fired at least two shells, the military said in a statement. Officials were investigating \"why the shells were fired and if the soldiers were mistaken for armed militants.\" The soldiers who died were all ages 20 to 22.\n\nThe incident took place in an area of northern Gaza initially cleared of Hamas militants early in the war. In recent days, however, Israeli forces have returned to face fierce fighting around Gaza City and the Jabalia refugee camp, raising doubts about Israel's progress in eliminating Hamas from the enclave.\n\nEarly Thursday, the Israeli military announced another issue, an \"operational accident as a result of a munitions explosion in military territory\" where forces were stationed in Israel less than a mile from Gaza. There was no immediate report on casualties, and the military said that incident was under investigation.\n\nEgyptian leader says Israel has no interest in cease-fire deal\n\nIsrael is stalling to avoid all efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement in Gaza, and Arab leaders and the international community must unite to protect the future of all Palestinians, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said Thursday. El-Sisi, speaking at the Arab League Summit in Bahrain, said the region is facing a defining moment and must choose between peace and stability or \"chaos and destruction.\" Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. have led mediation efforts that so far have failed to reach a cease-fire agreement since a weeklong truce in November.\n\n“We are facing the absence of a genuine international political will to end the occupation and address the root-causes of the conflict through the two-state solution,” El-Sisi said. “All the future generations of Palestine and Israel deserve to live in a region where justice thrives, peace prevails and security reigns.\"\n\nNetanyahu, who has opposed a two-state solution, says Israel has the right to defend itself and has pledged to continue the military effort until Hamas is crushed.\n\nAid to begin flowing through US-built pier\n\nThe Pentagon has built a pier in Gaza after a two-month effort and aid is expected to begin flowing within days, Solani Korde, a senior official with the U.S. Agency for Development, said Thursday. Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, acknowledged land routes are the most efficient means of getting aid to civilians in Gaza who face dire food shortages. Border closures and tight security demanded by Israel have severely limited the flow of aid along land routes.\n\nThe new pier was fixed to the shore early Thursday, and about 500 tons of aid are staged for delivery in the next few days, Cooper said.\n\n\"Trucks carrying humanitarian assistance are expected to begin moving ashore in the coming days,\" Central Command said in a statement. \"The United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.\"\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nPentagon begins building floating pier:Will ferry humanitarian aid to Gaza\n\nIsrael to send more troops into Rafah\n\nIsrael forces are \"wearing down\" Hamas resistance in Rafah and more Israel troops will join the ground operation, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday.\n\n\"This operation will continue with additional forces,\" Gallant said in a statement. \"Several tunnels in the area have been destroyed by our forces and more tunnels will be destroyed soon.\" He said Hamas is unable to \"regenerate itself\" because it has no reserves, no ability to manufacture weapons, no supplies or ammunition.\n\nHamas \"has no ability to properly treat terrorists who are injured, and this means that we are wearing it down,\" Gallant said.\n\nIsrael, Egypt clash over fate of Rafah border crossing\n\nEgypt has rejected an Israeli proposal for reopening the Rafah border crossing between Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip and to manage its future operation, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters. Among concerns: Egypt demands that Palestinians manage the border after Israel's withdrawal. Israel is unwilling to relinquish control amid concerns that Hamas could regain influence in the enclave.\n\nThe Rafah crossing had been a main conduit for humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Egypt blames the current border shutdown on the Israeli military operation amid concerns the Sinai will be overwhelmed with refugees fleeing Gaza. Israel says it is willing to open the border for civilians who want to flee the fighting.\n\nThe U.N. and international aid agencies say the closures of the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings have essentially severed the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/17/joe-biden-executive-privilege-shield-hur-interview-the-excerpt/73730913007/", "title": "Biden uses executive privilege to shield Hur interview | The Excerpt", "text": "On Friday’s episode of The Excerpt podcast: USA TODAY Justice Department Correspondent Bart Jansen discusses how Presiden Joe Biden invoked executive privilege to keep the recording of his deposition about storing classified documents at his home confidential.

And today marks 70 years since the decision that led to the desegregation of schools.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden invoked executive privilege yesterday to keep the recording of his deposition about storing classified documents at his home, confidential. I caught up with USA Today, Justice Department correspondent, Bart Jansen, to learn more. Bart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bart, what exactly is that issue here and what did this move functionally do?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWhat it really did is block the House where House Republicans have sought to obtain the recording from getting it, at least for the time being. The Justice Department has already released a transcript of the recording.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Hur spoke to President Biden for hours in early November about him keeping classified documents from his time as vice president at his Delaware home during the four-year interim between serving the Obama administration and then becoming president himself.\n\nHur decided not to press charges against Biden and Republicans want to know more about how that decision was made. They think that Biden had the documents, that he shared them with others, such as his ghost writer.\n\nAnd so perhaps criminal charges should have been filed. Hur, as you'll recall, put in his report that Biden was viewed as a sympathetic well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. Well, that poor memory is part of why they want to listen to the recording. They say that hearing how he answered questions might give them better insight, both about the replies and perhaps about his mental fitness for office.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, help us better understand executive privilege. Is invoking executive privilege in this way rare for presidents?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nIt's both common and rare. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan group that answers technical questions for Congress says that nearly every president has invoked this, starting with George Washington. It's the idea that the executive can keep things confidential so that it can obtain basically candid advice and communications from advisors.\n\nAnd so the idea is that if Congress can get access to everything that the president hears, that that might inhibit the kind of candid advice that he would get from aides through the years.\n\nIt came to a real test during the Nixon administration when, of course, during the Watergate scandal he was trying to keep information hidden from congressional investigators. But overall, the policy, the privilege of keeping communications confidential has been upheld by the courts all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nDepending on how far House Republicans want to push this, this could become a new test case if they want to push this through the courts to again try to this recording.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou mentioned House Republicans, the House Judiciary Committee, and the House Oversight and Accountability Committee each held votes on contempt resolutions yesterday. Bart, what exactly was the aim of these votes?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, they're upset that Attorney General Merrick Garland has refused to provide the recording to lawmakers despite a subpoena for the recording. So the votes essentially send the resolutions to the full House.\n\nThe House must now consider whether to hold Garland in contempt. It's not the most unusual thing. Previous attorney generals, such as Eric Holder and Bill Barr were each held in contempt for refusing to provide information during congressional investigations.\n\nBut in both cases, the Justice Department declined to prosecute them. And so it becomes more sort of a publicity stunt than actual criminal charges against an attorney general.\n\nNevertheless, the House Democrats were trying to block the votes. They say it will smear Garland with this, basically finding him in contempt. Garland himself answered questions to reporters Thursday morning saying that he had gone to extraordinary lengths to give the committees responses to their legitimate request.\n\nBut he says this was not a legitimate request and he said it would harm the department's ability to conduct future criminal sensitive investigations. So it's quite a departure for Garland who usually speaks quite softly as a long-time federal judge.\n\nThe White House Counsel Edward Siskel was a little more blunt about it in sending the rejection to the House committees. He said the absence of a legitimate need for the audio recordings laid bare their goal is to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes. So the White House was pulling no punches on these requests.\n\nThey consider this partisan theater, but House Republicans say that this is important for them to be independent, to be able to judge Biden and his fitness for Office. Comer said the response from the White House is like a five alarm fire because of the crisis. And so they're going to try to keep holding Biden and the White House's feet to the fire in this dispute.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, great breakdown as always. Bart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA Today. Thanks, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Judiciary Committee voted 18 to 15 along party lines to approve the contempt resolution after a four-hour hearing. And the Oversight Committee also voted along party lines 24 to 20 to approve its own contempt resolution after a testy hearing.\n\n♦\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has pardoned Daniel Perry, the man who killed Black Lives Matter protester, Garrett Foster, in 2020. That summer, Perry shot and killed Foster after driving into a racial justice protest in Austin. Perry claimed that he shot Foster who was carrying an AK-47 rifle in self-defense. During Perry's trial last year, prosecutors argued that he had sought out the confrontation. Less than 24 hours after a jury last year found Perry guilty of murder, Abbott said on social media that he would approve a pardon if one were recommended by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. The announcement came after prominent conservative figures called on him to undo Perry's conviction.\n\n♦\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday upheld the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding mechanism in a challenge brought by the payday loan industry. The move keeps the Obama-era agency in place and sustains a regulation from 2017 had cracked down on payday lenders.\n\nInstead of putting the Bureau through annual budget fights on Capitol Hill like most of the government, the CFPB is funded through the Federal Reserve, an effort to shield it from political pressure. Critics said the arrangement violated the constitution and the principle that Congress alone holds the power of the purse.\n\nThe seven-to-two decision was a victory for the Biden administration, which had asked the court to overturn a conservative appeals court decision in validating the funding mechanism.\n\n♦\n\nThe high court this week also cleared the way for Louisiana to use a congressional map with a second-majority Black district. The court's decision made in response to an emergency request from state officials and voting rights advocates is the latest twist in a years-long battle over the boundaries of the state's six congressional districts involving the intersection of race, politics and redistricting.\n\nThe Supreme Court put on hold a lower court's ruling in validating a map that increased the number of mostly Black districts from one to two. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nThe US military said earlier today that it has started moving aid to Gaza using a floating pier it built off the coast of the Palestinian territory as part of efforts to boost humanitarian deliveries to the enclave. US Central Command said in a statement that no US troops want to ashore as trucks began using the makeshift dock.\n\nThe project has been delayed by bad weather and cost an estimated $320 million and some 1000 US troops to build. The UN and international officials have stressed that maritime access for aid deliveries should not be viewed as a substitute for land routes to Gaza via Israel and Egypt, which can handle a higher volume of trucks.\n\n♦\n\nMeanwhile, South Africa asked the top international court yesterday to order a halt to the Rafah offensive, accusing Israel of Genocide. And saying that the country's war effort must be stopped to protect the Palestinian people.\n\nSouth Africa's legal representatives at the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court said, Israel's shutdown of the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings have plunged Gaza into unprecedented levels of humanitarian need.\n\n♦\n\nToday marks the 70th anniversary of the 1954 decision in Brown versus Board of Education, leading to the desegregation of schools. And President Joe Biden is meeting with families involved in the Civil rights case this week. USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers joined me from the White House to discuss. Francesca, thanks for hopping on.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nHi. It's always great to be on with you, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt's always great to have you on. So just walk us through yesterday's meeting, if you would. What took place here?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, the meeting, Taylor, with the families and plaintiffs, as well as members of the NAACP took place behind closed doors in the Oval Office. So we didn't get to see it, but they did come outside and hold a news conference with White House reporters afterwards.\n\nAnd it was really interesting. Cheryl Brown Henderson, whose family is the namesake of the Brown case, said that one of the plaintiffs in the meeting asked the president to make Brown v Board of Education decision date a national holiday.\n\nNow, asked about this later, the president's public engagement adviser, Steve Benjamin, noted that he had made Juneteenth a federal holiday. And he also pointed out that the president had taken other steps, including passing anti-lynching legislation, as well as pursuing policing reforms.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCan you help us understand how this meeting was really emblematic of Biden's evolution on civil rights issues?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nSo if you recall, Taylor, there was this flashpoint moment in a 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, in which now Vice President Kamala Harris noted to him that she had been bused to school as a child in California.\n\nNow, Biden had been against busing, which was a forced integration program that took Black students and brought them to White communities to go to school and vice versa. Now, a few months later, he went on to win the South Carolina Democratic primary, which was largely because of the Black community. And it came after a major endorsement from a congressman and a civil rights leader.\n\nHe picked Vice President Harris to be his running mate on the ticket. And the White House stressed repeatedly yesterday what he's done for the Black community, including larger investment in HBCUs. And recall that he was vice president to the first Black president, Barack Obama.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFrancesca, we're in this moment where debates and political battles have popped up over diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. How is Brown versus Board of Education still relevant today?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThat families talked about that a little bit. And Taylor, in an interview prior to the meeting with President Biden, Henderson told me democracy is on the line. And this part was really interesting.\n\nShe said that democracy gave birth to the rule of law and the rule of law gave birth to Brown, the Board of Education. And so for Henderson who founded the Brown Foundation, which seeks to educate people across America today about the impacts of the case, this is still very relevant.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo more events are set for today, Francesca. What can we expect?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, President Joe Biden will be speaking at the African-American Museum in Washington, D.C., at an NAACP event. And also over the weekend, he'll be giving the commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. He'll speak on Sunday evening at an NAACP event in Detroit too.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Francesca Chambers USA today, White House Correspondent. Thanks as always.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThanks so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for listening to The Excerpt.

Previously, Biden had stopped short of labeling atrocities being documented on the ground in Ukraine as “war crimes,” citing ongoing international and US investigations.\n\nBut on Wednesday, speaking with reporters at an unrelated event, Biden affixed the designation on the Russian leader.\n\n“I think he is a war criminal,” the President said after remarks at the White House.\n\nThe shift from the administration’s previous stance came after an emotional address to Congress from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who aired a video showing Ukrainians suffering amid Russia’s onslaught. Zelensky asked American lawmakers and Biden for more help defending itself, including a no-fly zone and fighter jets.\n\nCNN Illustration/Getty Images\n\nBiden responded in his own address a few hours later, laying out new American military assistance to Ukraine – including anti-aircraft and anti-armor systems, weapons and drones – but stopping short of acceding to Zelensky’s requests.\n\nStill, Biden acknowledged the horrors transpiring on the ground.\n\n“We saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol,” Biden said. “These are atrocities. They’re an outrage to the world. And the world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.”\n\nIt wasn’t until a few hours after that that Biden responded to a question about Putin being a war criminal. Biden initially said “no,” but immediately returned to a group of reporters to clarify what had been asked. When asked again whether Putin was a war criminal, he answered in the affirmative.\n\nOn Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Biden’s remarks were “absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.”\n\nOfficials, including Biden, had previously avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. Other world leaders have not been as circumspect, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said last week war crimes were being committed. The International Criminal Court at the Hague has also opened an investigation into war crimes. And the US Senate unanimously asked for an international investigation into war crimes on Tuesday. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people “constitute war crimes,” marking the first time a senior US official directly accused Moscow of war crimes since last month’s attack on Ukraine began.\n\nIn Poland last week, Vice President Kamala Harris called for international investigations into war crimes, and made clear she believed atrocities were underway. She said the intentional targeting of civilians would constitute war crimes.\n\nAfter Biden delivered his assessment, the White House said the administration’s investigation into war crimes would continue.\n\n“The President’s remarks speak for themselves,” press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said Biden was “speaking from the heart.”\n\nState Department spokesman Ned Price echoed Psaki later Wednesday, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that “when you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you’re seeing what we’ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it’s hard not to walk away with that conclusion.”\n\n“What we are doing here at the State Department, we are collecting every single piece of information, we’re evaluating it, we’re documenting it and sharing it with our partners. There is a process that is involved in this and there are people working almost around the clock to document, evaluate, share as we all watch what is happening with some horror.”\n\nPressed as to how Putin’s actions don’t currently amount to war crimes, Price reiterated that “there is a formal process here at the department under international humanitarian law to document war crimes. We’re involved in that.”\n\nWhile the term “war crimes” is often used colloquially – as Biden appeared to be doing Wednesday – they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Convention, which specifies intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime.\n\nYet in order to prosecute a war crime, solid evidence is required. And for Russian officials to be held accountable, they would need to travel outside of the country.\n\nStill, an official designation of war crimes – backed up with evidence – would still present the West with a symbolic tool in framing Putin’s actions in Ukraine.\n\nBiden has come under increasing pressure to do more to help besieged Ukrainians as Russia’s campaign intensifies. On Wednesday, a theater in Mariupol where civilians were sheltering was bombed, the latest example of Russia’s indiscriminate shelling.\n\nThe pressure was only likely to increase after Zelensky’s dramatic appeal to lawmakers for more help. He compared what is happening in Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and September 11, and said “we need you right now” to offer more support.\n\nBiden watched the address from the library of his private residence, and later called it a “convincing” and “significant” speech.\n\n“Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals,” he said afterward. “I mean, it’s godawful.”\n\nNext week, Biden plans to travel to Brussels for an extraordinary session of NATO leaders, where he hopes to demonstrate western unity amid Russia’s aggression.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Sam Fossum Kevin Liptak", "Sam Fossum", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}]}

Starter Kenny Pickett is recovering from ankle surgery.\n\nBut Pittsburgh’s problems are deeper than just its quarterback issue: Players have been exposed on social media for lack of effort, former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger criticized longtime coach Mike Tomlin saying, \"Maybe the tradition of the Pittsburgh Steelers is done.\" And even ESPN analyst Ryan Clark, a former Steelers safety, said current players no longer care for \"The Steeler Way.\"\n\nQuarterback Josh Allen and the Bills, who fell to 5-5 last month, still have a real chance to make the playoffs – and even win the AFC East for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nQuarterback Justin Herbert is done for the season with a broken finger, and the Chargers will play their first game without fired coach Brandon Staley after their 63-21 debacle against the Las Vegas Raiders during Week 15.\n\nIt’s unclear which Chargers team will show up. They have nothing to play for except pride, and they didn’t show much of it in their last outing. Allen and the Bills, on the other hand, have plenty to play for, and are coming off an impressive 31-10 win over the Dallas Cowboys last week.\n\nThe Bills finish the season at home against the New England Patriots on Dec. 31, and on the road against the Miami Dolphins during the first weekend of January, when the division could be on the line for both teams.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/21/raiders-at-chiefs-nfl-christmas-schedule-betting-odds/71993733007/", "title": "How to watch NFL Christmas: Raiders at Chiefs, plus odds", "text": "Apparently, we've all been very good boys and girls this year because Santa Claus is giving us three games of NFL football this Christmas. That's right! Week 16 of the NFL season concludes with three Monday games, the first of which is an AFC West matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nThe Chiefs have owned this matchup as of late, having won five straight, 10 of their last 11, and 15 of their last 17 against Vegas. 11 of those wins weren't even one-possession games. It's been obvious the stranglehold that the Chiefs have had over their division the last decade or so. However, that could be coming to an end sooner than we'd like to admit.\n\nThe Chiefs have not looked like the unstoppable force we've come to know and love throughout the years. They'd lost two straight coming into their Week 15 matchup against the New England Patriots and didn't dominate them as much as anyone expected. Travis Kelce has been underwhelming and for the first time in years, it seems as though the Chiefs are relying more on their defense to win games than their offense.\n\nThe Raiders may be huge underdogs, but they have an opportunity to dwindle Kansas City's hopes of obtaining the No. 1 seed in the AFC tremendously.

That's because the final game of the slate, the final game of the entire Week 16 schedule, is one that may very well be a preview of Super Bowl 58.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens will be traveling west to face the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup where both teams enter with winning streaks that span at least a month long. It also features some of the fastest players at their respective positions,: 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey and Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nBut, while NFL fans will have to wait until primetime to see that one, they will get the chance to enjoy an early slate of Raiders-Chiefs and Giants-Eagles.\n\nHere's what to know about the NFL Christmas Day tripleheader.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nHow to watch Monday's NFL games on TV\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs kickoff at 1 p.m. ET on CBS.

And the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers kick off at 8:15 p.m. on ABC and ESPN+.\n\nHow to live stream Monday's NFL games\n\nThe Raiders-Chiefs game can be streamed on Paramount+. The Giants-Eagles game can be streamed on NFL+. The Ravens-49ers game can also be streamed on NFL+.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders (6-8) at Kansas City Chiefs (9-5)\n\nThe Chiefs snapped a two-game skid in a 10-point victory over the New England Patriots and now will host their AFC West rival, the Raiders. In a crowded AFC wild card picture, Las Vegas is running out of time and needs to jump five slots in the conference, heading into Week 16.\n\nKansas City is still navigating an offense that hasn't been quite as crisp as we've seen in the tenure of coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, though its defense has been mostly up to the task this season. That said, Kansas City still ranks third in the NFL in passing offense, with 255.6 yards per game. The problem for Mahomes has been turnovers; he has already tied his career high with 13 this season, and has thrown at least one in each of the last three games.\n\nNew York Giants (5-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (10-4)\n\nAfter a nice three-game winning streak got the Giants back on track in the NFC wild card hunt, they dropped a pivotal game against the New Orleans Saints in Week 15 and now have no margin for error. Quarterback Tommy DeVito was banged around against New Orleans and was checked for a concussion but then cleared protocol to return. He's on track to play.\n\nThe problem is that New York is facing an Eagles team that is in a tailspin and will be looking to self-correct. Philadelphia has dropped three games in a row and its problems are coming on both sides of the ball. Quarterback Jalen Hurts has seen his production slow and the secondary is getting beat for big plays. The Eagles are currently tied at 10-4 with the Cowboys, but are behind Dallas in seeding, so every game will have massive implications for Philadelphia moving forward.\n\nBaltimore Ravens (11-3) at San Francisco 49ers (11-3)\n\nThe gem of the Christmas showcase, this matchups pits the two current No. 1 seeds in their respective conferences against each other. This may very well end up as a possible preview to Super Bowl 58.\n\nIn San Francisco, there are a pair of MVP candidates leading the offense in quarterback Brock Purdy and running back Christian McCaffrey. But this team is far more than simply two players, as receiver Deebo Samuel, tight end George Kittle and a fierce defense round out the squad. The 49ers are on a six-game winning streak, and their average margin of victory over that span is 18.8 points.\n\nBaltimore, however, has its own dynamic playmaker in quarterback Lamar Jackson. The Ravens have their own winning streak – four games – and have battled through a number of injuries to emerge as a force in the AFC. But with a game looming in Week 17 against the conference's No. 2 seed, the Miami Dolphins, Baltimore cannot afford to come out flat against San Francisco.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/18/baltimore-ravens-san-francisco-49ers-picks-predictions-nfl-week-16/71911882007/", "title": "Baltimore Ravens at San Francisco 49ers picks, odds for NFL Week 16", "text": "The Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers play on Monday, Dec. 25 at Levi's Stadium in a game on the NFL Week 16 schedule.\n\nWhich team will win the Christmas Day Monday Night Football game?\n\nCheck out these NFL Week 16 picks and NFL Week 16 predictions for the game, which can be seen at 6:15 p.m. MST on ABC, ESPN Plus and ESPN Deportes (stream with free trial from FUBO).\n\nThe 49ers are a 5-point favorite over the Ravens in NFL Week 16 odds for the game, courtesy of BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nSan Francisco is -225 on the moneyline, while Baltimore is +180.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe over/under (point total) is set at 45.5 points.\n\nThe Ravens are coming off a 23-7 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars in their NFL Week 15 game.\n\nThe 49ers are coming off a 45-29 win against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nNFL Week 16 picks: Saints at Rams | Bengals at Steelers | Bills at Chargers | Colts at Falcons | Packers at Panthers | Browns at Texans | Lions at Vikings | Commanders at Jets | Seahawks at Titans | Jaguars at Buccaneers | Cardinals at Bears | Cowboys at Dolphins | Patriots at Broncos | Raiders at Chiefs | Giants at Eagles | Ravens at 49ers | Power rankings | Odds | Schedule\n\nThe Arizona Republic: 49ers 24, Ravens 21\n\nJeremy Cluff writes: \"Could this be a possible Super Bowl preview?

After an extremely successful market debut in 2019, Beyond Meat (BYND) has lost favor with investors. The stock dropped about 77% so far this year.\n\nSome of the problems can be attributed to broader industry challenges. In the grocery store, interest in plant-based meats has waned as consumers, faced with inflation, focus on shopping for affordable basics.\n\nAt the same time, restaurant traffic is dipping. Cash-strapped customers are pulling back on dining out, making Beyond’s foodservice business more vulnerable. And Beyond is far from the only company to lay off staff as a possible recession looms.\n\nBeyond Meat's sales fell in the third quarter. Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images\n\nBut Beyond is facing some unique challenges.\n\nThe company recently parted ways with three members of its C-suite, one of whom allegedly bit someone’s nose. A recent LA Times report called into question the hygiene of a Beyond Meat facility in Pennsylvania, though the company stands by the cleanliness of the plant, saying that its “food safety protocols go above industry and regulatory standards.”\n\nAlso, a promising partnership with McDonald’s (MCD) has stalled in the United States. And fierce competition is squeezing sales, including in frozen, plant-based chicken, a category that is growing while refrigerated plant-based meat sales falter.\n\nThe company’s plan is to focus on cash flow and profitability rather than growth, and become more strategic in its restaurant and marketing initiatives, among other things.\n\n“Despite the current headwinds facing our business and category, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the long-term growth and impact expected from our global brand,” a Beyond Meat spokesperson told CNN Business in response to a request for comment.\n\n“They’ve got a big task ahead of them,” said Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at financial services firm BTIG. Next year will be about “trying to get their financials in order to a place where they can sustain themselves,” he added. “It’s a tall order.”\n\nWhere’s the McPlant?\n\nLast year, Beyond Meat announced a strategic partnership with McDonald’s, including working with the burger chain on the McPlant, a plant-based burger.\n\nSince then, the McPlant has been added to the McDonald’s menu permanently in some European markets.\n\nIn the US, McDonald’s (MCD) tested out the burger in some locations. But it hasn’t added the item to the menu, and it’s not clear if or when that will happen.\n\n“I don’t think it’s totally off the table, but I’m not sure that it’s going to be [Beyond’s] saving grace at this point,” said Saleh.\n\nBeyond has also lost its spot on the Dunkin’ menu. The coffee chain enthusiastically rolled out a breakfast sandwich with Beyond sausage nationally in 2019, but stopped working with Beyond last year.\n\nMcDonald's tested the McPlant, but has not added it permanently to US menus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBeyond still has plenty of partnerships with restaurants, but many of them are limited-time tests.\n\n“In the last 12 months, we have had 25 trials for permanent menu launches with nine distinct products,” said Beyond CEO Ethan Brown during a November analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results.\n\nBrown positioned the launches as long-term investments, saying they won’t generate big sales in the short term but should pay off eventually. But getting a permanent menu spot might be challenging, noted Kathryn Fenner, principal at foodservice consulting firm Technomic.\n\n“Even if they sell, say 30 to 40 of these plant-based burgers a day … that still pales in comparison to their traditional proteins,” she said, speaking about plant-based burgers in general. And these days, making a limited-time offer permanent is a tough sell because operators have been slimming down their menus, she noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Burger King continues to sell the Impossible Whopper nationally. “We haven’t been experiencing what Beyond Meat and some of the other brands in the space have reported,” said Impossible foods spokesperson Keely Sulprizio. Impossible is private and is not required to share its sales data publicly.\n\nIn the grocery store, Beyond is facing a swell of competition.\n\nCompetition heats up\n\nBeyond has embraced competition in the past. But now, rivals are interfering with its bottom line.\n\n“We believe that healthy competition within plant-based meat is a good thing as it brings investment in marketing to the category,” said Brown during the November analyst call.\n\n“However, in the current environment, we are not seeing this benefit,” he said. “Instead, more companies are pursuing the same or fewer consumers.” Brown said Beyond is the leader in refrigerated plant-based meat, and that he expects some brands to pull back or consolidate in the future.\n\nIt’s true that the plant-based meat pie is smaller these days. Retail sales of meat alternatives fell about 12% in the year through November 6, according to data from IRI. Ground plant-based meat fell about 19%, and patties were down 30% in that period.\n\nBut frozen chicken alternatives are growing. Strips and cutlets sales increased about 16% and nuggets jumped nearly 28%.\n\n“Frozen plant-based chicken is the largest single subcategory in all of plant-based meats and continues to grow at a double-digit pace,” said Brown during the analyst call. “So we are pleased to be expanding our presence of additional chicken items.”\n\nBeyond Meat introduced plant-based chicken strips in retail in 2014, but pulled the product in 2019. It launched a retooled version, Beyond Chicken Tenders, in stores in 2021, and has built its plant-based chicken portfolio since then.\n\nBut in the few years Beyond’s product was off the market, new entrants rushed into the space.\n\nNuggs, a plant-based chicken nugget made by startup Simulate, has made a splash online thanks to its bold packaging over the last few years and has been expanding in retail.\n\nDaring, another plant-based chicken company, launched its product in the US in 2020. Daring’s chicken alternative became available at Whole Foods last year. Impossible and other legacy brands have offerings, as well.\n\n“Plant-based chicken is a good growth category,” said Saleh. “I would have liked to have seen [Beyond] double down.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/21/mow-may-haunted-house-shooting-monk-seal-birth-news-around-states/50119967/", "title": "No Mow May, haunted house shooting: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Civil rights pioneer Jo Ann Robinson, who played an instrumental role in the historic 13-month Montgomery Bus Boycott in the mid-1950s, had a residence hall named after her on Alabama State University’s campus Tuesday. The hall was previously named for Bibb Graves, former Alabama governor and member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Board of Trustees voted to change the name in September. Dr. Sheree Finley, a relative of Robinson, called the renaming exciting. “She’s finally being brought to the forefront,” Finley said. Local artist Kevin King painted a portrait of Robinson during the event. The featured speaker of the event was Fred Gray, famed civil rights attorney, who recalled planning the bus boycott in Robinson’s living room. “Little did many know that (many of the) activities that (had an) impact on the civil rights movement in Alabama occurred at Jo Ann Robinson’s house,” Gray said. “She was the person who was interested in having mass participation. We could have desegregated the buses without a protest, but she was interested in getting something done with the community.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A legal challenge has been filed claiming proposed state Senate districts for the capital city area unconstitutionally favor the Eagle River suburb. The motion to reject the amended redistricting plan and to modify it was filed Monday as Anchorage Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews considers the legality of the map approved last week by the state’s redistricting board, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The new map was drawn after portions of the board’s first proposal were ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court. Each state Senate district is composed of two House districts. The board’s first proposal sought to link Eagle River to the south Muldoon area of Anchorage, which the Alaska Supreme Court called an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The court ruled in a lawsuit brought by east Anchorage residents Felisa Wilson, George Martinez and Yarrow Silvers, who also filed Monday’s challenge. The new proposal seeks to link south Eagle River to south Anchorage and north Eagle River to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The new challenge claims the redistricting board incorrectly interpreted the court’s instructions by keeping Muldoon districts together but again splitting the Eagle River districts. The filing seeks an order requiring the board to keep both House districts in Eagle River together.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A wildfire nearly tripled in size as relentless winds pushed the flames through neighborhoods on the outskirts of a college and tourist town, keeping hundreds of residents away from their homes and destroying more than two dozen structures. The blaze continued its run Wednesday through dry grass and scattered Ponderosa pines around homes into volcanic cinder fields, where roots underground can combust and send small rocks flying into the air, fire officials said. Persistent spring winds and 50 mph gusts hindered firefighters. “This is a heads-up for everywhere else in the state,” said fire information officer Dick Fleishman. “If you have dry grass up next to your house, it’s time to get that cleaned up.” Fire managers are contending with tight resources as wildfires burn around the Southwest. The U.S. has 16 top-level national fire management teams, and four of those are dedicated to blazes in Arizona and New Mexico – something Fleishman said is rare this early in the wildfire season. Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of the wildfires north of Flagstaff and south of Prescott in Arizona. On the outskirts of Flagstaff – where tourists and locals revel in hiking and horseback riding trails, camping spots, and the vast expanse of cinder fields for off-road vehicle use – flames soared as high as 100 feet. Popular national monuments including Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki were closed because of the wildfire.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: The Cherokee Nation has signed an agreement with the National Park Service to allow citizens to gather plants within the Buffalo National River to use for purposes including food, crafts and medicine. The river, located in the Ozark Mountains, was established as the country’s first national river in 1972. “This area has a vibrant history of helping sustain our Cherokee people with food, the cane and bushes for our Cherokee crafts, and leaves and roots for traditional medicine,” Deputy Chief Bryan Warner said. The agreement, announced Wednesday, will establish a process for Cherokee citizens to gather plants in parts of the national park including the Lost Valley, Tyler Bend, Buffalo Point and Rush areas. “This i7/ 8 s an important step in the continuing efforts to embrace our tribal partners in the management of public lands at Buffalo National River,” said Mark Foust, National Park Service superintendent at Buffalo National River. “The Cherokee Nation offers invaluable information, ecological knowledge, and a unique perspective that will lead to a better understanding of the benefits of public land.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: City supervisors have approved legislation prohibiting police from storing DNA obtained from rape kits and other crime scene evidence in city-run databases for more than 60 days. Tuesday’s unanimous vote came two months after San Francisco’s district attorney disclosed that police used a sexual assault victim’s DNA against her in 2016 in an unrelated 2021 property crime case. The revelation by DA Chesa Boudin prompted a national outcry among law enforcement, legal experts, lawmakers and advocates of sexual assault victims. Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who introduced the legislation, said there were no local laws regulating the storage or use of DNA profiles in local police databases, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Victim samples cannot be uploaded to state and federal DNA databases, which are more tightly regulated, and the legislation does not apply to those databases. “The fact that the police department’s crime lab has been storing and using victims’ physical evidence against victims came as a shock to most of us in the city,” Ronen said. The department stores DNA information in what it calls a quality control database in order to ensure samples are not contaminated. The department has said it stopped the practice. Police chief Bill Scott told police commissioners in March that he’d discovered 17 crime victim profiles, 11 of them from rape kits, that were matched using a crime victims database during unrelated investigations.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A “game changing” app will soon be in the hands of local first responders, and officials say it will improve their interactions with those in the community who have mental health issues or intellectual or developmental disabilities. Fort Collins Police Services announced Thursday that its officers will begin using the Vitals app in a first-of-its-kind partnership with UCHealth through the co-responder program and Mental Health Response Team. People and caregivers can download the Vitals app and create a profile that includes an individual’s name, photo, other identifying information and medical information along with their behavioral triggers and de-escalation techniques, which can help officers respond better in a crisis situation, UCHealth Co-Responder Supervisor Stephanie Booco said during a news conference. Fort Collins police officers and UCHealth co-responders who have the app will receive notifications when they are near someone with a profile and can use the information in the profile to better assist or resolve a situation. The technology is a “game changer” for the community, Fort Collins Police Services Chief Jeff Swoboda said. Fort Collins is the first community in Colorado to start using the Vitals app and the first community in the country to use it with a co-responder program, Booco said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers advanced legislation Tuesday evening that abortion rights advocates say is needed to protect in-state medical providers from legal action, as well as patients who travel to Connecticut to terminate a pregnancy and those who help them. It comes amid new abortion restrictions being enacted in a growing number of conservative states. The bill cleared the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 87-60. It now awaits action in the Senate. Although Connecticut codified the right to abortion in 1990, proponents said steps need to be taken now to prepare for the U.S. Supreme Court possibly overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. However, the socially conservative Family Institute of Connecticut has criticized the legislation, arguing it will create a “safe harbor” for “abortion providers who violate abortion laws in other states.” The bill is considered by some advocates to be one of the most consequential abortion-related proposals to come up for a vote in the Connecticut General Assembly since 1990. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he will sign the legislation in the law if clears the full Democratic-controlled General Assembly.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Sen. Darius Brown has regained his high-profile General Assembly committee assignments, following his acquittal of misdemeanor charges earlier this year. A jury in January found the Wilmington Democrat not guilty of misdemeanor offensive touching and disorderly conduct. A woman accused Brown at the time of hitting her in the head and throwing a drink glass that shattered near her while dining at a Talleyville restaurant in May 2021. Following his arrest, Brown was removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired. In November, months after his arrest, Brown reportedly got into a verbal altercation with Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle, during a bill-signing press event. That led to Senate leadership stripping Brown of his role on the Bond Committee, a high-profile position that helps write the annual infrastructure spending bill. Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola said in a statement Tuesday he has reinstated Brown to these positions due to his “acquittal in court and my belief that the terms of these sanctions have been appropriate.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden plans to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner – the first time a sitting president will be at the event since Barack Obama in 2016. The organization said in a tweet that it was pleased to host Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the dinner April 30 that will honor the First Amendment. Donald Trump opted to skip the event when he was president, and it was canceled in 2020 and last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” is serving as the event’s entertainer. In 2018, Michelle Wolf’s biting, after-dinner comedy routine grabbed headlines, even in Trump’s absence. After the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington earlier this month, some of those who attended, including Cabinet members, other administration officials and members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 amid a surge of cases around the nation’s capital. Capacity for the upcoming dinner is more than 2,600, and the event is fully booked. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, suggested last weekend that the correspondents’ dinner should move forward. He told “Fox News Sunday” that “we are at the point in this pandemic” where “I think we can gather safely.” The association is requiring full vaccination and negative same-day coronavirus tests.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: As critics decried a congressional redistricting map submitted by Republican Ron DeSantis as racially motivated and drawn to benefit the GOP, the staff member who crafted the maps told lawmakers Tuesday that he didn’t take race or party politics into consideration in preparing it. Lawmakers were called back to the Capitol for a special session to approve new congressional districts after DeSantis vetoed the maps they approved last month. The GOP House and Senate leadership opted not to try drawing maps again but rather to take up one submitted by DeSantis. His plan would likely add more Republican seats than the maps the Legislature approved and could mean the four districts where Black voters have the best chance of selecting a candidate would be reduced to two. Five of the current 27 U.S. House members from Florida are Black – one a Republican from an overwhelmingly white district. J. Alex Kelly, DeSantis’ deputy chief of staff, said the map is “race neutral.” Democrats reject that argument. Several Black lawmakers have called DeSantis racist for submitting the map. Rep. Angie Nixon said other lawmakers chastised her for previously using that language, but at a rally before session began, she repeated her opinion and said she won’t be silenced. “That’s what he is,” Nixon said in an interview afterward. “It’s all racially and politically driven. And this is the type of systemic racism that they don’t want us to talk about. It’s because it makes them uncomfortable because it shows people who they truly are.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is appealing a federal judge’s ruling allowing a challenge to her eligibility to run for reelection to proceed. A group of voters last month filed the challenge with the secretary of state’s office alleging that Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. They say that violates a part of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Greene said the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is unconstitutional, and she filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to prohibit state officials from enforcing it. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg on Monday ruled that the challenge can proceed. Greene filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The provision of the 14th Amendment cited in the challenge says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress. Greene has denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection. The challenge, filed on behalf of the voters by a group called Free Speech for People, is set for a hearing before an administrative law judge Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Images of a Hawaiian monk seal being born on an Oahu beach have been captured on camera. An employee of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources shot video and photos of the pup emerging from the mother onto white sands last week. “As soon as its (amniotic) sac burst, the little one starting wiggling around,” Lesley Macpherson, who works for the department’s Division of State Parks, said in a news release Tuesday. The mother monk seal checked on her pup by barking as the newborn flapped its flippers. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species. There are only about 1,400 seals in the world. About three-quarters of this total live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a remote string of small atolls northwest of Hawaii’s populated islands. The rest, about 300 seals, live in the Main Hawaiian Islands including Oahu and Maui. The pup, named PO5, was one of two baby seals born on Oahu last week. Officials and volunteers will actively monitor the moms and their pups until weaning in about five to six weeks. After weaning, officials will aim to tag the pups and may apply temporary satellite transmitters to the seals to help keep track of them. Three other pups born on Oahu this year died from complications related to birth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court has allowed lawmakers to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law they passed earlier this year that would ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The court on Monday approved a request by Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke, Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder and the Legislature to take part in the case. The law is modeled after a Texas law that is enforced through civil lawsuits to avoid constitutional court challenges. The Idaho law had been scheduled to take effect Friday but was temporarily blocked by the court following a lawsuit by a regional Planned Parenthood organization. Lawmakers said Planned Parenthood’s arguments challenging the constitutionality of the abortion law “directly implicate the Legislature’s authority.” The law allows the father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles of a “preborn child” to each sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortion. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but a rapist’s relatives could. The bill passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law but said he feared it would “in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed into law a state budget that aims to soften the blow of inflation with $1.8 billion in tax breaks and direct payments to Illinois consumers – an outline Republicans derided as an election-year ploy. The $46 billion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 also makes substantial investments in debt and savings backed by tax revenues virtually no one predicted a year ago amid a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker, who faces reelection this fall, said in a news release from Chicago that the fiscal outline “brings real improvements to the lives of working families and sets us up for a stronger fiscal future.” He said the funding for schools, updated highways and transportation systems, and paying down obligations in the state pension programs “are the kind of priorities we can invest in when our state is governed responsibly.” Pritzker rolled out his plan in February, when national inflation was at about 7% – the highest in 45 years. The package includes tactical strikes at rising prices: suspending the 1% grocery sales tax, freezing the motor fuel tax increase and offering a one-time $350 property tax refund, totaling $970 million in money consumers could keep or get back.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: There won’t be a balloon release at this year’s Indianapolis 500 in May. For the past two years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off on the pre-race balloon release largely due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the amount of staff on site. But this year, according to vice president of communications Alex Damron, the decision has taken into account the environmental and wildlife impacts – issues critics have raised for years. Speedway officials said they want the pre-race events to bring about unity as a way to honor military heroes, celebrate sporting excellence and build excitement. “We do recognize the release has become more divisive in recent years,” Damron said. “We’ve received significant feedback from groups and individuals opposed to it as well as an increasing number of our fans.” The balloon release has been a yearly staple at the event for more than 70 years. Environmentalists have been calling for the release – one of the few regular large balloon releases that have still been happening across the country – to end for years. Though the balloons are released in Indianapolis, they can travel quite far. In 2018, one woman even found what she believed to be an Indy 500 balloon in Ohio, 100 miles away. When the balloons land, they make their way into the ecosystem and the food chain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two years after fourth grade teachers at Andrew Jackson Elementary asked their students to consider whether the school should change its name, five members of the school’s student leadership team presented their arguments for renaming the school to the Des Moines School Board on Tuesday. The renaming project was waylaid when schools closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, teachers began discussing moving forward with the name change. Bettina Bradley, a reading and math interventionist, advocated letting students lead the project. At this week’s Des Moines School Board meeting, the students highlighted Jackson’s ownership of enslaved people and his signing of the Indian Removal Act, the 1830 law that authorized the president to negotiate the removal of Native Americans from their homelands to federal land – a move that led to thousands of deaths on the Trail of Tears. “The name Jackson is important to our school and community, as we are the stars,” student Keren Moran said, referring to the school’s mascot. “So we’re asking the board to rename Andrew Jackson to Mary Jackson Elementary.” Mary Jackson was NASA’s first Black female engineer. Her story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of two former Sedgwick County sheriff’s employees accused of stealing cash, drugs and weapons from the department’s evidence unit has been sentenced to a suspended jail term and one year of probation. Marc Gordon, 47, was sentenced after pleading guilty earlier this month to one count of official misconduct and three counts of theft, all misdemeanors, the Wichita Eagle reported. He was sentenced to a year in jail, which was immediately suspended, and placed on probation for a year. Gordon would be subject to having the jail term reinstated if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation. Prosecutors say Gordon was a property and evidence technician with the agency when he and a property and evidence supervisor, 55-year-old Robert White, stole more than $7,700 in cash, several pounds of cocaine, meth and other drugs and several samurai-style swords. The missing evidence led the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office to dismiss or review dozens of drug cases. White pleaded guilty in January to 12 counts, including felony official misconduct, drug distribution and thefts. He is set to be sentenced on April 29.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The last stockpiles of a deadly chemical agent in the U.S. have been safely eliminated, according to Kentucky officials in charge of destroying the Cold War-era weapons. The final M55 rocket containing VX nerve agent was destroyed Tuesday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent plant. Officials began disassembling about 18,000 of the rockets and draining the VX agent in July, according to a news release from plant officials. Candace Coyle, the plant’s project manager, said Wednesday that the nation’s entire stockpile of VX nerve agent “is now completely destroyed.” VX is considered the deadliest of the chemical agents that were produced by the U.S., much in the 1960s. It has a consistency similar to motor oil, and even a tiny amount causes victims’ bodies to flood with fluids, producing a feeling of drowning before death. Officials in 2017 declared that assassins used VX agent to kill the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. The central Kentucky Army depot still has 277 tons of other chemical agents left to be destroyed, after beginning with more than 520 tons of VX, GB and mustard agent that was in storage for decades. Officials said it all should be gone by next year after it began eliminating its mustard agent stockpiles in 2019.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Legislation to keep transgender athletes from competing on college and K-12 women’s and girls’ sports teams has been approved by the state Senate with little debate. The Advocate reports that the bill by Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, passed Tuesday evening on a 29-6 vote. It goes next to the state House. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed similar legislation last year, saying it was mean-spirited, unnecessary and could result in loss of NCAA events in the state. He has not said what he would do were the bill to pass this year. The measure would apply to K-12 schools, as well as colleges and universities, if they receive state funding. “Athletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall not be open to students who are not biologically female,” the bill says. Opponents say there are no known transgender athletes currently competing in the state, and the legislation adds to discrimination against an already marginalized group. Mizell said the NCAA hasn’t gone through with threats to pull events from states with similar laws.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday signed into law a bill to create a public-private partnership to help grow the state’s aerospace industry. Supporters envision the corporation as a central hub for innovation and economic development in the state’s air and space industry. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mattie Daughtry, D-Brunswick, said the effort has been years in the making. “The Maine Space Consortium will bring together business, research and state leaders, to help ensure Maine continues to be at the forefront of this industry,” Daughtry said in a statement. Members of the air and space industry have taken an interest in Maine in recent years, in part because it is home to the former Loring Air Force Base and Brunswick Landing, formerly a naval air station. The state’s geography and existing infrastructure make it a candidate to serve as a site for small launches, industry members have said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The addition of about 80 acres to the Pocomoke State Forest through legislation makes an elevated walkway connecting Snow Hill directly to the park possible. HB882, signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan this month, was co-sponsored by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester. According to a statement by Carozza, the project would create a trail network from Snow Hill to Pocomoke City “and has significant social, recreational and economic benefits.” This Maryland Department of Natural Resources project would add the acreage to Pocomoke State Forest as new type of wildlands and would exempt approximately 2 acres for the trail’s construction. She also confirmed in a statement that “the trail will be developed through a collaborative planning process between the Maryland Forest Service, Maryland Park Service and the Town of Snow Hill.” The public hearing on this project was held Oct. 28, 2020, and 98% of the 122 comments were in strong support of the project, including multiple organizations and local government agencies.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A gate separating affordable housing from the new playground at Coes Park was unlocked Friday. Community activists celebrated, having seen the locked gate as a symbol of environmental injustice and racism. “It felt like modern-day segregation,” said Nelly Medina, an organizer with the Tenant and Housing Alliance of Worcester and a Lakeside Apartments resident who spearheaded the fight to unlock the gate. “They got $1.2 million from saying it was in an environmental justice community, and they locked the gate. It put white people on one side and (Black, Indigenous and people of color) people on the other.” But Alex Corrales, director of the WHA, said unlocking the gate was simply a seasonal task. “It’s springtime – that’s all it is,” Corrales said in an interview. “We had been opening it for years, during the summer program for children, and they would do swimming classes, have canoes, but we would not leave it open permanently because we were concerned with safety.” Corrales bristled at the idea of any injustice and said the plan was to open the gate “indefinitely.” “We will obviously monitor the situation in terms of communicating with residents and the community,” he said. “If there are incidents that really put the safety risk of residents involved, we do want to review that very closely.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: A judge denied a motion Tuesday to reduce bonds for the jailed parents of a teenager who is charged in a shooting at his high school that left four students dead. Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews said that James and Jennifer Crumbley’s actions before their Dec. 4 arrests in a commercial building in Detroit were meant to conceal their whereabouts. “The defendants indicate they were devastated when they heard about the alleged actions of their son, felt unsafe in their home, felt hounded by the press and found it necessary to leave,” Matthews said. “The chronology of events that occurred subsequent to the defendants leaving their home is not consistent with cooperation with law enforcement.” The Crumbleys had disappeared the day before after they were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The parents are accused of failing to keep a gun secure at home and failing to reasonably care for their son when he showed signs of mental distress. They have pleaded not guilty. “Upon a warrant being issued, law enforcement is not required to make an appointment with a defendant,” Matthews said. “It is the job of the police to ensure a swift, safe and secure arrest. The defendants’ actions were premeditated to conceal their whereabouts.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear a challenge by environmentalists over portions of a lower court ruling involving a key permit for the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals in January reversed a 2018 decision by state regulators to issue PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It sent the case back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for further proceedings. That was a win for environmentalists, but they’re challenging other parts of the ruling. One prong involves the agency’s decision to issue the permit without setting specific effluent limits on mercury and other pollutants. They also faulted the appeals court for not imposing consequences for the agency’s alleged effort to dissuade the federal Environmental Protection Agency from submitting critical written comments during the water permit review process. “It is so important that Minnesota agencies be held accountable when they circumvent laws that were meant to protect the integrity of the regulatory process,” said Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, one of the three parties that asked the Supreme Court to step in. The other petitioners are the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy and the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A state prison violated inmates’ constitutional rights by failing to protect them from violence, failing to meet their mental health needs, failing to take adequate steps for suicide prevention and relying too much on prolonged solitary confinement, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The department released findings of its two-year investigation of the state’s oldest prison, Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. The probe started after an outburst of violence in late 2019 and early 2020. “The problems at Parchman are severe, systemic, and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision,” the department said in its report. It said the Mississippi Department of Corrections “has been on notice of these deficiencies for years and failed to take reasonable measures to address the violations, due in part to non-functional accountability or quality assurance measures.” “Years of MDOC’s deliberate indifference has resulted in serious harm and a substantial risk of serious harm to persons confined at Parchman,” the Justice Department said. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of Justice’s civil rights division, said 10 homicides and 12 suicides have occurred among inmates at Parchman since 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A bill passed by the state House on Tuesday would put restrictions on how race is talked about in public K-12 schools. The GOP-led House on Tuesday voted 85-59 in favor of the bill, with some Republicans opposing the measure. It now goes to the GOP-led Senate. The legislation would ban schools from teaching “that individuals, by virtue of their race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, bear collective guilt and are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, ethnicity, color, or national origin.” The measure also bans schools from compelling students and teachers to affirm that “individuals of any race, ethnicity, color, or national origin are inherently superior or inferior.” Students, parents or teachers could file complaints alleging violations of those bans with the state education department or Missouri attorney general. Supporters argued that the bill is needed to prevent classrooms from being used to indoctrinate children. But critics said the measure could have a chilling effect and might scare educators away from having difficult discussions about race and American history. “America’s history is not squeaky clean,” Democratic Rep. LaKeySha Bosley said. “We need to be open-minded about that and have the hard conversations and not be scared to talk it through.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city commission has voted 4-1 to deny an appeal from local marijuana dispensary owners over a Safety Inspection Certificate and to bring forward a proposed referendum package regarding adult-use marijuana sales on the ballot this November. City staff will work with city commissioners to get a referendum on the ballot. Janelle and Dale Yatsko, owners of Green Creek Dispensary in Cascade County, applied for a Safety Inspection Certificate, handled by Great Falls Fire Rescue as an annual inspection for businesses within city limits, for the operation of an adult-use marijuana dispensary within city limits in February. GFFR and the City Attorney’s Office advised that their application likely not be processed, according to the agenda background. Legal counsel for the Yatksos, Attorney Raph Graybill, reached out to the City Attorney Jeff Hindoien to argue that “state law entitles the Yatskos to operate their adult-use marijuana business within City limits; any contrary policy is preempted by state law.” The city responded denying the SIC on the basis of a local ordinance that has been in place for medical marijuana and federal law regarding marijuana but said the Yatskos could appeal the decision, which they did.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts touted the tax cuts lawmakers approved this year as they wrapped up their session Wednesday. Ricketts said the $900 million package of income and property tax cuts that the Legislature approved this year delivered “the most significant tax relief bill we have ever had in the state of Nebraska.” He signed the bill last week. Lawmakers took care of their business quickly Wednesday because Ricketts didn’t veto any of the bills they sent to him this week. Ricketts also praised bills the Legislature passed that will lay the groundwork for a canal project to divert water out of Colorado and study the creation of a major new lake along the Platte River between Lincoln and Omaha. Lawmakers also made plans to spend more than $1 billion in federal pandemic relief money, including a package of $335 million to help economic recovery in parts of Omaha and other high-poverty areas in the state. And Ricketts said the Legislature made important investments in public safety including improvements at the state law enforcement training center and setting aside money for a potential new state prison.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Generator, lauded as a headquarters for Burning Man artists, has a new space and a new mission. The arts and maker space reopened this month after signing a 10-year lease with Foothill Partners, developer of the much anticipated Oddie District – a 187,000-square-foot mixed-use space just east of U.S. 395 in Sparks, next to Goodwill. The Generator currently takes up about 70,000 square feet, about twice the size of its former home on Icehouse Avenue in industrial Sparks. Eventually, about half the space will be given to another tenant. “Any time there’s a lot of people in a space making art, it makes us all feel better, right?” said Jessi “Sprocket” Janusee, communications director for the Generator, also lovingly known as The Genny. Since 2013, local and international artists alike have used the space to assemble colossal sculptures, from temples to whales to ships, before sending the installations into the desert to burn. While it continues to be a magnet for Burning Man creations, staff at the Generator say the goals of the space are now more community-driven. Still run by a cast of established Burners, the team is placing a much heavier emphasis on community outreach year-round.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Theo Martey, a teacher of West African drumming and dance and a songwriter, is the state’s next artist laureate. Martey, nominated by Gov. Chris Sununu, was confirmed by the Executive Council on Wednesday for the two-year, honorary position. He had received the Governor’s Arts Award for Arts Education in 2019. Born in Accra, Ghana, he has more than 33 years’ experience as a performer and arts educator across three continents. He has lived and worked in New Hampshire for 20 years. Martey has taught more than 5,000 workshops to students from first grade through high school, college and university students, and in communities. “For over two decades, I have been invited into dozens of schools across New Hampshire as an artist in residence, working with students so that they may experience West African drumming and dance hands-on,” Martey said in a statement. “To be named artist laureate is an honor, and I look forward to continuing to use music to empower others to discover their best selves and promote the importance of arts across the state and the region.” Martey is the state’s ninth artist laureate since 1997.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A Catholic diocese has agreed to pay $87.5 million to settle claims involving clergy sex abuse with some 300 alleged victims in one of the largest cash settlements involving the Catholic Church in the United States. The agreement between the Diocese of Camden, which encompasses six counties in southern New Jersey on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and plaintiffs was filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden on Tuesday. The settlement must still go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge. If approved, the settlement would exceed the nearly $85 million settlement in 2003 in the clergy abuse scandal in Boston, although it’s less than other settlements in California and Oregon. “I want to express my sincere apology to all those who have been affected by sexual abuse in our Diocese,” Bishop Dennis Sullivan said in a statement. “My prayers go out to all survivors of abuse and I pledge my continuing commitment to ensure that this terrible chapter in the history of the Diocese of Camden, New Jersey never happens again.” Details about what allegedly happened to the roughly 300 victims were not included in the proposed settlement, according to Jeff Anderson, an attorney for some 70 of the victims, who called it “a powerful advance in accountability.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials with a U.S. agency undergoing a multibillion-dollar modernization effort that includes the production of plutonium cores for the nation’s nuclear arsenal celebrated the opening of a massive office complex Tuesday. Jill Hruby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, joined other officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Years in the making, the new complex on the edge of Albuquerque will replace a collection of two dozen military barracks and other buildings, some of which date back to the government’s top-secret Manhattan Project during World War II. Officials said some of the old buildings were compromised by asbestos and lead paint and were well past their lifespans. The new building boasts enough space to cover more than five football fields and will end up saving the agency an estimated $40 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. It includes a data center for rows of servers, conference rooms and secure spaces. Construction was supposed to wrap up last year, but officials said pandemic-related labor and material shortages resulted in delays.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: A widely seen video of an 8-year-old Black child sobbing as he’s being led into a police car over a bag of chips was called “heart-wrenching” Wednesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said more needs to be done to build trust with communities of color. The video taken Sunday shows a white officer holding the clearly distraught youth from behind by his elbows, leading him from a sidewalk to the back seat of a police vehicle. Another officer says the situation is about “stealing stuff.” The man recording the video argues with police to let the child go. The video has been widely shared on social media, with many people condemning the officers for treating the child roughly. Hochul, at a COVID-19 briefing in Syracuse, said the video was difficult to watch. “We have more work to do, and I know that the mayor is working closely with the police department to get to the bottom of everything,” said Hochul, a Democrat. “But also make sure that we do protect our children – that they’re handled in a different way when it comes to encounters with law enforcement.” Syracuse police said Tuesday the officers’ actions were being reviewed, along with body-worn camera footage. Police said the incident involved an accusation of youths stealing from a store.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to give a judge another week to work through the latest step in a long-running legal fight over public education spending. The court’s justices granted Special Superior Court Judge Michael Robinson a seven-day extension, which he had requested Tuesday while citing differences between the legal parties over details and numerous documents to review. Robinson was tasked last month with scrutinizing the November order of another judge who had directed that $1.75 billion be moved from state coffers to carry out two years of a remedial plan to address education inequities. In particular, the Supreme Court told Robinson to review Judge David Lee’s order in light of the General Assembly’s passage of a state budget that funds some of the plan’s provisions. Robinson originally had until Wednesday to report his findings to the justices, who afterward will hear appeals that likely would rule on whether the judicial branch has constitutional powers to order taxpayer-funded spending for education on its own. Republican legislative leaders say only the General Assembly can appropriate state money.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Holmberg, 79, the state’s longest-serving senator, stepped down from the legislative management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reports Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges but in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reports. He also said he no longer has the texts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A doctor accused of ordering excessive amounts of painkillers that led to multiple patient deaths at a Columbus-area hospital was acquitted of 14 counts of murder Wednesday following a weeks­long trial. Dr. William Husel, 46, was accused of ordering the drugs for patients in the Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them. Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook told jurors before the start of deliberations that they could also consider lesser charges of attempted murder. They deliberated for six days. Husel would have faced a sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 15 years had he been found guilty of just one count of murder. Prosecutors presented their case beginning Feb. 22 and put on 53 prosecution witnesses before resting on March 29. Those witnesses included medical experts who testified that Husel ordered up to 20 times as much fentanyl as was necessary to control pain.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Emergency responders, National Guardsmen, children, parents, grandparents, members of Congress, City Council members, students and college professors united Tuesday in their desire to remember the 168 lives lost in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building 27 years ago. In spite of the somber reason for the gathering, laughter and joyful conversation were heard among the crowd of nearly 1,000 people filling the pews of Oklahoma City’s First Church ahead of the annual Day of Remembrance Ceremony. The ceremony was moved inside the church east of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum out of concern for chilly temperatures and wind gusts Tuesday morning, but by the time the crowd followed the bagpipers to the Field of Empty Chairs to place flowers on them, the sun was shining brightly. Speakers partaking in the program included Gov. Kevin Stitt, U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. “When you see your fellow human beings as Republicans or Democrats – not as fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters – then you have begun the process of dehumanization. You are paving the path to horror,” Holt said. “That memorial is a symbol of that path’s inevitable conclusion.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon State Treasury has at least $5.3 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, a coalition of environmental groups said in a report Wednesday that blamed the state for adding to global warming and urged divestment. Oregon is considered a “green” state, through its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by state agencies and being the first state to commit to stop using coal-fired power. Yet the state treasury is working at cross-purposes with over $1 billion invested in the coal industry alone, Divest Oregon said in its report. “The state exposes Oregonians to climate and health risks, economic costs, and financial losses” through the investments, the group said. The amount that Oregon has invested in oil, gas and coal companies – whose products are a leading cause of global warming – is probably far higher than $5.3 billion because the numbers that Divest Oregon obtained from the state treasury through a public records request do not include private equity investments, which are not subject to public disclosure. The state treasury did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency’s spokesperson was tied up in a meeting Wednesday of the Oregon Investment Council, which makes investment decisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The federal fraud trial of a City Council member and his wife in what prosecutors alleged was a “widespread corruption conspiracy” has ended in a mistrial following a jury deadlock. Jurors deliberated for about 25 hours over four days but were unable to reach a verdict in the case of Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and his wife, Dawn Chavous, who were charged with honest services wire fraud in a 22-count indictment. Outside the courtroom, Johnson thanked family, friends and supporters “for just praying for us and showing your support during this very stressful time.” The jury told the judge Monday afternoon that they were at an impasse but deliberated all day Tuesday after being instructed by the judge to do so. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office later said “the government is committed to retrying the case.” Johnson, 46, a Democrat who has served on the council since 2012, was accused of engaging in official actions in exchange for payments. Chavous, 40, was accused of having entered into a “sham” consulting agreement with a nonprofit that was used to funnel payments to her husband. Defense attorneys said prosecutors lacked evidence to support their case, defending the work of Chavous as legitimate and saying it had nothing to do with Johnson’s actions on the council.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The downtown arena known as “The Dunk” will keep its name at least through June. Dunkin’ Donuts’ two-decade-old naming rights deal for the building expired Wednesday, but the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority has agreed to a short-term extension through June 30 while it vets new proposals, Executive Director Daniel McConaghy said Tuesday. At the start of this month, the Convention Center Authority went out to bid for new naming rights proposals from companies looking to display their brand to hockey and basketball fans or drivers speeding past on Route 95. Unlike the previous naming rights deal, which included only the arena, this time the authority plans to include the rights for the next door Rhode Island Convention Center, according to the Request For Proposals. While Dunkin’ Donuts – now known as Dunkin’ – may put in a bid to keep the name, it is likely to face competition. And the fact that the doughnut chain didn’t come to an agreement to extend the deal before it went to a formal bidding process may be a sign it has moved on. The arena was built by the City of Providence in 1972 and was originally known as the Providence Civic Center. Dunkin’ first bought the naming rights to the center in a 2001 deal valued at $8.65 million over 10 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: A performer who scared a group at a haunted house was shot by a man who said he thought he was grabbing a prop gun as part of the experience, police said. The employee at the Zombie Experience at the Hollywood Wax Museum Haunted House in Myrtle Beach was hit in the shoulder and survived, authorities said. The man told investigators the group fell to the ground after the performer scared them Saturday, and he felt a gun hit his foot, Myrtle Beach Police said in a statement on Facebook. The man thought the gun was not real and was part of the experience and fired twice, police said. The performer spoke at the suspect’s bond hearing and said the man looked at him before firing. He said since the shooting, he is struggling to work and can’t sleep. So far, the man has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he gave the gun to a 15-year-old after firing it even through he was told it was real, authorities said. Police said they are still trying to determine where the gun came from, and additional charges are likely.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Avera Health has plans to build the state’s largest pickleball facility. The health care provider will construct 12 outdoor courts at its Avera on Louise Health Campus in Sioux Falls at a cost of about $1.5 million. Pickleball is a sport that’s recently grown in popularity, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Combining elements of tennis, badminton and pingpong, it’s played indoors or outdoors on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net. Two or four players can play with simple equipment that involves paddles and a plastic ball with holes. Jason Askew is executive director of Sports Medicine for Avera and said the organization wants to appeal to people of all ages. “Being able to offer something for adults that is growing by leaps and bounds in popularity, both here in Sioux Falls and around the country, is a lot of fun to be able to announce,” Askew said, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Askew said construction will take a few months, and Avera anticipates the free courts will open to the public by early August.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican officials have removed three congressional hopefuls from the GOP primary ballot, including one candidate backed by ex-President Donald Trump. The late Tuesday night decision by the Tennessee Republican Party was a long-awaited result of months of debate over Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s former State Department spokesperson, entering Nashville’s open 5th Congressional District race. Even with Trump’s endorsement, some Republicans criticized the selection after pointing out that she had just recently moved to the state and did not know the region or its voters. Tennessee’s GOP-controlled Legislature had sought to nudge Ortagus and others off the ballot by imposing residency requirements on most U.S. House and Senate candidates. However, that attempt fizzled after the state’s election office told the Associated Press the legislation – which Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee allowed to go into effect without his signature earlier this month – would not apply retroactively to candidates who had already met the qualifications. That left the decision up to the state Republican Party, who had received challenges over the voting records of Ortagus, as well as video producer Robby Starbuck and small-business owner Baxter Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Former state lawmaker Wendy Davis sued Tuesday over the most restrictive abortion law in effect in the U.S., nearly a decade after her 13-hour filibuster of another anti-abortion measure made her an overnight Democratic star. The lawsuit is the latest attempt to halt the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Courts have repeatedly turned back multiple other challenges and kept the law in place since September. That includes both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court, defeats that left attorneys for Texas abortion clinics acknowledging that their path to stopping the law had effectively shut. Like past challenges, Davis calls the law unconstitutional but a takes a different legal approach, suing a Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who earlier this year accused Citigroup of circumventing the law by offering to pay travel expenses for employees who go out of state to seek an abortion. Cain did not immediately respond to an email sent Tuesday evening. The suit also names three private citizens who Davis accuses of using or threatening to use the law’s unique mechanism that enforces the law only through private lawsuits. Davis’ filibuster propelled a failed run for governor. She also lost a bid for Congress in 2020 and now works with abortion funds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As warmer weather draws more people to get out and enjoy the sunshine, officials are urging anyone heading out into the state’s great outdoors with their pets to keep their dogs on leashes. Dogs can have a serious impact on wildlife and on landscapes, and any left off-leash while in nature could act on their instincts to chase deer and other animals, wildlife officials said Tuesday as they issued a statewide request for dog owners to take the issue more seriously. Utah wildlife often struggles to find food during the winter and can be vulnerable and weak come springtime, according to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “If they get chased, it uses up energy they may need to survive,” said Covy Jones, the Big Game coordinator at UDWR. “These animals are already depleted, and they often can’t afford to waste energy. If you or a pet force them to move away from where they are trying to feed, it could be harmful.” Deer and other big game animals typically move to lower elevations in search of feed during the snowy winter months, which typically brings them closer to roads and to people and pets. Dogs that are off leash can also disturb nesting ground birds and can chase, injure or kill small mammals, deer, elk or moose, according to the DWR. Utah law states that a person may kill or injure a dog that is “attacking, chasing or worrying any species of hoofed protected wildlife.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The second of four men accused in a failed plan to build a biotechnology plant in Vermont using tens of millions of dollars in foreign investors’ money raised through a special visa program was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to 18 months in prison. William Kelly, 73, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $8.3 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty last June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of concealment of material information. As part of the plea deal, eight other charges were dropped and he agreed to cooperative with the government. Kelly was indicted in 2019 on multiple fraud charges along with Miami businessman Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski resorts in northern Vermont, and former Jay Peak president William Stenger. Kelly was an adviser to Quiros. The indictment accused the men of conspiring to devise a scheme between 2011 and 2016 to defraud foreign investors in the AnC-Bio project in Newport. The EB-5 visa program encourages foreigners to invest in U.S. projects that create jobs in exchange for a chance to earn permanent U.S. residency.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After two years of pandemic-enforced absence, Tom’s Cove Park campground will again welcome hungry seafood lovers as the Chincoteague Seafood Festival – appropriately themed “Long Time ... No Sea!” – returns for its 52nd year May7. The Chincoteague Chamber-sponsored event is held the first Saturday in May to promote the seafood industry on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The festival offers fresh, local seafood and signature dishes from local restaurants as well as old and new Eastern Shore favorites prepared by festival cooks, volunteers and professionals, according to the chamber. Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the ticket price, with beer available for purchase. Front Page News will provide live entertainment, and festivalgoers can shop an arts and crafts tent featuring handmade creations from area artisans. Ticket sales have been brisk due to the two-year hiatus, according to the chamber.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A citywide “day of service” in May will offer thousands of volunteer opportunities in an event Mayor Bruce Harrell hopes will be a symbol of how his administration plans to beautify the city. Rather than a budget boost or a new devotion of city resources, Harrell is appealing to civic goodwill to help clear litter, weeds, debris and graffiti, The Seattle Times reports. More than 80 city-organized cleanup and volunteer events will take place May 21. Some of the options include picking up litter in Ballard, clearing trails in Jackson Park, working on community gardens in the Chinatown International District, sorting donations at downtown shelters and building tiny homes near the Duwamish River. “This is going to be symbolic of how we’re going to get things done in our city,” Harrell said Monday. “People want to help. Employers want to help; employees want to help.” Everyone who volunteers for the day of service, Harrell said, will a sense of self-fulfillment that they did something about a problem rather than just complaining, along with a T-shirt. The city annually spends about $3.7 million on graffiti removal and has the equivalent of about 15 full-time employees devoted to the problem. Harrell said he’s not yet sure if the city needs to devote more money to it. Volunteers can register at seattle.gov/dayofservice.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A former director at a hospital has filed a lawsuit alleging he was fired after he raised concerns about the safety of patients who were on ventilators and receiving other respiratory care services during a surge of COVID-19 cases. Mark Mustard was fired as director of cardiopulmonary and therapy services at Princeton Community Hospital in September 2021. His departure from the West Virginia University Medicine affiliate came amid the surging delta variant of the coronavirus “at a time when respiratory care was crucial to the community,” according to a lawsuit filed last week in Mercer County Circuit Court. Mustard, then 63, alleges he was terminated after he reported concerns about the quality of medical care being provided as the number of patients requiring respiratory care increased during the pandemic. Mustard was “highly outspoken” about the need for more staff in the respiratory services department “in order to provide an adequate level of care to its patients and the community,” the lawsuit said. He was not warned that his job was in jeopardy or given a reason for the termination, which came less than one month after he received an “exceptional” performance review that included an incentive bonus of more than $6,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Communities are encouraging residents to keep their lawnmowers in the garage next month to boost the population of bees and other pollinators. Appleton became the first city to adopt the “No Mow May” initiative a couple of years ago, and others have followed, including Wausau, Oshkosh, Fort Atkinson and Stevens Point. The idea is to give homeowners the option of letting their lawns become a bit overgrown for a few weeks to ensure that bees coming out of hibernation have plenty of options for the nectar and pollen they need, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Cities temporarily waive enforcement of ordinances that require homeowners to maintain their lawns. This year, the initiative has spread even farther, to La Crosse, Wisconsin Rapids, De Pere and other communities. “Bees, and insects in general, are in a bit of a slump right now,” said Israel Del Toro, a biology professor at Appleton’s Lawrence University. Studies have shown steep declines in wild bee populations in the 21st century. The United Nations characterizes it as a threat to the global food supply. Del Toro said many factors are hurting bee populations, including climate change and irresponsible uses of pesticides and herbicides. But in his view, the biggest stressor is habitat loss. Del Toro said there is plenty of room for compromise. People can plant native flowers or allow growth only in parts of their yards.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A utility company estimates a new law requiring carbon-capture systems be added to coal-fired plants could cost the average customer an extra $500 a month, WyoFile reports. Black Hills Corp. said in a filing with the Wyoming Public Service Commission that the measure passed by the Legislature in 2020 could cost it as much as $1 billion per coal unit, according to the news outlet.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}]}

They tried medicating the 14 patients. They tried every treatment they knew of.\n\nThe patients still had \"uncontrollable\" behaviors.\n\nSo, in 1964 the state mental institution in Georgetown, now called Stockley Center, wrote to the notorious Dr. Walter Freeman in California for help.\n\nThey wanted to learn how to do lobotomies.\n\nFreeman, who would perform 7,000 lobotomies in the United States in a 40-year period, traveled to Georgetown where, in a six-minute procedure, he inserted an ice pick-like instrument into a patient's brain through his or her eye sockets — without anesthesia.\n\nA handful of doctors and nurses were tasked with holding the patients down. The goal was to cure mental illness.\n\nWhile the lobotomies in 1964 represent one day of the institution's almost 100-year-old history, the procedure was one of the many practices performed at the institution that are now considered to be cruel and ineffective.\n\nAnd they are all documented in the mental institution's museum.\n\nThe Stockley Center museum is preserving the state institution's complicated past, with the hopes of history never repeating itself. Run by volunteer Linda Fleetwood, whose stepson is a resident of Stockley, the curated items show the evolution of treatment for people with disabilities — and how some of these methods occurred only decades ago.\n\n“It is part of the history,” said Adele Wemlinger, the former executive director of Stockley. “And it shows how far we’ve come. I think time has taught us all a lot over the years.\n\n\"At the time, we thought we were doing the right thing.”\n\nOpened in 1921 for \"feeble-minded\" children, the Stockley Center at one time housed more than 700 people with varying physical and mental disabilities. Stockley now cares for 49 adults, many of whom have severe physical disabilities.\n\nWemlinger, who retired from Stockley last year, asked Fleetwood to curate a museum about four years ago. As the institution was downsizing and remodeling buildings, staff members and parents were finding items she viewed to be artifacts. Wemlinger didn't want them to be thrown away.\n\nThe museum, based in a small recreational room on the campus, has bookshelves of binders filled with old treatment plans, including the sterilization of patients who were as young as 2 years old. Photos show how black and white residents were segregated, with black patients receiving the ragged hand-me-downs of their white peers.\n\nReports detail how parents barely visited their children. Some families, out of embarrassment, instructed nurses to refrain from saying they were with Stockley when they called them about their children. Instead, the nurses had to use code words.\n\nWhen the 14 Delawareans were lobotomized at Stockley in 1964, the doctors were focused on \"curing mental retardation,\" Fleetwood said. But in reality, it only made the patients worse.\n\nThe doctors cut apart the two sides of their brain and then withdrew the ice pick, turning the patients into \"placid souls,\" and made many of them blind, Fleetwood said.\n\nMany of those patients lived at Stockley until they died decades later, she said.\n\nFleetwood has saved the lobotomy consent forms signed by the patient's family members, which never mentioned blindness as a potential side effect. It also described lobotomies as a noninvasive procedure that would not involve a lot of stitches, Fleetwood said.\n\nThe consent form for the sterilizations, which were done to avoid procreation, didn't note that women's Fallopian tubes would be removed or that men would undergo vasectomies.\n\nWhile finding old photographs and documents, Fleetwood was surprised to learn that many of the residents were required to work while living at Stockley. Some would tend to the farm while others worked in the laundry room.\n\nSome people worked 60 hours a week and got paid very little, she said.\n\n\"That tells me that they weren’t that handicapped if they could work on the farm six days a week,\" she said.\n\nThe residents didn't always have disabilities, Fleetwood said. Sometimes they were homeless people or children with mild behavioral issues.\n\nAs group homes became a more popular and suitable option for some residents in the early 2000s, Stockley began transitioning people out of the institution and into the community, said Marie Nonnenmacher, director of the Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.\n\nEven though other states are closing their institutions, Nonnenmacher said there are no immediate plans to make changes to Stockley. There also isn’t a need to grow the number of people at the institution, she said.\n\nStockley operates on an $18 million budget, which is a significant decrease from previous decades, Nonnenmacher said. The institution now only cares for adults.\n\nFleetwood's stepson has lived at Stockley for almost 15 years. Since Jonathan, 35, is epileptic, nonverbal and non-ambulatory, he requires 24/7 care, she said. He's also fed through a feeding tube.\n\nTo Fleetwood, Stockley is the only place that can look after her stepson.\n\n\"As long as I have a breath in my body, my stepson will be here,\" she said.\n\n“I’m glad he is a present-day relative and not here in 1950,\" Fleetwood added. \"I have seen all of the pictures from the way the old buildings were...they were in horrible shape. There was little for them to do.\"\n\nFleetwood is still curating the museum, constantly trying to get her hands on anything related to Stockley, from glass doorknobs to wooden wheelchairs. It's not easy.\n\nLast Wednesday, the binder containing photos of the lobotomies and documents relating to lobotomies had disappeared, confusing Fleetwood.\n\nShe worries that if someone wanted to \"clean up\" Stockley's history, the binder would be the first to go.\n\nThat's why Fleetwood made copies and gave them to the State Archives. She never wants this history to disappear for good.\n\nDELAWARE HEALTH\n\nThis is why the mumps is making a comeback in Delaware\n\nHospital CEOs don't like Delaware plan to rein in health care costs\n\nSenate bill would cover IVF, all fertility treatments for Delawareans\n\nContact Meredith Newman at 302-324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

That would be the final score.\n\nThe game had been moved to September from its traditional season-ending spot due to schedule conflicts created because of the pope’s visit to Philadelphia.\n\nConsidering Delaware’s misfortune, some wondered if higher forces were at work on the Catholic school campus that sunny afternoon.\n\nNo Delaware players have ever experienced the thrill of a win over Villanova, a major motivator, especially for seniors such as Roberts.\n\n“Regardless of the situation, just to beat them would be gratifying,” Roberts said.\n\nThe “situation” to which Roberts referred was the NCAA Tournament and the wonderful bonus perhaps awaiting the Blue Hens.\n\nWith a win, Delaware (7-3 overall, 5-2 CAA) has a good chance to find itself in the FCS 24-team bracket when it is announced Sunday at 11 a.m. on ESPNU.\n\n“I recognize the significance of playing in a rivalry game like this one,” said first-year Delaware coach Danny Rocco, who was 3-1 against Villanova as Richmond coach the previous five years.\n\n“I recognize the reality that we have not had a lot of success of late but we are very highly motivated to go up there and play a complete game and find a way to come out of there with a win. I’m excited for the challenge.”\n\nWhich brings another painful Villanova memory to mind for Blue Hens.\n\nThe last time Delaware was positioned to make the playoffs was 2013. It took a 7-4 record into its meeting with the Wildcats, that year at PPL Park (now Talen Energy Stadium), home of the Philadelphia Union in Chester.\n\nIt was a disaster.\n\nAhead 34-12 with less than nine minutes left, Delaware lost 35-34 after a startling array of offensive failure, defensive incompetence, and special teams mishaps. Villanova scored 23 points in the final 8:01, winning on a 24-yard field goal with :01 left after recovering an onside kick.\n\nThe 22-point fourth-quarter lead remains the largest Delaware has blown in its 126-year football history.\n\n“It’s just one of those rivalries that brings out sometimes the best and worst in both teams,” Villanova coach Andy Talley, who retired last year, had said after dealing Delaware that devastating defeat.\n\nDelaware discovered the “worst” half of that equation.\n\nBut Delaware also lost to Villanova in 2007 and 2010, seasons it reached FCS title games.\n\nIn other seasons in which Delaware may have appeared overmatched, it did put up a good fight but fell in heartbreaking fashion. In addition to the 2013 and 2015 games, four more of Delaware’s 10 recent losses to the Wildcats have been by seven points or fewer.\n\nIn 2014 at Delaware Stadium, for instance, Villanova needed Robertson’s 21-yard pass to Kevin Gulyas with 23 seconds left and a subsequent two-point pass to overcome a one-point deficit in a 35-28 win. The Wildcats marched on to the FCS quarterfinals.\n\nDelaware’s only win in the last 11 games came in 2011, a 26-16 verdict in Chester against a 2-9 Villanova squad.\n\nWhile Villanova (4-6, 2-5) is stuck with its first losing record since, “You can’t take the bait,” Rocco said, meaning every CAA game is a challenge.\n\nIn addition, the Wildcats remain a significant threat despite injuries that have knocked out key players such as Bednarczyk, tight end Ryan Bell, running back Matt Gudzak and safety Rob Rolle, the CAA preseason defensive player of the year, among others.\n\nDelaware has also lost three defensive starters itself to season-ending injuries – All-CAA linebacker Charles Bell, cornerback Justin Watson and defensive end Cam Kitchen – plus offensive tackle Jethro Pepe.\n\n“I think it’s a typical rivalry game,” said Mark Ferrante, in his first year as Villanova head coach after 30 years as an assistant there.\n\n“You play these games and everyone always says, and we say it to our players and I’m sure coach Rocco will have those guys ready to rock and roll, but you throw the records out the window when you play these games. You just gotta go out and play as consistently as you can and a lot of times it comes down to big plays.”\n\nOn Saturday, the Blue Hens will see if they can make the big plays at the opportune moments.\n\nIf they do and it earns them that trophy, Delaware can maybe stop singing the FCS Tournament blues, too.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

And, we should learn from initiatives and workgroups right here in Delaware.\n\nNationally, the number of patients who seek physician assisted suicide remains extremely small. Furthermore, many of the patients who seek and are approved for this controversial prescription, ultimately do not take the lethal dose of medication.\n\nSo we would ask, what is the true reason why patients resort to this option?\n\nThe answer in the large majority of these cases is that patients have lost their autonomy and sense of empowerment in the late stages of their illnesses. Pain, both physical and mental, may be inadequately treated. However, providing a prescription for suicide is certainly not how we should be empowering our patients at the end of life.\n\nToday, Delaware has created many pathways to restore the autonomy of the patient and manage suffering at the end of life. Palliative care and hospice programs are present at almost all hospitals and it’s available in the outpatient setting. Hospitals here in Delaware have launched training programs in adult and pediatric palliative care that will produce doctors with the expertise needed to alleviate suffering and continue the role as physicians as healers and not those who hasten death by assisting in suicide or foster euthanasia.\n\nThe recent recognition of DMOST, Delaware Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment, by our state provides a platform for doctors to have important conversations about end of life care and to make sure patient’s wishes are followed. A responsible exception in the new opiate prescribing regulations and the provision of medical marijuana for managing cancer pain also allow pathways for better pain control. Delaware continues to work on ramping up mental health services in our state to provide counseling and treatment for the depression and anxiety that can often compound suffering.\n\nIn November of 2015, the Delaware Health Care Commission (DHCC) convened an End of Life Workgroup, of which the primary sponsor of HB 160 was a member. In their final report published in May of 2016 they embrace promoting and advancing DMOST as well as other insightful recommendations. It is important to note that legalizing physician assisted suicide or any form of euthanasia is NOT included in their recommendations.\n\nThe key recommendations outlined in the report include the following:\n\nFormally link current activities related to end-of-life and palliative care with ongoing health system transformation efforts involving, at minimum, the Delaware End of Life Coalition, Palliative Care Council of the Delaware Healthcare Association (DHA), the Delaware Health Care Commission (HCC) and the Delaware Center for Health Innovation (DCHI).\n\nDevelop, implement and evaluate a Delaware-specific awareness campaign that engages an array of stakeholders and leverages the wealth of available resources in the state. An effective campaign will ideally include standardized materials and information geared toward a variety of audiences (patients, providers, caregivers, etc.), utilize technology and multiple platforms and be culturally sensitive.\n\nSpecifically promote palliative and end-of-life care educational offerings as a means to meet continuing education requirements for providers at all levels.\n\nSupport and monitor the growth of palliative and end-of-life care services offered in inpatient and community-based settings.\n\nUsing resources compiled by the Delaware End of Life Coalition as a basis, build and continue to update a compendium of resources related to end-of-life and palliative care for consumers, advocates, and service providers.\n\nExplore mechanisms to make patient wishes readily accessible in a variety of settings.\n\nUsing existing data and data collection tools as a foundation, develop and implement a comprehensive, statewide approach to gathering and using data related to end-of-life and palliative care\n\nWe clearly have more work to do. It is critical that the medical profession redouble its efforts to ensure that dying patients are provided optimal treatment for their pain and other discomfort. The use of more aggressive comfort care measures, including greater reliance on hospice care and palliative care, can alleviate the physical and emotional suffering that dying patients experience.\n\nEvaluation and treatment by a health professional with expertise in the psychiatric aspects of terminal illness can often alleviate the suffering that leads a patient to desire assisted suicide. All health care providers must resist the natural tendency to withdraw physically and emotionally from their terminally ill patients. When the treatment goals for a patient in the end stages of a terminal illness shift from curative efforts to comfort care, the level of physician involvement in the patient's care should in no way decrease.\n\nRequests for physician assisted suicide should be a signal to the physician that the patient's needs are unmet and further evaluation to identify the elements contributing to the patient's suffering is necessary. Multidisciplinary intervention, including specialty consultation, pastoral care, family counseling and other modalities, should be sought as clinically indicated. Further efforts to educate physicians about advanced pain management techniques, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, are necessary to overcome any shortcomings in this area.\n\nIt is for these reasons, The Medical Society of Delaware, after careful and thoughtful review of HB 160, strongly oppose any bill to legalize physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia and urge the members of the General Assembly to focus on the recommendations established by the DHCC End of Life Workgroup.\n\nDr. Prayus Tailor is president of the Medical Society of Delaware.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/traffic/2015/05/28/bridge-debacle/28068833/", "title": "$45 million later: I-495 bridge closure impact still felt", "text": "Jeff Montgomery\n\nThe News Journal\n\nMay 29 marks a year since I-495 columns were found to be tipping.\n\nThe crossing over the Christina River was closed for repairs.\n\nIt was found that 55%2C000 tons of dirt piled nearby caused the issues.\n\nDetours caused extensive delays across the region.\n\nFallout from the closure of I-495 over the Christina River still is being felt in the form of pockmarked roads, legal disputes and sagging profits, a year after it was discovered pillars supporting the crossing were dangerously tipping.\n\n\"We were ready to almost close our doors last year,\" said Les Tronzo, owner of Sports Car Tire Co. on East 13th Street in Wilmington, which was cut off from traffic for weeks during the detour and $45 million construction project. \"We're back somewhat in the black, but we're still trying to make up for last year.\"\n\nFriday marks a year since senior engineer R. David Charles of the Pike Creek firm Duffield Associates was visiting a job site on the Christina River and happened to notice that several I-495 pillars seemed to be tilting. He sent photos to the Delaware Department of Transportation, which ordered a complete shutdown June 2.\n\nThe closure between Exits 2 and 3 cut off a key bypass for the East Coast transportation grid, funneling motorists onto detours across nearby roads and causing a far-reaching impact on the interstate network. U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called the stoppage \"a national issue\" and the Federal Highway Administration stepped in with $2 million in emergency funds.\n\nPresident Barack Obama later delivered a speech about infrastructure funding at the Port of Wilmington, within sight of the span.\n\nIt was later determined that DelDOT had been notified of the column issues weeks before, and that problems were caused after a contractor had deposited 55,000 tons of dirt near pillars. The shifting earth broke and bent underground supports, slowly tipping piers and both the north and south lanes.\n\nSouthbound traffic was rerouted for 60 days as crews worked on repairs. Northbound lanes, which had more serious damage, were rerouted for 83 days. The delays sent commute times skyrocketing.\n\nMargaret Garrison of Newark said it was like rush hour all day. She travels the region for a service that provides medical checks for insurance customers.\n\n\"If I had to go up into north Wilmington, I had to plan on an hour drive, versus half an hour,\" she said.\n\nHerbert Bollman, owner of the F&H Transport truck shop off I-495 and Terminal Avenue, estimates his business was sliced by 20-25 percent because of the closure. The drop in port-related traffic and motorists using I-95 as an alternate hurt, he said.\n\n\"When they shut the bridge down, we lost our customers that normally come from Pennsylvania going south immediately,\" Bollman said.\n\nTruck drivers were upset over lost time, increased fuel costs and inconvenience, he said.\n\nWilmington resident Howard Laws, whose Eden Park neighborhood is near the I-495 overpass, recalls days of traffic, noise and exhaust surging along New Castle Avenue and nearby streets.\n\n\"It caused a lot of road damage, a lot of traffic jam, a lot of commotion,\" Laws said. \"I won't even talk about the pollution that it caused.\"\n\nDelDOT sees lessons learned in case\n\nBarry Benton, the state Transportation Department chief bridge engineer, said they were very aware of traffic disruptions and the potential economic impact, especially in summertime.\n\nWithin days of the shutdown, DelDOT announced plans to shore up the underside of the bridge and repair supports while traffic moved above, instead of building a replacement. The agency launched what would become a massive, on-the-fly fix that would pull in contractors and supplies from around the country.\n\nEngineers also opted for solutions that in hindsight might have been more massive than needed, including huge concrete bases for two damaged sets of piers, Benton said. They also had to comply with federal preferences for design choices.\n\n\"We were making some conservative, quick assumptions,\" he said. \"In order to move forward, we were designing it while we were getting information. The [cost of] materials weren't that big a deal, compared to the user costs of what was happening on I-95.\"\n\nAt one point, workers cut holes in the bridge deck so 160-foot steel cages could be lowered in one piece into 4-foot holes drilled under the span, then filled with cement to create a stable base for new supports.\n\nContractors also were skeptical about drilling 150-foot-deep holes for supports under a bridge with far less clearance. Two drilling companies backed out after examining the challenge.\n\nPort Director Gene Bailey said DelDOT managed to complete the repairs before peak operations resumed, a time when as many as 1,500 vehicles would have been moving in and out of the port gates daily. Only a between-season fruit shipping fall-off prevented the problem from being worse, he said.\n\n\"Sometimes you'd rather be lucky than good,\" Bailey said.\n\nBenton said the experience was a lesson for the agency. He said they adopted reforms to address safety and supervisory shortcomings, and recently shared what was learned at a recent meeting of bridge engineers from all 50 states.\n\n\"We explained what we went through, how we fixed it and let them know how processes changed at DelDOT and what they should look at as well,\" he said.\n\nDelDOT will present a paper on the issue next month at an international conference in Pittsburgh, long known as the \"City of Bridges.\"\n\nBenton said the agency also addressed why the original notification fell on deaf ears. In April 2014, Charles Allen Jr. of Elkton, Maryland, called DelDOT and 911 with worries that the bridge lanes were out of kilter. He uses the crossing to get to his auto body shop in Wilmington.\n\n\"I'm just a little concerned,\" Allen told the DelDOT official, according to a recording. \"I mean, it doesn't look right.\"\n\nAllen's warning and other hints of trouble were treated with skepticism and dismissed. Another call on May 30 also generated no action. An October 2012 inspection of the bridge, built in 1974, found it was in \"good condition.\"\n\nAllen said this week he was satisfied by assurances that DelDOT has improved its reporting system, assuring that hazard calls are taken seriously. But he also said the incident has been \"blown out of proportion\" by some.\n\n\"What kind of aggravates me is, they're saying this is an infrastructure problem, a national big deal,\" Allen said. \"It's a repair. Somebody made a mistake, dumped some dirt and they need to get it resolved.\"\n\nCharles, the engineer who got a response from DelDOT, credited the agency and contractors with coming up with a smart solution.\n\n\"I think it was a great project, an interesting project,\" he said. \"I wish I could have worked on it.\"\n\nIn a twist, Charles said that he worked on a soil-instability project 30 years ago on the north side of the Christina River, after an earthen berm that was enlarged by the Corps of Engineers shifted surrounding ground several feet, affecting utilities.\n\nThe Delaware Engineering Society in February named Charles the Delaware Engineer of the Year for spotting the problem. He said Allen deserved credit as well.\n\nCase may still go to court\n\nNegotiations continue between state attorneys and the intertwined businesses associated with the dirt pile: Alma Properties LLC, Port Contractors Inc. and Keogh Contracting Co.\n\nThe land is owned by DuPont Co., which leases it to Port Contractors. That firm has an agreement to let Keogh use the property for storage and also has an interest in Alma, which owns land near the site.\n\nKeogh is owned by James B. Thomas Jr., son of a founder of Port Contractors. Thomas did not return a call for this story, but said in June that \"I feel very badly about what happened to the bridge.\"\n\nHis father, James Thomas Sr., last month said the companies \"know they have a fight on their hands\" because of the government lawsuit threats.\n\nDelDOT has hired a national legal firm to represent the agency in negotiations and possibly in court.\n\nLaws, the Eden Park resident, said someone should have noticed the pile of dirt and raised concerns.\n\n\"This is what happens in life when you think you can't do any damage,\" he said. \"It's just amazing how the city and county can come and do code enforcement, but never look at stuff like that.\"\n\nWilmington has yet to recover from what started a year ago, Tronzo said.\n\n\"The roads in the city weren't designed to take the kind of traffic they were getting when tractor-trailers were diverting straight up through,\" he said. \"They still haven't fixed the potholes and damage to the curbs from the tractor-trailers.\"\n\nContact Jeff Montgomery at (302) 463-3344 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n93,000\n\nVehicles that travel on Interstate 495 over the Christina River daily\n\n55,000\n\nWeight, in tons, of dirt found piled near support columns\n\n4\n\nDegrees of pillar found to be tipping the most at the crossing\n\n8\n\nDamaged pillars fixed by crews\n\n59\n\nDays I-495 was closed between Exits 2 and 3\n\n45 million\n\nCost, in dollars, to repair interstate", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/09/25/investigators-scene-wheelchair-shooting/72806220/", "title": "Police release part of 911 tape in wheelchair shooting", "text": "Jessica Masulli Reyes, Jenna Pizzi, and Brittany Horn\n\nInvestigators from the Delaware Department of Justice and Wilmington police are continuing to piece together what led four officers – three white and one Hispanic – to shoot to death a black man in a wheelchair on Wednesday.\n\nCity police say Jeremy “Bam” McDole was armed and reaching for a gun when the officers opened fire, but McDole’s family has denied he had a gun, pointing to a cell phone video posted to YouTube where one is not visible.\n\nMcDole, 28, was killed in the 1800 block of Tulip Street after the four officers shot him several times. City officials have not identified the officers, but confirmed their races on Friday. All remain on administrative leave.\n\nLate Friday, police released a portion of the 911 call. In it, a woman says a man shot himself and they needed to get an ambulance to the AutoZone parking lot along Lancaster Avenue.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Andrea Janvier said the audio was released “in the interest of preserving public safety and to address the specific question of whether Mr. McDole was armed at the time of the incident.” The remainder of the call will not be released at this time, she said.\n\nThe News Journal/delawareonline exclusive audio:\n\nThe female caller says to “send (police) quick” to Autozone and South Scott Street. She repeatedly says McDole, who is not yet identified, is moving but that he shot himself and he still has a gun.\n\n“Please get the cops here,” the woman in the 911 audio says.\n\nShe says she doesn’t know where his weapon is but she repeatedly asks for police response, saying he has a weapon in his hand. She says he shot himself and the emergency dispatcher asks her to move back from the situation.\n\nShe says she doesn’t want to move closer to him and to “please get the cops here” and confirms he’s in a wheelchair. She repeatedly says he has a weapon in his hand, telling others nearby to back up from the scene.\n\nMcDole’s family members have maintained that he did not have a weapon. Family members could not be reached late Friday night.\n\nBut Pastor Derrick Johnson of Joshua Harvest Church said witnesses at the scene prior to the shooting told him McDole had a gun.\n\nWhile Johnson has not led any of the protests following the shooting, he said the issue is not simply whether McDole was armed.\n\n“The issue is the actions of police as clearly displayed on the video,” he said, referring to a phone video of the police confrontation shot by a bystander.\n\n“If they knew he had a gun and that they were dealing with a person who was suicidal, why wasn’t a psychologist ... or someone like that sent with them to talk him down,” he asked.\n\nThe official investigation of the shooting continued on Friday, though few details were released.\n\nAt least six investigators from Attorney General Matt Denn’s office were at the scene Friday, two of whom examined a shed in the parking lot of a gas station that backs up to the corner of Tulip and South Lincoln streets. Other investigators focused further down the street.\n\nAs the investigators searched, a makeshift memorial stood on the spot of the shooting, marked by yellow cones that have “bam” and “rip” scrawled on them. The cones, which occasionally get knocked down by the wind, are surrounded by candles, beer cans, stuffed animals, flowers and balloons.\n\nNews of the shooting has garnered international attention – topping CNN and other media’s homepages on Friday. Despite the attention, few details have been released.\n\nJanvier declined Friday to answer questions, including ones about the number of shots fired, what preceded what is seen on the video, and the officers’ names.\n\nDepending on how the investigation progresses over the weekend, the department may be able to provide more information on Monday, she said.\n\nRobert Bovell, a Hilltop resident who has been with the family since the shooting, said he and McDole’s family are upset that city police haven’t given more details.\n\n“We are all unhappy,” Bovell said. “We just want to examine the facts of what happened.”\n\nMuch of the public information about the shooting has come from a cellphone video that shows one officer pointing a shotgun at McDole, screaming at him to “drop the gun.” Other officers are later heard screaming, “Hands up.”\n\nMcDole, who is paralyzed from the waist down, fidgets, moving his legs with his hands and rubbing his knees with both hands, and tries to raise himself out of the wheelchair. He is then seen sliding his hand up his thigh and toward his waist as officers open fire.\n\nWARNING: Graphic video\n\nPolice have said they responded to a 911 call at 3 p.m. Wednesday about a man with a self-inflicted wound who was armed. The chief said police found a .38-caliber gun at McDole’s side after the shooting.\n\nOfficials have assured the public that their investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is conducting its investigation separate from the Wilmington police, as is standard after a police shooting.\n\nThe office, which has two attorneys and three investigators, was created within the Department of Justice after Denn took office earlier this year.\n\n“The Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust conducts investigations of police shooting incidents in order to determine whether the officer or officers were in compliance with Delaware law,” spokesman Carl Kanefsky said. “That determination, which could result in criminal charges, is made solely within the Attorney General’s Office.”\n\nKanefsky said investigators work both separately and with the police agency after a police-involved shooting.\n\nLatest shooting intensifies scrutiny of police conduct\n\nThe police department and Department of Justice will both respond to the scene, observe the autopsy and observe interviews. Other activities, however, are done separately, such as seeking and interviewing witnesses, examining the scene and reviewing evidence.\n\nThe results will be released publicly and posted to the Department of Justice website when they are complete, he said. These investigations can often take several months to finish.\n\nThe Department of Justice took more than six months to clear the Wilmington officers who shot Marvin T. Jones, a Georgia man paralyzed by police during a traffic stop on Vandever Avenue in January.\n\nNeither Wilmington Police nor the Department of Justice have released details about what led up to and followed Wednesday’s shooting.\n\nJon Shane, a retired captain from the Newark Police Department and associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said it appears the officers involved in McDole’s death were justified in their use of force, because they believed at the moment that he was armed and that he was able to use the gun because of the 911 call that he had shot himself.\n\n“The less information officers have, they have the right to draw some inferences,” Shane said. “They treat every gun as loaded until they find out it is not, and every gun as real until they find out it is fake.”\n\nFamily disputes police, says McDole had no gun\n\nShane said the video raises many questions about the incident, but said if the matter goes to court, the officers will likely be able to prove that use of force was justified.\n\n“The law is pretty clear on how you can use force,” Shane said. “You have to be in fear for your life or for the life of a third person and you have to be able to articulate what those fears are.”\n\nShane said the officers, because of their training or because they have a different vantage point than seen in the bystander video, may have seen something different that presented a real threat.\n\n“These things are always delicate,” Shane said. “There are not many police shootings where people believe the police account unless it is so clear – and they never really are.”\n\nMaria Haberfeld, professor and chair of the department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College, said officers are trained not to see anyone as less of a threat because of their appearance or disability. Therefore, these officers would not have approached McDole differently than someone not seated in a wheelchair.\n\n“There are plenty of what police call war stories where somebody who appeared to be completely benign or not a threat pulls out a gun or knife and kills an officer,” Haberfeld said. “I’ve seen many departments training use of force around the concept of unusual suspects.”\n\nHaberfeld said it is an ABC of police training to identify the threat no matter if the person is old, young, able-bodied or disabled.\n\n“It is about the final outcome, whether you are 80 years old, 8 years old or in a wheelchair, the outcome is the only consideration here,” Haberfeld said.\n\nOfficers are trained to leave distance between themselves and suspects they believe to be dangerous, therefore it would have gone against training to go behind McDole to subdue him.\n\n“Your training is not to be a Kung Fu master and wrestle someone to the ground like that,” Shane said. “You don’t want to put yourself in a situation where you have to use force because you don’t have distance on your side.”\n\nMcDole’s mother has said her son did not have a gun. Pastor Ty Johnson, who has been close to the family since the incident, said they continue to hold that belief, despite what police have said.\n\nJohnson said the family, which is making arrangements to bury McDole, is still processing the incident but hopes to look closely and analyze any evidence they can.\n\n“We certainly want to wait and find out,” Johnson said.\n\nMcDole’s mother, Phyllis, raised concerns Thursday that she was never notified that her son had been killed or where his body was taken after the incident.\n\n“They never notified me where his body was,” she said. “They have yet to come and tell me anything. I had to call them this morning and find my own child, my own child laying in a morgue.”\n\nKimberly H. Chandler, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security, said in an email to The News Journal on Friday that autopsies are usually performed the same day as the death or the next day.\n\n“Families do not get to view the body before an exam, unless it is needed for identification purposes only,” she said.\n\nChandler added that autopsies are performed in any death that is “sudden, unexplained or violent.”\n\nGov. Jack Markell attended a vigil Thursday night outside McDole’s mother’s home. His office released the following statement Friday:\n\n“I had the opportunity to meet with relatives of Jeremy McDole yesterday, including his mother, grandmother and sister, during the vigil held in his honor and to offer my sincere condolences for their loss. The vigil was peaceful and somber, arranged by a community in mourning. I am grateful the Attorney General’s Office has taken swift action to review the details of the case and await the results of its investigation.”\n\nThe family is still working to set up a fund to accept donations to go toward funeral expenses.\n\nThe Wilmington Police Department asks that anyone with information about the incident contact Detective Sergeant George Pigford at (302) 576-3674 or George.pigford@cj.state.de.us.\n\nThe Department of Justice asks anyone with information about the incident to call Special Investigator Frank Robinson at (302) 577-8707.\n\nReporter Esteban Parra contributed to this report.Contact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @JessicaMasulli.

He was 103.\n\nDu Pont was the great-great-grandson of DuPont Co. founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours who fled France for Delaware during the French Revolution and began building a vast family fortune by producing gunpowder along the banks of the Brandywine.\n\nHis father Irénée du Pont Sr., along with his father's two brothers Pierre S. du Pont, founder of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, and Lammot du Pont had each served as the Wilmington-based DuPont Co.'s president. They helped expand its interests from an explosives manufacturer to one of the world's largest chemical companies.\n\nIrénée du Pont Jr., who had eight sisters, was the youngest and only son of Irénée and Irene Sophie du Pont, who were second cousins.\n\nA graduate of Wilmington's Tower Hill School, he attended Dartmouth College and graduated in 1943 with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his father's and uncles' alma mater.\n\nHe was hired by \"the family business,\" as some du Ponts liked to call the DuPont Co., in 1946, by the late DuPont scientist Nathaniel C. Wyeth. Wyeth was the inventor of the plastic soda bottle and the older brother of famed Chadds Ford artist Andrew Wyeth.\n\nAs was the family tradition, Irénée Jr., known by his nickname \"Brip,\" worked his way up the company ladder. He learned the ropes and held various engineering and supervisory positions at plants in Arlington, New Jersey; Parkersburg, West Virginia, and Charleston, West Virginia.\n\nHe returned to Wilmington in 1953 and later served as the company's senior vice president before retiring in 1978.\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal in a 2000 interview that he declined all suggestions that he run the company.\n\n\"I as a stockholder would have objected to me as president,\" he said.\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal he had dyslexia and it would have kept him from doing the huge volume of reading needed to do the job well. \"I would have been a disaster. You've got to be a very astute and quick-witted person to take an executive level of leadership. It would have been in my financial interest not to go there.\"\n\nStill, du Pont was one of the last family members to reach one of the highest levels of management in the DuPont Co. The family who had led the DuPont Co. for most of the 20th century eventually ended its control in the late 1970s.\n\nLife at Granogue\n\nDu Pont was once considered one of the richest men in the world, according to various Forbes magazine rankings over the years. He brushed aside the reports and told The News Journal the $525 million net worth which Forbes attributed to him and his family in Montchanin in 1998 was based on money \"generated generations ago.\"\n\nWhen a News Journal reporter interviewed him in 2000, du Pont was more than delighted to show off the tag inside the blazer he was wearing. It wasn't from Brooks Brothers. He bought the jacket at Value City, which, at that time, was a well-known discount store.\n\nHe lived at Granogue, the hilltop estate and mansion with a mile-long driveway and 30 rooms in northern New Castle County, which can be seen along points of Smith Bridge Road. It is sometimes referred to as the symbol of Chateau Country, the name for Delaware's most exclusive region and for generations the home of extended members of the du Pont family.\n\nThe century-old house was built in 1923 by du Pont's father. The mansion has 11 bedrooms for family members and six for live-in employees. Walls are lined with paintings by family friends, like Maxfield Parrish, and Rembrandt Peale's original painting of DuPont founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours hangs over a hearth.\n\nDu Pont was proud of an oak-paneled music room, home to an Aeolian pipe organ housed in a chamber below the floor. The music is controlled by a computer, much like a player piano, but sometimes du Pont brought in musicians to play the organ. He enjoyed sharing the organ's music with others.\n\nHe and his wife Barbara also were known for opening the grounds of their estate to local organizations and groups for fundraisers.\n\nA 5K run and walk called Granogue & Bach were held in the 1990s to raise money for Brandywine Baroque. Musicians played Bach compositions for participants at the finish line. In recent years, the Beau Biden Foundation has hosted trail runs on the estate with more than 800 participants.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who attended the run when he was vice president, had raced motorbikes on the estate with Irénée when Biden was serving in the Senate. Biden's sister Valerie once lived on the Granogue property\n\nA passion for car collecting\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal he was a \"motorhead\" and enjoyed collecting motorcycles and automobiles which he stored in his 12-car garage.\n\nOver the years, his collection included everything from a 1980 two-door Chevette hatchback to a 1936 Oldsmobile coupe his father gave him on his 16th birthday.\n\nHe frequently brought his 1918 Cadillac to various events, including Winterthur Museum's annual Point to Point steeplechase races and to the Marshall Steam Museum at Auburn Valley State Park in Yorklyn.\n\nDu Pont found the car at a salvage yard in 1939 when he was a student at Dartmouth College. He said he paid $40 for it and joked he spent as much on immediate repairs. He said the car once was owned by actors Frank Fay and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nDu Pont was known for upholding his family's legacy and served on DuPont's board of directors until 1990 and worked on various projects as a trustee for Wilmington University and Longwood Gardens, the former home of his Uncle Pierre.\n\nDespite the clannish nature of the family, another tradition du Pont had long upheld was never stepping foot on the Nemours estate of Alfred I. du Pont in Rockwood. It was due to a historic rift that happened a few years after cousins Pierre, Alfred and T. Coleman du Pont banded together to buy the DuPont Co. in 1902. Pierre and Alfred had a falling out about control and Alfred lost his role in the company.\n\nWhen Alfred built his Nemours estate, he installed a 10-foot stone wall topped with shards of broken glass to surround the majestic mansion inside. Supposedly, he said he built the wall with the glass shards around his estate “to keep out intruders, mainly of the name of du Pont,” according to Marquis James’s 1941 book \"Alfred I. duPont: The Family Rebel.\"\n\nIrénée Jr. told The News Journal in 2000 that his father was on his brother Pierre's side and gave his children strict instructions to never step foot inside the Nemours gates.\n\nDu Pont obeyed for years, but apparently changed his mind, and in 2008 he told The News Journal \"it's a great place — if you like that kind of thing.\"\n\nHe was predeceased by his eight older sisters; his daughter, Susanne; his son, Irénée du Pont, III; and Barbara, his wife of 77 years.\n\nDu Pont is survived by his daughter-in-law, Eugenie Collison du Pont, and his daughters Irene Light (Tom) of Lime Rock, Connecticut; Cynthia Tobias (Terry) of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; Sally Quinn (Rob) of Winchester, Massachusetts; Grace Engbring (Paul) of Telluride, Colorado; 13 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at a later date. Burial will be private.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nMore Delaware news\n\nMore:Longwood Gardens tucks visitors into a warm flowerbed of Winter Wonder\n\nMore:Fire destroys 113-year-old building in downtown Laurel beyond repair early Wednesday\n\nMore:Open Call: Serafin, Music School a testament to the power of collaboration", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/04/02/a-bucket-list-of-44-delaware-sports-events-for-fans-to-see-experience/72611968007/", "title": "A bucket list of 44 Delaware sports events for fans to see, experience", "text": "Some of us might be a little closer to kicking the bucket than others.\n\nBut putting together and enjoying a “bucket list” of activities to attend, things to see or places to visit before it’s too late is an endeavor anyone can savor.\n\nSports destinations are particularly appealing for those aiming to open their eyes and ears to the best experiences, biggest events and most memorable attractions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/08/30/iowa-caucus-a-brief-history-of-why-iowa-caucuses-are-first-election-2020-dnc-virtual-caucus/2163813001/", "title": "Iowa caucus: The history of why Iowa is first-in-the-nation", "text": "Five months before the July Democratic National Convention, when there’s still snow on the ground, Iowans traditionally gather across the state in school gymnasiums, community centers and other locations to decide who in their party they support for president.\n\nSome other states don't have their primaries until June, a month before the national convention. So why does Iowa start so early? More importantly, out of all the states, why is Iowa first?\n\nThe answer to those questions involves a little bit of pragmatism, a little bit of political conflict, and, these days, a strong desire to stick to tradition.\n\nMore: The Democratic Party is planning to reject Iowa's virtual caucus plan. Here's how we got here.\n\nIowa has almost always held caucuses for presidential selection rather than the primary system used in other states like New Hampshire, which is the second state to vote on presidential picks. But it wasn't always first in the nation.\n\nRoots in the 1960s\n\nAfter the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention, the DNC decided it needed to open up its process to lessen the power of party leaders and involve more grassroots activists. That paved the way for the shake-up that led to Iowa moving to first on the calendar.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Democrats in Iowa said they were frustrated with the state's caucus system, which they felt was run by party bosses and didn't respond to grassroots voices and desires.\n\nChanges to address this problem involved holding separate district and state conventions, which meant that the whole caucus process needed to start earlier.\n\nKathie Obradovich, the Register's opinion editor, speaking for a video about Iowa's caucus history, says that \"the old story is that they figured out how long it would take to print all the paperwork on their elderly mimeograph machine.\"\n\nSo Iowa was first.\n\nWhen did the caucuses become powerful?\n\nThe question remained: Who cared? In 1972, Gary Hart cared. Obradovich recounts the story: \"In the 1972 presidential race, Sen. George McGovern’s campaign was managed by a young political whiz kid named Gary Hart. Hart noticed that Iowa was going to be first in the nation and decided to make a bid here as a way to get (McGovern) a media boost before the New Hampshire primary. It worked.\"\n\nIn 1976, Jimmy Carter replicated McGovern's success. The media paid attention to his performance in Iowa, and it illustrated the caucuses as an important metric of a candidate's strength. Carter went on to become president.\n\nBut Iowa had to fight for its right to be first\n\nHowever, this first-in-the-nation status wasn't set in stone.\n\nPrompted by Carter's reelection loss in 1980, the national Democratic Party theorized that the drawn-out nomination process was more of a hindrance than a help to their party's nominee. They rolled out new rules that would restrict how early any state's nomination processes could be held, but still allowed Iowa to caucus first. At that point, it seemed like everyone was happy.\n\nThen, Vermont moved up the date of its straw poll. In response, New Hampshire made its primary earlier. In defiance of the national party, Iowa chose to move the caucuses earlier than its nationally assigned date to maintain the buffer between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn November of 1983, with the caucuses (whatever their date was to be) soon approaching, state party officials gathered to resolve the disagreement and vote on the official date. Those in favor of the earlier date wanted to preserve both Iowa and New Hampshire's unique roles in the nomination process. Those in favor of the later date wanted the whole process shortened to help the eventual nominee.\n\nThe party leaders voted 20-10 for the earlier date. Iowa's status as first in the nation was, at least for the moment, secured.\n\n\"Today,\" Obradovich said, \"Iowa caucuses are first-in-the-nation mainly because the state insists on remaining first.\"\n\nThe outsized media attention on Iowa means many candidates build their strategies around the early state, seeing those first votes as a way to give them momentum through other states. Barack Obama credits the Iowa caucuses for giving him the initial momentum that propelled him to the White House.\n\nAs long as the state is first, it's seen as the first serious litmus test of a candidate. And as Iowa indicates or influences later success, candidates will keep coming, journalists will keep reporting, and in February, the eyes of the nation will stay on Iowa.\n\nClare Ulmer is a politics reporter for the Register.

He was sworn in to the position Nov. 8.\n\nDelmarva Now spoke with Paddack about his goals as the newest Town Council member and what issues he thinks need to be addressed.\n\nResponses were edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nContinuing to serve the community\n\nWhat made you decide to run for the Ocean City Town Council?\n\nI've lived in Ocean City my entire 28-year career with OCPD. Back in the mid-1990s, I wanted to run for Town Council, but couldn't because I was a policeman. During my career, people reached out to me and really liked me as a policeman. I'm very involved in community organizations, including the Elks Club, the Delmarva Blood Bank and the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nI retired from OCPD after 28 years. I didn't intend to run for Town Council until 2020. But when Wayne Hartman won his primary race in June, that vacated a seat on the Town Council.\n\nI've only ever wanted to be an elected representative in Ocean City because I believe in Ocean City. It's not about ego. I've served in multiple capacities as a policeman on town committees. I've been involved in many different ways, but the catalyst for me was when Wayne Hartman won the primary. That vacated a seat and solidified to me I should run.\n\nThere's a quote from Ann Landers: \"Opportunities are usually disguised as hard work, so most people don't recognize them.\" I believe when we are not successful in life with one endeavor, there will be other opportunities to try again. That's how we become successful leaders in everything we do. So when Wayne vacated that seat, I said, \"This is my opportunity to keep serving.\"\n\nFor the last five years, I policed our southern district on bike patrol with all the downtown and Boardwalk businesses. That gave me a good grasp of the street performer issues and ordinances pertaining to the Boardwalk. I know how to solve problems. The Boardwalk has problems every day, and we try to resolve those issues as quickly as we can. Sometimes it means using interpersonal communication skills and educating people. As a council member, I know I can continue to do that.\n\nFocusing on public safety\n\nAs the newest Town Council member, what are some of your goals?\n\nMy involvement with the Ocean City government is not my first rodeo. I was president of the Fraternal Order of Police for 10 years during a very tumultuous time period. Eventually, I led a referendum to utilize collective bargaining with binding interest arbitration between OCPD and the Town Council. Since then, the five contracts we've negotiated with the town have been amicable and professional.\n\nMy goal is to continue the amicable relationship between the council and all the employees, with an emphasis on public safety. The largest portion of the town's budget is public safety — $32 million a year. As a policeman, I've been involved in every special event the town has operated. I bring knowledge of how to make future events productive for the town, while also improving public safety.\n\nI'm a guy who believes in strict enforcement of the law. I don't endorse shutting down any events. I endorse pursuing avenues in which we can strictly enforce the laws to curtail unwanted behavior from outsiders. This is one of my goals for Ocean City's special events.\n\nAnother goal of mine is to continue to maintain my character and integrity. You hear all politicians talk about transparency — well, I'm not a politician. I'm a policeman, who's going to say what needs to be said.\n\nLeaving a lasting legacy\n\nWhat changes or improvements do you think need to be made to the Town Council?\n\nMy addition brings 57 years of life experience, taking opportunities and leaving a lasting legacy. In 1994, I wrote two $500,000 grants and co-founded the OCPD bike patrol unit. Today, the entire downtown neighborhood and business district is policed by bicycle.\n\nAnother example of my experience is co-founding OCPD's Citizen Police Academy, the longest running open, public dialogue between law enforcement and citizens in Maryland. We've been doing that for 27 years, and it's not going away.\n\nIn my community involvement, I served on the Board of Directors for the Caine Woods Community Association for 10 years. Then I purchased a lot and built a home in Caine Keys II. When I moved there, I was immediately nominated president of that association, where I've served for the last 13 years. I have an intricate personal knowledge of community issues. My learning curve is small. It's not my first rodeo, and I've hit the ground running from day one.\n\nNavigating the offshore wind energy issue\n\nWhat are some important issues you think need to be addressed?\n\nThe first issue is the tax differential between the town and the county. We need to come to an agreement that's not so adversarial, but cohesive in achieving our goal. Do I have an answer for this issue? No, I need to learn more about this.\n\nAnother issue facing us is the wind farm off the coast of Ocean City. That was done at the federal level and approved by the state. What wasn't approved, though, were the larger wind turbines now proposed. The technology wasn't available years ago when the project was being developed. They've taken what were about 260-foot wind turbines, and they're now proposing up to 600- or 800-foot wind turbines. The line of sight from the shore is going to be inhibited by those wind turbines.\n\nThere's also a debate over whether it will either build or destroy the fisheries for recreational and commercial fishermen. Some argue the wind turbines will create reef systems where fish will congregate, while others argue the vibrations from the turbines will drive fish away. That needs to be investigated. I'm a highly trained investigator who looks at things objectively to keep my opinion out of it. When we have the facts, we need to make the right decisions to benefit everyone.\n\nThe other issue is with the dualization of Route 90. If the Route 50 bridge goes down, we only have Route 90 and then Coastal Highway up into Delaware, so the dualization of Route 90 can greatly impact the safety of the town during emergency situations.\n\nHelping others\n\nWhat are you looking forward to most during your time on the Town Council?\n\nI'm looking forward to being able to be me. I like to help people, and I've shown that throughout my career. As a council member, I'm very approachable. I go to a lot of different charitable functions to help generate funds for those who are in need — I've done that my whole career. As a council member, I want to be me. I don't want to be someone I'm not. I'm a leader from one end to the other. I don't ask people to do anything I wouldn't do myself.\n\nContact reporter Sara Swann at (302) 324-7711, sswann@delmarvanow.com or on Twitter @saramswann.\n\nMore:Capt.

Each player had only a 30-minute break between matches, said tournament director Campbell Booth.\n\nThe finals matches were played on Saturday, followed by closing and awards ceremonies.\n\nThe event was sponsored by INAS, the International Association of Sport, a UK-based organization for elite para-athletes with intellectual disability. The tournament, the first one hosted in the United States, was organized by Athletes Without Limits, the United States member organization of INAS.\n\nIntellectual disability is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs mental function and individual functional skills.

AWL founder and president Barry Holman emphasized that the goal of his organization is the development of talent in athletes who might not be adequately served by mainstream programs.\n\n\"We look at the athlete first,\" he said. \"And that's why we say athletes with an intellectual disability, not an intellectually disabled athlete. That's how INAS brands it as well. First and foremost, we are a high-performance sports organization. This is high-performance tennis. You would find the top male players would be playing at the level of (NCAA) Division III college tennis.\"\n\nMore than just tennis\n\nHolman founded AWL in 2009, but the tennis program only debuted in 2014, making the first competitive appearance that year at an international championship for players with intellectual disabilities at the Australian Open.\n\n\"One of the players from Australia has some offers to play for colleges in the U.S.; he's 19 years old. Also a very fast runner, he holds a 53-second 400 meter record. His name is Josh Holloway,\" Holman said.\n\n\"We have a runner in the U.S., Mikey Brannigan, he will probably break the 4-minute mile this year,\" said Holman. \"The disability affects but doesn't define them, and if they didn't have the disability you would be seeing them on the Olympic stage. And some of them I believe you will be seeing on the Olympic stage.\"\n\nINAS tennis tournaments use the International Tennis Federation rulebook, with professional judges certified by the United States Tennis Association. With minor accommodation for cognitive and communicative obstacles, play is the same as in mainstream tennis.\n\n\"Part of our goal in bringing this event to the United States is to give some exposure to it, so that other tennis families, maybe some tennis clubs and coaches might say, 'Hey, I have an athlete who might fit that eligibility (requirement), but I didn't know this opportunity was out there,'\" Holman said.\n\nAustralia's Kelly Wren, the undefeated women's tennis champion, supports this goal.\n\nStarting in Special Olympics as an athlete, she quickly came to the attention of the Australian INAS affiliate. After completing her USTA Junior Development track in coaching, she began coaching children's tennis for Special Olympics International. She met Team USA's Brittany Tagliareni at a tournament in Hilton Head, North Carolina.\n\n\"I saw the potential in her, and thought, 'This (Athletes Without Limits) is for her,' and that's what I said to Barry, she deserves to be here. He gave her the opportunity and she loves it,\" Wren said.\n\nRELATED: Shore woman is global messenger for Special Olympics\n\nWren feels this is an important step for an athlete who is \"different,\" she said. The supportive atmosphere fosters personal development. She cites her high school experience, in which she lacked the self-confidence to know that making mistakes wasn't the end of the world.\n\n\"I don't do this for the money, I do it because I enjoy what I do,\" she said. \"You can't sit back. If you sit back, how are you going to know (if you can do it)? That's really the way I see it, and I think I've given Brittany that gift. (Barry) sees the enjoyment, and he can speak to parents and say, 'Hey, we've got something for you now.'\"\n\nTeam USA coach Jon Sarosiek described the supportive atmosphere and how it encourages the development of these athletes.\n\n\"What we're really trying to do this week is make the process about the process and not about results,\" he said. \"Each player has a specific task to accomplish when they play, none of which include making shots or ultimately winning a match. For instance, can we get the doubles team high-fiving between points? We have a player who gets down on herself, can we have her smile between every single point? Results will come if some of these other processes are followed.\"\n\nWith that type of culture promoted within the training, Sarosiek said it has amazing results for the person and the organization as they try to recruit more players.\n\n\"It's amazing what that sort of culture promotes for that individual person but also for the organization as we try to grow and to get more people playing,\" Sarosiek said.\n\nBooth said Sea Colony was chosen as the venue because it is one of the top 50 tennis resorts in the world. A bonus was that nonprofit Athletes Without Limits was not charged for the use of the facility, he said.\n\nBACKGROUND: Sea Colony's tennis director talks about the vision for the program there\n\nHolman praised the way Sea Colony handled the needs of the tournament.\n\nUnexpected downpours on Thursday and Friday threatened to upset the tournament schedule, but the Tennis Center was able to reschedule other activities, allowing the tournament to continue indoors. Getting back on schedule required trimming the number of matches in the semifinals sets on Friday.\n\nResortQuest, which handles rental arrangements for Sea Colony, provided housing not just for the teams, but also for their families.\n\nHolman said he is looking forward to working with Sea Colony again for future tournaments.\n\nThe medal results for the 2016 INAS Tennis World Championships\n\nMen's Singles\n\nGold: Archie Graham, Australia\n\nSilver: Ondrej Sedlisky, Czech Republic\n\nBronze: Mitchell James, Australia\n\n\n\nWomen's Singles\n\nGold: Hanne Lavreysen, Belgium\n\nSilver: Kelly Wren, Australia\n\nBronze: Brittany Tagliareni, USA\n\nMen's Doubles\n\nGold: Archie Graham/Damian Phillips, Australia\n\nSilver: Josh Holloway/Mitchell James, Australia\n\nBronze: Jakob Jerholt/ONdrej Sedlisky, Czech republic\n\nWomen's Doubles\n\nGold: Hanne Lavreysen/Leis Geilis, Belgium\n\nSilver: Kelly Wren/Carla Lenarduzzi, Australia\n\nBronze: Katherine Richards/Brittany Tagliareni, USA\n\nMixed Doubles\n\nGold: Damian Phillips/Kelly Wren, Australia\n\nSilver: Jochen Fens/Hanne Lavreysen, Belgium\n\nBronze: Archie Graham/Carla Lenarduzzi, Australia\n\nAnother Slam in the books, but where are the U.S. men?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/06/30/delaware-summer-guide-things-to-do-bucket-list-2023/70155073007/", "title": "Do summer like a local with our Delaware Summer of 2023 Bucket List", "text": "We're hyped for a jam-packed, yet relaxing Delaware summer.\n\nFrom New Castle to Slower Lower, there is no shortage of fun to be had from beach to city and everywhere in between.\n\nTo inspire you to make the most of it, we've polled our Delaware Online/The News Journal team to share their bucket list items, the things they are determined to do to maximize their own summer of 2023.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2016/11/08/count-begins-next-president/93416010/", "title": "Trump-Clinton too close to call", "text": "Jessica Masulli Reyes\n\nThe News Journal\n\nDefying most national polls and surprising many, Republican nominee Donald Trump appeared poised to take the presidency early Wednesday morning, although the count was too close to call.\n\nResults were neck-and-neck for much of election night in key battleground states. Trump secured Florida and North Carolina, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won Colorado and Ohio.\n\nBy midnight, election-watchers were still awaiting results in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which could propel either Trump or Clinton to victory.\n\nDerek Reigle, a University of Delaware College Republican studying history and political science, said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" as he watched results pouring in with his father, Hans Reigle, who lost a bid Tuesday for Delaware's lone U.S. Congressional seat.\n\n\"He has a chance to be a fantastic president,\" said Reigle, a first time voter. \"I think he has a chance to bring the nation back together in a way Hillary Clinton couldn't.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nPike Creek resident Diane Codding, 28, a doctoral student and former teacher, disagreed. As of 11:30 p.m., the Clinton supporter said the results were troubling.\n\n\"I'm surprised by the results so far,\" she said. \"They definitely are not what I was expecting.\"\n\nThe margin between the two candidates was thin in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nIn Delaware, the election results were more definitive with Clinton garnering about 53 percent of the vote. Trump got about 42 percent, according to unofficial election results from all districts.\n\nEven though Trump lost in Delaware, Rob Arlett, his campaign's state chair, said the vote was strong, more than it had been for a Republican candidate since 1988.\n\n\"We are very proud,\" he said. \"I'm not surprised because we've always known that there has been a silent majority that has existed throughout the country and even here in Delaware.\"\n\nPolls closed at 8 p.m. in Delaware, after being busy, orderly and even somber for most of the day.\n\nThe months of campaigning – scarred at times by email scandals and sexual assault commentary and energized other days by messages of hope – came to a quick end, but then dragged on as election results teetered across the nation. Many Delawareans casting their ballots said that end of the campaign cannot come soon enough.\n\n\"It's been crazy, I think. Ugly, divisive and we don't have any good choices,\" 59-year-old Jim Gray said after he cast his ballot as polls opened at Hodgson Vocational-Technical High School in Glasgow.\n\nGray added that he was looking forward to an end of political commercials.\n\n\"I'm tired of the ads,\" he said.\n\nMillennials could decide presidential race\n\nUnofficial poll watchers won't be allowed inside voting sites\n\nFor University of Delaware sophomore Shivam Amin, his first time voting in a presidential election was about choosing the candidate he disliked less.\n\n\"To this day, looking at both candidates, I don't even want to vote,\" he said at A.I. du Pont High School, where Vice President Joe Biden voted.\n\nBut national security weighed heavily on his mind. When it came time to send his absentee ballot to New Jersey, Amin, who is Hindu, voted for Trump. He sided with his father who sells furniture, detests Obamacare and hopes a businessman with no political background can get the country back on track.\n\n\"Whoever wins there will be riots in the streets,\" Amin predicted.\n\nDespite the scandals\n\nMost polls leading into Tuesday night showed Clinton with a slight edge over Trump. But faith in those polls wavered Tuesday night as the Trump lead grew.\n\n\"Polls are a guesstimation,\" Arlett said.\n\n\"It appears the people are speaking very loud and very clear throughout the country, and people want change.\"\n\nBoth candidates spent the last weeks heavily courting voters in key battleground states. Arlett said he grew tired of the ugliness of the final stretch.\n\nIn October, a leaked tape from \"Access Hollywood\" showed Trump and Billy Bush bragging about sexual assault in 2005. The release caused Trump's numbers to plummet.\n\nThen, Clinton's campaign was hurt after FBI director James Comey announced that the agency would consider additional emails in the investigation against her. Comey told Congress on Sunday that the agency stands by its recommendation not to file charges against Clinton.\n\nThese issues weighed heavily on voters in Delaware on Tuesday.\n\nClinton supporters said she was the most experienced, and ready for the presidency – despite the scandals that peppered her campaign.\n\n\"Other people have had similar situations,\" said Anne Allen, 72 of Bethany Beach. \"It's easy to blow things out of proportion and that is what this campaign has been all about, blowing things out of proportion. But America cannot forget about the big issues that got swept under the rug.\"\n\nRoxann Koren, 63, and Cathy Ferraro, 56, both of Ocean View were in favor of Trump. The women set up a folding card table outside the Roxana Fire Hall in Frankford, and handed out Trump signs, stickers and homemade cake to those who voted for him.\n\n\"Trump is going to make our country safe, secure and great again,\" said Koren.\n\n\"And he's not going to let people who are not willing to work hard sponge off the country any longer,\" added Ferraro. \"Trump is going to get people off the streets and back to work.\"\n\nSome voters left the parking lot feeling indifferent.\n\nTerrie Burns, 43 of Bethany Beach, said she was \"embarrassed for everyone.\"\n\nVoters turnout\n\nReports from polling locations around the state indicated long lines. About 65 percent of the state turned out to vote, which is consistent with the 2012 race in which President Barack Obama secured his re-election.\n\nVoter traffic was so heavy at Cheswold Fire Hall, a polling station for four election districts, that a town police officer had to be deployed to serve as a crossing guard. About 200 people were lined up when the polling site opened at 7 a.m., according to election workers.\n\nThe steady stream of voters heading into the polling site were greeted by state Rep. Trey Paradee, D-Cheswold, and his dog, Teddy. Paradee, who faced a challenge from Republican Janice Gallagher, was joined early Tuesday afternoon by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, who ran unopposed in the General Election.\n\nEmmanuel Chenny, 24, cast his ballot for Clinton at the busy polling station.\n\n\"I had some time to look over the candidates so I feel pretty confident,\" he said. \"She has the most experience. She was in the Senate for a good amount of time and was secretary of state.\"\n\nChenny said health care was the biggest issue for him.\n\n\"I think it's important,\" he said. \"And I want her to continue what President Obama already started.\"\n\nChenny, who voted in just his second presidential election, said he believes the nation will be able to get over the division that has defined this election.\n\n\"Everything has built up to this point,\" he said. \"But I think we'll be able to get over it just like we do after every election.\n\nSusanne Coggins, 66, said that for her the choice was \"simple and clear.\" The retired elementary school teacher cast her ballot for Trump, saying he identified some important problems that exist in the federal government.\n\n\"Hillary is just someone I could never vote for,\" she said. \"She represents the bad guys -- the establishment. We just need a change.\"\n\nCoggins said she was not concerned by Trump's shoot-from-the-hip rhetoric.\n\n\"Did he say some stupid stuff? Yes. Do we all say stupid stuff? Yes,\" she said. \"I think he grew a little like we all do.\"\n\nOn the edge – until the last minute\n\nDeborah Hilyard said she was torn by her choices for president after casting her ballot at the Milton Fire Hall.\n\n\"I want to throw up,\" she said. \"I don't know how they allowed those two to be the ones we had to pick from. But what are you going to do? You pick the one you think is going to do the less harm.\"\n\nGiven that criteria, Hilyard settled on Trump.\n\n\"I've always registered Democrat, but this year I'm saying no to someone I think is more corrupt than anyone and has no right to be in that office,\" she said, adding that she voted a straight Republican ticket because she wants to get a \"new breeze coming in.\"\n\n\"I'm sick of Hillary Clinton spewing all that ilk,\" she said. \"She's using all that stuff that isn't true and it's been proven that it isn't true. I'm sure Trump is no better, but I haven't seen too much of his commercials that are being dirty against Clinton. He's just stating facts.\"\n\nCathy Raffle, 70, said she hopes to God she made the right choice by voting for Clinton at Brittingham Elementary.\n\nThe retiree said she was a Trump supporter right up until he allegedly mocked a Washington Post reporter who has arthrogryposis, which limits the functioning of his joints.\n\n\"I have friends that have disabled children,\" she said. \"That changed my mind.\"\n\nRaffle said she liked Bill Clinton when he served as president and has faith in Clinton's knowledge of foreign affairs.\n\n\"She can't be that bad,\" she said, adding that she's relieved the election is nearly over. \"They're both good candidates. She's been in there so long and Trump might be a great businessman, but does he know anything about politics?\"\n\nIn Harrington, the site of the big Donald Trump rally earlier this year, most residents seemed to be seeing red, as in Republican red.\n\nBarbara Bullock, who was on her way to Bible study after voting, said she is glad the election is nearly over.\n\n“I can’t wait to see the results. There needs to be changes,” she said. “I’m not a Trump lover because I support (Ted) Cruz, but I can’t do Clinton. Not another one.”\n\nErwin Rogers, who has lived in town for more than 50 years, was one of the first to cast his ballot when the Harrington Fire Hall opened at 7 a.m. on Tuesday. Known in Harrington as the guy who tools around town on his three-wheel bike, the 72-year-old Rogers was at the fire hall Tuesday.\n\n“I take pride in voting. Everybody should vote,” he said. “I’ve always been a Republican. I definitely voted for Donald Trump today. He knows what he is doing. If anyone can help this nation be great again, it’s Trump. Hopefully he can bring things back to where they once were.”\n\nOutten said that he hopes there will be a lot of surprises in a state that has historically been Democratic.\n\n“I think you’ll see more seats taken by Republicans in this election,” Outten said. “We’re looking for some surprises today.”\n\nNew voters fired up\n\nVoting was a new experience for some Tuesday, whether they were coming of age or have just become citizens.\n\nFirst time voter, Varyan Thomas, called the entire process a \"roller coaster.\"\n\n\"It's kind of nerve-racking for being a first time voter,\" Thomas said as he left the Elsemere Fire Company where he voted Tuesday morning. \"I was like 'I don't want to vote for the wrong person.' \"\n\nThe 18-year-old Elsmere resident said he was undecided until a couple of weeks ago for who he would be voting for.\n\nIn the end, Thomas said \"this election was fun.\"\n\nCompared to other quiet voting places, The Elks Lodge in Dover had a carnival-like feel Tuesday around 11 a.m. when an election official shouted, “We have a first-time voter here,” to the applause of most everyone in the large hall.\n\nNoticeably embarrassed, yet beaming, Didine Cajuste of Dover kept repeating how proud she was to have voted for the first time.\n\n\"I’m so excited and so happy right now,” said the Haitian immigrant, who in 2013 became a U.S. citizen. “It’s my time to vote. I was just able to take place in one of the most important American traditions and I am just so proud.”\n\nA few moments earlier, another first-time voter had been recognized. Lischen Toloe of Dover said that she had never taken part in the tradition and was proud of herself for doing so.\n\n“I’ve never felt so proud,” she said as her friend Aaron Nehlar took a photo of her outside the Elks Lodge. “I just exercised my right as an American citizen in a free country for the first time. It was an amazing experience.”\n\nToloe said now that she had voted, she was going to show people her “I Voted” sticker and make sure they vote, too.\n\nA return to civility\n\nWith the election almost over, many voters said they hope the nation can come together once the results are in.\n\nDianne Miller, 62, brought her daughter Micaela Miller, 21, to Brittingham Elementary in Milton to cast her first ballot in a presidential election. Both women said the choice fore president was clear. They both voted for Clinton.\n\n\"I couldn't say I was in love with anyone, but I definitely knew who I wanted to vote for,\" Micaela said. \"Hillary is pro-choice. She for equal rights and equal pay for women. She's defending our democracy by being inclusive of everyone and not turning her back against people who want to come to this country to make a better life for themselves.\"\n\nDianne called the current campaign the most contentious of any presidential election she's witnessed, but said she has faith the nation will be able to unite behind the winner.\n\n\"I think it's in our history,\" she said.\n\nMicaela said she thinks it will take time.\n\n\"There's too much hate rhetoric going around,\" the international relations major at University of Delaware said. \"I don't think it will go away immediately.\"\n\nMarvin Phillips, a 44-year-old correctional officer, declined to say which presidential candidate got his vote, although he expressed some concerns that so many of the political signs leading to the polling station were for Trump.\n\n\"I wonder why is that,\" he said. \"That probably tells you how I leaned.\"\n\nPhillips said he's just looking forward to getting the election over with.\n\n\"It was just a nasty fight,\" he said. \"No one said what they're going to do as far as changes. To me, it seemed like they were just attacking each other and I don't think that's good for the younger generation coming up to see that.\"\n\nNews Journal reporters Esteban Parra, Scott Goss, Jerry Smith, Margie Fishman, Karl Baker and staff member Karen Okamoto and DelmarvaNow.com staff members Ryan Marshall and Hannah Carroll contributed to this report.\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at 302-324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @JessicaMasulli.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/07/12/race-colors-students-lives-despite-similarities/5389661002/", "title": "Same school, similar achievements, different skin: How race colors ...", "text": "WILMINGTON, Del. – As a kid, Omar Chatt could never wrap his head around why Rosa Parks wasn’t allowed to sit near white passengers on the bus.\n\nRace was an occasional conversation topic among Omar and his parents, coming up only when his class reached the annual Black history lesson.\n\nThe realities of race gained new focus when he got his license. He was learning to drive, but he was also learning how to interact with police if he got pulled over.\n\n“You have to stay still. You can’t be moving,” Omar said. “Seeing the blue and red lights, my heart is pounding. You think to yourself, ‘Wow, is this going to be my last moment?’ I get scared, but I just remain calm and say a prayer, ‘Lord, be with me now.’ ”\n\nWill Rhodunda grew up being told police officers were the good guys, always to be trusted if he was in danger.\n\n“When I started to be home alone, I was always told, if something is wrong, or there’s somebody at our house that’s not supposed to be, to call the cops,” Will said. “I’ve always trusted the police.\n\n\"I’ve woken up over the past couple of weeks to the fact that not everybody feels that way.”\n\nIn many ways, the high school lives of Omar and Will mirror one another. They each earned good grades at Concord High School in Wilmington, Delaware. Their schedules were filled with after-school activities, and both served stints as student council president.\n\nThey are both bound for college, graduating at a fraught time in the world as the country faces the uncertainties of a pandemic and a reckoning over its history of racism.\n\nAt 18, watching news of protests and police brutality through their phones, Omar and Will have a heightened awareness that no matter their similarities, the world sees them differently.\n\nOmar is Black, Will is white.\n\nOmar scrolls through social media videos of Black people getting arrested or killed, terrified that he or his family members could be next.\n\nWill watches as police officers in riot gear confront protesters, pushing him to confront his own white identity.\n\nSince the death of George Floyd on May 25, the nation has been reeling. Omar and Will search for answers, reading whatever they can get their hands on to fill in the gaps in their education on race.\n\nThey’re processing the confusion and anger of watching the country argue over race and police violence. They both reached the same conclusion.\n\nSomething in this country needs to change.\n\nBut like so many other Americans, they don’t know how to get there.\n\nLessons about race\n\nLiving on Wilmington’s east side with his parents, grandmother and four brothers and sisters, Omar remembers a dirt bike and the handful of times people attempted to steal it; an alleyway that would get broken into; and the drug sales that went on in clear sight in front of his house.\n\nHe and his grandmother witnessed a man getting shot while on their walk home.\n\n“Little things like that. It wasn’t a nice neighborhood,” he said. “It definitely shaped me a lot as a person. And a lot of people would never expect where I came from at all. You would never know unless I told you.”\n\nNow, the Chatts live in a North Wilmington home near Wilmington Hospital.\n\nAfter a concussion in ninth grade ended his time on the wrestling team, Omar threw himself into other school clubs.\n\nHe joined student council, serving as president his senior year, and represented Concord students on the district-level council. He volunteered to serve meals at the Emmanuel Dining room and played tuba all through high school.\n\nOmar started thinking more seriously about race and politics when Donald Trump was elected president. Suddenly, teens were arguing in the comments of Instagram posts over something the president said or tweeted.\n\nA 'moral obligation':Milwaukee pushes to end hyper segregation in schools\n\nHe started noticing quieter moments of racism as he moved through high school.\n\nWhite students would casually drop the n-word in songs or conversation, claiming to have said it “by accident.”\n\nWhen he worked in the front office, he noticed more Black students were written up than white students. (Nationally, a body of research reflects his observations: Black students are much more likely to be suspended or arrested in school.)\n\nOmar asked his band director if the band could play works by more diverse composers, particularly for Black History Month. At first, he said, the director seemed dismissive of his request, but after more vocal complaints from Omar, the director came around.\n\nOmar knows he has more to learn about Black history and race in America. He learned about the Rodney King riots only a few days after hearing about Floyd’s death. He said some of his peers are even more in the dark when it comes to police brutality against Black Americans.\n\n“I have friends who are like, ‘This is the first time this has happened,’ ” Omar said. “No, the stuff we’re seeing today is stuff we’ve seen since the ’50s and ’60s. In our schools, we learn about Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks. But we don’t really get into detail about these subjects. How about you teach me what happened in the past, so we can be better off in the future?”\n\n‘People don’t give a second look’\n\nFive years ago, Will attended what he thought would be a normal baseball game. As he watched the Baltimore Orioles play the Boston Red Sox, riots unfolded outside the stadium after the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of police.\n\nThat moment, timed with Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protest during the national anthem, was when Will said he came face to face with his shallow understanding of race in America.\n\nWill grew up a 10-minute drive from Concord High in a neighborhood filled with manicured green lawns and neighbors who always greet each other on the street.\n\nHe’s lived in the house his whole life where his parents provided him a comfortable life growing up. He said he has never felt unsafe walking out of his home.\n\n“People don’t question when I walk places at night if I’m doing something suspicious. People will always smile at me when I wave to them,” he said. “I feel like that’s how white privilege is, people don’t give a second look.”\n\nHe first saw the video of police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck on Instagram. Will was disgusted, but he wanted to know the full story before passing judgment. As more details emerged, he felt “confusion, sadness and anger all around.”\n\n“I was just embarrassed that as a white person, we have to be associated with someone who does something that harmful to another person,” he said.\n\nWill watched as his social media feeds filled with posts about Black Lives Matter and violent protests across the country.\n\nFriends on Instagram proclaimed they would end friendships with those who don’t support Black Lives Matter. Others accused those who stayed silent on social media of being complicit in the face of racism.\n\nHe worries that the outpouring of awareness online will be temporary and has noticed that people are less vocal than they were a few weeks ago.\n\n“I definitely think there’s a pressure for you to post things,” he said. \"If you’re not posting things, people are saying, ‘What the heck is wrong with you?’ ”\n\n'They're watching'\n\nMuch like the protests Will saw in Baltimore, thousands marched through Wilmington and other Delaware cities in the weeks after Floyd’s death.\n\nOn May 30, protesters moved through Wilmington’s downtown streets, chanting the rallying cries of “No justice, no peace,” and “Black lives matter,” taking over I-95.\n\nAs day turned to night, lingering protesters smashed the windows of Market Street businesses, and police in riot gear ordered people off the streets.\n\nNeither Will nor Omar attended a protest that weekend, but they saw the day unfold through social media. Confused and upset, they turned to their senior English teacher, Julia Overly.\n\nCombating hate crimes, speech:More school districts push to address systemic racism\n\nIn the weeks since the protests shook Wilmington, Overly has fielded calls and texts from dozens of current and former students, all trying to get a sense of what is going on.\n\nWill and Omar were eager to keep reading and learning into the summer.\n\n“People assume teens are just into their phones and their sneakers,” Overly said. “No, teens are extremely passionate. They are emotional. But they lack the deeper history and life experience to fully process those feelings. They are much more socially aware with this topic than I think people give them credit for. They’re involved. They’re watching.”\n\nThe day after protesters marched through Wilmington, the Concord community gathered on the sidewalks as the class of 2020 paraded to the high school parking lot.\n\nWill and Omar drove through the suburban streets with their classmates, waving at teachers and neighbors cheering them on with signs and balloons. It had been months since they’d seen their friends in person, after their typical high school lives ended abruptly on a Friday in March.\n\nIt was a happy occasion in the moment, the culmination of 13 years of schooling. In the fall, they’ll both head off to college – Omar attending the University of Delaware to study biology and Will majoring in international business at Elizabethtown College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nFor the two graduates, celebrating that sunny morning also felt strange, almost wrong, as the realities of the world loomed in their heads and on nearby streets.\n\n“Seeing all my friends, it was the happiest we’ve all been in the past three months,” Will said. “We were all so happy, when there are people getting hurt and protesting the injustice in our country. I wish everyone could be as happy as we were that day.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/outdoors/2014/07/23/asheville-running-goes-boom-new-stores-months/13072271/", "title": "Asheville running goes boom: 2 new stores in 2 months", "text": "Karen Chávez\n\nASHEVILLE – Randy Ashley once ran so fast, he ran right into the future by opening a running store about a decade ahead of its time.\n\nA two-time Olympic Marathon Trials qualifier, Ashley, 48, thinks the rest of Asheville has caught up with him by now. He will be the general manager of the Asheville Running Co., a new shop set to open in mid-September in the Pink Dog Creative building in the River Arts District, at a time when running is more popular than ever, and Americans are spending billions on running shoes and gear.\n\nAsheville Running Co. is one of two new running specialty shops set to open this summer, adding more competition than ever to Asheville’s running retail scene — a decade after Ashley’s one-time running shop, Tortoise and Hare, went out of business.\n\nAshley and Asheville trail running champion Mark Lundblad ran Tortoise and Hare in Biltmore Park from 2002-2004, at a time when Long Shoals was just a two-lane road, and before the YMCA was a fixture in the now-booming residential and retail neighborhood in South Asheville.\n\nIt was just down the block from where Fleet Feet, another new running retail running store, will open Aug. 15, next door to Charming Charlie’s and across from the Loft.\n\n“Tortoise and Hare was just a little ahead of its time. I like to think of myself as a visionary,” Ashley joked.\n\nBut his new venture, owned by North Asheville residents Judi and Dan Foy, is no joke. Ashley — who coached cross country and track at Asheville School for 10 years, directed many area races, including the 10-mile Sunset Stampede, and worked in retail for Foot Rx Running — said he has done his running research, and the River Arts District is the place to be for running.\n\n“I’ve felt like the River Arts, there’s something new to be done in the area, there’s an energy, with New Belgium coming in,” Ashley said of the mega brewery that plans to open next year on Craven Street.\n\n“I’ve got a fantastic support and an incredibly good business model. Western North Carolina is as big as Massachusetts. We have over 20 bike shops, and two running shops. But there’s seven runners for every cyclist — it’s not difficult from a business perspective to see this makes sense.”\n\nColorful running\n\nNo one knows exactly how many runners there are in Asheville, but you don’t need to strain your neck to see runners at most intersections of downtown, North Asheville and the River Arts District on any given day — or to see a 5K on any given weekend on the city streets or in one of the area parks.\n\nThe River Arts District, built in the river valley, is one of the most sought-after spots for runners and races because of its flat terrain, in contrast to other notoriously hilly parts of town.\n\nWhile the city lost its biggest single 5K, the Bele Chere 5K, along with the music festival, which was traditionally held this weekend and drew some 1,500 runners each year, it scored with the Color Run 5K, to be held this Saturday.\n\nThe untimed race, starting and ending at the downtown YMCA, sold out with 7,000 runners, said race director Tabitha Cooper. A new race, the Color Rave Electric Glow Run, is coming to Carrier Park in the RAD Aug. 23. It is being produced by Dennis Miller, of Columbia, S.C., an endurance athlete who founded the Color Rave, also an untimed run.\n\nThe Asheville run will be at night, with runners wearing glow stick necklaces and will be doused in foam and colored cornstarch at various points. Miller said he hopes to have 1,500 runners at this first-time event and chose Asheville for its healthy, active lifestyle population.\n\n“I want to spread the happy and encourage people to get healthy. That’s what the Color Rave is all about,” Miller said.\n\nOther area races, including the IDES Hot Chocolate 10K in January, the Jus’ Running Turkey Trot 5K on Thanksgiving Day and the inaugural Asheville Half Marathon in June, bring in close to 2,000 runners per race. Many smaller 5Ks dot the landscape each weekend.\n\nThe region has a strong contingent of high school and college runners, is home to the world headquarters of Chi Running and its founder, Danny Dreyer, and many clubs, training programs and more informal groups.\n\nRunning high\n\nBut are there enough everyday runners to support at least five area running stores? Jus’ Running, the grandfather of area running shops, on Merrimon Avenue in North Asheville, opened in the late 1990s, in the midst of the country’s “second running boom,” that took off after the 1970s.\n\nFoot Rx Running opened in South Asheville in 2007, Black Mountain Running Co. opened on the outskirts of town in 2011 and in between many other stores have gotten into running shoe and apparel — including Diamond Brand Outdoors in Arden (which will open another store near the Fresh Market on Hendersonville Road), REI in Biltmore Park, Lululemon in Biltmore Village and Dick’s Sporting Goods, with locations on Tunnel Road and a new one on Airport Road.\n\nAccording to the National Sporting Goods Association, participation in running is booming, as is as the amount people are willing to spend on running shoes and apparel.\n\nAcross the country, total running participation (people who ran at least 6 days of the year) since 2004 has increased 70 percent to a record of nearly 42 million, according to the NSGA. The group says frequent runners, or those who run at least 110 days a year, number about 9.9 million. More women (who tend to spend more on running outfits) run than men, with some 22 million women running in 2012, according to the NSGA.\n\nRunning shoe sales totaled $3.09 billion in 2013, up 2 percent from the previous year. For 2014, sales are projected to grow an additional 7 percent to approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nIf you can dig in to the runner market, it’s a good one. According to the 2013 National Runner Survey, conducted every two years by Running USA, core runners — active adult participants who tend to enter running events and train year-round — are highly educated and have higher than average incomes.\n\nThe survey showed nearly 76 percent of core runners earned a college diploma (compared with 30 percent of overall U.S. adults) and some 73 percent report a household income of more than $75,000 (compared with U.S. median of $52,700).\n\nThe NSGA survey showed several states in the Southeast region had the highest number of runners, with 7.8 million people taking to running in Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware.\n\nHow that shakes out for Asheville is harder to quantify, however.\n\nPushing for local loyalty\n\nNorm Blair, who bought Jus’ Running in 2002, said looks can be deceiving and the city’s consumer tread is wearing thin as it is.\n\n“I’m not sure the town population can support four running stores, plus REI, Diamond Brand, a new Dick’s on Airport Road. That’s going to make it very tough,” said Blair, an Asheville native who ran for Roberson High and at Appalachian State, then coached for many years at Roberson and was once a professional runner.\n\nHe is the race director of the infamous Shut-In Ridge Trail Run, an 18-mile race from the N.C. Arboretum to Mount Pisgah, as well at the Turkey Trot 5K, one of the region’s most popular races.\n\n“There is an illusion that Asheville and this area are really growing population wise. What’s going to happen is with the number of shops, somebody is going to go out. It’s not that big an area. Even though people are upbeat about jobs in the area, it’s a very small amount. Most of the jobs being created are in hospitality.”\n\nBlair said Jus’ Running is a niche specialty store. He has two full-time employees and half a dozen part-timers, who are all experts on running gear, running know-how and knowing where to run. He said the local knowledge base, and the community involvement — he sponsors dozens of other runs and events throughout the year — are what he knows will keep customers coming.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing what we do — fitting shoes and answering questions. There’s no need to change anything. We just need to keep doing what we’re good at. Fleet Feet is a corporate store. They don’t know running to the extent that my people know running.”\n\nShawna Spencer, who will be manager of Fleet Feet with partner Mark Scott, who is the store operator, said they are both relatively new to the area but will be learning and growing with the community. She said the store, which is one of 120 Fleet Feet stores nationwide, headquartered in Carrboro, will be selling athletic lifestyle clothing and gear, including yoga gear.\n\nSpencer, 33, is a runner and cyclist who is coming from a background as a child abuse specialist, and Scott, 32, has a business degree and has operated a New Balance shoe store.\n\n“We were lucky enough to hand-pick a place where we wanted to live and have a business,” Spencer said. “We knew there were two running stores, but actually that’s very few for the population of area. I’m optimistic. Our mentality is not to become a competitive experience, but a partnership. It will probably take a little bit of time, but we hope to build and grow the unity of the running community and not have it be negative.”\n\nPete Nielsen, a trail runner who just retired from the N.C. State Highway Patrol, said runners are excited about the new stores. He just took a job as a fit specialist and will lead group runs from Fleet Feet.\n\n“I grew up going to Norm and Jus’ Running. They’re not right next door to us — we’re closer to Arboretum and trail runs. I think we’lll all support each other,” Nielsen said.\n\n‘We put a lot back’\n\nJohn Blexrud, president of the Asheville Track Club, said competition in retail is good for the individual runner, although he can see it would be tough on store owners.\n\n“Retail is a tough business, no matter how you cut it,” Blexrud said. “It will come down to who can offer loyalty among their customers with the things they are looking for — good selection and good prices. Are there are enough runners to support all this? I don’t know, but getting more beginning runners involved is the key.”\n\nFleet Feet has already gotten into the community- and beginning-runner spirit, Spencer said, by sponsoring the inaugural Race to the Brewery at Highland Brewer a couple of weeks ago, and also started a free, 12-week beginning runner clinic last week.\n\nSpencer is coaching the “couch to 5K” group, partnering with CarePartners. She is certified in Good Form Running, an injury prevention style of running through New Balance.\n\nScott Socha, owns Foot Rx Running on Hendersonville Road in South Asheville with Aaron Saft and Jamie Dick as a retail store and pedorthic clinic, agrees with Blair that the arrival of two running shops within a month might be overload for the community.\n\nThe independent Foot Rx is heavily invested in the community, Socha said, so much so he can’t even count how many races and events they sponsor each year. They hold group runs, clinics, ladies nights (with speakers and discounts for female runners) and $5 5K races at Fletcher Community Park, where all the money goes back to participants in the form of prizes.\n\n“Our idea and execution has been in large shaped by the Asheville community. Especially with our devotion to trail running,” Socha said. “We are a here to help anyone move in more comfort and health. Our focus expands beyond running although it is our roots. We bring low cost high service to running shoes and orthotics. We put a lot back into the community.”\n\nAshley, who worked at Foot Rx for several years, said he’s not looking to step on anyone’s toes, and thinks all the shops can find a footing in the Asheville market.\n\n“We want to capitalize on the tourism market and the local scene and athlete community that has grown here through running and trail running and even CrossFit,” Ashley said. “The running scene has essentially blown up in all positive ways. Not only has our population increased, we’re getting a younger crowd of people moving here who are active. Doctors move here with boat racks and bike racks and running shoes to go along with their profession.”\n\nHe said the RAD is becoming an outdoors destination all its own. The city and county have plans for a greenway to expand the existing pathway up to North Asheville. For the past four decades, the RAD has been home to the Asheville Outdoors Center on Amboy Road, a canoe and kayak rental business.\n\nStuart Cowles is building a new climbing gym called the Smoky Mountain Adventure Center, just down the road from AOC, and Carrier Park is home to the annual three-day Mountain Sports Festival, as well as countless 5K races, biking events such as last weekend’s Mellowdrom Criterium, and other outdoor competitions.\n\nAshley has a 14-year-old son and has been married for seven years to Amanda Chase, a former competitive runner whom Ashley once coached for the Olympic Trials in 800-meter and 1500-meter. Ashley himself qualified for the Olympic Marathon Trials in 1996 in Charlotte and 2000 in Pittsburgh by running a marathon in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 24 seconds, but said he is now more tuned in to the mind of the average runner.\n\n“The competitive runners are not the market you want to go after. You want the people who want to get into a lifestyle.,” he said.\n\nBUNCOMBE RUNNING STORES\n\n• Jus’ Running, 523 Merrimon Ave., Asheville, opened in 1998, 252-7867, www.jusrunning.com\n\n• Foot Rx Running, 1979 Hendersonville Road, Asheville, opened in 2007, 687-2825, www.footrxasheville.com\n\n• Black Mountain Running Co., 106 W.

The internet gives us more opportunity to be exposed to noteworthy terrors from other countries. And especially recently, there's been an artful bent to horror that allows newer filmmakers such as Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\") and Ari Aster (\"Hereditary\") to make vital and important films that may also leave you in a fetal position.\n\nBecause Halloween is upon us and you might be in the need of a good freakout, here are the 75 best horror films of this century, definitively ranked.

That is, until he accidentally witnesses her demonic cult of high schoolers engage in a blood sacrifice in his living room in the Netflix horror comedy.\n\n74. 'The Blackcoat's Daughter' (2015)\n\nOsgood Perkins (the spawn of \"Psycho\" horror icon Anthony Perkins) crafts this dark and twisty narrative revolving around two boarding school girls (Lucy Boynton and Kiernan Shipka), an escapee (Emma Roberts) from a mental asylum and the murderous demon that connects them all.\n\n73. 'I Trapped the Devil' (2019)\n\nA Christmas visit between two brothers turns dark and surreal when one says he's got a man locked in his basement and claims the dude is the devil. (Fun fact: \"This Is Us\" star Chris Sullivan is the voice of the guy downstairs in this moody creep show.)\n\n72. 'The Guest' (2014)\n\nIn this thriller with a rad '80s vibe, Dan Stevens plays a charismatic soldier who shows up on a family's doorstep claiming to be the best friend of their son who died in Afghanistan, and Maika Monroe is the grieving sister who has reason to be skeptical.\n\n71. 'The Mist' (2007)\n\nHow do you make a Stephen King novella even more bleak? Put it in the hands of director Frank Darabont, who adapts the story of small-town Maine folks stuck in a supermarket thanks to a mysterious mist and monstrous hidden creatures.\n\n70. 'The Lighthouse' (2019)\n\nWillem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson play a pair of 19th-century New England lighthouse keepers stranded on a remote island due to a storm. Come for the unraveling of manly sanities, stay for Dafoe's farts and a scene-stealing seagull.\n\n69. 'It Comes at Night' (2017)\n\nThe pitch-black psychological thriller centers on survivalists hunkered down in the woods to avoid a deadly virus. They take in a family needing help and that uneasy alliance devolves. Just have \"Ted Lasso\" on hand for a pick-me-up afterward.\n\n68. 'Color Out of Space' (2020)\n\nNicolas Cage goes crazy – not a stretch for him – as a man living an ordinary existence with his wife and two kids when a meteorite lands in his front yard and their minds and bodies are taken over by an alien presence.\n\n67. 'Hush' (2016)\n\nIn director Mike Flanagan's mix of home-invasion terror and slasher picture, Kate Siegel puts a different spin on the usual horror heroine as an author unable to hear or speak but who has plenty of gumption when she's stalked in her home by a masked killer.\n\n66. 'Deathgasm' (2015)\n\nThis one definitely goes to 11: Two teenage rocker dudes – who yearn to add some excitement to their lives – delve into black magic and accidentally conjure a demonic entity known as The Blind One. Which is a very metal thing to do.\n\n65. 'The Purge' (2013)\n\nIn the franchise that's become way too timely for comfort, the first film is tops, with Ethan Hawke trying to keep his family safe from masked maniacs during an all-night legal crime spree.\n\n64. 'Trick 'r Treat' (2007)\n\nThis Halloween treasure features four intertwining tales of mischief and menace. The common thread in the anthology? An enigmatic kid named Sam, wearing pajamas and a sack on his head, who punishes those who break holiday tradition.\n\n63. 'The Lodge' (2020)\n\nPrepare for despair in this literal chiller, which stars Riley Keough as a woman still haunted by her childhood being the only survivor of a religious death cult who gets snowed in and trapped with her fiancé's kids in a remote house.\n\n62. 'The Angry Black Girl and her Monster' (2023)\n\nMary Shelley would be proud: After a teenage girl's big brother is gunned down in a gang shooting, and believing death is just a disease to be cured, the young \"mad scientist\" (Laya DeLeon Hayes) brings him back to life with nightmarish consequences in a timely take on a familiar tale.\n\n61. 'Paranormal Activity' (2009)\n\nThe found-footage and haunted house subgenres went together like peanut butter and jelly in this low-budget chiller that chronicles the demonic threat to a young couple through the always-watchful lens of a home video camera.\n\n60. 'May' (2003)\n\nOne of the more criminally underrated films of the genre, this Frankenstein-esque tale stars Angela Bettis as the title woman, a lonely sort whose sole friend is a doll made by her mom. As May starts to look for more personal connection, and struggles to find it, she decides to craft her own human pal, piece by piece.\n\n59. 'The Ring' (2002)\n\nA cursed videotape that kills anyone who views it seven days later falls into the hands of Naomi Watts for a neat spook show. (Guys, ghost girl Samara is STILL freaking us out.) More importantly, it sparked an American interest in the original \"Ringu\" and other outstanding Asian horror of the time.\n\n58. 'Saint Maud' (2021)\n\nA deeply devout hospice nurse (Morfydd Clark) tries to save her lesbian client's soul and wrestles with her own dark backstory in director Rose Glass' unholy and twisted film. Worth it for one absolutely fiery finale.\n\n57. 'Donnie Darko' (2001)\n\nIs this crazy psychological thriller a horror movie? Jake Gyllenhaal dealing with an aircraft engine falling into his bedroom and interacting with a giant rabbit named Frank – who tells him doomsday's afoot in 28 days – is all the answer you really need.\n\n56. 'The Loved Ones' (2009)\n\nThere are both intriguing character relationships and super-gnarly home medical procedures (lobotomy by electric drill!) to be had when an Australian teenager (Xavier Samuel) turns down the prom proposal of a classmate (Robin McLeavy) and gets an unexpected night to remember.\n\nRanked:The top scary movies of 2023 so far (from 'M3GAN' to 'No One Will Save You')\n\n55. 'Werewolves Within' (2021)\n\nIn a bloody good mix of horror comedy and murder mystery, Sam Richardson plays a naive but good-hearted forest ranger new to a small Vermont town out to catch a killer (who may or may not be a werewolf) among the various kooky residents.\n\n54. 'Halloween' (2018)\n\nThe 11th film featuring machete-wielding masked man Michael Myers rids itself of unneeded previous canon and acts as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 original, pitting the villain vs. the woman (Jamie Lee Curtis) who's waited four decades for a rematch.\n\n53. 'Drag Me to Hell' (2009)\n\nSam Raimi's flick starred Alison Lohman as a loan officer who, wanting to impress her boss, refuses to extend an old gypsy woman's mortgage. Suffice it to say, not the best decision, considering the three nightmarish days that follow. And that title? That's some real truth in advertising.\n\n52. 'REC' (2007)\n\nGot claustrophobia? Then maybe ease gently into this Spanish found-footage chiller. A night news crew enters a building with firefighters called in to help an old woman trapped in her apartment, she gets a little too bitey and, before you know it, zombies everywhere.\n\n51. 'The Boy Behind the Door' (2021)\n\nThose holding out for a young hero will find one in Lonnie Chavis' terrorized kid, who has to rescue his best pal (Ezra Dewey) after they're kidnapped and taken to a strange country house in a survival thriller with a welcome twist.\n\n50. 'VHS' (2012)\n\nUsing a found-footage framing device, the anthology unleashes a bevy of shorts revolving around a second honeymoon gone wrong, a freaky sci-fi story told through video chats, and some pervy dudes who make a deadly mistake recruiting a mysterious young woman for their amateur porn.\n\n49. 'Ju-On: The Grudge' (2004)\n\nNo, not the Sarah Michelle Gellar version. (Come on now.) The original Japanese flick featured a social worker (Megumi Okina) seeing all manner of freaky ghost children in her house. And there's a timeless quality, too, because, well, ghastly kids are always ghastly.\n\n48. 'We Are Still Here' (2015)\n\nSet in 1970s New England, the spin on the haunted house template centers on a couple who moves to a sleepy hamlet following the death of their college-age son and into a place that still contains the dark, ashen souls of the Dagmar family that lived there and a supernatural force that awakens every 30 years.\n\n47. 'Annihilation' (2018)\n\nThis is one heck of a WrestleMania main event: Natalie Portman vs. a mutant bear with a skull head. The nightmarish sci-fi thriller features Portman as part of a science group that investigates a Florida swamp where the fauna has been otherworldly transformed.\n\n46. 'X'/'Pearl' (2022)\n\nYou shouldn't watch one without the other: Start with Ti West's \"X,\" an ode to old-school slashers featuring a 1970s adult-film crew running across a crazy elderly lady on a Texas farm, and chase it with the period prequel \"Pearl,\" the 1918-set origin story starring Mia Goth as a young woman whose need for fame turns murderous.\n\n45. 'Fear Street' trilogy (2021)\n\nThe teen slasher's reinvented yet again, with an eye toward diversity and mythology. A bunch of 1990s kids look into a witch's curse that's affected their town since the 17th century while also trying to stay alive.\n\n44. 'The Conjuring' (2013)\n\nThe fact that paranormal experts Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are folks who dealt with horrors in real life adds to the fear factor of James Wan's franchise starter, which focused on a Rhode Island family, their rundown farmhouse and some witchiness.\n\n43. 'Sinister' (2012)\n\nBefore writer/director Scott Derrickson did a Marvel-ous \"Doctor Strange,\" he went full-on creepy video. Ethan Hawke's true-crime writer finds a box of Super 8 home movies in his attic, playing them and consequently putting his family in grave danger thanks to the appearance of a Babylonian deity named Bughuul.\n\n42. 'The House of the Devil' (2009)\n\nDirector Ti West's ode to 1970s and '80s horror is slow-burn dread. A college student (Jocelin Donahue) gets a baby-sitting offer she can't refuse, which leads to utter satanic insanity for the last 25 minutes. Fun fact: Greta Gerwig shows up in one of her early roles.\n\n41. 'Split' (2017)\n\nWhile it was ultimately revealed as a secret sequel to \"Unbreakable,\" M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller stands on its own, thanks to James McAvoy's troubled Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has more than 20 distinct personalities and kidnaps a girl (Anya Taylor-Joy) who's just as damaged as he is.\n\n40. 'Inside' (2007)\n\nThe French fright fest features a very pregnant widow (Alysson Paradis) who sees her home invaded on Christmas Eve by a mysterious woman in black (Beatrice Dalle) dead set on cutting her baby out with some scissors. Buckle up for fiery mayhem and a \"birthing\" scene that's hard to even fathom.\n\n39. 'The Invitation' (2016)\n\nKaryn Kusama's cult horror comedy \"Jennifer's Body\" was ahead of its time, but the director returned with this twisty treat, which makes the boring dinner party anything but. Logan Marshall-Green stars as a man invited to a shindig by his ex-wife, the revelry goes awry and you're left with jaw on the floor by a whopper of a last scene.\n\n38. 'Goodnight Mommy' (2015)\n\nFull of dread and melancholy, the Austrian import flips the creepy-kid script a bit by centering on two boys (Elias and Lukas Schwarz) who wonder whether their mom (Susanne Wuest), whose head is wrapped in bandages after facial surgery, is actually their mom.\n\n37. 'Don’t Breathe' (2016)\n\nAnother intriguing take on the home-invasion trope has three young robbers wanting fast cash and breaking into the house of a blind Gulf War vet (Stephen Lang) harboring some seriously dark secrets of his own. (You'll never look at a turkey baster the same way ever again. Promise.)\n\n36. 'She Dies Tomorrow' (2020)\n\nA woman believes she's going to die tomorrow, a doom-ridden viral thought that metastasizes among family and friends in this absurdist, unnerving and trippy film. And you thought COVID was contagious!\n\n35. 'A Quiet Place' (2018)\n\nJim from \"The Office\" (aka John Krasinski) scared the pants off pop culture with his dystopian directorial debut, where a family (including Krasinski and real-life wife Emily Blunt) has to stay as quiet as possible in order to avoid being gobbled up by blind alien monsters that target their prey though sound.\n\n34. 'Happy Death Day' (2017)\n\nSo what if it's a slasher-movie \"Groundhog Day\"? The enchanting time-hopper puts a sorority girl (Jessica Rothe) through her paces as she's forced to re-live the same day of getting murdered by a serial killer in a baby mask until she figures out whodunit.\n\n33. 'Barbarian' (2022)\n\nA young researcher (Georgina Campbell) rents a Detroit Airbnb, shows up and discovers it's already occupied by a kind but creepy sort (Bill Skarsgård, aka Pennywise from the recent \"It\" movies). That's all you need to know to buckle up for one wildly unconventional and gleefully grotesque getaway nightmare.\n\n32. 'You’re Next' (2013)\n\nThis funny and vicious tweak of the \"final girl\" trope is an underrated gem starring Sharni Vinson as Erin, an Aussie woman visiting her boyfriend's family reunion. Soon enough, the house is surrounded by dangerous folks in animal masks, but it turns out Erin is more than ready and able for a fight.\n\n31. 'Train to Busan' (2016)\n\nWas the title \"Zombies on a Train\" already taken? An undead apocalypse emerges outside as well as inside a Korean bullet train headed for – you guessed it – Busan, and avoiding infection is a bigger problem for passengers than travel delays. Like \"World War Z\" meets \"Speed,\" in the best way possible.\n\n30. 'Ready or Not' (2019)\n\nThis movie's just so darn enjoyable, and that's maybe not something you expect with buckets of blood, servants getting shot in the head, a catchily kooky Victrola tune and a newlywed bride (Samara Weaving) trying to literally survive a night with her evil in-laws.\n\n29. 'Us' (2019)\n\nJordan Peele weaves in Bible references, metaphorical rabbits and Hands Across America with the story of a family fending off their relentless killer doppelgangers. And look out, Freddy Krueger, because Lupita Nyong'o's Red makes a strong case for sharpest horror villain.\n\n28. 'A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night' (2014)\n\nThere's wonderful originality, a Western bent and style to spare in Ana Lily Amirpour's super-cool black-and-white piece about an Iranian vampire (Sheila Vand) who skateboards around Bad City and attacks men who mistreat women.\n\n27. 'Insidious' (2011)\n\nFor those who never got into James Wan's gory \"Saw\" extravaganzas, the first outing in the haunted house series makes use of old-school scare tactics, plus introduces an interesting interdimensional mythology and Lin Shaye as a kind but determined demonologist.\n\n26. 'Starry Eyes' (2014)\n\nThe deal-with-the-devil nature of Hollywood gets the scary-movie treatment with Alexandra Essoe as a waitress and struggling actress who will do whatever it takes to be a film star. She later realizes the wicked sacrifices, physical and otherwise, that need to be made in the intriguing exploration of power and celebrity.\n\n25. 'Mandy' (2018)\n\nA wacked-out, crazily emotional Nicolas Cage wields axes and a chain saw in heavy-metal fashion as a logger who goes on a fantastical revenge quest against the religious cult that killed his main squeeze. The best part is it's just as awesome watching that all unfold onscreen as it is typing that sentence.\n\n24. 'The Conjuring 2' (2016)\n\nAs good as the original film is, the sequel manages to outdo it with a religious theme and possessed girl a la \"The Exorcist,\" mining a couple of the Warrens' real cases (the Amityville Horror and the Enfield poltergeist) and unleashing some extra ghoulish delights.\n\n23. 'Raw' (2017)\n\nYoungsters navigating growing up and social anxiety have long been horror staples, though this French coming-of-age drama is a cannibalistic one. Garance Marillier stars as a strict vegetarian and vet-school student forced to eat a rabbit kidney, which unlocks a whole new appetite not kosher in most circles.\n\n22. 'Suspiria' (2018)\n\nA rare remake that surpasses the original – in this case, Dario Argento's 1977 classic – in story if not style. The witchy tale of a young rookie (Dakota Johnson) learning a coven secretly runs her famous dance company is one of feminine strength and schlocky carnage.\n\n21. 'A Dark Song' (2017)\n\nA grieving mom (Catherine Walker) mourning her murdered son rents a Welsh house for a black magic ritual and recruits an oddball occultist (Steve Oram) to summon a guardian angel for a mission of revenge. Sure, it's weird and spiteful but also beautiful, thoughtful and surprising.\n\n20. 'What We Do in the Shadows' (2015)\n\nThe lesson of Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's blood-sucking mockumentary? Life's hard out there for a vampire. Hilarity ensues when ancient fanged friends struggle with the hazards of modern living, such as chores and problematic roommates. They're just like us!\n\n19. 'The Invisible Man' (2020)\n\nA classic Universal monster is reinvented in a thoroughly modern manner (with gaslighting!). Elisabeth Moss stars as the abused ex of a wealthy scientist who killed himself, and no one believes her desperate claims that he's haunting her from beyond the grave.\n\n18. 'Midsommar' (2019)\n\nAfter a tragedy, a young woman (Florence Pugh) goes with her boyfriend and his pals to a Swedish summer solstice festival that turns into a kaleidoscope of kooky rituals and isolating dread. The most disturbing acts of folk horror occur in the broad daylight in a film that's honestly the most unsettling breakup movie ever.\n\n17. 'Talk to Me' (2023)\n\nAustralian filmmaking twins Danny and Michael Philippou arrive as the scrappiest young voices in original horror with an unflinching, unforgettable story of partying teens streaming live possessions via an embalmed hand – with ghastly results.\n\n16. 'The Vigil' (2021)\n\nA lapsed Jewish New Yorker (Dave Davis) is hired by his old rabbi to watch the body of a recently deceased community member overnight. Doing a favor for some extra cash turns into a night of demonic torment in a fright fest steeped in lore and historical connections.\n\n15. 'It' (2017)\n\nThe first chapter adapting Stephen King's epic tome introduced cinema to the Losers' Club, a bunch of outcast Maine kids who find acceptance in friendship and, oh, yeah, have to deal with a demonic clown. Bill Skarsgard's creeptastic Pennywise is just the cherry on top of the rich coming-of-age sundae.\n\n14. 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004)\n\nFrom LPs being used as zombie-killing weapons to the best Queen needle drop in movies (sorry, \"Wayne's World\"), Edgar Wright's horror comedy sent up the undead just as they were starting to lumber all over pop culture. Its real secret sauce, though: Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as lovable best friends.\n\n13. 'The Cabin in the Woods' (2012)\n\nName a horror trope and it's referenced in this genre-deconstructing wonder. Heck, there's even a whiteboard that names them all in the clever thriller, which starts with teens venturing to a cabin in the woods before revealing a whole other conceit underneath, metaphorically and literally.\n\n12. 'Let the Right One In' (2008)\n\nThere is an insightful sweetness to the Swedish love story of sorts between a bullied 12-year-old boy and his new friend, a protective female vampire. When she states simply, \"I am not a girl,\" there's a weight and sadness but also understanding behind it.\n\n11. 'The Devil’s Backbone' (2001)\n\nGuillermo del Toro has risen to the annals of horror mastery in recent years, but there's a little bit of a Spielbergian nature to his ghostly tale set in the Spanish Civil War, about an orphan boy seeking the secrets of his school and the dead kid he frequently sees.\n\n10. 'Black Swan' (2010)\n\nIf \"Suspiria\" didn't already prove artistry was hell, the insane world of ballet does the job here. Natalie Portman's main character cracks under the psychological and physical pressures of being a prima ballerina in \"Swan Lake\" and goes dancing on the dark side.\n\n9. 'His House' (2020)\n\nYour mind will be spooked and your heart shattered by this politically relevant take on the haunted-house film. Ṣọpẹ Dìrísù and Wunmi Mosaku are a couple who escape war-torn South Sudan and seek asylum in Britain. But they find weirdness in the walls of their new suburban digs and have to face very personal nightmares.\n\n8. 'It Follows' (2015)\n\nMaika Monroe stars as a young woman who just can't shake a shape-shifting menace who takes different human forms and is a source of constant stress. This isn't an ordinary antagonist, though – in fact, she's hounded by a sexually transmitted curse, a high concept that gives the eerie thriller extraordinary, infectious life.\n\n7. 'The Babadook' (2014)\n\nThings aren't great in the emotionally fraught household of a single mother and a young boy. And it's hard to say what makes things worse: Mom's deteriorating mental state or the appearance of Mr. Babadook, an expressionistic storybook monster with a top hat and intimidating chompers.\n\n6. 'Hereditary' (2018)\n\nAri Aster's disturbing debut would be impressive if you just stop at the spectacular implosion of a loving family and Toni Collette's heartbreaking performance. It rises to all-time status when you factor in all the occult leanings, horrifying imagery and a demon king thrown in for good measure.\n\n5. 'Get Out' (2017)\n\nDaniel Kaluuya's teary, wide-eyed shocked face, as his character enters the abominable Sunken Place courtesy of his white girlfriend's totally evil parents, is one of the most indelible horror-film sights this millennium. And filmmaker Jordan Peele earns instant-classic status with his socially relevant (and totally rousing) tackling of modern racism.\n\n4. 'The Witch' (2016)\n\nThe unnerving look at 17th-century paranoia is seen through the eyes of a young New England teenager (Anya Taylor-Joy). Her baby brother goes mysteriously missing on her watch and she's suspected of witchcraft. Come for the downward spiral of hellish despair, stay for macabre goat Black Phillip and the ominous climax.\n\n3. 'The Wailing' (2016)\n\nGhosts? Check. The undead? Check. Hair-raising possessed kids? Check and check. Over the course of 2½ hours, the Korean masterpiece goes a lot of different places following a bumbling cop worried about his family when a dangerous infection turns his neighbors into monsters.\n\n2. '28 Days Later' (2003)\n\nThe best zombie movie that didn't involve George Romero, period. From the harrowing shot of Cillian Murphy waking from a coma to find a bizarrely deserted London to the rage-filled creatures who run instead of lumber, it bleakly captures post-apocalyptic life in a brutally realistic fashion that other films strive to but just can't.\n\n1. 'Kill List' (2012)\n\nIn Ben Wheatley's brilliant and blistering work, a British soldier returns home and embarks on a career as a hit man, finding strange little details while on his various jobs. Totally sounds like a normal ol' crime thriller, right? Hoo boy, by the end it is not at all, and to reveal anything else would be downright felonious.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/25"}]}

However, we are hopeful that we – the current generation of the Meaher family – can start a new chapter,” said the statement, which came amid the release of “Descendant,” a new documentary about the people who were brought to the United States aboard the slave ship Clotilda and their families. The film was acquired by Netflix and Higher Ground, the production company of Barack and Michelle Obama. The Meaher family has started meeting with leaders of the community in and around Africatown, the community begun by the Africans in north Mobile after they were released from slavery in 1865, the statement said. Clotilda Descendants Association President Jeremy Ellis said the organization had been in contact with the Meaher family by email, and members hope for face-to-face talks.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Alaskans want results, not “partisan political rhetoric,” as she faced Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Kelly Tshibaka in a televised debate Thursday. Tshibaka questioned the value of Murkowski’s seniority and said it’s time for a change. Murkowski “cannot accomplish in the next six years what she hasn’t been able to accomplish in the last 21 years,” Tshibaka said. Murkowski, who has held the seat since late 2002 and is the most senior member of Alaska’s congressional delegation, said the race is about “who can best deliver for Alaska.” She pointed to and defended her record. The debate, held less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 ranked-choice election, also included Democrat Pat Chesbro, who has significantly trailed Murkowski and Tshibaka in fundraising. The other candidate on the ballot, Republican Buzz Kelley, who finished fourth in the August primary, last month suspended his campaign and endorsed Tshibaka. Trump, who came to Alaska in July for a rally with Tshibaka and Sarah Palin, whose U.S. House run he’s endorsed, participated in a tele-rally for Tshibaka last week. He called Murkowski “one of the worst senators even imaginable,” criticizing her for voting for the “insane impeachment” and for opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s U.S. Supreme Court nomination.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge refused Friday to bar a group from monitoring outdoor ballot boxes in Maricopa County – where watchers have shown up armed and in ballistic vests – saying to do so could violate the monitors’ constitutional rights. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said the case remained open, and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. Liburdi concluded that “while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.” The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some masked and armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County and rural Yavapai County as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained of voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos and followed voters. “Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat,” the judge wrote. “On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Students from Northside High School have made bed frames for children in need. The city’s school district, Rotary Club of Fort Smith, the Community Rescue Mission, and the Sleep in Heavenly Peace organization joined forces on the hand-crafted bed construction project. According to SHP, 3% of children ages 3-17 nationwide do not have a bed in which to sleep. On Friday, 25 students from Northside’s construction class put their knowledge and skills to work in an effort to build beds for needy children. The SHP organization will deliver 30 new beds, along with mattresses and bedding, to area homes. “This project gives our students a chance to serve their community while enhancing their skill set,” Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Terry Morawski said. Fort Smith Rotary Club volunteer member Ken Colley said his group was “very excited” to lend a hand. “No kid should sleep on the floor in our town,” Colley said. “Studies have shown that if a child has a good night’s sleep, they will be much more apt to stay alert in the classroom and be able to focus and remember what they learn.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday. The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during an Oct. 20 court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University, Los Angeles. “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.” “What has happened to Mr. Hastings is a terrible injustice,” District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.” The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. A suspect identified through DNA testing last year had died in prison in 2020, according to state officials.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in suburban Denver last winter caused more than $2 billion in losses, making it by far the costliest in Colorado history, the state insurance commissioner said. Commissioner Michael Conway provided the updated estimate this month during a meeting with residents who lost homes to the so-called Marshall Fire in Boulder County and other Colorado wildfires in recent years, The Denver Post reports. The Boulder County fire broke out unusually late in December following months of drought and is blamed for at least one death. Official estimates released days after the fire put the losses at more than $500 million. Experts say the winter grassland fire that blew up along Colorado’s Front Range was rare, but similar events will be more common in the coming years as climate change warms the planet, sucking the moisture out of plants, and as suburbs grow in fire-prone areas. Conway said additional insurance claims and assessments of the scope of rebuilding from the wildfire prompted the new estimate. “We’re estimating now it will be $2 billion in claims if not more,” he told residents. Investigators have yet to determine what caused the Dec. 30 fire, which was fed by winds up to 100 mph and raced from the Rocky Mountain foothills eastward through unincorporated Boulder County and into the cities of Superior and Louisville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As part of his campaign to win over blue state voters, the Republican candidate for governor, Bob Stefanowski, is trying to capitalize on any lingering resentment over safety precautions taken at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the businessman pledged never to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for schoolchildren, joining Republicans who made similar promises after a national panel advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add the shots to lists of recommended vaccinations for kids and adults. Stefanowski has complained that the state’s old mask mandate in schools, which ended in most districts in late February after campuses were allowed to reopen for in-person learning with masks in August 2020, lasted too long. In his proposed “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” he said families shouldn’t be “forced by the government to vaccinate or mask their children without any recourse to object.” “It’s up to the person. They should have the choice,” Stefanowski said. Stefanowski’s opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for “public or private employees or anyone else” is in line with other Republicans who have campaigned this election season on promises to protect individual liberty in public health.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden returned to his home state to cast his ballot for the midterm election Saturday afternoon. He was joined by his 18-year-old granddaughter Natalie, a first-time voter. The two arrived at the Shipyard Shops polling location on the Wilmington Riverfront at 4:15 p.m., a few hours after the president watched Natalie Biden’s field hockey game at St. Andrew’s in Middletown. The two of them walked through the doors of the polling place hand in hand after greeting a constituent leaving the building. Secret Service and local police officers were posted outside as the Bidens voted, drawing the attention of others who had come to vote early. They took photos and posted on social media, surprised to see the president there. When the Bidens emerged from the voting booths, White House staff said Joe and Natalie Biden placed “I Voted” stickers on each others’ shirts. The president then gave his granddaughter a kiss on the cheek. Joe and Natalie Biden join the more than 17,800 Delawareans who had voted either by mail or in person as of Friday afternoon, according to the Delaware Department of Elections. A department spokesperson said the official count would be updated Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief White House groundskeeper as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families – and many of their pets – who have called the mansion home. Dale Haney’s chief responsibility in his post that has spanned 10 presidencies is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year. To honor Haney, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney last Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are “going to be looking at this tree and asking, ‘Who’s Dale?’ ” Haney, 70, joked that he “might still be here.” But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president’s pets. “He’s like the whisperer,” said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan’s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander, Biden’s German shepherd. Haney started at the White House in 1972 and said he originally planned to work there for just two years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year. The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium, Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said in an email. A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure, which is in the process of undergoing a required recertification. An engineer discovered that a main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted, and a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well, the report said. One resident, renovation contractor Marash Markaj, who lived in the building for more than six years, said the damage extends beyond a single support beam. “I’ve seen the issues for many years,” Markaj told the Associated Press. He said he tried to report the issues – including cracks in a column and water standing in the garage area for weeks at a time – to the building management and to the city’s building department. “I was never able to get a response,” he said, adding that he was feeling “unsafe” living in the building and with the way the building’s maintenance was handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man and his family “have faced threats of violence and live in fear” since the movie “2000 Mules” falsely accused him of ballot fraud during the 2020 election, according to a federal lawsuit. The widely debunked film includes surveillance video showing Mark Andrews, his face blurred, depositing five ballots in a drop box in downtown Lawrenceville, a suburb northeast of Atlanta. A voiceover by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” In fact, a state investigation found, Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all live at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and a state investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. D’Souza’s film uses research from the Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote and suggests that ballot “mules” aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. State and federal officials have repeatedly confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election that could have changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former U.S. defense contractor in Hawaii accused with his wife of living for decades under stolen identities of dead babies will get a new attorney, a federal judge ruled Thursday. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. The couple have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Assistant Federal Defender Max Mizono filed a motion this month asking to withdraw as Primrose’s attorney, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. During a telephone hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rom Trader granted the request after a private conversation with Mizono and Primrose. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic Russian KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said. Attorneys for the couple have said they are not Russian spies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says it will not reconsider the clemency case of a terminally ill man who is facing execution for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors near McCall. The high court made the decision Friday in Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr.’s case. The decision means the state remains free to seek a death warrant for Pizzuto. Once issued, the warrant would set his execution by lethal injection in the next 30 days. Deborah A. Czuba, the head of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho’s capital case unit, said in a statement that the Idaho Supreme Court decision was disappointing. “There is still time for Gov. Brad Little to accept the recommendation of his parole commissioners and let Mr. Pizzuto die a natural death in prison,” Czuba said. “If not, our hope is that the State will have enough grace to wait at least until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas season before making Department of Correction employees participate in a needless and traumatizing execution during the holidays.” Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row and was originally scheduled to be put to death in June 2021. He asked for clemency last year because he has terminal bladder cancer, heart disease, diabetes and decreased intellectual function.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A mountain lion that roamed residential neighborhoods in the state capital was sedated Friday and taken to a sanctuary that houses big cats, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources said. The young male cat was tranquilized by staff with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services branch and sent to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, the state agency said. IDNR wildlife experts, Illinois Conservation Police, the USDA and the Springfield Police Department determined the animal had entered areas of the city where he would be a threat to people or property. The animal, which was fitted last year with a GPS collar by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, had wandered to Illinois from Nebraska. It arrived in Springfield on Wednesday, and IDNR warned residents not to disturb it while the agency tracked its movements. The DNR asked people to leave the mountain lion alone because the animals are a protected species in Illinois, and it’s illegal to kill them unless they pose an imminent threat to person or property. Its appearance in Springfield marks the second time in recent weeks a mountain lion has been detected in Illinois. The DNR said a mountain lion was struck and killed Oct. 16 by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A fifth grade teacher in northwestern Indiana charged with felony intimidation after authorities say she told a student she had a “kill list” of students and staff has agreed to stay away from the school. Angelica Carrasquillo, 25, of Griffith, signed a no-contact order Friday without objection when she appeared wearing a green jail uniform in Lake Superior Court, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Judge Kathleen Lang affirmed Carrasquillo’s not guilty plea to one felony count of intimidation. Carrasquillo was being held with a bond set at $20,000 surety or $2,000 cash. Court documents say Carrasquillo communicated “a threat to commit murder” on Oct. 12. Once officials at the school where she was employed, St. Stanislaus in East Chicago, learned of the threat, they immediately confronted her and escorted her from the building, the Diocese of Gary said in a message to parents. When Carrasquillo was asked why she wanted to kill herself and others, she reportedly told school officials: “I’m having trouble with my mental health, and sometimes the kids do not listen in the classroom. I also have trauma caused when I went to high school.” But Carrasquillo also allegedly told school officials that “she was only joking about it all.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge should allow a law passed in 2018 that bans most abortions to take effect, three years after the measure was ruled unconstitutional, lawyers for Gov. Kim Reynolds argued Friday. Chris Schandevel, a lawyer for the Republican governor, said Judge Celene Gogerty should set aside a 2019 permanent injunction that prevented Iowa from enforcing a law that would block abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. That is usually around six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Schandevel said the injunction rests entirely on an Iowa Supreme Court 2018 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion under the state constitution and cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and 1973 that established abortion rights nationally. All three cases were overruled this year by more conservative courts, and given that, Reynolds’ lawyers argued the judge should reverse the injunction and let the 2018 law take effect. Rita Bettis Austen, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, countered that there is no precedent or legal support in Iowa for a judge to reverse a final judgment entered three years ago. The judge said she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Voters are being asked to reduce the authority of the governor and other state officials and give legislators a bigger say in how the state regulates businesses, protects the environment and preserves residents’ health. A proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the Nov. 8 ballot would make it easier for the Republican-controlled Legislature to overturn regulations written by state agencies and boards – those under the control of the governor but also others in the executive branch of state government. At issue are rules as varied as which shots are required for children attending school and how often hotels must clean guest rooms. Business groups and advocates of smaller government view the measure as reining in unelected bureaucrats. But in the fall campaign’s final weeks, abortion rights advocates have begun warning that it is another attempted power grab by far-right legislators. The November vote comes three months after voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to eliminate state constitutional protections for abortion and give lawmakers authority to more tightly regulate or ban the procedure. Those who oppose the regulation amendment have repurposed the “vote no” yard signs from the abortion vote for their fall campaign.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools has received the largest gift in its history, according to the district, with plans to invest the funds in some of the city’s most disadvantaged schools. A total of $20 million was put forward by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott for Louisville’s public school district, officials said at a press conference Thursday. The money will go toward “direct financial support for JCPS,” district officials said in a release. JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said the gift came following an interview with a consulting firm that represents several unnamed philanthropists. Three months later, he said, Scott’s team called to tell him about the planned donation to JCPS. “We also promised this community that we would fund the schools in an appropriate way so that the families in this community would have equity in selection,” Pollio said at the event at the Academy @ Shawnee in Louisville’s West End. “You can’t go to a high-poverty school across America and see something like this.” Pollio said the $20 million influx in cash will help address growing inequity in supplemental funding – cash that schools receive through parent-teacher associations, athletic events, booster clubs and alumni associations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Roads: Authorities are looking for a stolen sign marking a centuries-old tree that inspired author Ernest Gaines. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office said the historical marker identifying the “Miss Jane Pittman Oak” was stolen recently, and the parish government is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery or the thief’s arrest, news outlets report. The tree itself, believed to be about 400 years old, served as partial inspiration for “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” which gained widespread notice for the internationally acclaimed, award-winning author. The book describes a first-person narrative of a fictional 110-year-old woman born into slavery. Historians have said Gaines regularly walked past the oak tree, which sits along Louisiana Highway 16 in Lakeland, a village in the parish, on his way to the grocery store. In 2008, state officials considered cutting down the oak because its low-hanging branches posed a potential threat to passing cars. But the state ultimately relented amid pushback from Gaines and other activists, opting instead to trim the branches. Tips leading to an arrest or recovery of the marker should be directed to the sheriff’s office at 225-694-3737. Gaines, who died in 2019 at age 86, will be depicted on a stamp next year, the U.S. Postal Service announced last week.\n\nMaine\n\nHallowell: The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a pair of energy projects that would generate enough wind power for up to 900,000 homes along with construction of a new transmission corridor to get the electricity to the regional power grid. The PUC was required by law to choose the projects to boost transmission capacity and renewable energy in Aroostook County. It chose LS Power Base for a 345-kilovolt transmission project and Longroad Energy’s King Pine for a wind generation project, but it didn’t rule on how how much of the cost would be borne by Maine ratepayers. Together, the net cost of the projects is $1.8 billion over a 30-year period, but they would benefit the state, officials said. An influx of energy into the regional grid would “place downward pressure on electricity prices, benefitting consumers in Maine and throughout New England,” said PUC Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. It’s a similar to the proposed 145-mile transmission line that would be a conduit for 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid, but it would serve a different purpose. State voters rebuked the New England Clean Energy Connect last November, and work was halted pending the outcome of a lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two legislators have called for an independent review of the state Department of Natural Resources’ handling of repeated complaints against the former manager at Gunpowder Falls State Park. A Baltimore County grand jury indicted former longtime manager Michael Browning last Monday on charges that include rape and assault. The Baltimore Sun reports that state Sen. Sarah Elfreth and Del. Eric Luedtke called for the review in a letter to Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Maryland’s secretary of natural resources. “The behavior and lack of accountability described is inexcusable and requires prompt action by the Department to address the issues raised and ensure that a similar situation never happens again,” the letter says. Baltimore County Police arrested Browning, 71, in September and charged him with sexually assaulting a former park employee. According to charging documents, the woman told police she met Browning as a teenager while attending a youth club his wife ran before working with Browning at the park. Police wrote in charging documents that the two had a yearslong consensual relationship. The woman told police that she tried to end the relationship and that Browning raped her 10 to 15 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Police and school officials are trying to figure out how a 7-year-old child managed to bring a loaded gun to school. Police responded to UP Academy Holland in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood about 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a report of a student with a firearm, police said in a statement on the department’s website. Responding officers confiscated the weapon. No injuries were reported. “I’m speechless. I don’t have the words. This is truly devastating,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. “We have to ask ourselves how a very young student becomes in possession of and gains access to a firearm.” Mayor Michelle Wu pledged to hold the person who allowed the child access to the gun accountable. “No child should be near a weapon, much less directly endangered at such a young age,” she said. No additional information was released. “The Boston Police Department is focused on the proliferation of guns in our city and keeping access to them away from the youngest among us needs to be a priority for everyone,” Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. The school has about 770 students from kindergarten through fifth grade, according to its website. Police are still investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyandotte:There’s nothing sweet about bringing home a cockroach, so trick-or-treating is off limits in a suburban Detroit neighborhood. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes. Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street. City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching a ride on costumes. The city is trying to exterminate the roaches, but “it will take some time,” Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches, but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member Todd Hanna said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Election officials held a public demonstration of voting machines Friday as part of an effort to maintain public trust and transparency in election systems that have drawn coordinated attacks from ex-President Donald Trump and others. Minneapolis Director of Elections and Voter Services Katie Smith showed election judges from around the city how to test the voting equipment: Turn on the tabulator machine, feed the pre-marked set of test ballots into the machine, print off the results, and make sure the results exactly match the ballots. More than two dozen people tested the tabulator machines and assistive voting devices – which help voters zoom in, print and read their ballots with Braille, if needed – at the demonstration at the city’s election and voter services building. Smith said the public accuracy test, which is required under state law, is important because it lets members of the public see their votes are going to be correctly and accurately counted on election night. Around the country, some voters have expressed skepticism about election systems since Trump and others have falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud led to President Joe Biden being elected. After nearly two years, no evidence has shown that voting machines were manipulated to steal the 2020 election or that there was any widespread fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nMound Bayou: The tiny, all-Black town of Mound Bayou became a safe haven for Emmett Till’s mother as she traveled to Mississippi to testify in the murder trial of two white men who lynched her son in 1955. Hundreds of people – a good portion of Mound Bayou’s 1,500 residents – turned out Thursday evening to watch the movie “Till.” The feature film went into wide release across the U.S. over the weekend after being in limited release since Oct. 14. “This place, this city, is very sacred to the story of Emmett Till,” one of the filmmakers, Keith Beauchamp, told the mostly Black audience in the gymnasium/auditorium of Mound Bayou’s John F. Kennedy High School. The screening happened days after a bronze statue of Till was unveiled about 50 miles away in Greenwood. Beauchamp is one of the producers and writers of “Till,” which largely focuses on Mamie Till-Mobley’s reaction to the loss of her only child and her evolution into a civil rights leader. Mound Bayou was founded by formerly enslaved people in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta in 1887 as a freestanding community where Black people could thrive amid the hostility of the Jim Crow era.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed testing inside a school closed amid concerns of radioactive contamination, and sampling of soil outside the school has begun, Corps officials said Friday. A suburban St. Louis school board voted last week to close Jana Elementary School in Florissant after testing by a private firm found levels of radioactive isotope lead-210 that were 22 times the expected level on the kindergarten playground. It also found high levels of polonium, radium and other material inside the school, which sits along Coldwater Creek, contaminated decades ago with Manhattan Project atomic waste. The Corps said in a news release that radiation detection instruments were used to scan surfaces inside the school. Sampling of soil outside the school is expected to go on for another two weeks, the Corps said. The agency plans to sample at least 45 spots, with depths ranging from 15 to 28 feet below the surface. Preliminary test results are expected in November. The approximate 400 students at Jana Elementary are taking virtual classes for the next month, then will be reassigned to other schools. Coldwater Creek was contaminated in the 1940s and 1950s when waste from atomic bomb material manufactured in St. Louis got into the waterway near Lambert Airport, where the waste was stored. The result was an environmental nightmare that resulted in a Superfund declaration in 1989.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the state and its wildlife management agency, alleging it illegally set hunting and trapping policies and quotas intended to reduce the gray wolf population by making it easier to kill the predators. WildEarth Guardians and Project Coyote filed the lawsuit Thursday in District Court in Helena asking for the new laws and resulting increased quotas to be overturned. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 passed bills that allowed the state to reduce the wolf population, authorize additional hunting methods, allow extended hunting seasons, allow an individual to kill up to 20 wolves, and allow private parties to offer bounties for hunting or trapping wolves. The conservation groups allege management decisions are being made based on a wolf plan that was created in 2002 and was amended to use a new wolf population model without following state rulemaking procedures and without public participation. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Greg Lemon said Friday. Montana officials authorized the killing of 450 wolves during the winter of 2021-22 but ended up shutting down hunting near Yellowstone National Park after 23 wolves from the park were killed, all but five in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Dueling lawsuits have been dropped by a former candidate for governor and a fellow Republican state lawmaker who accused him of groping her at a political function several years ago. Charles W. Herbster, who lost his bid in May to become the GOP nominee for governor despite an early endorsement from ex-President Donald Trump, sued state Sen. Julie Slama for defamation after she told the Nebraska Examiner that, in 2019, Herbster reached under her skirt and groped her at the Douglas County Republican Party event when she was 22. Slama was one of eight women who accused Herbster of unwanted groping, but Slama was the only one to go on the record with her name. Herbster denied the allegations and painted them as a politically motivated attack. Slama quickly countersued, accusing Herbster of sexual battery. The competing lawsuits had largely stalled in the months since being filed, with both sides seeking delays. Online court records show that both sides on Wednesday submitted motions to dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled. On Thursday, the judge granted the motion. Neither the motion nor the judge’s order addressed why the parties sought to dismiss their respective lawsuits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A rural county roiled by voting machine conspiracy theories stopped its unprecedented effort Friday to hand-count ballots cast in advance of Election Day. But Nye County officials vowed to reshape their plan and seek another go-ahead from the Nevada Supreme Court, after justices ruled late Thursday that counting methods used last week violated rules they set to prevent the county from allowing early disclosure of election results. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court order requires us to make some changes to our hand count process,” Nye County officials said in a statement issued Friday that promised to “resume as soon as our plan is in compliance with the court’s order and approved by the secretary of state.” Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada said they stood ready to challenge any effort to restart the hand tallies this week and don’t believe there’s any hand-counting scenario that would pass legal muster. The civil rights advocacy group accused Nye County officials of failing to prevent public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. It argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violated the court rule.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and Republican challenger Robert Burns frequently took jabs and interrupted one another over COVID-19 funding, drug addiction treatment and abortion rights during their first debate Friday for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District seat. Burns said many companies are suffering now because of reckless government spending. “My opponent here talks about the need for the federal government to help build businesses ... I built my business without the help of the federal government,” said Burns, who runs a quality control and pharmaceutical safety company in Bedford. “That’s not true when you consider the Paycheck Protection loan that you took,” Kuster said. Burns responded: “That was 10 years later.” Kuster expressed her support for suboxone medication to treat opioid addiction, saying it is helping her own brother. Burns said statistics have shown that isn’t true and accused her campaign of being funded by its manufacturers. Burns, who says he is pro-life and supported the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was asked to clarify his proposal to form “panels” that would require a second and third opinion when a woman, in his words, is “being forced to have an abortion.” Burns said “probably misspoke a little bit” in his use of the word “panel” and said he was referring to the mental health of the mother.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Borough: A “significant” piece of historic artwork depicting George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth may be sold by the Monmouth County Historical Association for millions of dollars, drawing opposition from historians who claim the MCHA museum would lose a valuable piece of history. Titled “Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,” the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a legendary German artist, dates to 1857. It recreates Washington’s involvement in the historic battle that occurred in June 1778. “I think it would be pathetically tragic to sell one of the key pieces of the association’s major collection,” said Joe Hammond, a former curator of the MCHA museum and one-time director of the association. “It is a regional collection of national significance, and the painting of Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth is one of the most significant.” But with a price tag that could reach tens of millions of dollars, MCHA officials contend it is worth investigating a potential sale. The new interest is likely the result of a recent multimillion-dollar sale of another Washington painting by Leutze. His famed “Washington Crossing the Delaware” piece fetched more than $45 million in May, according to Christie’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The FBI confirmed Friday that it is investigating a report from a Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group that it received mail containing antisemitic imagery and a suspicious powdery substance inside. FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said in an email that the substance was tested and determined not to be harmful. Further details were not being released in order to protect the integrity the investigation, he said. Conservation Voters New Mexico Executive Director Demis Foster said the group received an envelope Wednesday in the mail that included a brown, powdery substance inside along with a torn-up political flier that the group distributed in support of a Democratic state House representative who is running for reelection. The mail included a reference to the Nazi Party, a swastika and other antisemitic symbols, Foster said. She said first responders including police evacuated the building, and an employee who opened the mail was released unharmed from a hospital after undergoing observation. Foster said she and her employees are working remotely as a precaution, while continuing their advocacy for environmental causes and endorsed political candidates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who fought poverty and racism and skillfully navigated New York’s power structure as pastor of Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, died Friday at age 73, the church announced. “The Butts Family and entire Abyssinian Baptist Church membership solicit your prayers for us in our bereavement,” the church said on its website. No cause of death was given. Butts began serving as a youth minister at Abyssinian in 1972 and was senior pastor there for more than 30 years. He also served as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island, from 1999 to 2020. His post at Abyssinian gave Butts one of the most prominent pulpits in the U.S. The church traces its roots to 1808 when a group of Black worshippers who refused to accept segregation at the First Baptist Church of New York City left to form their own congregation. The church’s current home on 138th Street in Harlem is a massive Tudor and Gothic revival structure dedicated in 1923 and designated a city landmark in 1993. Earlier pastors at Abyssinian included Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and his son Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The two North Carolina Supreme Court seats up for election in November have taken on extra significance as the outcome could flip the court’s partisan makeup during a period of political polarization. Registered Democrats hold a 4-3 advantage on the court, but Republicans would retake the majority for the first time since 2016 should they win at least one race. The seats carry eight-year terms, so barring unplanned retirements, Republicans would be assured of keeping the upper hand for at least 41/ 2 years if successful. Outside groups are spending big to influence the races. In the two largest television markets alone, two super PACs have committed spending roughly $3 million on ads, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In keeping with nonjudicial elections this year, ads have focused on crime and abortion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor said Thursday that an examination of North Dakota’s electoral systems conducted in response to voter concerns found that they are “incredibly secure.” Auditor Josh Gallion said he undertook the review in response to concerns nationally that false claims of election fraud and conspiracies are threats to democracy. “We looked at any potential weaknesses in the election system of our state that could be exploited by someone with nefarious intent,” Gallion said. “The determination after extensive review from our contractor was that our election systems are incredibly secure across our state.” The review found six vulnerabilities to the state’s election system but all were labeled “low risk,” Gallion said. The report identified the vulnerabilities as the the ability for a voter to cast multiple ballots, identity theft of deceased voters, stuffing or discarding valid absentee ballots, equipment tampering, and absentee ballot fraud. Gallion said his office received many inquiries from residents and others about North Dakota’s election security following the 2020 election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. One inquiry came from MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has echoed lies that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The first major retrospective of artist Maurice Sendak’s work since his 2012 death – and the largest and most complete to date – opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. Most people today know Sendak as the creator of children’s book classics such as “Where the Wild Things Are” and “In the Night Kitchen.” A new exhibition of his work looks at that reputation and a less well-known side of his immense output: his work as a designer for opera, theater, film, and television. “We wanted people to understand that Maurice was actually a serious artist,” said Lynn Caponera, executive director of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Though most knew him as an illustrator and picture book artist, “they didn’t see beyond the fact that he did a lot more than that,” she said. “Wild Things are Happening” opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. It’s the first major retrospective of Sendak’s work since his 2012 death and the largest and most complete to date. The exhibit takes its name from a 1990s advertising campaign Sendak did for Bell Atlantic that featured Wild Things characters promoting “a fast, dependable Internet service.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nBroken Arrow: The deaths of eight family members – including six children found in a burning Oklahoma home – are being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Friday. Police are trying to determine whether both adults were involved in the killings. The children, who ranged in age from 1 to 13, were the victims, Broken Arrow Police Chief Brandon Berryhill said during a news conference. He did not provide their identities, ages or explain their relationships to one another except to say they were family members believed to be living in the home. Police said both adults who live in the home were considered “primary suspects” because they were found dead in the front of the home while the children were all found in a bedroom, where the fire was contained. A police spokesman declined to say whether authorities believe the two adults were both responsible for the killings or whether it could be just one of them. “It’s because investigators are still trying to piece together what happened with eight people dead,” police spokesman Ethan Hutchins said in an email to the Associated Press. Hutchins also said police would not be able to identify the dead adults until the medical examiner’s office has completed its work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration compiled extensive intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested, even for minor offenses, during Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon. Initial drafts of the dossiers even included friends of the subjects as well as their interests, but those were later removed and replaced with a note that they would be made available upon request, according to an internal review by the Department of Homeland Security. The dossiers, known by agents as baseball cards, were previously normally compiled on non-U.S. citizens or only on Americans with “a demonstrated terrorism nexus,” according to the 76-page report. It was previously released last year but contains new revelations based on extensive redactions that were removed by the Biden administration. Ben Wizner, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s free speech, privacy and technology project, said the report indicates leaders of the Department of Homeland Security wanted to inflate the risk caused by protesters in Portland. The city became an epicenter of sometimes violent demonstrations in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. But many protesters, including women belonging to a “Wall of Moms” ad hoc group and military veterans, were peaceful.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Authorities say they have recovered a gun believed to have been thrown off a bridge by a suspect after a shooting that injured six people, one critically, outside a church where a funeral was being held. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said a river rescue team working off the McKees Rocks Bridge on Sunday morning was able to locate a firearm matching the description of the firearm used in Friday’s shooting outside Destiny of Faith Church. Officials said the weapon found had a bullet in the chamber and had been reported stolen in Shaler Township. Nineteen-year-old Shawn Davis of McKees Rocks and a 16-year-old Pittsburgh youth are both charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons counts in the noontime gunfire Friday outside the church where a funeral was being held for a man killed in a shooting earlier this month. The service was being livestreamed, and the video showed several people screaming and ducking for cover. It wasn’t clear if any shots went into the church. One person was taken to a hospital in critical condition while four other shooting victims were listed as stable. A sixth person injured trying to escape was also treated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Backed by Brown University, Vartan Gregorian Elementary School has opened a hands-on, interactive classroom meant to help students explore science, technology, engineering, art and math in a fresh new space. Three groups of fourth and fifth graders were assigned a challenge Friday to figure out a way to raise a tiny flag using three machines and six chain reactions – without electricity. After a couple of false starts, fifth grader Noelle Ingle’s team propelled a tiny ball down a ramp, which struck a series of matchbox cars, which raised a card-size version of the Brown University flag. The room erupted in cheers. The Rube Goldberg machine was the first experiment in Gregorian’s new STEAM lab. Brown University spent approximately $200,000 renovating the dingy third grade classroom, installing new windows, floors and a sink and buying new furniture, including ricochet stools that allow students to wiggle while seated. The university also purchased whiteboards, a smart television and a microscope with up to 1,200x magnification. The shelves are already filled with robot and model car kits, magnetic play tiles and Legos. Brown has had a decades­long partnership with the elementary school, named after Vartan Gregorian, Brown’s larger-than-life president, who served from 1989 to 1997 and died April 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would restrict children from accessing public library books and electronic materials that are “promoting sexuality.” Local news outlets report the proposed Greenville County Council measure would direct trustees of the Greenville County Library System to order books and electronic materials removed from the county’s 12 libraries. The resolution also orders the library trustees to report “how such books ever found their way into the children’s sections of our public libraries” and to say how they will prevent them returning. As is true nationwide, controversies over materials dealing with LGBTQ and racial themes have been roiling South Carolina schools and public libraries for a year, particularly in the heavily Republican Upstate region. A large number of opponents spoke against restricting books during a Greenville County Council meeting in September, saying it targets books with LGBTQ themes. “These materials are not innately sexualized, they are not innately about sex, they are just about who we are and those should continue to exist,” Tyler Prescott of the Upstate LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce told councilors then. Republican Councilor Joe Dill, who is sponsoring the resolution, said in September that the county needs to also consider other people who are offended.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two critically endangered red wolves have arrived at the Great Plains Zoo from facilities in Texas and Washington. There are fewer than two dozen red wolves living in the wild, the zoo said in a press release, making them the most endangered canid species in the world. The wolves’ placement at zoo is part of a species survival plan, which aims to breed pairs with the greatest possible genetic diversity. “With only around 20 individuals remaining in the wild, the survival of the red wolf species is contingent the concerted help of accredited zoos and conservation partners with species survival breeding and reintroduction plans,” CEO Becky Dewitz said in a statement. “Weare grateful and dedicated to helping save the red wolf from extinction.” The male and female wolves are still getting used to each other and their new habitat, so the path by their enclosure will be blocked for ZooBoo, which takes place this Friday through Sunday. The zoo asks patrons respect the barricades as the wolves adjust.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Historical Commission is taking applications for awards to honor people or groups that work to study and preserve the state’s heritage. The commission said Thursday that its Certificates of Merit are presented each May, during National Preservation Month. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 31. Patrick McIntyre, State Historic Preservation Officer and executive director of the commission, said the awards program “highlights people and organizations for the work they do in the areas of publication, commemoration, and education regarding our state’s unique history and heritage.” “For 47 years our awards program has offered an opportunity to give thanks and recognition to those working to champion and revitalize Tennessee’s historic places,” McIntyre said. Applications can be found on the commission’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state police chief said Thursday that his department “did not fail” Uvalde during the hesitant law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, as a Republican congressman joined angry parents of some of the 19 children killed in the May attack in calling for him to resign. Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, acknowledged mistakes by officers while several Uvalde families confronted him in Austin over multiple outrages: why police waited more than 70 minutes before entering the fourth-grade classroom and killing the gunman, false and shifting accounts given by authorities, and records that remain withheld more than five months later. But McCraw defended his agency, and during a meeting of the state’s Public Safety Commission, made the case that failures uncovered to date did not warrant his removal while saying he was not shirking from accountability. Uvalde families bristled and asked how DPS could not have failed, given that troopers were among the first on the scene. “I can tell you this right now, DPS as an institution, right now, did not fail the community,” McCraw said. “Plain and simple.” Significantly, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales said for the first time after the meeting that McCraw should also lose his job, becoming the first major figure in the GOP to call for a change at the top of Texas’ state police force.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Jordan: U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens and Democratic challenger Darlene McDonald agreed on none of the issues addressed Friday in their only debate before the midterm elections, with each largely echoing their party’s talking points on inflation, abortion and infrastructure spending. In an untelevised debate in the basement of a suburban real estate office with an audience of only campaign staff and half a dozen reporters, the Utah Republican blamed Democrats and President Joe Biden for fentanyl being imported across the U.S.-Mexico border, racial division and inflation. Owens accused Democrats of pushing critical race theory – an academic framework that connects the country’s history, including the legacy of slavery, to contemporary racism – and said that it’s destroying the country’s social fabric. “One thing that the Biden administration has accomplished is that they’ve given us a common purpose again,” Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the U.S. House, added. “We now share in what’s called misery, as a people.” McDonald, who is also Black, countered that Owens was spreading falsehoods to drum up fear – about both the nature of protests against police brutality and the idea that critical race theory was being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A man charged with the 1989 stabbing deaths of his in-laws in the town of Danby after modern DNA techniques linked him to the crime pleaded not guilty Friday during a court hearing. The arraignment of Michael Louise in Vermont Superior Court in Rutland came two days after he was returned to Vermont from New York to answer charges in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73. He had been scheduled for arraignment Thursday but the hearing was delayed 24 hours. Louise entered the pleas and then was ordered held without bail, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman, who monitored the hearing remotely. Louise, 79, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later after the couple was found dead in their Danby home in September 1989. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, but there was not enough to charge him, police said in an affidavit filed in the case. Louise told conflicting stories about whether he had traveled to Vermont from his home in Liverpool, New York, on Sept. 13, 1989, the day the Peacocks were believed to have been killed. Their bodies were discovered Sept. 17 after neighbors went to check on the couple.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The U.S. Coast Guard, a crew of scientists and others launched an air and sea mission to rescue 13 people, including a child, from a fishing vessel just moments before it sank in darkness early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia, authorities said. The 115-foot Tremont fishing vessel collided with the 1000-foot Panamanian-flagged container vessel MSC Rita, about 60 miles from shore, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Tremont sent out a mayday call that it was taking on water and sinking with 13 people aboard that was received by watchstanders with Coast Guard Sector Virginia, officials said. That call was also heard by Atlantis, a 274-foot ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts, at about 1:45 a.m., WHOI said in an email to The Associated Press. The captain of the Atlantis contacted the Coast Guard and motored 8 miles west to the fishing vessel. The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew from its air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the Coast Guard said. It also dispatched a motor lifeboat crew from its station in Chincoteague, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and diverted the Coast Guard Cutter Rollin Fritch to assist.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: The city’s dress code ordinance saying bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment last week came after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reports. Everett is about 30 miles north of Seattle. U.S. District Court in Seattle found Everett’s dress code ordinance violated the Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington state constitutions. The Court found that the ordinance was, at least in part, shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose, according to a 19-page ruling signed by U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men,” including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis. Bikini baristas were “clearly” a target of the ordinance, the court also ruled, adding that the profession is comprised of a workforce that is almost entirely women.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Local chefs and surgeons put their carving skills to the test for the Huntington Children’s Museum Pumpkin Carving Contest at The Market’s outdoor patio in downtown Huntington. Jessica McCormick, of Huntington, brought her two children, 10-year-old Iris and 4-year-old Oscar, to the event on Tuesday, which also featured the Marshall Nutrition Program, a dance floor with a fog machine, and other contests and events for kids. “They loved this event last year, and they love checking out the carved pumpkins, too,” said McCormick, who is the vice president of the museum’s board of directors. “We have been waiting for a children’s museum in Huntington since Iris was a baby. I hope everyone will get involved and donate to such a great cause.” Drew Hetzer, of Backyard Pizza and Raw Bar and The Peddler, was one of the local dining legends competing in the contest that also included Jonathan Patterson of Le Bistro and Jordan Hagy of La Famiglia. “I’m sticking with a pizza theme, but with a Halloween twist on it,” Hetzer said. Participating surgeons included doctors Ashleigh Clickett, Courtney Crain, Michael Gentile, Farzad Amiri and Ben Moosavi. “I will attempt carving a breastfeeding mother with a baby,” said Clickett, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist at Valley Health. “Cutting a pumpkin is a lot different than human skin, so it will be much different. I just want to have fun with it and help a great cause at the same time.” Votes for the best pumpkin can be made with donations to Huntington Children’s Museum online at givebutter.com/hcmpumpkin.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court is refusing to block a lower court’s ruling prohibiting voters who already submitted an absentee ballot from voiding it and voting again, a rarely used practice known as ballot spoiling. The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided Thursday against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to the Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Three wolves shot and killed in the state are drawing attention across the border. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials believe the animals may have belonged to their state’s closely watched North Park wolf pack. The North Park pack, which often crosses into Wyoming where hunting wolves is legal, gained notoriety last year after birthing Colorado’s first known litter of pups in 80 years. Travis Duncan, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said in an email that the agency cannot yet confirm whether the slain wolves were in the North Park pack but will continue to monitor the animals “if and when they are next seen in the area.” Duncan added that at least two wolves were seen Friday in northern Colorado. In Colorado, killing a wolf can bring a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But once all four paws are across the border into Wyoming, wolves are in the state’s “predator zone” where anyone can legally hunt the animals without a license. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The difference in state laws could impede Colorado’s planned reintroduction of wolves that was narrowly approved by voters in a controversial 2019 ballot initiative. The introduction is planned for 2023 on the sparsely populated Western Slope.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/23/tattoos-masks-telemedicine-yellowstone-news-around-states/111998506/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:People can pick up free masks from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday at one of 11 sites across Montgomery, the city announced. Each person can get up to two masks. Mayor Steven Reed issued an executive order that goes into effect Friday requiring people in public to wear facial coverings, except in specific situations like when visiting a restaurant or bar, or when there’s room for social distancing. Those who violate the order are subject to a $25 fine.

You can find their contact information at montgomeryal.gov.\n\nAlaska\n\nKetchikan: A person who didn’t follow quarantine procedures after arriving in Alaska has created the possibility of broad community spread of the novel coronavirus after going to social gatherings and public places in Ketchikan while awaiting results of a COVID-19 test that turned out positive, officials said. The person arrived in Ketchikan on June 13 and underwent testing for COVID-19. The state said anyone tested on arrival is to quarantine until they receive a negative test result. Under the state rules, one is not to leave a quarantine location except for medical emergencies or necessary medical care. This person instead attended social gatherings and went to public places June 13-15, events attended by many young people, families and residents, officials said. Officials did not say if the person was a resident or a visitor. The person’s positive test was received Tuesday, and the person is now in isolation ad checked on daily by public health nurses. “I know many of you are angry, hurt, disappointed, and even scared about the impact this may have in our community. I am too, but we are prepared for this,” Ketchikan Emergency Manager Abner Hoage said in video to the community Wednesday night. He said there is testing and personal protection equipment available. The Ketchikan Police Department is investigating the individual’s actions for possible charges, and public health nurses are tracing contacts the individual had. City officials are advising anyone who attended gatherings in Ketchikan where social distancing wasn’t followed or if someone who recently traveled was in attendance to consider self-quarantining for 14 days and to get tested if symptoms like a cough, fever or difficulty breathing develop.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Cases of an inflammatory illness that’s associated with COVID-19 and affects children and young adults have been identified in Arizona. Officials with Phoenix-based Banner Health confirmed they have seen a few Arizona cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. MIS-C illness is rare, said Dr. David Moromisato, chief medical officer for Banner Desert and Cardon Children’s medical centers in Mesa. Still, it’s important for parents, children and their loved ones to know the signs, because when it does occur, MIS-C can be extremely serious and is potentially fatal, said Moromisato, a pediatric ICU physician. The illness mostly tends to affect young children and teens, although the age range of patients is from about 2 to young adulthood, early evidence is showing. Different body parts can become inflamed with MIS-C, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Researchers have said that children who get the MIS-C illness might never have been sick with COVID-19, although the majority appear to have been infected with it at some point, and about 25% have active COVID-19 infection. The MIS-C could be a postinfection inflammatory response. Although children appear to be good at fighting off COVID-19 illness, some of them might be having severe immune responses to the virus that makes them ill. If a child has a fever, red eyes, cracked lips, and they are having vomiting and diarrhea, parents should seek medical attention, Moromisato said. The earlier the intervention for MIS-C, the better, he said. “Even though we feel that children are not affected (by COVID-19), I think that it’s still important for us to be appropriately socially distancing, not just adults and the elderly, but children,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff:Whole Nêdz Inc. and ACCESS Inc. will give away COVID-19 supplies to caregivers and other essential workers from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesday at Saracen Landing. ACCESS, Inc. will also be giving away 100 bags to youth in the community, according to a news release. This event will be drive-through only entering Saracen Landing from Pullen Street to adhere to guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Whole Nêdz is a nonprofit designed to educate the community on situations that can lead to grief and loss. ACCESS is a teen pregnancy prevention agency which has served youth since 1978, according to the release. This event is funded by contributions of the Pine Bluff Community Foundation and local churches.

The county had been struggling to maintain its numbers since early June, reporting a total of 12,778 cumulative cases on Friday, a 25% increase from 10 days prior. Riverside County has two weeks from the day it was placed on the list – June 17 – to show progress in controlling the transmission of the coronavirus or the state will recommend that the county health department reinstate some stricter stay-at-home rules and business closures. If there is still no progress after that, the state can step in and take its own actions within the county. Riverside County already narrowly avoided being placed on the list in early June because of a concerning increase in hospitalizations two days in a row. However, the county was not placed on the list because that number fell back to an acceptable level on the third day. A county does not get placed on the watch list unless it misses a metric three days in a row. That same week, Riverside County allowed partial Stage 3 reopening, which gave the green light for gyms and fitness centers to restart operations on June 12. Nail salons and tattoo parlors got the go-ahead on June 19 – two days after the county was placed on the watch list.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Bars in Colorado can now reopen after a relaxation of restrictions meant to stave off the novel coronavirus went into effect Thursday. Bar occupancy is now limited to 25% or 50 people, whichever is lower, according to the a public health order from Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Outdoor bar service limits can also resume with approval from local officials. Previously, taprooms and wineries could open if they offered food from a licensed retail food establishment on-site and followed the state’s restaurant guidelines for proper table spacing, mask usage and sanitation procedures. The new order also allows restaurants to open at 50% capacity or 50 people, whichever is lower, as long as tables are 6 feet apart. Rules already in effect in Larimer County allowed restaurants to open at 30% capacity or up to 60% capacity if the additional seating is in an outdoor space. Extra-large sites, defined as 7,200 square feet or more, can accommodate more people, up to 100, depending on the results of an occupancy calculator for indoor events.

Using a Virtual Mentoring Toolkit, children and their “Bigs” can undertake joint activities and virtual tours, explore science, math and reading, play games and stay in close touch. “For many of them, a smartphone is their only way of really connecting with their mentors,” said Andy Fleischmann, president and CEO of Nutmeg Big Brothers Big Sisters. “In this period of uncertainty and disconnection, keeping the vulnerable kids in our program in contact with their Big Brothers and Sisters – as well as other nurturing people in their lives – is tremendously important.” AT&T donated the new devices, along with two months of free service. Officials hope children will also be able to use them for distance learning during the school year. Between Nutmeg’s three programs (Community-Based, Site-Based and Foster Grandparent Program), it serves about 1,300 children. Brian Kelly, of Nutmeg Big Brothers Big Sisters, said that officials have about 600 matches statewide.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware Park opened its 83rd season of racing on June 17, long delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, and the thoroughbreds galloping around the Stanton oval were a welcome sight. Wagering could be done outside at betting windows or computer terminals, or inside the clubhouse. A total of $2,978,879 was wagered on Delaware Park races that day. When Delaware Park opened two years ago, also on a Wednesday, the handle was $2,087,072. “A lot of people have dealt with change the last three months,” said jockey Trevor McCarthy, “and everybody’s just kind of happy to be back and we’ll do whatever it takes to be back.” The pandemic led to the cancellation of the spring high school sports season. College athletics were halted for good in mid-March. Other First State spring staples, such as Wilmington Blue Rocks minor-league baseball and the NASCAR race at Dover International Speedway, have also been absent.Some youth sports were able to kick off last week, including the Delaware Baseball Group college and high school leagues. But the 10-race card on June 17, which featured the $100,000 Obeah Stakes for fillies and mares 3 years old and up, was a sign of sports normalcy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The District officially moves to Phase 2 of reopening on Monday after seeing 13 days of a sustained decline in coronavirus cases, WUSA-TV reported. Starting Tuesday, residents will be able to enter the DMV to conduct driver’s licenses services, vehicle registrations and knowledge tests by appointment only. All documents that expired on or after March 1 are still valid until mid-September, so there is no need to rush to the DMV, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. To set up an appointment, click here. All playgrounds across the District will also reopen effective Monday. According to the latest data, the District has now been on a long-term downward trend since May 21. The District has also expanded its testing in neighborhoods and has begun offering free walk-up testing at firehouses from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. D.C. Fire and EMS Chief Gregory Dean said the testing outside the firehouses has been going smoothly. The city has 200 contact tracers and wants an additional 100 by June 30, Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: More than 100,000 people in Florida have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, state health officials reported Monday, as public health officials reissued advisories urging social distancing and mask wearing. Some businesses have begun reevaluating their decisions to reopen amid the spike in cases reported by the state health department on its website. More than 3,100 people in Florida have died from COVID-19. Over the weekend, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered the Health Department to reissue advisories urging Floridians to consider wearing masks to help keep the virus from spreading and to refrain from attending gatherings of more than 50 people. Despite the rise in new infections, the governor has not signaled any intention of retreating from reopening the state. Three months of business closures have left hundreds of thousands of people out of work and disrupted the day-to-day lives of Floridians.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah:Houses of worship should remain closed for services at this time, according to recommendations from the Savannah Faith Task Force. The task force was formed earlier this year by Mayor Van Johnson as part of efforts to include faith leaders in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. Representatives from the task force joined with Johnson last week to release their latest recommendations. Johnson said the task force had three virtual meetings with more thnan 100 local faith leaders attending. “It’s been a difficult time for many of us and a trying time for most of us, but the faith community has come together in ways that I’ve never seen before,” Rabbi Robert Haas of Congregation Mickve Israel said. Following those meetings, which included input from Coastal Health Director Dr. Lawton Davis, the task force is recommending houses of worship remain closed for services until a vaccine is found or there is a “drastic plummet” in the number of cases. If congregations wish to open against the recommendations, the Savannah Faith Task Force said it hopes they recommended protocals by the task force, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayor Johnson Virtual Clergy Discussions. “We talked a good bit about if you open you have to take everyone’s temperature, make sure everyone has masks, the bathrooms are cleaned after every use, make sure there is plenty of hand sanitizer and ensure there is no singing, because if you sing you have to be 30 feet apart,” Haas said. “You have to ensure people are spaced, and if someone starts coughing in the middle of a service, what are you going to do?”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A coalition of Hawaii nonprofit organizations and social service agencies has urged state lawmakers to enact widespread protections for renters in anticipation of a wave of evictions because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The group of more than 50 organizations said it expects evictions to occur after the $600 weekly federal supplement increase to state unemployment payments expires at the end of July, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Sunday. The coalition that includes the Office of Hawaiian Affairs urged the state Legislature to address the predicted rental crisis when lawmakers convene beginning Monday. The organizations called for policies to minimize the threat of mass evictions across the islands – including the extension of a state prohibition on evictions for months after the pandemic ends, a landlord subsidy program, and a tax credit or deduction for landlords based on reductions in rent. The coalition also recommended instituting a mandatory mediation process to settle landlord and tenant disputes and expunging eviction records if the actions were based in part on back rent or late fees accrued during the pandemic. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that close to 20% of Hawaii’s households have been unable to make housing payments or have little or no confidence they can make upcoming rent or mortgage payments.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho is experiencing a sharp increase in confirmed coronavirus cases, with 544 new cases reported in a five-day span. That brings the state’s total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to more than 4,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University total. Gov. Brad Little ordered a statewide stay-at-home order in late March, and those restrictions have been gradually lifted over the last several weeks. The state is in the fourth and final stage of Little’s reopening plan, with gatherings of more than 50 people allowed. However, the numbers of people becoming infected have climbed as more businesses reopened and more people resumed normal activity levels. One outbreak in the Boise area was tied to young people going to downtown bars as they reopened. Health districts in the Twin Falls region and in eastern Idaho have all seen a recent increase in COVID-19 cases in people under the age of 50, Boise State Public Radio reported. Little has repeatedly said that he would consider renewing some restrictions if cases spike in order to prevent Idaho’s health care system from becoming overwhelmed. But last week he suggested any such decisions could be made on a regional, rather than statewide, basis.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: You can’t use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse not to get married anymore – at least not in Lake County. The 19th Judicial Circuit Court suspended marriages and civil unions in March to protect the health of the public but it was scheduled to start officiating weddings and civil unions – virtually – on Monday. The only requirement for the general public is that at least one member of the couple getting married be a Lake County resident. All active-duty members of the military are also eligible. To have a judge officiate at a virtual wedding, couples must call the county clerk’s office to set up an appointment to apply for a marriage license and then visit the clerk of the local circuit court to pay $10 in cash on the day the license is issued. Couples can go to the Remote Court Hearings section of the 19th Judicial Circuit website for wedding instructions. Even though the wedding is virtual, both members of the couple are required to be somewhere in Lake County during the ceremony.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana doctors have been providing remote care to patients since clinics have closed and government mandated orders have kept people at home during the coronavirus pandemic. The health system is starting to look much different as facilities shift to telemedicine, which allows doctors to meet with patients through video conferencing software, the Indianapolis Business Journal reported. Some doctors said it can speed up diagnosis and treatment. IU Health, the state’s largest hospital system, said its doctors have conducted about 80,000 telemedicine visits this year, a 10,000% increase since the pandemic hit the state in March. Other health care facilities have also seen increases in telemedicine. Ascension St. Vincent said it had 109,000 appointments in April and May, up from about 1,000 in March. Community Health Network said it has conducted nearly 90% of its patient visits by video or phone during the shutdown. Dr. William Bennett, who has an office at Riley Hospital for Children, said nearly three-quarters of his patient visits are now conducted by telemedicine.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City:Amid uncertainty of whether college football games will be played this fall, and how many fans would be allowed to attend, the University of Iowa said Monday it will pause ticket sales at the end of the month. Only fans who have renewed their season ticket orders and paid per-seat contributions by June 30 will be included in any potential Kinnick Stadium seating plans, the university said. By halting ticket orders, the university can take some time to figure out how seating will look at Kinnick before the scheduled Sept. 5 season opener against Northern Iowa. As a result, new sales of the digital season pass, mini-plans and single-games ticket sales will be put on hold. Football tickets typically generate about $23 million a year for the university, roughly 20% of its athletic department budget. If the 2020 season is disrupted, the university said it will provide future credit or ticket refunds.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Embattled Kansas Labor Secretary Delia Garcia resigned Monday amid escalating problems with the state’s unemployment insurance caseload and a record number of jobless claims. Gov. Laura Kelly announced she had accepted Garcia’s resignation and appointed the governor’s Deputy Chief of Staff Ryan Wright to serve in an acting role until a permanent candidate is nominated. The governor said she would take action to address the volume of claims for unemployment insurance, including bringing in specialists to determine how to improve response times for unemployment insurance and implementing new ways to manage the caseload and mitigate backlogs and errors. On June 10, duplicate payments totaling $7 million were made to more than 4,500 claimants of pandemic unemployment assistance and compensation programs. Without consulting the governor, the Labor Department on Thursday began reversing those duplicate payments, a process known as clawback, that caused some bank accounts to be overdrawn. The state Labor Department is working to identify and reimburse people whose accounts were overdrawn. Some Republican lawmakers last month called for Garcia’s ouster, saying she had mismanaged the agency so badly that thousands of people were denied prompt payment of unemployment benefits. But the governor steadfastly defended Garcia, noting the state unexpectedly went from record low to record high unemployment rates when the economy shut down to slow spread of the novel coronavirus. The state’s 40-year-old computer system was unable to keep up with the claims.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The city will benefit from an Accelerator for America grant to help people who have taken financial blows during the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Greg Fischer’s office said. The $50,000 grant will add to the assistance provided through the One Louisville COVID-19 Response Fund, which provides financial relief to eligible people. “One of the many inspiring actions we’ve witnessed during the pandemic is the support and compassion for neighbors in need,” Fischer said in a statement. “This grant from Accelerator for America will provide an additional boost to get much needed support into the hands of residents seeking rental, utility or food assistance.” Louisville is one of 10 communities to receive the grant. The others are Atlanta; Connecticut; Rhode Island; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Dayton, Ohio; Birmingham, Alabama; Oklahoma City; Salt Lake City; and Austin, Texas. Accelerator for America was founded in 2017, according to its website, and “finds and develops solutions to economic insecurity and shares them with cities to create national change from the ground up.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State health regulators have tied at least 100 cases of the new coronavirus to bars near Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and report a new cluster of the illness in the Orleans Parish area. The state Department of Public Health said Friday that bars in an area near the campus called Tigerland are believed to be a major contributor to the outbreak. Anyone who visited bars in that area recently should consider themselves exposed and should self-quarantine for 14 days. People should monitor for symptoms including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea and diarrhea, the health department said. At least three bars – JL’s Place, Reggie’s and Fred’s – have employees who have tested positive for COVID-19, the businesses’ owners told WAFB-TV. Louisiana Department of Health spokeswoman Mindy Faciane confirmed an outbreak investigation is underway involving JL’s Place and Reggie’s Bar. Meanwhile, the owner of Fred’s confirms two of his employees have tested positive for the virus. He said each is recovering at home. In New Orleans, health officials are investigating a new cluster of COVID-19 that is likely linked to a high school graduation party. Health care professionals said they have seen an increase in positive cases at New Orleans mobile testing sites, indicating a possible increase in community spread. Statewide, numbers are rising too. As of Saturday, the state reported 49,385 cases of the disease with almost 3,000 deaths.\n\nMaine\n\nHoulton: Four ambulance crew members and at least two others in the Houlton area tested positive for the novel coronavirus after having contact with a person who exhibited no symptoms, the Maine Center for Disease Control said. Two separate ambulance crews transported the patient first to a hospital in Houlton and then to a hospital in Bangor, the Maine CDC said. The patient tested positive during a routine screening before undergoing surgery at Northern Lights Eastern Maine Medical Center. All four Houlton Ambulance Service crew members tested positive for the virus, as did two others who were close in contact with the crew members or the patient, the Maine CDC said Sunday. In Fort Fairfield, about 50 miles away, the police chief announced Sunday that five members of the town’s fire department and one police officer might have been exposed to the virus during a training exercise It’s unknown if it was related to the Houlton case.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: More than 200 Maryland companies and nonprofits have supported their communities’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday. Companies have helped in ways from sewing face masks, manufacturing personal protective equipment and delivering meals to front-line workers. The businesses include technology firms, local boutiques, restaurants, hotels and biotechnology companies. At least 35 breweries, distilleries, wineries and vineyards have produced hand sanitizer or donated to COVID-19 relief funds, the governor’s office said. More than 20 biotechnology and health care companies are contributing to the global effort to develop tests, vaccines, and treatments.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Restaurants were allowed to start offering indoor dining again, and close-contact businesses including nail salons, tattoo parlors and personal trainers could reopen Monday under the latest phase of Massachusetts’s coronavirus pandemic economic recovery plan. In addition, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was cranking up service again, allowing more people to return to their offices, which are limited to 50% capacity under Gov. Charlie Baker’s reopening plan. Restaurants opening their indoor dining areas must space tables at least 6 feet apart, but bars, unattended buffets and self-serve drink stations will remain closed for now. Parties are limited to a maximum of six people. Workers are required to wear face coverings and must wash or sanitize their hands between table visits. Employees of close-contact businesses as well as their customers are also required to wear masks, and frequently touched surfaces must be cleaned regularly. Personal trainers can see clients by appointment only, and only one person at a time, or two if they are from the same household. After boosting subway and bus service Sunday, the MBTA also increased commuter rail and ferry service Monday. Face coverings will be required on buses, trains and ferries.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor:The fall term at the University of Michigan will open Aug. 31 with a mix of remote learning and in-person classes at the Ann Arbor campus, the school said Monday in its latest response to the coronavirus pandemic. Residence halls will be open, but there will be an emphasis on boxed meals and fewer people in dining rooms. The pandemic has been “substantially contained” in Michigan and other parts of the U.S., although the potential for new infections will continue until a vaccine or drug regimen is developed, said university President Mark Schlissel, who is also a medical doctor. Large classes will be held online, small classes will meet in-person and other classes will be a mix of both. “Some students will choose or need to take all their classes remotely, and we’ll provide a robust set of fully remote classes that will enable most students to make that choice,” Schlissel said. There will be no in-person classes after Thanksgiving. Instruction and final exams from Nov. 30 to Dec. 18 will be conducted remotely. The winter term will start on Jan. 19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Four more Minnesotans died of COVID-19, according to the Monday report from the Department of Health. That is the lowest daily total since April 13, when the daily count was zero and the total death count was 70.The state reported 308 new cases Monday, including three in Stearns County, one in Sherburne and one in Benton County. That makes 2,137 cases in Stearns, 276 in Sherburne and 202 in Benton. There re no new deaths from COVID-19 reported in those three counties. The number of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus reached 33,227 in the state on Monday, and 1,384 people have died, according to the MDH. And 29,065 coronavirus patients no longer need isolation. As of Monday 156 COVID-19 patients in the state were in intensive care and 176 others were hospitalized.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Ashlee Smith, chief executive officer of the Mississippi Wildlife Federation, said the conservation organization will not hold its traditional Mississippi Wildlife Extravaganza because of COVID-19 response guidelines requiring events at convention centers to be limited to 25% of capacity with seating requirements. The event was scheduled for July 24-26. “These guidelines, coupled with the events of the 2019 boycott, have led us to the difficult decision that we need to take a ‘timeout’ from our traditional extravaganza format,” Smith said. “We do plan to host some historic components of the extravaganza live in an outside setting, if the CDC guidelines on COVID allow.” The cause of the boycott was the organization’s one-time position against the Yazoo Backwater Pumps, which were a part of a federal plan to alleviate flooding in the south Delta. But it drew severe backlash from the public following months of flooding in the Delta that displaced families, killed wildlife, destroyed homes and prevented farming in 2019. Attendance at the 2019 event dropped significantly. The federation has since stated it will support the pumps if new data shows wetlands won’t be harmed by them.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A rural area of Missouri’s far southwestern corner is seeing a big spike in coronavirus cases, driving a record increase in cases in the state. Missouri reported 389 new cases on Saturday, but that was topped by the 413 new cases reported Sunday – the highest one-day total since the pandemic began. More than half of those new cases came from one county. The McDonald County Health Department announced 235 new cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, bringing its total to 473. Although the county has just 23,000 residents, only six counties and the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City have confirmed more cases in Missouri. McDonald County Health Department Director Paige Behm said the big increase is the result, in part, of testing at two poultry plants, one operated by Tyson Foods in Noel and the other operated by Simmons Foods in Southwest City. But Behm said the cases extend beyond workers at the plants. “It’s people from all over the community,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s all Tyson or all Simmons.” Behm said the big increase is “very concerning, but I think it’s important that we’ve done a lot of testing to identify, isolate and contact trace so we can kind of see what’s going on in the community. But it’s more widespread than we realized.” Missouri’s health director, Randall Williams, said last week that all 1,400 workers at the Tyson plant were being testing. The state has not released the results of those tests. An email message left with a Simmons spokesman was not immediately returned. McDonald County sits at the border of Arkansas and Oklahoma. Although the number of positive tests has risen dramatically, few people are requiring hospitalization. Mercy Hospital Joplin, the largest hospital in the region, has just seven patients with COVID-19, spokesman Jordan Larimore said.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Tourist spending in and around Yellowstone National Park supported about 7,000 jobs in 2019, according to a National Park Service report released last week. The roughly 4 million people who visited the world’s first national park in 2019 spent $507 million dollars in towns within 60 miles of the park. That doesn’t include Bozeman, which is about 80 miles from Yellowstone’s border, but does include gateway cities West Yellowstone and Gardiner. “The positive economic impacts of Yellowstone are essential to the economies of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho,” said Cam Sholly, Yellowstone superintendent, in the release. “It is important that we continue working with our state and local partners to balance the many benefits of tourism with our continued efforts to protect the world-class resources within the park.” Yellowstone was closed on March 24 for seven weeks this spring to curb the spread of COVID-19. Its Wyoming entrances opened in mid-May and Montana entrances opened June 1. The closure at the beginning of the summer season hurt gateway businesses, but traffic at the park has been steady since its reopening.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska confirmed another 103 coronavirus cases Sunday but no new deaths, according to state health officials. The new cases brings the total known number to 17,810 in the state since the pandemic began. Officials have confirmed 244 virus-related deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles said it temporarily suspended driving tests because of concerns over spreading the novel coronavirus. The announcement that all noncommercial skills tests are suspended came after an examiner at the West Flamingo office in Las Vegas tested positive for the virus. The examiner did not report for work on Wednesday after feeling ill and subsequently tested positive for the virus, the DMV said. On June 15 and June 16, the DMV said, the examiner conducted tests while wearing personal protective equipment that included a face shield, mask, gloves and gown. “We’re taking this brief pause to reevaluate our protocols. Even though our examiners have been wearing personal protective equipment, the driver and the examiner sit in close proximity during a test. We must continue to put the safety of the public and our employees first,” DMV Director Julie Butler said. Driving tests were expected to resume Monday with the added precaution that drivers will also be required to wear a mask. Before the suspension, masks were recommended for drivers but not required, the DMV said. Appointment services were also expected to resume Monday at DMV offices in Las Vegas, Reno, Carson City and Henderson.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state capital is seeing more use of fireworks by private residents than typical, as the coronavirus pandemic has canceled dozens of planned celebrations. New Hampshire had more than 100 fireworks shows last year and about a third that many are scheduled this year, the Concord Monitor reported. Most of those have happened already. The city of Concord is seeing more complaints about fireworks use this year, Police Chief Brad Osgood said. Purchasing fireworks is relatively easy in New Hampshire. Osgood said exercising safety is important.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Salons, barber shops, and massage and tattoo parlors in New Jersey reopened Monday from their COVID-19 pause. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy also announced on Monday that Atlantic City’s casinos would be cleared to reopen on July 2 at 25% capacity. The governor also said that indoor dining would resume the same day, also at 25% capacity. Those are the latest businesses authorized to reopen since the outbreak hit the state in early March. Murphy’s executive order requires that masks be worn inside these businesses and for service to be by appointment only. Murphy has moved the state into Stage 2 of three. He has not said when the third stage would begin.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico’s largest airport has enlisted a robot to help with cleaning in the age of the coronavirus pandemic. KOAT-TV reported that Albuquerque International Sunport is employing an autonomous robot to sanitize spaces in the airport. Airport officials said the robot, dubbed Breezy One, will be employed every night. The device came from Build with Robotics and Fetch Robotics. Fetch Robotics officials said it decontaminates spaces of mover than 100,000 square feet in under two hours. The robot uses a disinfectant developed at Sandia National Labs.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany:New York could team with New Jersey and Connecticut to require travelers from states with high COVID-19 transmission rates to isolate upon their arrival, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Cuomo last week threatened to impose a mandatory quarantine order on travelers from Florida, which is seeing thousands of newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day as New York continues to see declines in hospitalizations and deaths. The Democratic governor offered more detail Monday, saying he has been in discussion with his neighboring states about issuing travel guidance that would mandate a quarantine when someone arrives from any state with a high COVID-19 transmission rate – not just Florida. \"I would consider states with the highest transmission rate, that if somebody comes from that state to New York, then there’s a period of quarantine where they quarantine themselves to make sure they’re not spreading,\" Cuomo said Monday on CNN. Cuomo's comments come three months after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis imposed a similar order on travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, mandating they quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival in Florida.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMarshall:The Madison County Health Department has scheduled another free drive-thru testing event open to all, regardless of their home county or whether they show symptoms, for Wednesday on Blannahassett Island in Marshall from 3 p.m. 5 p.m. Although County Health Director Tammy Cody anticipated the Marshall event would be the county’s busiest yet, she said health department staff would be ready. “We’ve streamlined consent forms and figured out little things after each testing event to have things move smoothly,” she said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Field hospitals set up in North Dakota in preparation for a spike in coronavirus cases have been disassembled. Hundreds of cots and medical supplies were put in place at the University of Mary Fieldhouse in Bismarck and at the Fargodome early this spring in case regular hospitals weren’t able to handle all the coronavirus cases. About two dozen people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in North Dakota, well below the state’s hospital bed capacity. The Bismarck Tribune reported state officials said the cots are in storage and could be reassembled in as little as 48 hours, if needed. State health officials on Monday confirmed 25 new cases of the coronavirus, including seven in Sioux County and five in Cass County. A total of 284 cases are active, down 17 from the previous day. No new deaths were reported.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state continued Monday to defend its right to impose normal signature requirements on ballot issue campaigns amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court, Republican Attorney General Dave Yost’s attorneys argued that a lower court judge who had temporarily relaxed the rules effectively “rewrote Ohio’s Constitution and Revised Code.” The state also argued that changing signature-gathering rules now would lead to “last-minute confusion” and the possible wrongful passage of issues this fall. U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus Jr. set up the more flexible rules in a May 19 decision. They would have allowed campaigns promoting minimum wage, voting rights and marijuana issues to collect signatures electronically. Sargus had also extended the deadline for submitting signatures by about a month, to July 31. The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked those less restrictive rules from kicking in. Justices have been asked to decide whether failing to accommodate ballot campaigns during the time of COVID-19 violates their constitutional right to access Ohio’s ballot. A decision by the justices will no longer help what was the most high-profile of Ohio’s fall ballot campaigns. Ohioans for Safe and Secure Elections, which advanced election-law changes aiming to make voting easier, suspended its campaign last week as its protracted fight to proceed with the effort neared the June 30 filing deadline. Other parties to the case are Ohioans for Raising the Wage, which seeks a statewide vote to raise the state minimum wage from $8.70 to $13 over five years, and backers of placing marijuana decriminalization measures on more than a dozen town and village ballots across the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A day after President Donald Trump held a campaign rally at an indoor arena in the city of Tulsa, the Oklahoma State Department of Health urged anyone who has recently attended a large-scale event to be tested for the novel coronavirus. The department did not specify any event in its news release sent late Sunday. Nearly 6,200 people attended Trump’s rally at Tulsa’s BOK Center on Saturday night. The campaign did not require attendees to wear face masks to guard against the spread of the virus. And just hours before the rally began, the campaign announced that six staffers had tested positive. The state health department recommends that people take a test before and after attending such events and encourages participants to wear face masks and practice social distancing. The Trump campaign handed out masks to attendees as they arrived, but the majority did not wear one, including the president.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Marion County moved into Phase 2 of reopening on Friday; but on Monday, it had its highest number of new coronavirus cases since the pandemic hit in March. The county reported 51 new cases on Monday, setting a record for highest number of new cases and topping the previous high of 37 on May 9. According to Marion County data, the 51 cases came from the 540 tests results returned Sunday, a positive test rate of 9%. The county has had 1,352 total cases and 35 deaths, including one new death announced Monday. A 90-year-old woman in Marion County tested positive on June 18 and died later. Her exact date of death has not yet been made available. The state continued to report high numbers of new cases in the past few days as more counties across the state reopened, with 206 on Friday, 178 on Saturday and 190 on Sunday. Marion County Commissioner Kevin Cameron said a message he received indicated that many of the positive tests were linked to a long-term care facility and the former NORPAC facility on Madrona Ave. in Salem. That facility, which is now owned by Lineage Logistics, was the source of an outbreak between June 5 and June 8 when 11 people tested positive for the virus, according to the Oregon Health Authority. And the message he received indicated more positive test results are anticipated in the coming days.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nChester: Delaware County residents 18 years old or over can get a free coronavirus test outside of City Hall from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday. Those who have health insurance are asked to bring their insurance card. People seeking a test are asked to wear a mask and can drive through or walk up to the testing site.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State Rep. Camille Vella-Wilkinson, D-Warwick, has introduced legislation that would make Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings essential and allow them to be held in person during the coronavirus pandemic and other declared emergencies. “The services provided by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are not only essential, they are necessary for the public health,” Vella-Wilkinson said in a statement Monday. “During the pandemic, AA meetings were designated as a social gathering rather than an essential service, while liquor stores were considered essential and permitted to remain open.” Vella-Wilkinson noted that many people are court-ordered to attend AA meetings. “To consider this service as nonessential when the results can be devastating is not only absurd, it’s reckless,” she said. The bill would also mandate that adequate measures be made to provide the services safely.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An organizer of protests against racial injustice in South Carolina is urging people who participated in recent events to get tested for the new coronavirus. The call from Lawrence Nathaniel of the group I Can’t Breathe SC comes after several group leaders and attendees tested positive, South Carolina news outlets reported. Nathaniel posted a Facebook video Saturday about the danger of COVID-19 to those protesting in the state. Nathaniel said four of his group’s leaders, three photographers and six protesters recently tested positive for the virus. He said testing is vital in light of the state’s recent surge in coronavirus cases. Nathaniel said his group will cancel protests until they’re able to work out a safe way of assembling. Other protesters should be careful about joining protests until they’re sure they’re not spreading the virus, he said. Events canceled include a Sunday art project on Main Street in Columbia called Chalk the Streets, The State reported. Nathaniel said 12 of the artists scheduled to work on specific portions of the project backed out last Sunday morning, including two who contacted him at 2 a.m. to inform him they tested positive for COVID-19. Nathaniel told The Post and Courier Gov. Henry McMaster should “do everything in order to keep the citizens here safe.” For him, the Post and Courier reported, that means a return to a statewide lockdown.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said she will be sending $200 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to city and county governments, but warned the economic impact of the pandemic could last for years. The Republican governor visited the state’s largest city, Sioux Falls, to explain that cities and counties will be able to access the funds based on their population. That means Sioux Falls city leaders can get up to $41.5 million reimbursed for what they spend on addressing the coronavirus. The state has received $1.25 billion from the federal government as part of a relief package for the pandemic, part of which the governor is still hoping can be used to make up losses in tax revenue from the economic downturn. Noem said she was concerned businesses and tax revenue could be hurt in the long-term by the pandemic, especially after federal relief sent to businesses and individuals dries up. “We’re going to start to see the real impact of this virus in the coming days, and we could feel it for up to one to two years,” Noem said. She has said that the state budget that will end on June 30 looks to be in good shape, but that a special legislative session might be called in August to reshape the state’s budget for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. The governor will be touring the state this week, visiting some of the larger cities to dole out the funds. Her visits come amid what Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken called an “appetite, at least in Sioux Falls, for us to get the cash registers ringing again.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city entered another phase of reopening Monday amid a rise in the trend of new COVID-19 cases, but officials said the city will stay in the phase for at least a month. The move comes as Tennessee collectively has seen its new cases of COVID-19 trend upward. The state on Friday reported its biggest single-day increase in positive cases since the pandemic began in March. Nashville’s third phase notably allows event spaces and small music venues to operate at half-capacity, or up to 250 attendees, while bars can open at half-capacity. The remaining closed metro parks and facilities, including playgrounds and basketball courts, can reopen, and camps can operate at full capacity with social distancing. Schools can also open with restrictions. In moving forward, Mayor John Cooper cited Nashville’s testing capacity, contract tracing levels and adequate hospital beds. The phases originally were meant to last two weeks each, though the second phase lasted a month.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:Although calling the rising number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations “unacceptable,” Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday said he has no plans to shut down the state again. “We must find ways to return to our daily routines as well as finding ways to coexist with COVID-19,” Abbott said in a news conference. “Closing down Texas again will always be the last option.” His remarks come a day after Texas set its 10th consecutive record for COVID-19 hospitalizations, with state health officials reporting 3,409 patients in Texas hospitals Sunday. The percentage of tests that come back positive has also continued to increase. The state’s seven-day rolling average rate of positive cases reached 8.8% over the weekend. The rolling rate is calculated by taking a week’s worth of new COVID-19 cases and dividing it by the total tests performed in those seven days. Public health experts said that ideally that number should stay below 6%. “To state the obvious, COVID-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas,” Abbott said, adding the state can do a number of things to slow down increases in certain parts of the state. “It must be corralled.” It was a change in tone for Abbott, who up until his Monday news conference, had insisted that much of the state’s COVID-19 case increases came from batches of additional reporting in certain areas. Although noting that hospitalizations have more than doubled since Memorial Day, Abbott still insisted that Texas hospitals can continue to manage the current rise in cases. “If we were to experience another doubling of those numbers over the next month, that would mean we are in an urgent situation,” which would require new restrictions for the state, Abbott said.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A letter from Washington County School District Superintendent Larry Bergeson is causing some local parents to consider whether they would rather send their children to school in the fall wearing masks or keep them home for online instruction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends wearing face cloth coverings in public settings to help slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Additionally, state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said at a recent media event that in situations like buses, masks are beneficial. Dunn said it will be up to local education agencies whether wearing a mask will be mandated. \"Wearing masks is a simple safety measure than can protect our neighbors,\" said parent Brandon Bonewell, who's planning on sending his children to school if masks are required. \"We all know that kids aren't great at covering their coughs or keeping their fingers out of their noses. A mask will automatically cover that cough and block that finger. ... It's a small inconvenience that may save a few lives.\" St. George resident Rebecca Bushnell said she \"absolutely (does) not support children going back to school wearing masks. ... Watching people wear masks has been a bit of a joke with them either wearing them inappropriately or (constantly) adjusting, which causes cross contamination.\" If masks are required to return to school, her children will be learning online, she said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Legislature hopes to give final approval this week to a state budget for the first quarter of the fiscal year that begins July 1. Lawmakers are also wrapping up legislation to allocate about $1 billion in federal money designed to help the state respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, House Speaker Mitzi Johnson said Monday. The plan is for lawmakers to return in August when they will have more information about state revenue and potential federal assistance to pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year that runs through June 30, 2021, she said Monday. “There is no way we could pass a straight-faced budget right now,” said Johnson, a Democrat. “We just don’t have enough information.” The pandemic prompted the federal government to delay this year’s tax deadline until next month, which means Vermont won’t have a clear revenue picture until after taxes are filed. Johnson said they hoped that by August there will be more information about about what, if any, additional federal assistance might be available to help states make up losses caused by the pandemic. Lawmakers in the House and Senate are wrapping up legislation to allocate almost $1 billion of the $1.25 billion Vermont has received from the federal CARES Act, which is helping states respond to the pandemic. Under the terms of the CARES Act, states must spend the money by the end of the year on coronavirus-related projects that will have immediate benefit. It is separate from the regular state budget. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has criticized the Legislature for not moving faster to disperse the CARES Act funds.\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: Federal workers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be going door to door in two northern Virginia cities to conduct a survey of needs related to the coronavirus pandemic. Manassas and Manassas Park have large Hispanic populations and on a per-capita basis have been some of the hardest-hit jurisdictions in the country with COVID-19 cases. CDC workers were expected to start going door-to-door Monday in the area with a 30-question survey conducted in Spanish. The city of Manassas said the survey will collect information designed to help local health officials understand what resources are needed in the community. The survey is voluntary and will not collect information that can be used to identify individuals.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A Seattle hospital said four staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19 work in or near the facility’s operating rooms. A spokesperson for Virginia Mason Medical Center confirmed the positive tests occurred within the last week, The Seattle Times reported Sunday. After three employees tested positive for the virus, surveillance testing of more than 650 other staff members discovered one additional employee had developed COVID-19. Media-relations Manager Gale Robinette said in a statement that each staff member who tested positive has been treated and will remain at home for at least two weeks in accordance with guidelines issued by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. “We have not identified any risk of exposure to patients, as these team members were always wearing appropriate personal protective equipment while in their presence,” Robinette said. Robinette did not respond to questions concerning the number of patients those staff members came in contact with or whether the patients would be notified and tested.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A coronavirus outbreak linked to a church in southern West Virginia has grown to at least 41 cases, officials said Monday. The caseload connected to the Graystone Baptist Church in Lewisburg increased after several tests came back positive over the weekend, Greenbrier County health officials said in a statement. The state has seen multiple outbreaks this month connected to church services and tourism travel to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Health officials are urging residents to wear face masks and follow safety precautions. Preston County has reported at least 26 cases stemming from trips to Myrtle Beach. Cabell and Kanawha counties have also reported spikes after residents traveled to the popular beach getaway. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has framed reopening as a process of managing risk and said the state can react to virus flare-ups as they emerge. He has lifted most virus restrictions. Sporting events with spectators resumed Monday and fairs can begin again on July 1, under the governor’s reopening plan.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Reopening guidelines for Wisconsin schools released Monday make clear that big changes are in store if and when in-person classes resume. That includes teachers, staff and students wearing masks, classes with no more than 10 students at a time and schedules where buildings are open as few as two days a week, with the bulk of instruction continuing online only. The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction’s 87-page guidance document, dubbed “Education Forward,” is not a mandate for Wisconsin’s 421 public school districts, 26 independent charter schools and 792 private schools. But it does provide a framework for schools to use as they plan for what instruction, both in the classroom and online, will look like in the fall amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “The next school year will be likely be different from the learning environment students and teachers have grown accustomed to,” state Superintendent Carolyn Stanford Taylor said in a statement. Flexibility will be key given that a vaccine for COVID-19 likely won’t be in broad circulation for 12 to 18 months, the recommendations said. The education department stressed that the guidance, the first comprehensive set of recommendations for reopening in the fall, will be ever-evolving as more is known. When schools reopen, it is likely that students and staff will be screened for symptoms; social distancing will be in effect in all settings; and there will be isolation and the timely removal of students and staff who are displaying symptoms, the guidelines said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Two people in Uinta County are in intensive care after contracting COVID-19 amid a coronavirus outbreak that continues to grow, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. The southwest Wyoming county recorded 17 new cases over the weekend, all but one of which came from the Evanston area, according to an announcement from Uinta County Public Health. That brings the county's total to 118. Three people have been hospitalized, two of which are still being treated. Both of those patients – one is over 60, the other is younger – are in intensive care.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/20/child-rock-climber-baby-doll-scare-real-life-robocop-news-around-states/39605105/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGoodwater: A Texas longhorn in this town has set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records for longest horns, with a span wider than the Statue of Liberty’s face. News outlets cite Guinness World Records as announcing last week that Poncho Via’s horns measured just over 10 feet, 7 inches as of last month, beating all previous records. The 7-year-old steer belongs to a family in Goodwater, just southeast of Birmingham. Poncho’s owner Jeral Pope says he brought Poncho into the family when the steer was 6 months old. The organization says the Pope family first noticed the potential of Poncho’s horns when he was about 4 years old and his horns were growing straight out instead of curving upward. Pope says Poncho is a gentle giant with a soft spot for apples, carrots and marshmallows.\n\nAlaska\n\nQuinhagak: Accelerating erosion is forcing villages in western Alaska to begin making plans to move. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports erosion caused by climate change threatens village infrastructure and could force the relocation of communities such as Quinhagak. A 2012 state report listed Quinhagak’s sewer lagoon and multipurpose building as top priorities for replacement or repair because of erosion and thawing permafrost. Officials say erosion now threatens Quinhagak’s airstrip, water treatment plant, and water and sewer system. An official says he does not know how they would close up the lagoon if erosion causes waste to leak into the Kuskokwim Bay, an important food source. Quinhagak has applied for a Bureau of Indian Affairs grant to help with moving and rebuilding the lagoon, which could cost $6 million.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s housing shortage has drawn more attention than ever before in recent months, prompting a stack of dream-big legislation, newly energized activism and a mayoral race that emphasized each candidate’s plan to keep Phoenix affordable. Yet the state continues to slide deeper into unaffordable territory. An Arizona renter with a minimum-wage job must now work 71 hours to afford a modest two-bedroom home, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In the Phoenix metro area, that figure rises to 75 hours of labor. Under a widely accepted standard for affordability, a household should spend no more than 30% of its income on housing costs. The NLIHC report assumes a median two-bedroom rent of $898 across Arizona, rising to just under $1,000 in the Phoenix metro area. The state’s minimum wage is $11 an hour.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has blocked a state law that prevents candidates for state office from accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election. U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. on Monday granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the state from enforcing the blackout period for accepting campaign contributions. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has appealed the order and on Tuesday asked Moody to stay his ruling during the appeal. Attorneys for Peggy Jones, the Pulaski County woman who sued over the restriction, have said the blackout period prevents her from exercising her First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates she wishes to support in the 2022 election.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Park: A Southern California police force is welcoming a robot to the department. Huntington Park police says “HP RoboCop” will provide 360-degree high-definition video footage. It became an official member of the force at a Tuesday evening ceremony. The department says the blue-and-white rolling robot serves as an extra set of eyes for areas such as parks and buildings that police might not have time to patrol. HP RoboCop has been helping to patrol a park in the Los Angeles suburb for several weeks since it was previewed at a 5K run last month. HP RoboCop even has its own Twitter page.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: A 10-year-old Colorado girl has scaled Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan, taking five days to reach the top of the iconic rock formation. Selah Schneiter of Glenwood Springs completed the challenging 3,000-foot climb last week with the help of her father and a family friend. Selah and her dad, Mike Schneiter, say it took them five days last week with family friend Mark Regier to reach the top of the California icon. Selah told KFSN-TV that the group’s method was to do the climb little by little, calling it taking “small bites.” Mike Schneiter told the television station in Fresno, California, that the entire family climbs and that he fell in love with his wife, Joy, 15 years ago while scaling El Capitan.\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: The man who promised to turn himself in if his wanted poster received 15,000 likes on Facebook has made good on his pledge. It just took longer than expected. Torrington police say 29-year-old Jose Simms called Enfield police Wednesday and asked them to pick him up because he was wanted. Enfield police turned him over to Torrington police, who held him on $30,500 bond. Torrington police posted Simms’ poster on Facebook on May 22. He contacted police through the site and agreed to surrender if the post received 15,000 likes. It quickly surpassed that number. Simms was being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on several charges. It couldn’t be determined if he has a lawyer.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: For more than 150 years, members of the city’s Episcopal community were baptized, married and eulogized at the imposing Cathedral Church of St. John in Brandywine Village. This year, after sitting vacant since 2012 due to declining membership and rising maintenance costs, the church will be reborn with a new purpose: housing the elderly. The Ministry of Caring has converted the historic Gothic Revival structure and a priest’s residence on its grounds into 17 apartment units for low- and moderate-income seniors. A new building adjoining the church adds 36 units to the new Village of St. John. The apartments will be offered to residents over the age of 62, with a maximum of four residents per unit and income restrictions determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Georgetown University graduate who launched a project to trace the family histories of hundreds of black slaves sold by the Jesuit college in 1838 and a Boston-based genealogical organization have teamed up to digitize the information and make it available to people researching family histories. The public announcement Wednesday of what’s known as the GU272 Memory Project coincided not only with Juneteenth – the annual observance of the 1865 announcement of the abolition of slavery in America – but also with the anniversary of the 1838 sale of 272 of the more than 300 slaves the Washington, D.C., college sold over a five-year period. In addition to documents, photographs and the indexed genealogies of thousands of descendants, the project includes recorded interviews with dozens of living descendants.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: Boeing says it’s moving the headquarters of its space and launch division to the Sunshine State. The company said Wednesday that it was moving the space division headquarters from Arlington, Virginia, to Titusville on Florida’s Space Coast. Boeing official Leanne Caret says it makes sense to move Boeing’s space headquarters to Florida, where so much space history has taken place. The company also is working on several future launches. Florida is home to the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Patrick Air Force Base. Company officials say the move won’t affect space operations in other states, such as Alabama, California, Colorado, Louisiana and Texas. Boeing spokesman Daniel Beck says the company isn’t saying how many jobs will move to Florida, but the number will be small.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta’s mayor says she hopes to improve the city’s reputation through media coverage and her administration’s initiatives. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms spoke Tuesday at the Atlanta Press Club about her concern that the city is viewed locally and nationwide as corrupt. She asked journalists to be mindful of how their reporting affects the city’s reputation, and she encouraged news leaders to balance coverage of positive and negative stories. Bottoms mentioned launching My Brother’s Keeper in Atlanta – a program created under former President Barack Obama’s administration that pairs boys with mentors. And she spoke about opening a homeless resource center with money remaining after hosting the Super Bowl. She said these efforts and highlighting positive news will make strides in the right direction.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Vacation rental registrations have been coming in to Hawaii County faster than workers can process them. West Hawaii Today reports the county Planning Department processed 226 registrations as of early last week. Paper application forms were stacked in several boxes awaiting processing. The applications are the result of a new law requiring all vacation rental owners in existence as of April 1 to register their property by Sept. 28. Registrants must pay a $500 fee and show that their transient accommodations taxes, general excise taxes and property taxes are paid in full. Vacation rentals are defined as dwellings that are rented for a period of 30 consecutive days or less and where the owner or operator does not live on the building site.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A citizens group is launching an initiative drive to raise the state’s $7.25-an-hour minimum wage. The Idaho Press reports that while lawmakers haven’t raised the minimum wage in a decade, 26 other states have increased theirs in the past five years alone. That includes 17 that raised minimum wages by legislation and nine other states by voter initiative. Idaho is a low-wage state overall, with the average weekly wage in 2018 lower than all but two other states. The group, Idahoans for a Fair Wage, is organizing a signature drive to get an initiative on the ballot. It would raise Idaho’s minimum wage to $8.75 initially, raising it another dollar a year for the next two years. After four years, the wage would be set at $12 an hour, after which increases would be tied to the consumer price index.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A wet spring and dangerous flooding have created a nasty byproduct – more mosquitoes. The Illinois Department of Public Health says the flooding has made conditions ripe for floodwater mosquitoes. They’re also known as nuisance mosquitoes and don’t carry disease like other types. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of public health, says it’s always important to be protected from mosquito bites. She says mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus prefer hot, dry conditions. But nuisance mosquitoes that flourish in wet weather can still pose a threat. A bite from one of them can become infected if it is scratched and becomes a wound. Precautions include avoiding outdoors between dusk and dawn, wearing light clothing over all exposed skin and using approved repellant.\n\nIndiana\n\nWolf Lake: The owner of a small northern Indiana town’s former hospital that’s become a medical museum is looking for someone to take it over. The Luckey Hospital Museum building in the Noble County community of Wolf Lake dates to 1931, when it was opened as a hospital by Dr. James Luckey. After closing in the 1950s, the building was used as a nursing home and apartments before two great-nieces bought it in 2000 and started displaying their collection of medical memorabilia. Shirley Hile, 83, tells The (Kendallville) News Sun that she can’t keep up the museum anymore since her sister died a year ago. Hile hopes a buyer will keep the museum intact. A museum anniversary celebration is planned for July 13.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds says a new social media and advertising campaign is designed to draw attention to the state’s quality of life in hopes of attracting new workers. At the announcement of a newly branded “This is Iowa” campaign, Reynolds unveiled a state-produced video that shows New York City residents being shown photos of properties they assumed were nearby, only to learn they are in Iowa. The video records their shock at hearing the prices for such large, luxurious apartments and houses. Iowa has a chronic worker shortage, and attracting more people is one of Reynolds’ priorities. She held her announcement at a downtown restaurant owned by Alexander Hall, who sold several New York restaurants four years ago and moved to his wife’s native Iowa. He’s now planning his fourth dining location. Reynolds says Hall’s experience demonstrates that when people spend a year or two in Iowa, they stay.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: Officials in this western Kansas city are sweating over a nearly century-old swimming pool that leaks about 200,000 gallons of water every day. The Kansas News Service reports that Garden City water resource manager Fred Jones says the water loss at the Big Pool is excessive, even for a pool that holds about 2 million gallons. Assistant city manager Jennifer Cunningham says refilling the Big Pool costs $1,000 a day, and the city spends up to $800,000 on repairs, staff and water for the pool every summer. She says recoating the deep end of the pool with concrete would cost $750,000, but it wouldn’t be cost-effective. Concrete expands in heat and contracts in the cold, so it breaks down as the seasons change. She supports replacing the pool with a sturdier option.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A project that would bring high-speed internet across the state will be delayed because company representatives say an “abundance” of squirrels have chewed through wiring. Lawmakers in the Capitol questioned reports of ravenous squirrels Tuesday, blocking officials in charge of the KentuckyWired project from borrowing an additional $110 million. KentuckyWired was started in 2015 under former Gov. Steve Beshear to boost Kentucky’s internet infrastructure. Officials are now saying squirrels damaged cable that was supposed to be up and running in April. This isn’t the first time the project has been denied extra funds. In February, lawmakers blocked a request for an additional $20 million for “unanticipated borrowing costs.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Weekend memorial services have been scheduled for singer and musician Malcom “Mac” Rebennack Jr., better known by his Voodoo-inspired stage name, Dr. John. Rebennack, a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, died June 6 at age 77. The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival says memorial services are set for Saturday at the historic Orpheum Theater in downtown New Orleans. Public visitation starts at 7 a.m. and runs until 10:30 a.m. A service running from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Orpheum will be invitation only but will be broadcast on WWOZ FM. There was no immediate word on any music and entertainment stars who might attend. That will be followed by a public “second line parade” that will begin at the theater.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The National Audubon Society is getting involved in a lawsuit over the future of a national monument in the ocean off New England because of the area’s importance to seabirds, especially colorfully beaked puffins. Fishing groups sued in federal court against creation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which former President Barack Obama designated in 2016. The case is on appeal. Court documents show Audubon has moved to file a friend-of-the-court brief in favor of keeping the monument. Lawyers for the fishing groups have said the monument was illegally created by Obama using the Antiquities Act. But the nearly 5,000-square-mile area is especially important to Maine’s vulnerable Atlantic puffins, says Karen Hyun, vice president of coasts for Audubon. The health of the puffin population is a tourism boost for Maine, she says.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A carnivorous plant recently discovered by botanists is the first of its kind in the state. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources announced Tuesday the discovery of a dwarf sundew near Nassawango Creek in Worcester County. It was reported growing in open areas with wet, peaty sand, according to a Facebook post. “Dwarf sundew is an insectivorous plant with a unique way of catching its prey. The paddle-shaped leaves of the sundew form a rosette at the base and are densely covered with hairs that exude a clear, sticky liquid, which attracts and traps various kinds of insects,” the post says. The plant is the smallest native species of sundew in the U.S., according to the post. There are other species of sundew in Maryland, according to DNR. Dwarf sundew is not in the same family as the Venus flytrap, but both are considered carnivorous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials are expanding an early college initiative that allows thousands of students to study and earn college credits before they even graduate from high school. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and state Education Secretary James Peyser announced $900,000 in grants being awarded for programs involving 13 high schools and eight public colleges, starting in the fall. State officials say the early college programs combine traditional high school classes with courses offered by a local college or university, allowing students to focus on an area of study while earning up to 12 college credits at no cost. High schools in Boston, Framingham, Fitchburg, Haverhill, Lynn, Leominster and Marlborough are among those receiving grants and bring to 35 the number of high schools with early college programs.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: Michigan State University was named the most secretive public agency in the United States by the nation’s largest organization of investigative journalists, recognizing what award committee chair Robert Cribb called MSU’s “unrelenting commitment to ensuring transparency was avoided.” Investigative Reporters and Editors named MSU the winner of the Golden Padlock Award at its annual conference in Houston on Saturday. “MSU was nominated for keeping sweeping sexual assault scandals under tight wraps, including serial abuse by disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar and hundreds of student complaints against faculty, staff and students,” IRE Executive Director Doug Haddix wrote in a May 28 letter to acting Michigan State President Satish Udpa. Udpa did not respond to the letter or Haddix’s invitation to attend IRE’s annual awards luncheon.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A leaked email has raised new questions about how state and federal regulators handled a major permit for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The email asks Environmental Protection Agency officials not to file written comments on the water quality permit during Minnesota’s public comment period, which had the effect of keeping the federal regulators’ multiple criticisms out of the public record. The Star Tribune reports the email appears to support accusations by PolyMet’s critics that the two agencies suppressed regulators’ concerns about pollution risks of the mine. The state approved the permit in December. The email from a top Minnesota Pollution Control Agency official was released Tuesday by the union representing employees of the EPA’s regional office in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: Academy Award winner Allison Janney will take the stage at a local theater in a fundraiser for the venue’s restoration project. The Natchez Democrat reports stars from the upcoming film “Breaking News in Yuba County” have volunteered to be in a production at the Natchez Little Theatre on Saturday night. The feature was filmed in Natchez and stars Janney, Mila Kunis, Awkwafina and Regina Hall. The event will feature Janney and a few “surprise” guests. Representatives from the theater’s board of directors say the proceeds would be used for funding youth programs and multiple restoration projects, including a remodel of the theater’s Mayweather Hall. Representatives say they hope to raise $350,000 and have already received donations from “all over the world.”\n\nMissouri\n\nEureka: An endangered wolf pup born at a preservation center near St. Louis has been named in honor of the St. Louis Blues’ Stanley Cup victory. Officials at the Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka said the nearly 8-week-old American red wolf is rare and worthy of celebration, like the hockey win. The pup was named Gloria after the 1982 Laura Branigan hit that became the Blues’ unofficial victory song. Gloria is one of a littler of seven pups born April 23 at the Endangered Wolf Center. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that center director of animal care and conservation Regina Mossotti says there are fewer than 30 American red wolves left in the wild and about 200 in breeding programs. Forty-five of those have been born at the Eureka facility.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A conservation group is opposing planned races on state trails, saying the events would put runners and grizzly bears at risk. The Missoulian reports the U.S. Forest Service has granted a special use permit for a 31-mile ultramarathon in October from Whitefish to the top of Whitefish Mountain and back. The agency is considering a permit for the Foy’s to Blacktail Marathon in September. The trail course sends runner from the Blacktail Mountain ski area to Herron Park. The Swan View Coalition has asked the agency to rescind the permit for the ultramarathon and deny one for the marathon. Coalition chair Keith Hammer says granting the permits would promote risky behavior in bear habitat. Montana Trail Crew co-founder Jimmy Grant says the risks are “very minimal.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Education Department intends to provide school districts with guidance on students’ sunscreen use during the school year. Officials say various districts have wrestled with the issue and sought state direction. Rules vary from district to district. Some require the sunscreen be sent from home and require parents to sign permission notes guiding administrators on application. Some require notes from doctors, and some don’t. Some districts have no policies at all. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the state guidance says children should be allowed to possess and use over-the-counter sunscreen approved by the Food and Drug Administration without doctors’ notes, and the sunscreen need not be stored in the nurses’ office. A department spokesman says the guidance would not be binding on districts.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Silver State residents who live in areas most prone to wildfires could see their electricity intentionally cut. NV Energy already turns off customers’ power during fires when lines are damaged or aren’t working properly. But the utility announced last week that it would turn off power when there’s a high risk of wildfires, too. Chris Hofmann, the utility’s director of grid reliability, says planned outages would lower the odds that an electrical malfunction would spark a wildfire. Up to 15,000 customers in the Lake Tahoe Basin and the Spring Mountains could be subject to the outages. New equipment to monitor weather, fuel moisture and soil conditions has been installed in those areas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Visitors are expected to flock to the state this summer. The New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs says it is expecting to see a 2.7% increase in summer visitations and spending over 2018. As a result, the state is expecting to see about 3.6 billion overnight visitors and for spending to reach $1.9 billion for the summer travel season. As part of an event Tuesday to kick off the summer travel season, BEA Commissioner Taylor Caswell and local tourism partners gathered in downtown Littleton. Along with announcing the summer forecast, the Portsmouth Herald reports they also unveiled their summer marketing campaign, which aims to build on the “Live Free” brand. The department will focus its campaign on the New England market, as well as Canada.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: New Jerseyans are living healthier lives than their peers in other states thanks to lower rates of suicide and alcohol deaths, but opioid fatalities have skyrocketed, according to a report by a research group. The report by the Commonwealth Fund showed New Jersey could make bigger gains if its residents had more access to mental health services. “Their physical concerns are being addressed, but the mental health aspect is not,” says Linda Dayan, 23, of Allenhurst, and a medical student at the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine at Seton Hall University. The Garden State scored highly in the healthy lives category. For example, it had the third-lowest suicide death rate. It had the fourth-lowest alcohol death rate and the fifth-lowest adult-smoking rate. But drug-poisoning deaths have increased by 219% since 2005. They increased just 115% nationwide during that time, according to the report.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A CIA intelligence officer will be working at the University of New Mexico’s campus and will carry a teaching or research load comparable to faculty colleagues, according to a new agreement. The CIA officer is scheduled to arrive at the university in August as part of an ongoing relationship with the agency and the school despites protests from students in previous years, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Under a new contract between the university and the agency, the officer will participate in the academic life of the university just like other professors. Since UNM became a signature school, very few others have publicly identified themselves. Other than the University of New Mexico, the CIA has only publicized signature schools partnerships at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Baruch College in New York City, according to CIA news releases.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Horror and alarm over the discovery of what appeared to be a dead baby at a city park turned to relief and probably some embarrassment Tuesday when the blue-skinned corpse was revealed to be a realistic-looking doll. Police and paramedics rushed to Crocheron Park in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens after a woman out for a morning jog found the “baby” lying face-down in the grass. Detectives descended in droves to look for evidence. A crime scene tent was set up. Yellow tape blocked off the area. Police initially reported the child was 3 months old and had been pronounced dead at the scene. At some point, a closer inspection showed it was a doll or some sort of theatrical prop, its skin apparently colored to resemble decomposing skin. One giveaway was the baby’s T-shirt, which read, “the crawling dead.” The red lettering wasn’t initially visible because the doll was on its stomach.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouthern Pines: Some rising high school seniors do not have their ACT test scores because their answer sheets were never submitted. News outlets report more than 400 students at Pinecrest High School were notified Tuesday that they were affected. School leaders say the missing scores are due to “human error,” and appropriate personnel action has been taken. The school says it plans to administer the test again in the fall at no cost to the students. All juniors took the ACT on Feb. 20 and March 13. Pinecrest High School spokesperson Catherine Murphy says the school learned the tests weren’t submitted when ACT officials said they hadn’t received the answer sheets. Moore County Schools says it’s looking into security, processes and protocols for giving tests like the ACT.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials have confirmed the presence of zebra mussels in Lake Ashtabula. The state’s Game and Fish Department says an angler discovered a suspected zebra mussel last week and turned it in. Subsequent inspections found populations of zebra mussels of various ages throughout the lake. Lake Ashtabula is an impoundment on the Sheyenne River in Barnes and Griggs counties. It’s operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and open for boating, swimming, fishing, camping and skiing. The Game and Fish Department has now classified Lake Ashtabula and the Sheyenne River downstream all the way to the Red River as Class I aquatic nuisance species infested waters. Emergency rules go into effect immediately to prohibit moving water away from the lake and river, including water for transferring bait.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will help wrap up nearly a week’s celebration of the 50th anniversary of the famous 1969 Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio. Kennedy’s scheduled remarks Sunday come as part of Cleveland’s celebration of environmental science and sustainability half a century after the June 22, 1969, fire. The blaze became the iconic event of the U.S. environmental movement. Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy, is president of Waterkeeper Alliance. The nonprofit environmental group fights to defend the fire-inspired Clean Water Act. Sunday’s celebration includes free afternoon admission to the Great Lakes Science Center, where shows will explore the properties of water and combustion. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is hosting live music. A ticket is required to tour the Rock Hall.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Mayor David Holt has declared the city’s first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Holt helped kick off a week’s worth of events Monday with a mayoral proclamation to “reaffirm our city’s commitment that all people are welcome in Oklahoma City.” Others who joined the kickoff included Councilman James Cooper, who became Oklahoma City’s first openly gay councilman when he took office in April. Festivities include a parade Saturday that will roll by businesses catering to LGBTQ clientele along a stretch of road that was part of historic Route 66. Pride celebrations are happening throughout the U.S. in June, which also marks 50 years since a clash with police at the Stonewall Inn in New York became a catalyst for expanding LGBT activism nationwide and abroad.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The loss of public funding at one of the city’s homeless shelters will leave about 80 women needing a new place to stay in late July. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Salvation Army gave incomplete answers on a new application for taxpayer money, leading to the loss of funding. The Salvation Army Female Emergency Shelter started getting money in 2008 from the city, but the Joint Office of Homeless Services, created as the city and Multnomah County consolidated homeless services, devised a more robust application process. Salvation Army’s Oregon and Southern Idaho operations CEO Nancy Dihle says officials were unprepared for the rigor of the process and hope to be more competitive next time. The closure won’t reduce the total number of homeless shelter beds as new shelters open this summer and temporary shelters are extended.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is permanently recognizing Juneteenth, the cultural holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved black people in the United States. Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed legislation designating June 19 as Juneteenth National Freedom Day. Most states recognize it, and Pennsylvania lawmakers typically recognize the day by passing nonbinding resolutions. The celebration started with the freed slaves of Galveston, Texas. Although the Emancipation Proclamation declared slaves in the South free in 1863, it couldn’t be enforced in many places until after the Civil War ended in 1865. It was June 19, 1865, when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and his Union troops arrived at Galveston with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Under the law, employers aren’t required to treat June 19 as a legal or official holiday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWest Warwick: The Catholic Diocese of Providence is merging two of its parishes. WJAR-TV reports that St. Mary Parish and SS John and James Parish of West Warwick will merge July 1. The diocese said in a press release Monday that a decline in attendance and key retirements played a role in the decision. The diocese says St. Mary Parish is serving 150 people, a smaller number than a viable parish should have. St. Mary has also seen a decline in sacramental practices like weddings, baptisms and First Holy Communions, and the current pastor is retiring soon. St. Mary Parish was built in 1850 and is the oldest Catholic church building in use in the diocese. It will remain open for daily Mass and other liturgical celebrations.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Jennifer Pinckney was hiding under a desk holding the mouth of her then-6-year-old daughter when Dylann Roof fired more than 70 rounds in Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, killing nine black worshippers. The new documentary, “Emanuel,” explores life after the June 17, 2015, shooting, as family members, friends and the community try to heal through faith and forgiveness. The Rev. Clementa Pinckney was killed by Roof. Jennifer Pinckney and her daughter were in her husband’s office when they heard gunshots in another room. Pinckney says watching the film is “emotional. I can’t help but to relive what happened.” “Emanuel,” which opened in theaters nationwide for a limited run Monday and Wednesday, is executive produced by Viola Davis and Steph Curry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A year after an independent safety review of Falls Park recommended more viewing platforms, walkways and railings, construction on those amenities is nearing completion. In June 2018, three months after a 5-year-old Iowa girl drowned at the park after falling into the Big Sioux River, an outside consultant hired to study safety protocols furnished a report to city officials outlining ways to reduce drowning risks at Falls Park. That led Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and the City Council in July to set aside $300,000 in leftover cash from the previous year’s budget for the design and construction of a “lower falls viewing area” with two platforms and railings that are tied into the park’s walkways with sidewalks. Mike Patten, a park development specialist for the city, says work on the project is expected to wrap up within the next couple weeks if weather cooperates.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis Brooks Museum of Art this week opens an exhibition devoted to a man once cherished and later scorned as “the most popular painter in the United States.” The paintings range from confectionary scenes of huggable cherubs “with cute little rosy cheeks and pudgy little legs” to a violent tableau in which “women are about to be taken away by centaurs to be raped,” in the words of new Brooks associate curator Rosamund Garrett. Titled “Bouguereau & America,” the exhibition contains 39 paintings by William Adolphe-Bouguereau (1825-1905), the French academic artist who became a millionaire in the era of the robber barons when his detailed, idealized, sentimental and teasingly sensuous canvases became prized by wealthy American collectors. Organized by the Brooks and the Milwaukee Art Museum, the exhibition is the first major Bouguereau show in North America since 1984.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A program meant to help restore storm-battered Galveston Bay oyster beds has gained support from a statewide conservation initiative founded by former first lady Laura Bush. The Galveston County Daily News reports Texan by Nature has picked Galveston Bay Foundation’s oyster shell recycling program as one of six programs across the state worthy of its support over the next year with the hope of expanding the program’s reach. Along with programs aimed at conserving wetlands, cleaning up rivers and preserving other natural systems, the oyster shell program has been named a Conservation Wrangler by Texan by Nature, which Bush founded in 2011. The nonprofit group’s mission is to bring together business and conservation leaders in Texas who believe the state’s prosperity depends upon conservation of natural resources.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah judge says the time has come to let a community board have final decision-making authority about who is entitled to buy homes and properties in a trust that once belonged to Warren Jeffs’ polygamous sect, ending court oversight that began 14 years ago. Judge Richard McKelvie made his ruling Tuesday despite hearing from attorneys for past and current members of the polygamous group who argued that court oversight is still necessary because the board picks favorites and isn’t transparent enough. Utah seized control of the trust in 2005 due to allegations of mismanagement by Jeffs and other sect leaders. A board of trustees formed in 2013 has overseen the resale of more than 200 homes and buildings to people with ties to the community on the Utah-Arizona border.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: Gov. Phil Scott has signed a bill aimed at getting Vermont veterans who have served overseas to sign up on a national registry that tracks symptoms of those who have suffered from burn bit exposure. The bill requires the state health commissioner and adjutant general to work together to develop and make available information about the possible health effects of being exposed to chemicals from burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. Officials will contact all known veterans and ensure they have access to the registry and other resources. Scott signed the bill Monday at the Woody William Gold Star Families Memorial Monument in Northfield. He gave particular thanks to June Heston, whose husband, Gen. Mike Heston, died of cancer last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Experts say southeastern Virginia could suffer $40 billion in losses if it’s struck by a major hurricane. Professors from Old Dominion University said in a recent report that the damages could seriously puncture the regional economy. The June 12 report said losses could equate to 40% of Hampton Roads’ gross domestic product. GDP is a measure of an economy’s health and accounts for the total output of goods and services. The report predicted a loss of 175,000 jobs and a decline in economic activity if the region’s infrastructure and military installations suffer major damage. The report was put together by the Commonwealth Center for Recurrent Flooding Resiliency. The center was established by Old Dominion University, the College of William & Mary and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The state’s apple industry expects exports to India to slow down even more after the country tacked on a 20% retaliatory tariff, bringing the total duty to 70%. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports India added the tariff to apples and 27 other American products Sunday after the U.S. ended a preferential trade program with the country earlier this year. India had imported 7.8 million 40-pound boxes of the state’s 2017 apple crop by June 2018. It imported a record 8 million boxes by the end of season. It has imported 2.6 million boxes of the 2018 crop since last week. Northwest Horticultural Council President Mark Powers says the apples could depress prices for all growers if the industry cannot find alternative export markets.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain State residents eat more hot dogs per capita – and fewer hamburgers – than any other state, according to a study by 24/7 Wall Street. West Virginia was served the dubious distinction with an estimated 481 hot dogs eaten per person annually, trailed by No. 2 Illinois with 317 hot dogs and Pennsylvania with 289. Meanwhile, the study found that West Virginians eat about 171 hamburgers per capita each year, the fewest among all states. The study used data from Google Trends, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to estimate the number of hot dogs and hamburgers eaten annually in each state based on restaurant sales and 2017 populations.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has passed a bill that would limit the regulation of 5G, or “small cell,” technology. The bill approved Tuesday now heads to Gov. Tony Evers for his consideration. The Senate passed the bill 25-5 earlier this month. The proposal creates a statewide regulatory framework for the 5G technology, including provisions about where the small wireless facilities can be placed, height and size restrictions, and other requirements. In general, the bill prohibits local governments from regulating certain communications services or charging fees on infrastructure to support it. Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Kuglitsch said Wisconsin has been at a competitive disadvantage because neighboring states have already enacted similar laws. Supporters are calling for quick action to get the technology in place, especially before Milwaukee hosts the Democratic National Convention next year.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Nearly 100 people expressed opposition to any thought of demolishing the historic Cooper House on the University of Wyoming campus to make way for new student dormitories. The Laramie Boomerang reports that residents from across Wyoming had been mobilized in recent weeks after hearing that aask force working on a new student housing plan had discussed the possibility of tearing down the building. The task force heard more than an hour of public comment Monday, all from people who were opposed to Cooper House being demolished. Task force chairman Steve Harshman says he doesn’t think the Cooper House is in danger of being demolished. The Cooper House was built in the 1920s and was once visited by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/28/cheetah-run-mountain-man-biathlon-prodigal-emu-news-around-states/41078179/", "title": "Cheetah run, mountain-man biathlon: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A new project at the state’s main seaport will open the facility to the shipment of finished automobiles. The Alabama State Port Authority says it has signed a deal to build a $60 million automotive terminal in Mobile. It’s supposed to be ready early next year and will allow for vehicles to roll on and off ships. The 57-acre terminal will be able to handle 150,000 vehicles annually with connections to rail service and highways, officials say. Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Honda currently make cars in the state, and Mazda-Toyota is building a factory in north Alabama. A docks official says the new terminal will open a new business stream for the docks. The project is a joint venture between Terminal Zarate, S.A., a Grupo Murchison company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Neltume Ports, based in Santiago, Chile.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Legislators have proposed changes to key elements of the state’s Village Public Safety Officer Program. About 1 in 3 communities in the state has no police of any kind, Anchorage Daily News reported last week in partnership with ProPublica. The Department of Justice subsequently declared the public safety gap a federal emergency, officials said. The 40-year-old program uses state money to train and pay officers working in remote villages, but the number of officers fell to a record-low 38 compared to the more than 100 in 2012, legislators in the working group said. The working group spent five months seeking ways to fix the program, which includes placing more certified officers in rural Alaska, increasing morale among current officers and retaining village-based first responders who know their communities best, legislators said.\n\nArizona\n\nQueen Creek: A company’s proposal to take water from farmland along the Colorado River and sell it to this growing Phoenix suburb has provoked a heated debate, and some Arizona legislators are trying to block the deal with a bill that would prohibit the transfer. The legislation introduced by Rep. Regina Cobb would bar landowners who hold “fourth-priority” water entitlements from transferring Colorado River water away from communities near the river. Cobb said this water was supposed to be used for agriculture, and diverting it elsewhere would harm farming communities along the river. “We just needed to get ahead of it and let them know that we’re not for this,” said Cobb, R-Kingman. Cobb said without legislation, she’s concerned hedge funds will try to make more deals to use farmlands for selling off water.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Forrest L. Wood, who created one of the top brands in the boating industry and was a pioneer of bass tournament fishing, has died at age 87. Wood, born in Flippin, Arkansas, founded the company Ranger Boats in 1968 with his wife, Nina. The business quickly grew and became a household name among fisherman around the U.S. He sold the company in 1987. Wood was known as the “father of the modern bass boat.” Keith Daffron, his grandson, said in a Facebook post that Wood died Saturday surrounded by his family, after a brief illness. In a statement, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wood’s death “is a deeply sad moment for our entire state.” Former President Bill Clinton said in a statement that Wood was “ambitious and determined and Arkansas is a better place because he fully invested his time and his talents right here.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Former Gov. Jerry Brown wants to know who is trying to sell his father’s memorabilia related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Private letters and other items that had belonged to Edmund G. “Pat” Brown when he was governor are being offered by the auction house Sotheby’s, which estimates the value at $20,000 to $30,000. Sotheby’s says the seller wants to remain anonymous. The elder Brown, who died in 1996, was California’s top elected official from 1959 to 1967, and eight years later his son started the first of his record four terms as governor. Jerry Brown says he was not consulted or informed of the sale and believes the items should instead reside at the University of California, Berkeley, “with the rest of my father’s papers.” Sotheby’s touts Brown’s materials for sale as unique because “it comes from a single source” and “chronicles a country in mourning.” The auction opened Monday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped to 2.5% in December, the lowest level in at least 44 years. An unemployment rate of 2.6% in October and November tied the previous record-low rate in early 2017. The lowest rate before that, 2.7%, occurred in 2000, The Denver Post reports. Yuma and Kiowa counties in northeastern Colorado had the nation’s lowest seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 1.1% in December. Low unemployment is better than high unemployment but can make it hard for employers to find workers, economist Gary Horvath said. “We are in uncharted territory,” Horvath said. “I’m baffled by how companies are making this work.” Colorado has averaged about 84,000 job openings a month since 2001. Colorado had about 150,000 openings in September but only 85,000 people unemployed and seeking work, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Voters who are registered with one party but want to vote in a different party’s presidential primary are facing a key deadline. Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said those voters must change their registration by Tuesday. Voters can look up and check their current registration status online and make any changes at myvote.ct.gov/register. Unaffiliated voters, the state’s largest block of voters, have until April 23 to register with a party online, by mail or at the Department of Motor Vehicles if they want to participate in that party’s presidential primary. They have until April 27 to register in person. Connecticut’s Democratic and Republican presidential primary elections are scheduled for April 28. There are currently 2,192,828 active voters registered in Connecticut. Of those, 895,218 are registered as unaffiliated, 803,802 as Democrats, 459,403 as Republicans and 34,405 in some other party.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: This tiny coastal town’s environment committee held its first discussion last week on ways to reduce plastic intake. Committee members are in the early stages of suggesting various restrictions on plastic, from banning materials outright to putting a fee on others. Along with Wilmington and Newark, Rehoboth is the “farthest along” in reducing plastic use, like charging a fee for single-use bags, says Dee Durham, president of Plastic Free Delaware. The environment committee is eyeing single-use plastic bags, plastic straws and polystyrene, which Durham calls the “low-hanging fruit” of plastic products, meaning they are typically easier to restrict. Last year, state lawmakers chose to ban single-use plastic bags at large retailers. That law, which goes into effect in 2021, doesn’t really impact Rehoboth Beach because it generally applies only to stores 7,000 square feet or bigger or ones with three or more Delaware locations at least 3,000 square feet.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A male harbor seal considered geriatric for his species has died at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. Luke, 35, was humanely euthanized last week, according to a statement. The zoo said he outlived the median life expectancy for his species – 25 years in the wild and 30 years in human care. Luke had been experiencing ocular discomfort and had trouble orienting himself recently, according to the zoo’s statement. He had also experienced a loss of appetite and an unusual lack of interest in training with keepers and socializing with other animals. Animal care staff decided to euthanize him after trying several methods to treat his symptoms. Luke was born June 17, 1984, at New York Aquarium in Brooklyn, and he came to the nation’s capital in 2011, the statement said. He didn’t father any pups, according to news outlets, but lived at the zoo’s American Trail habitat with another male harbor seal and a gray seal colony.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: Residents in an upscale community are seeing red over a paint job on a half-million-dollar home. The home was painted in large patches of extremely bright primary colors with random splatters throughout. The home in the Il Regalo Circle Community in Naples resembles a preschool play toy or cartoon home. Even the trees, lawn and mailbox were splattered with paint. Neighbors said the paint job got worse over the course of a week. WBBH News reports that Collier County Code Enforcement are investigating the paint job. Jeffrey Leibman, 40, is listed as the owner of the home, according to property appraiser records. Neighbors said he painted it, but the management company for the neighborhood said he no longer lives there. The company estimated that reversing the paint job could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is proposing that the state borrow nearly $900 million for construction projects and equipment next year, an amount likely to rise before lawmakers get done with the budget. Key projects in the Republican governor’s plan include $70 million to expand the state-owned convention center in Savannah and $55 million to build a new headquarters for the Department of Public Safety in Atlanta. Lawmakers authorized borrowing of nearly $1.1 billion last year. The agency that forecasts Georgia’s borrowing said the state could issue up to $1.2 billion in bonds this year. In one shift, Kemp wants to move more funding to aid school construction from districts statewide to those that have small property tax bases. Kemp would borrow $155 million for construction in such low-wealth districts, up from $44 million this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State lawmakers have proposed initiatives to help reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities after transportation officials confirmed more than 100 deaths in the past year. Those initiatives include installing traffic cameras to capture drivers running red lights, and enforcing zero-tolerance policies for drinking and driving, Hawaii News Now reports. “Every year, you hear of a horrific pedestrian accident that’s occurring at an intersection because someone did not stop at a red light,” state House Speaker Scott Saiki said. The cameras would automatically record anyone who runs a red light, and a ticket would then be mailed to the address associated with the license plate number, officials said. “There could potentially be a bench warrant for someone who doesn’t appear or who doesn’t respond to the ticket,” Saiki said. “And if you have a bench warrant, potentially there could be some jail time.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two environmental groups have given notice that they intend to file a lawsuit to stop a proposed underground natural gas pipeline from Idaho to Wyoming that the groups say will harm protected grizzly bears and other wildlife. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection sent a required 60-day notice to sue to the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week. The groups contend the Forest Service’s approval of the pipeline project in November violated the Endangered Species Act. The groups also say the 18-mile portion of the 50-mile pipeline would cut a corridor through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and create a road through six Inventoried Roadless Areas. The 2001 Roadless Rule prevents road construction and timber harvest in designated roadless areas, which are typically 5,000 acres or larger.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The story of a boy who grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s family and later presided over one the nation’s larger retailers will be told in the annual George L. Painter Looking for Lincoln Lecture. Julius Rosenwald spent his formative years in the shadow of the future president and grew up to be president of Sears, Roebuck & Co. He used the fortune he amassed to help those who faced racial injustices. His life will be recalled as part of the annual lecture series at 8:30 a.m. Feb. 12 at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. It’s presented with the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area, which preserves the history of the central Illinois communities touched by Lincoln’s life. The Rosenwald home, part of the Lincoln historic site, will be renamed in his honor and an exhibit panel about his life and legacy unveiled.\n\nIndiana\n\nJasper: A one-room schoolhouse where the last lessons were taught in early 1950s has been dismantled after efforts to find a buyer for the small building failed. The Dick School had educated generations of Dubois County residents in rural Jasper from 1892 to 1951. But a few weeks ago, the shed-like building was taken down piece by piece in the city about 40 miles northeast of Evansville. The weatherboard structure with a tin roof was moved to a new location after it was closed, and it had remained in good shape. Robin Pate, the current owner of the property on which it stood, had advertised the old schoolhouse and reached out to the Dubois County Historical Society. But Pate couldn’t find any takers for the school, which had been the region’s last functioning one-room schoolhouse, The (Jasper) Herald reports. She’s selling the 2-acre site on which the building stood.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The leaking inflatable dam on the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo has been fixed, officials said. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports contractors found a slit in the half-inch-thick rubber and repaired it. Associate city engineer Wayne Castle said the final cost of the project will be significantly below the original $388,350 contract approved in November with J.F. Brennan Co., of La Crosse, Wisconsin. “We’re not completely done yet, but we should be just under $220,000,” Castle said. A major reason for the lower cost was that a marine contractor was able to use divers to inspect the riverbed on the downstream side of the dam, Castle said. The original contract anticipated the contractor building a more expensive wall around the inspection area. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It’s usually inflated in June and deflated in October.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: An effort is underway to more fully tell the story of a boulder that was a sacred prayer rock for a Native American tribe before it was moved to Lawrence and inscribed with the names of the city’s founders. The Lawrence Journal-World reports Pauline Eads Sharp, who serves as secretary and treasurer of the Kanza Heritage Society, and Lawrence artist Dave Loewenstein are leading a wide-ranging team of people, including historians, geologists, artists and filmmakers, to increase interest in the 23-ton red quartzite Shunganunga boulder. At issue is that there currently is no mention on the boulder-turned-monument of the Kanza tribe, which was forcibly removed to Oklahoma in 1873. The approximately yearlong project, called Between the Rock and a Hard Place, will include research, community workshops and the creation of a documentary film and book.\n\nKentucky\n\nHopkinsville: A prosecutor has been absent from court in the weeks following the release of the letter in which he asked former Gov. Matt Bevin to pardon a man convicted of sexual abuse. Two judges in Christian County said there is an agreement between them and Commonwealth’s Attorney Rick Boling that he remain absent from their courtrooms for the “foreseeable future,” The Kentucky New Era reports. Dayton Jones was granted a commutation by Bevin on Dec. 9. The letter Boling wrote on official letterhead Dec. 7 asking the former governor to pardon Jones was released Jan. 9. Boling apologized after it was released. Jones pleaded guilty in 2016 to sodomy, wanton endangerment and distribution of matter portraying a sexual performance by a minor. Boling wrote in his letter to Bevin that the prosecution of Jones was politically motivated. He said the case involved intoxicated teenagers and people in their early 20s “being stupid and immature.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Fans of the late Louisiana author Ernest J. Gaines, who wrote such storied works as “A Lesson Before Dying” and “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” are gathering to remember his work as part of Black History Month celebrations. The Louisiana Center for the Book in the State Library of Louisiana is hosting the discussion Feb. 19, according to a news release from Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser. Gaines died Nov. 5, 2019. He grew up on a small Louisiana plantation, experiences that later translated into his rich literary characters. “A Lesson Before Dying,” published in 1993, was an acclaimed classic. Both “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman” (1971) and “A Gathering of Old Men” (1984) became honored television movies. The program will be hosted by Darrell Bourque, who is a two-time Louisiana poet laureate, a close friend of Gaines and a member of the Ernest J. Gaines Center.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Finance Authority of Maine’s board on Monday approved loan guarantees and a loan necessary for a Boston investment group to proceed with purchasing Saddleback Mountain and reopening the area to skiers next winter. The board unanimously approved $2.5 million in loan insurance on a $12.5 million loan, which was smaller than the original request, along with a $1 million direct loan. Arctaris Impact Fund also raised private funds and received a separate $1 million loan through the Maine Rural Development Association. The finance authority and rural development funds will be part of a $23.5 million funding package that includes private equity, new market tax credits, community loans, and community grants for the purchase of Saddleback, officials said. Bruce Wagner, CEO of FAME, said the agency is pleased to “help restart this historic and beloved Maine ski mountain.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Singer and recording artist CeCe Peniston – who released her signature dance hit, “Finally,” in 1991 – will be the headline entertainer and grand marshal for the city’s first organized LGBTQ+ pride celebration, according to Salisbury’s branch of PFLAG, the United States’ first and largest LGBTQ+ ally organization. The city made the announcement in a video on Facebook. The lovably corny clip features Mayor Jake Day vibing to Peniston’s “Finally” in the city government offices. Peniston rose to fame in the early 1990s, when she rapidly become one of the most successful dance club artists in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play Charts, according to her official website. Salisbury PFLAG announced the city’s inaugural Pride Parade and Festival on National Coming Out Day last October. The event is set for 11 a.m. Sunday, June 7.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has received more than $160 million from federal immigration authorities since 2012, most of which went to four county jails in exchange for housing and transporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, according to a report in The Boston Sunday Globe that cited documents obtained through a public records request. Advocates and immigration attorneys oppose the agreements with the jails. They say the payments are a waste of taxpayer money, and there are better alternatives to deal with people facing federal immigration charges. The sheriff’s offices for Plymouth, Bristol, Franklin, and Suffolk counties that run the jails have defended the arrangements, with at least two saying their relationship with ICE has made Massachusetts safer. But Matt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration lawyer, said there was “no good public safety justification” for local sheriff’s departments to house ICE detainees.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Home values are projected to increase by an average of 20% across most of the city’s neighborhoods, according to Mayor Mike Duggan. Residential assessments for 2020 also show that property values are up 30% in several parts of the city. The city said that the figures are based on two years of actual market sales and that homeowners are protected by a 2% cap on property tax increases as long as ownership has not changed. Property owners can appeal assessments until Feb. 22. Detroit residential property values rose an average of 13% last year. “This is great news for Detroit homeowners, particularly those who held on to their properties and stayed in the city,” Duggan said. “Home values in nearly every neighborhood are rising and helping to build new wealth, without significant tax increases. This shows as clearly as anything that the city’s revitalization has reached nearly every corner of our city.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has planted hundreds of trees in the past few years in an effort to green up downtown, but many aren’t surviving past their first year. City staff have been trying to figure out why, and they think they might have found the culprit: salt. Soil tests show that salinity levels in some of the planting spots are much higher than what’s ideal for trees to thrive, said Ben Shardlow, director of urban design for the Minneapolis Downtown Council and the Downtown Improvement District. Salt is used liberally in downtown Minneapolis to keep sidewalks and parking lots clear of ice. After the ice melts, the extra salt left behind piles up or gets pushed to the side – sometimes directly into the places where the trees are trying to grow. For three years in a row, a tree census showed only half of the trees the city planted had survived, Shardlow told Minnesota Public Radio News.\n\nMississippi\n\nIndianola: A historical marker will commemorate the legacy of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. Research for the project was led by a Mississippi Valley State University student and professor, the Greenwood Commonwealth reports. C. Sade Turnipseed is an associate professor of history, and 17-year-old Nigerian native Brian Diyaolu took her public history course during the fall semester. They recently received approval from the Sunflower County Board of Supervisors to place the Hamer sign in front of the county courthouse. It will be unveiled during a ceremony March 27. Students in Turnipseed’s course are assigned a historical topic, and Diyaolu’s was Hamer. He said he wrote three drafts of the historical marker’s narrative before pitching the idea to the supervisors. He said other students helped him edit the narrative and prepare the presentation. Hamer was born to sharecroppers in Montgomery County on Oct. 6, 1917.\n\nMissouri\n\nCreve Coeur: The St. Louis Holocaust Museum & Learning Center will triple in size with an $18 million expansion as officials seek to reach even deeper into issues of bias, bigotry and hate. Details about the expansion were announced Monday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Officials hope to make the building more visible and accessible. The museum, in the suburb of Creve Coeur and operated by the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, draws 30,000 annual visitors, about two-thirds of whom are students. Admission is free. Museum officials are in touch with about 30 Holocaust survivors who live in the St. Louis area. Monday’s announcement came on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The museum’s new executive director, Sandra Harris, says groundbreaking will be in May, and the goal is to finish by the end of 2021.\n\nMontana\n\nIsmay: U.S. Postal Service officials say mail service will resume in this town where a fire destroyed the post office. The fire in early January has prompted some residents of Ismay to worry about their mail. Since the fire, they’ve taken turns dropping off and picking up mail in a town almost 20 miles away. Postal officials plan to put a mailbox in a community center in tiny Ismay, population 20, Postal Service spokesman James Boxrud says. Meanwhile, property owners Rita and Gene Nimitz tell the Billings Gazette they’re making tentative plans to rebuild the post office, which dated to the 1920s. A faulty furnace or electrical wiring is believed to have started the blaze.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city’s school district is about to take a major step in the recovery from a fire that destroyed the district office more than eight years ago. The school board is expected to vote next month on a nearly $1.15 million construction project agreement to build a backup data center, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. It’ll be constructed in the basement of the building built to replace the office burned in May 2011. The blaze was started by a disgruntled teacher who was later sentenced to prison for arson. The fire wiped out nearly everything in the building, including severely damaging the computer system that held email servers, grades, payroll and other records. District officials worked with University of Nebraska-Lincoln information technology staff to get the data system back online. The district built an off-site data center near Lincoln High School about a year later. The district wants the backup data center finished this summer.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Local tourism officials have canceled several activities tied to the launch of a new city slogan in the wake of basketball star Kobe Bryant’s death. A 60-second spot touting the “what happens here, only happens here” campaign aired during the Grammy Awards as planned Sunday night, but other plans were postponed. The new slogan is a play on the longtime saying that “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.” The city had intended to display the new slogan on more than two dozen hotel and casino marquees on and around the Strip. Instead, most resorts showed messages of grief. They included “L.A., OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO YOU” and “#RIPKOBE.” Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said all the planned activities will take place at a future date. But Bryant, his daughter and the other lives lost in a helicopter crash were too much on everyone’s minds.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State health officials are seeking input on whether the state needs a residential treatment facility for youth with mental health and addiction issues. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued a request for information about the opportunities and challenges associated with establishing a psychiatric facility that would provide the highest level of care next to an acute psychiatric hospital. The state’s only youth drug and alcohol treatment center closed last month after a spate of nonfatal overdoses. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu says a new facility would ensure that young people struggling with addiction, mental illness or both get the right level of care in a safe environment. The deadline for submitting information is Feb. 24.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled a sweeping energy plan Monday that sets goals for shifting the state to 100% clean energy by 2050. The first-term Democratic governor announced the plan at Stockton University alongside two Cabinet officials who will be carrying the plan out, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe and Board of Public Utilities President Joe Fiordaliso. Murphy cast climate change as an urgent concern and pointed to a Rutgers study that indicated the state could see 1 foot of sea level rise in the next decade. “Quite frankly it will be hard for future generations to create their Jersey Shore memories if the Jersey Shore is only a memory,” Murphy said. The plan calls for reducing the use of fossil fuels while increasing renewable sources of energy. New Jersey currently gets 94% of its electricity from natural gas and nuclear plants, according to the U.S. Energy Department.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A former state lawmaker’s emu that has been missing since Thanksgiving is safely back at its home near the city. Former state Rep. Brad Cates learned his emu had resurfaced last week thanks to a barrage of images people shared on social media. Pictures of the large bird around a subdivision near Cates’ home prompted inquiries from a state livestock inspector and a game warden. Later Sunday, Cates with some help corralled the 150-pound emu named “Hey You!” Cates was also the Republican nominee for Dona Ana County district attorney in 2016. He lost to Mark D’Antonio.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State taxpayers could decide to contribute to a fund that helps pay for abortions under a proposed bill. State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblymember Karines Reyes say their bill would create an abortion access fund to which taxpayers could voluntarily contribute when they file their personal income tax returns. The Democrats say the fund’s money would go to not-for-profit groups that provide financial and logical assistance to individuals seeking abortion care. The Legislature passed a sweeping law last year to protect a right to abortion care in New York in case of changes on the federal level. Lawmakers could consider passing the latest bill this year before they depart in early June. The bill would also require a report to lawmakers and the governor about the amount of money deposited in the abortion access fund and how it was spent. The state wouldn’t be able to request the names of anyone who sought money from the fund.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Three months after a set of anonymous, threatening, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic emails sent a wave of fear through the sociology department at Wake Forest University, the department chairman says he’s still waiting for university leaders to announce a meaningful response. The emails to faculty in sociology and two other departments called for a “purge” of minorities and the LGBTQ community. Alarmed by what he deemed white supremacist terrorism, chairman Joseph Soares canceled sociology classes for a week. When they resumed, Wake Forest police officers were stationed outside classrooms and the building itself. Doors normally open were closed and locked. Even a study lounge was locked. “It was the most stressful experience of my academic life,” said Soares, who began his college teaching career in 1991 and has taught at Wake Forest since 2003. “My faculty were afraid.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A massive 1984 diesel spill in Mandan, North Dakota, has finally been cleaned up. State officials said the cleanup at a rail yard in downtown Mandan was complicated because of limited access to the affected area, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Workers collected about 770,000 gallons of fuel over the years, said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. “It’s pretty much gone,” Glatt said at a Wednesday meeting. “It seems like a long time, but when you look at, in a downtown area where access is limited, we had 4 to 6 feet on top of the groundwater in some areas. This is a success.” Burlington Northern ran the rail yard when the spill was found in 1984, but BNSF Railway runs it now.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Cheetahs from the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden will have about 5 acres of open terrain where they can run at a facility anticipated to be completed this summer. The cheetahs will be transported from the zoo in suburban Cincinnati in custom, built-in van crates to the “Cheetah Run” at the zoo’s Bowyer Farm in Warren County. The animals will have the space to run but will not be required to do so, said zoo spokeswoman Michelle Curley. Zoning records indicate some residents raised safety concerns, but the Warren County Board of Zoning and Appeals approved the plan last year. The tree-lined “Cheetah Run” project will be enclosed by a fence. Zoo officials have no safety concerns, said Mark Fischer, vice president of facilities, planning and stability for the zoo. He said the cheetahs, raised by humans and dogs, are “docile” and “timid.” Fisher said the run will be fun for the cheetahs – Tommy, Nia, Savanna, Donni, Cathryn, Willow, Redd, and Kris – and give them space to stretch their legs.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor has been arrested, accused of domestic abuse. Robert McClatchie, an Oklahoma County assistant district attorney, was booked into Oklahoma County jail about 4 a.m. Saturday on complaints of domestic abuse by strangulation and domestic abuse in the presence of a minor child. Jail records also did not list an attorney for him. District Attorney David Prater said in a statement that McClatchie “will remain in jail until he is released by a judge or when his bond is posted after a judge sets his bond, like any other person arrested on a domestic abuse charge.” Prater said he’s “not intervening in this matter in any way.” He said the case will be assigned by the attorney general to another district attorney to assist Oklahoma City police in their investigation “and ultimately, make a charging decision.”\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Local police now have an extra set of eyes with them. Each of Pendleton’s 24 sworn police officers has been equipped with body cameras that will record each call of service to which they respond, the East Oregonian reports. “Certainly, the preservation of evidence in real time is something you can’t replace,” Police Chief Stuart Roberts said. The cameras are located on the officers’ left breast pocket and attached using a magnetic plate. Officers must double tap the camera to activate it when responding to a call. The program joins Pendleton police with departments in Boardman and Hermiston as the only agencies with body cameras in Northeast Oregon. All footage collected by the department will be held for a minimum of 180 days, and anything that is a part of an investigation or court case will be held for an additional 30 months, officials said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Former Mayor Stephen Reed, who served for almost three decades but was later sentenced to probation for accumulating Wild West artifacts he bought with public money for a museum that was never built, has died. He was 70. A statement from the family reported by PennLive.com said Reed died Saturday “surrounded by his family.” “Reed was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 and fought it courageously,” the statement said. Reed served seven terms but lost the 2009 primary amid criticism over the millions of dollars he had spent on museum-related items. He and city officials scoured the country for artifacts that would stock the museum, which he had called part of a wider plan to make the city a museum destination for tourists. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to 20 counts of receiving stolen property and was sentenced to two years of probation. Reed apologized and told the judge he took responsibility for his actions, calling his prosecution “a gut-wrenchingly humiliating” process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo wants to reform the state’s criminal justice system through a series of proposals in her budget and administrative actions. The Democratic governor released a nearly $10.2 billion state budget plan this month. The Legislature will review the proposals and present its plan before the 2021 fiscal year begins in July. The budget includes recommendations from Raimondo’s working group on criminal and juvenile justice. Among them, the proposal seeks to improve discharge planning, shift staffing to improve access to health care, update the parole statute to include geriatric parole and provide incestives for work release programs. Raimondo is also looking to bring her signature workforce training program to prisons.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Residents who want to vote in the state’s Democratic presidential primary next month face a deadline to register this week. The State Election Commission said all voters for the Feb. 29 primary must be registered by Thursday. The first-in-the-South presidential primary is open, which means a voter does not have to be a registered Democrat to cast a ballot. People who are 17 years old can vote in the primary as long as they will be 18 by Election Day on Nov. 3. Registration forms can be downloaded at scvotes.org, and residents can also check to see if their South Carolina registration is current. Voters can also register at their county registration offices. Republicans will not have a presidential primary in South Carolina as President Donald Trump runs for reelection.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster State Park: After the near-decimation of the Custer State Park bighorn sheep herd, wildlife managers are now seeing the group as a success story, the Black Hills Pioneer reports. In 2004 the herd was 200-plus animals strong when members contracted mycoplasma ovipneumoiae, a pneumonia-causing bacteria that killed 70-80% of the animals. Since that time, the adults in the herd obtained an immunity to the bacteria, but the lambs suffered – most died from the disease within months, and on a good year, one would survive. Some wildlife managers even began discussions about destroying the remaining 20-25 animals and starting over with disease-free sheep. Then, three years ago, biologists discovered that only three of the bighorns shed the pathogens responsible for the die-off. Those were removed from the herd, and the population rebound began. The first lambing year, eight of the nine born in the park survived.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new $200 million Amazon distribution center in the city’s Raleigh neighborhood will employ 1,000 workers and should be up and running in time for this year’s holiday season, officials said Monday. With the building’s skeleton and yellow bulldozers in the background, Amazon officials and state and local politicians gathered at the busy construction site in north Memphis to provide details about the project. Workers will make at least $15 per hour as they pack and ship books, electronics and other consumer goods alongside Amazon’s robots, officials said. At 855,000 square feet – the equivalent of 14 football fields – the order fulfillment center will be Amazon’s third in Memphis. The company employs about 6,500 people in Tennessee, Amazon officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Local police are inviting people to drop off their unwanted firearms and ammunition, with no questions asked, Tuesday at an East Austin police substation. This is the first of several gun surrender events this year, police said. On Tuesday, people can drop off these items from 3 to 8 p.m. at the Robert T. Martinez Central East Substation. “No questions asked” means police will not attempt to identify those who drop off guns, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. “We merely want to get weapons that are no longer wanted off the streets, out of homes, and destroyed so they don’t end up potentially in the wrong hands if there was to be a burglary,” Manley said. “This is a service we want to provide for the community.” Austin police will host similar programs throughout the year on April 28, July 28 and Oct. 27.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: An event straight out of the Old West is attracting more people with its mountain-man appeal, organizers said. About 50 people gathered in Blacksmith Fork Canyon to compete in the state-organized biathlon – an event combining cross-country skiing and sharpshooting – that features muzzleloader guns, the Herald Journal reports. Many wore traditional mountain-man gear to the event this month dubbed Willy Wapiti’s Smoke Pole Biathlon at Hardware Ranch, which is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and populated by hundreds of elk. Shooters raced along a snowy trail, with or without snowshoes, to five separate shooting stations. Prizes like electronic earmuffs, knives and fire starters were given to the best score out of 10, said Rachael Tuckett, a wildlife recreation specialist with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, which organized the event. Prizes also are given for the best mountain man outfit. The event has grown by 40% since last year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The completion of a 93-mile rail trail across northern Vermont would help link an ever-expanding network of recreation trails across New England and beyond, advocates say. The effort got a big boost last week when Republican Gov. Phil Scott asked lawmakers to approve $2.8 million as the state’s share of the estimated $14.1 million cost of completing the remaining 60 miles of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. It runs from Swanton, near the Canadian border, to St. Johnsbury, not far from the Connecticut River border with New Hampshire. The 30-mile section of the trail currently open is already benefiting businesses and the communities that people visit so they can use it, officials say. Trail advocates say completing one section of the trail boosts other nearby trails.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The post office where survivors reunited after a mass shooting in a government office building now is named after the man who gave his own life for his co-workers. A plaque was unveiled Friday honoring Ryan Keith Cox at the post office that now bears his name, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Cox was one of 12 people who died in the mass shooting last May 31 at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. “We are a city of heroes, and Keith is a perfect example of one of them,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said during the ceremony. In interviews, Cox’s co-workers have said he ushered women into a room and told them to barricade the door. Cox then left to see if anyone else needed help. The gunman and shot and killed him soon after that. Cox, 50, had been an account clerk in Virginia Beach’s public utilities department for 12 years.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A school district has warned parents about a potentially dangerous “penny challenge” spreading on social media. The Tacoma School District said a middle school student in the district took part in the online trend last week, KOMO-TV reports. The school district provided a photo of a burned electrical wall outlet resulting from the penny challenge. No injuries were reported. Social media users are challenged to record a video of themselves sliding a penny between a partially plugged-in cellphone charger and a wall outlet, officials said. Users are asked to film and post the results on the TikTok video-sharing channel. Placing a penny across an active electrical connection will create sparks that can damage the outlet and potentially start a fire and cause injury, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Projects involving sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places are eligible to apply for historic preservation development grants through the West Virginia Historic Preservation Office. Projects should involve the restoration, rehabilitation or archaeological development of historic sites, the state Department of Arts, Culture and History said in a news release. Approximately $369,000 is expected to be available for the grants, depending on appropriations from Congress or the Legislature. Privately owned properties are only eligible where there is evidence of public support or public benefit, the release said. Governmental properties that aren’t accessible to the public are not eligible for funding. Applications must be postmarked by March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: For nearly a century and a half, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration have said prayers every hour of every day in their chapel in La Crosse. But next month that practice will be coming to an end. The sisters have announced that after a dozen years of study and reflection, they will begin to cut back their prayer ritual, which began in 1878, to 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily. In 1997, prayer partners were invited to take the daytime hours while sisters living at St. Rose Convent continued the night hours. As demographics continued changing in the early 2000s, the sisters began studying the future of the practice. “Our thoughtful study over the years has included a growing understanding of a modern way to live in adoration through our prayer lives and actions, no matter where we are,” said FSPA President Eileen McKenzie.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The city’s police don’t have the authority to enforce the new federal law that increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21, the agency says. Officers can only legally enforce state laws and Cheyenne city ordinances, spokesman David Inman says. He says city officials posted the clarification on Facebook because they’d been receiving calls from residents and local businesses. Nonetheless, it’s still illegal for someone under the age of 21 to purchase products containing tobacco or nicotine, including vaping products. The Legislature is expected to consider a bill that would change state law to match the new federal law on tobacco sales. If it passes, Inman said the city would likely pass a similar ordinance, and then police would have the power to enforce it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/28"}]}

Mask mandates, book bans, social justice issues and other national debates have made it to the boardroom. And districts in Delaware’s largest county have been no stranger to unruly debates, packed meetings and sharp tensions.\n\nNow, such a trend continues to trickle down to local elections.\n\nNew Castle County hosts the heaviest competition in school board races this year — as Appoquinimink, Red Clay and Christina public schools post contentious races for open seats.\n\nPushes to strip mask mandates and return to in-person learning dominated rooms in the pandemic. Other student-rights issues, like giving transgender students access to bathrooms or affirming anti-discrimination policies, have also become politically charged in New Castle’s school-board discourse.\n\nDelaware PTA expects to focus on a few major issues this election, the group told Delaware Online, like health and safety in schools, learning loss recovery, school funding and boosting family engagement. However, general opposition to social justice themes — from banning books, challenging critical race theory or other representation — are expected to appear in new packaging, members said, from discussions of a \"Parent Bill of Rights\" to concerns of \"indoctrination.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHigh learning:New plan promises experience outside the classroom will earn college credit in Delaware\n\nAll of these hot-button issues have, however, brought more eyes to school boards.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" said Sadé Truiett, the PTA’s vice president of advocacy, back in March. \"We want people involved in our school boards, for people to really be speaking about the things that matter to our kids in our schools.\"\n\nSchool board races are considered nonpartisan, though the races have become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nThis year’s election comes on Tuesday, May 9. We took a look at the backgrounds of candidates across the ballot. Keep exploring this voter guide from Delaware Online/The News Journal to learn more.\n\nHow do I vote in Delaware school board elections? The basics\n\nVoters must be at least 18 years old and live in the district where they hope to cast a ballot. Proof of ID and address will be requested, which could come as a driver's license, ID card or U. S. mail with street address. Being registered to vote in state and federal elections is not required, nor is having children in schools.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., May 9, with various locations across each district. Voters can also request an absentee ballot.\n\nLearn more about your district below.\n\n[Go to: Appoquinimink, Christina, Red Clay, Smyrna ]\n\nAppoquinimink School District\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated ACLU-DE supported a particular candidate. It has since been changed, as the organization remains nonpartisan.\n\nAt-Large seat\n\nTashiba A. Graham, 40, Townsend\n\nBackground: Tashiba Graham is vice president of operations and innovation for a healthcare system in Pennsylvania. The mother of two has a youngest son in the Appoquinimink School District.\n\nIssues: According to Graham, the focus of her campaign is advocating for students with special needs, school safety and teacher retention. She shared her intention to introduce regular assemblies to combat bullying and violence in schools and address general mental wellness among students.\n\nGraham has stated her support for paying teachers and staff members a more competitive salary and improving incentives for new candidates while also evaluating what factors are working to keep staff members in the district. Engaging family members on resources available for students is another priority of hers.\n\nIn response to ACLU-DE voters guide questionnaire regarding national movements restricting certain curriculum material, Graham remains adamant that policies must be put in place to keep the district’s curriculum factual and comprehensive and protect the rights and inclusion of LGBTQ+ students. Graham has been supported by Appoquinimink Educational Support Professionals, First State Action Fund and more.\n\nEducation roundup:Delaware is 1 of 5 states to get $1 million for tutoring in schools\n\nTimothy W. Johns, 57, Middletown\n\nNote: This candidate did not return any requests for contribution from Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nBackground: Timothy Johns is an entrepreneur and co-founder of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, which he runs with his wife, Monique, in Newark. As co-founder, Johns oversees nonprofit charity work and established a leadership institute, where he has worked as an educator for 12 years. The U.S Army veteran is a father of four adult children.\n\nIssues: Johns says he's mainly concerned with bridging the achievement gap between students of different backgrounds and accessibilities, while setting students up for success in the global marketplace with leadership skills.\n\nJohns has stated during a public Q&A session that he believes conversations related to sexual orientation and gender identity are “family matters\" and should be left out of the classroom. He proposes setting up a public forum where debates about curriculum censorship can take place and be evaluated fairly.\n\nRestorative justice is another hallmark of Johns’ campaign, he told ACLU-DE in its voter guide, which includes training staff members and SROs about de-escalation techniques. He also proposes enhancing parent participation within the district by holding parent education classes focused on child development and communication.\n\nRaymond J. Petkevis, 45, Middletown\n\nBackground: Raymond Petkevis is a real estate broker for Keller Williams Realty around the Middletown area and recently started a position as Delaware’s principal broker for REAL, a virtual-based real estate company. His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

Loss Elementary , 200 Brennan Blvd., Bear\n\n, 200 Brennan Blvd., Bear Townsend Elementary, 126 Main St., Townsend\n\nFrom Kent:Caesar Rodney’s bid to raise school taxes rejected by voters\n\nChristina School District\n\nDistrict C\n\nChristine Gilbert, 54, Newark\n\nBackground: This Delaware native has lived in Newark alongside her husband of 27 years since 1997, according to her campaign website. The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/03/16/delaware-school-board-races-are-taking-shape-see-whos-running/69982049007/", "title": "Delaware school board races are taking shape. See who's running", "text": "School board races across the nation have caught heightened attention and participation in recent years, particularly through pandemic shutdowns and districts embroiled over which versions of their history to teach.\n\nDelaware offers no exception.\n\nMask mandates, inclusive facilities, buzzwords like critical race theory — many of these boardrooms have become backdrops to heated debate or even shouting matches. Officially nonpartisan, these boards and their elections continue to become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nAs Sadé Truiett put it, campaign checks aren't often green.\n\n\"It becomes political,\" said the vice president of advocacy with Delaware PTA. \"I mean, it shouldn't be, but at the end of the day, it's dollars and cents to run these campaigns... When the checks come in, they're blue or red.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDelaware PTA expects to focus on a few major issues this election cycle, such as health and safety in schools, learning loss recovery, school funding and boosting family engagement. Members say general opposition to social justice themes, banning books or challenging representation could appear in new packaging, from discussions of a \"Parent Bill of Rights,\" to concerns of \"indoctrination\" or similar claims across districts. But it's too soon to tell. This national organization's state arm will soon host forums to get to know Delaware's candidates.\n\n\"There may, in fact, be more competition than there was last year,\" added David Redlawsk, University of Delaware professor studying and teaching on political campaigns, elections and voter behavior. Redlawsk noted the heaviest competition has stacked up in New Castle County, with Appoquinimink, Red Clay and Christina posting contentious races with three or more candidates vying for individual seats.\n\nCompetition tends to cool as one moves down the map, but overall 12 of 19 districts will offer contested match-ups. ACLU-DE released a comprehensive school board voter guide on how to get to the polls.\n\nYour child's curriculum is changing:Are Delaware schools meeting new Black history requirements? Not yet. Here's why\n\nMore:School board races are supposed to be nonpartisan, why have they become so political?\n\nEven with recent evolution, Redlawsk said, school board election turnout has always been relatively low. This is likely due to races falling in the spring, as well as a possible perception of these races as being less important. Last year, however, a Delaware Online analysis of school board election results from the past five years did reveal most districts have seen an uptick in voting since 2020.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" the PTA's Truiett said. \"We want people involved in our school boards, for people to really be speaking about the things that matter to our kids in our schools.\"\n\nThis year, election is set for May 9.\n\nWith the filing deadline earlier this month, here’s a breakdown of candidates running for school board seats as of March 15. Races are broken up by county, though several districts cross county lines.\n\nNew Castle\n\nAppoquinimink\n\nFour candidates are vying for educational leadership in Middletown. With one seat up for election, Tashiba Graham, Timothy Johns, Raymond Joseph Petkevis and Shawn Rohe have officially put their names in the running.\n\nThe next at-large member will serve a four-year term, standard for school board seats.\n\nBrandywine\n\nBrandywine School District doesn’t host much competition in this election. May will see two seats up for grabs, and on candidate is currently running for each.\n\nShanika Perry hopes to represent District A for the next four years, while Ralph Ackerman is running for District C.\n\nChristina\n\nThree candidates have their eyes on Christina’s District C. Christine Gilbert, Donna Hitchner and Douglas Danger Manley will go head-to-head, while the New Castle County system’s District E has two other hopefuls in Yunfei Lou and Yong Peng.\n\nSubscriber background:How a lack of guidance led to all Delaware schools failing background check compliance\n\nColonial\n\nColonial School District has two seats to fill and two candidates on the ballot so far. Ronald Handy Sr., is running for District A, and Ja'Lisa White is running in District C.\n\nRed Clay\n\nDistricts A and D will be up for election in Red Clay this spring, with three candidates looking for the first seat and two vying for the second.\n\nAje English-Wynn, Jing Han and John Shulli will run for District A.

Sean Christiansen is running unopposed to do just that.\n\nLake Forest\n\nJordan McCloskey is running unopposed, too. McCloskey hopes to fill the open, at-large seat for a four-year-term.\n\nMilford\n\nMilford School District had the most filed candidates at five, but Dinae Woodside pulled out on March 10, according to the elections dashboard.

Tiffany Pascoe, who is trailing by a little more than 3,000 votes in the race for the seat to represent Wayne Township, said she was looking into it, but that was the only update she had as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nIndyStar has not yet called these races due to how close the vote totals are.\n\n3 HSE school board seats on the ballot\n\nThe HSE school board is responsible for Hamilton County’s largest school district of nearly 22,000 students and three of the board's seven seats were up for election this year.\n\nOn Thursday, Shera told IndyStar that she plans to ask for a recount, but is not challenging the voting process. She added that 22 votes is close enough that it could be a counting error.\n\n“I don’t think we should say I won or lost yet,” Shera said.\n\nThe third candidate on the ballot, Tony Bagato, had 12,990 votes. Bagato posted to his campaign Facebook Wednesday evening that he didn’t win and congratulated Donsbach.\n\nShera said she will likely wait until after Nov. 13 to file a verified petition for a recount. All candidates have until noon Nov. 17 to do so.\n\nNov. 13 at noon is when military and overseas ballots, as well as provisional ballots, are due. Shera said she wants to see if those ballots impact her election and added that she sent campaign postcards to military members.\n\nDonsbach said she is excited to be ahead but knows the election results are not final. She said if those additional ballots mean she loses, she doesn't plan to challenge those results. Overall, she said she was happy to see the voter turnout and that people were involved with local races.\n\nKathy Williams, Hamilton County Clerk, said there are 2,000 absentee ballots that were not returned, but there is no way of knowing how many of those are military or overseas voters planning to vote by mail. She said many military members vote by email and those votes were already counted.\n\nAdditionally, she said there are about 50 provisional ballots out but some of those may not count if the voter can’t prove their Hamilton County address.\n\nShera also alleged that there were voters who cast absentee ballots by saying they are over age 65 but were not.\n\nWilliams said that Shera’s claim was the first she’s heard of that and added that would have to be challenged during counting or could be challenged as part of a recount.\n\nPascoe, also on the ballot for HSE school board and a candidate for the seat in Wayne Township, said she's looking into challenging the results, but added no other details.\n\nPascoe trails Sarah Parks-Reese by 3,282 votes with 31.68% of the vote to Parks-Reese's 39.46%.\n\nThe third candidate, Ron Thieme, had 28.86% of the vote and posted that he lost on his campaign Facebook page on Thursday.\n\nThe third seat is to represent Fall Creek Township and IndyStar has called that race for Suzanne Thomas who had 39.07% of the vote per Wednesday's unofficial final results. She defeated four opponents including Clint Wilson, the incumbent.\n\nRunning for HSE school board\n\nThe HSE school board has been in the spotlight as the board made decisions about students’ return to in-person classes this fall during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHSE has a phased approach and was the only district to start the year with all virtual learning.\n\nShera is the most outspoken member of the current school board about her support for having all students return to the classroom for a 100% in-person learning option.\n\nShera, who has a background in accounting, has promised fiscal responsibility in the district if she returns to the board. She said in a candidate forum with the Hamilton Southeastern Education Association that the district has an achievement gap that needs to be addressed and that education can be an equalizer among students.\n\nShe also was an avid supporter of the proposed partnership with Purdue Polytech that was postponed due to the pandemic.\n\nWhat to know:here's what school boards can and can't do\n\nShera was one of two votes against an anti-discrimination policy at HSE that made headlines last year. The board voted 5-2 to approve a version that included language specifically prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nShera voted against it and proposed a “conscience clause” aimed at protecting students and teachers from being subjected to \"compelled speech,\" which would include using a transgender student's preferred pronouns if that teacher or student morally objected to doing so.\n\nDonsbach, who is currently leading in the race, previously worked in the administration of former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels and stressed her dedication to asking tough questions and listening to the community in her campaign materials.\n\nShe also said she wants to be a voice for students and push for equity in the district so that all students have an opportunity for a top education. In the HSE Education Association candidate forum, she said there is a divide in the community that needs to become more unified to create a stable environment for students to learn.\n\nLike Shera, Pascoe said she is a fiscal conservative and supports having in-school options. She pointed to a protest at a school board meeting earlier this year urging for in-person school options outside and said she will fight alongside families, and said that parents should have the options of in-person or virtual learning. She said she is also committed to academic excellence.\n\nParks-Reese, who currently leads the race, said in the HSE Education Association candidate forum that her top priorities are equity, including a more diverse staff, and social emotional learning. She said equity issues can’t be addressed with just one training and said equity must be part of every decision the board makes.\n\nParks-Reese was part of a grassroots effort that urged the HSE school board to pass its non-discrimination policy.\n\nTight school board races in Hamilton County\n\nOverall, 38 candidates were on the ballot for 14 seats on school boards in the county’s six public school districts.\n\nA majority of the 14 school board races in the county — except two in northern Hamilton County — were contested. And one seat in Sheridan Schools had no candidates.\n\nIn addition to multiple tight races, of the seven incumbents vying to keep their positions, two have won their races — and one was unopposed. The remaining five, which includes Shera, have either lost or are poised to lose their seats.\n\nAfter Hamilton County released unofficial results on Wednesday, IndyStar has called the election for six of the school board seats in Hamilton County, seven remain too close to call and one had no.\n\nAfter the HSE race between Donsbach and Shera, the next closest is in Westfield Washington Schools.\n\nIn the District 1 school board race, Jimmy Cox has 9,950 votes and is ahead of current school board president Amy Pictor who has 9,904 — a difference of 46 votes, making it the second-closest result total to the HSE Delaware Township seat.\n\nPictor told IndyStar on Friday that she's waiting until Nov. 13 to see if there are any changes.\n\nAlso in Westfield, Carl (Mike) Steele won the seat for District 3 with 55.59% of the vote defeating two challengers including incumbent Duane Lutz.\n\nIn Noblesville, voters picked three candidates from a list of nine to fill three at-large seats on the Noblesville School Board. Stephanie Lambert is in the lead with 11,882 votes (19.02%) followed by three candidates who differ by 200 votes or less than 1% of the vote.\n\nLaura Alerding had 13.77% (8,603 votes), Christi Crosser had 13.54% (8,457 votes) of the vote and Evan Elliott had 13.45% of the vote (8,403 votes).\n\nSince voters in Noblesville were electing three candidates, Alerding and Crosser are poised to win along with Lambert. Elliot would lose by 54 votes and he told IndyStar that he didn't plan to challenge the results. Of the five other candidates who each finished with less than 10% of the vote, three, including Carl Johnson, who is the incumbent and board president, told IndyStar they don't plan to challenge the results and IndyStar has reached out to the remaining two.\n\nIn Carmel, voters picked two candidates from a list of nine to fill two at-large seats.\n\nCurrent school board member Katie Browning had more than 18,000 votes and IndyStar has called her as the winner of one of the seats.\n\nHowever, unofficial results for the second seat were close and remain not called by IndyStar. Lousie Jackson has 9,815 votes to Anne Poindexter’s 9,747 votes — a difference of 68 votes.\n\nPoindexter said told IndyStar that she has complete confidence in county election officials and won't challenge the results.\n\nOf the remaining candidates, IndyStar has reached out to one, four have conceded and one stopped campaigning before Election Day.\n\nHamilton Heights School board president Kevin Cavanaugh ran unopposed and will return to the board along with new board member Gretchen Pennington who defeated challenger David Adam Sheller.\n\nIn Sheridan, John Hunt who was unopposed will join the board. A board member will later be appointed to fill the second seat in Sheridan.\n\nSee full election results for school boards in Hamilton County here.\n\nCall IndyStar education reporter MJ Slaby at 317-447-1586 or email her at mslaby@gannett.com.

There are 691,647 registered voters statewide.\n\nThis year's school board elections are on Tuesday, May 8.\n\n“The children of this state are too important to leave major decisions about school governance to less than 2 percent of the eligible voters,” Alleyne said. “If we believe public education is important and that the success of our children is paramount, we must do our part to vote and thoroughly vet those with control over our schools.”\n\nTo that end, DelawareCAN recently launched a campaign and website called \"Who Runs Our Schools?\" in an attempt to boost voter turnout. It connects voters across the state with clear, interactive information about their candidates — including survey results from candidates running in races from Wilmington to Delmar.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAt www.whorunsourschools.com, community members can also learn more about the function of school boards, candidate requirements, and where to cast their ballots in the upcoming election.\n\n“Many people say 'I want to vote, but how do I pick a school board member?'\" Alleyne said. \"People will say I want to vote, then just forget.\"\n\n“On the website, we try to answer those questions about: Should I vote if I have a kid in public school? Should I vote if I don’t have school-age kids anymore?”\n\nAlleyne thinks the timing of school board elections could have something to do with low turnout.\n\n\"When you think about when these elections happen, on a Tuesday in May,\" he said. \"It starts at 10 a.m., so you basically have to go when you're at work or after work.\"\n\nThere is legislation in the works that hopes to change that.\n\nOne bill, sponsored by Kim Williams, D-Newport, would make it so polls for both school board elections and referendums open at 7 a.m., to be consistent with other Delaware elections. The bill was unanimously approved by the state House on Monday and has been assigned to the Senate Education Committee.\n\nRonnie Williams, who on Tuesday is running against Colonial school board incumbent Richard Schiller Jr., said he doesn't think school districts do enough to let voters know about upcoming school board elections.\n\n\"The Colonial District has about 60,000 registered voters, of which only 235 came out in 2008,\" he said. \"This shows that people really don’t know or don’t care. My campaign has been trying to reinforce the fact that these elected volunteers are helping to drive policy, procedures and the budget for five-plus years.\"\n\n\"People should be voting in school board elections because as a parent, taxpayer and concerned citizen, you should want the best in your community and children. People complain when things go wrong or are wrong, but don’t take the opportunity to fix it when the time arises. If you don’t like the direction of the school and district, then take action and make things happen.\"\n\nWho runs our schools?\n\nDelaware's 117 school board members make decisions impacting 93,171 students. The smallest school district budget is $14 million in Delmar, while the largest is $255 million in Red Clay, according to DelawareCAN.\n\nAn analysis done by the nonprofit shows 66 current board members are male and 51 are female. About 80 percent of board members are white, 17 percent are black, 2 percent are Hispanic and 1 percent are Native American. The longest-serving board member was first elected in 1974, and 49 percent of candidates have served at least one full term, which is five years long.\n\nLess than 500 votes are generally needed for a seat on a Delaware school board, according to DelawareCAN. There are 24 elected board members reaching the end of their terms this year.

They're opposed by Freehold school board President Michael Amorosoand Ocean resident Matthew Wooleey, the Republican candidates.\n\nSchool state aid funds, which were slashed at some District 11 schools as a result of the state's new school-funding formula, is one of the main issues for voters. Downey and Houghtaling support the \"regionalization, consolidation and shared services of schools.\" Amoros and Woolley want the district's schools to be fully funded.\n\nMunicipalities included in the 11th Legislative District are: Allenhurst, Asbury Park, Colts Neck, Deal, Eatontown, Freehold Borough, Freehold Township, Interlaken, Loch Arbour, Long Branch, Neptune, Neptune Township, Ocean Township, Red Bank, Shrewsbury Borough, Shrewsbury Township, Tinton Falls and West Long Branch.\n\nDistrict 12\n\nIncumbent Assemblymen Rob Clifton, R-Matawan, and Ron Dancer, R-Plumsted, are running for re-election against DemocratsDavid Lande of Millstone and Matawan resident Malini Guha.\n\nThe main issue facing voters is changes to the school funding formula that could mean the loss of millions in state aid for some schools in the 12th District. The candidates said those changes would lead to larger classroom sizes and program cuts, as well as add to the property tax burden.\n\nClifton and Dancer want the state to redirect money from community college tuition to K-12 schools. Lande suggested allowing localities to levy sales taxes as a means of alternative revenue. Guha suggested regionalizing school districts and having the state absorb the cost of special education.\n\nMunicipalities included in the 12th Legislative District are: Allentown, Chesterfield, Englishtown, Jackson, Manalapan, Matawan, Millstone, New Hanover, North Hanover, Old Bridge, Plumsted, Roosevelt, Upper Freehold and Wrightstown.\n\nDistrict 13:\n\nThe battle for New Jersey Assembly District 13 is a clash between two Republicans and two Democrats who seem to disagree on most issues — from school mergers to driver's licenses for immigrants without legal status.\n\nOnly one of them, Republican Serena DiMaso, is an incumbent. The former Holmdel Township Committee member and Monmouth County freeholder has been in the Assembly since 2018.\n\nRunning alongside her is Gerry Scharfenberger, a Monmouth County freeholder and former Middletown Township committeeman and mayor.

Kean has served in the Assembly since 2012 and Thomson, a former Wall mayor, was appointed to the seat in 2017 to replace Dave Rible, who resigned to become the director of the state Alcohol Beverage Control division.\n\nKean and Thomson highlighted property tax reform and finding an equitable school funding formula as the top issues on their agenda.\n\nTwo Howell residents, Steven Farkas and Yesin \"Jason\" Celik, are running on the Democratic slate. They both highlighted affordable health care, higher education, marijuana legalization and fighting the opioid crisis as the top issues.\n\nSea Girt resident Hank Schroeder is running independently for an Assembly seat, his sixth attempt to get elected. Schroeder said he hopes to make New Jersey a leader in green technology, make health care more affordable and automatically register people to vote on their 18th birthday.\n\nMunicipalities included in the 30th Legislative District are:Avon-by-the-Sea, Belmar, Bradley Beach, Brielle, Farmingdale, Howell, Lake Como, Lakewood, Manasquan, Point Pleasant, Sea Girt, Spring Lake, Spring Lake Heights and Wall.\n\nMonmouth County\n\nBoard of Chosen Freeholders: The future of the Monmouth County landfill and balance between county services and taxpayer costs are the major issues among the four candidates seeking election to two open seats on the freeholder board.\n\nIncumbent Republican Freeholder Tom Arnone is running alongside Wall Township Committeeman Nick DiRocco against Democrats Moira Nelson and Michael Penna.\n\nSheriff: Democrat Raymond Dothard hopes to unseat Republican Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden, who is vying for his fourth term as sheriff.\n\nDothard of Millstone is a U.S. Navy veteran. Golden was a police officer in Colts Neck and Toms River before joining, then leading the sheriff's office.\n\nAberdeen: There are eight candidates for four seats on the township's council, and concerns about land preservation, development and taxes are driving the conversation.\n\nThe incumbent Democrats — Greg Cannon, Artie Hirsch, Connie Kelley and Robert Swindle — make a case that they are properly balancing preservation with development, while the Republican challengers — Alicia Botticelli, James Eccles, William Sullivan and Theresa Velardi — say their development initiatives don't represent the will of Aberdeen's residents.\n\nAsbury Park: Seven candidates are seeking three seats on the Asbury Park school board, divided into two slates and one independent.\n\nOn the incumbent, Moving Ahead Together ticket is Connie Breech, Barbara Lesinski and Dominic Latorraca.\n\nThey are being challenged by the Diversity is Strength ticket, which features Vincent Martino, Eddie Gonzales and Anthony Remy.\n\nAn independent candidate, Norman E. Robertson, is also making a bid for one of the seats.\n\nEatontown: The heart of this year's election is the unstable Borough Council, which has seen four members leave in a year.\n\nCurrent council members Albert Baginsky and Tonya Rivera, both Democrats, are seeking election to full, three-year terms. They are opposed by Republican candidates Kevin Gonzalez, a former councilman, and Maria Grazia Escalante.\n\nDemocratic candidate James David is running against Republican Joseph Olsavsky for a two-year unexpired term.\n\nThere are two vacant seats on a one-year, unexpired term. Democratic candidate Renata Bodner and Republicans Edwin Palenzuela and Mark Regan, Jr., the son of former councilman Mark Regan Sr., are seeking the seats.\n\nFreehold Borough: Mayor Nolan Higgins declined to seek re-election, leaving the mayoral race wide open for the first time in eight years.\n\nRunning to replace him are Councilman Kevin Kane, a Democrat who isn't seeking re-election to his council seat.

Fasano, a lifelong resident, hopes to find a \"sensible way\" to meet its affordable housing obligations.\n\nBerlin has lived in town for four years and is a software and public relations professional.

Those numbers do not include people who may have the virus but aren't being tested.\n\nThe Department of Health said 518 cases are tied to Smithfield workers. In addition, 126 people have tested positive after being in direct contact with Smithfield workers.\n\nCombined that's 644 of the state's 1,168 cases.\n\nTwo Prince of Peace Retirement Community residents recover from COVID-19\n\nTwo residents at the Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community have recovered after testing positive for COVID-19 last week, officials say.\n\nTwo residents tested positive March 31 and another patient tested positive on April 1.

Kristi Noem on Monday announced a comprehensive clinical trial looking at whether an antimalarial drug is effective in treating COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nThe study will initially include 2,000 outpatient people who have been exposed to the disease, including frontline health workers.\n\nThe drug, hydroxychloroquine, is one of the therapeutics under investigation in clinical trials for treatment of people with COVID-19, according to a news release from Sanford.\n\n\"We are going to be the first state in the nation to run a statewide clincial trial on hydroxychloroquine,\" Noem said, adding that she's proud to see Sanford leading national research efforts.\n\nCases increase by 138 in South Dakota, 127 in Minnehaha County\n\nThe number of confirmed cornavirus cases increased by 138 on Monday, the highest daily rate so far.\n\nCases in Minnehaha county increased by 127 to 654 and four in Lincoln County to 50.

Kristi Noem to declare a shelter-in-place order for all of Minnehaha and Lincoln County for three weeks in a formal request Saturday. And again Monday he said he hopes to see quick action from Pierre as COVID-19 cases continue to spike in Sioux Falls.\n\nSunday, April 12\n\nCase update: State adds 104 positive cases total\n\nSouth Dakota reported 104 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, bringing the total number of statewide cases to 730. It's the state's biggest jump in cases yet.\n\nOf the new cases, 89 were in Minnehaha County, which is up to 527 confirmed cases. The state reported no new deaths. These numbers do not include pending tests or those who have symptoms of the virus but are not being tested.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health said 293 of the county's total cases involve \"individuals who work at Smithfield Foods.\" That's up from 238 announced cases involving Smithfield on Saturday.\n\nSmithfield Foods to close Sioux Falls plant indefinitely\n\nSmithfield Foods will close its Sioux Falls facility until further notice, the company announced Sunday in a news release.\n\nThe closure comes after the South Dakota Department of Health said 238 of Minnehaha's 438 COVID-19 cases involve \"individuals who work at Smithfield Foods.\" The plant was identified as the largest hot spot in the state with about 38% of the state's cases. Those numbers were last updated Saturday.\n\nSmithfield will fully shutdown on Wednesday. The plant will partially be operated through Tuesday to process inventory, according to the news release.\n\nSaturday, April 11\n\nConfirmed cases increase by 90 in South Dakota, most in Minnehaha County\n\nSouth Dakota reported 90 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, the largest single day increase in confirmed cases. That brings the total number of statewide cases to 626. That number does not include tests pending in private labs or those without symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nOf the 90 new cases, 86 were in Minnehaha County, which is now up to 438 confirmed cases. The state reported no new deaths.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health said 238 of the county's 438 cases involve \"individuals who work at Smithfield Foods.\"\n\nFriday, April 10\n\nState to declare public health emergency in Minnehaha County; 190 cases connected to Smithfield\n\nThe South Dakota secretary of health will declare a public health emergency in Minnehaha County at the guidance of Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\nNoem announced the declaration Friday after the state released the latest COVID-19 data showing a one-day increase of 83 confirmed cases in the county.\n\nThe decision comes as state officials confirmed that 190 confirmed cases — \"primarily\" employees — have been connected to Smithfield Foods, a hot spot in Sioux Falls. That's more than double the number of cases confirmed two days prior.\n\nThe state is working to identify people who were in contact with those confirmed to have the disease. The state's contact tracing — a process where those who may have been in close contact with an infected individual are monitored for signs of infection — across all positive cases has shown an average of 10 people in close contact to a positive case, said State Epidemiologist Josh Clayton.\n\nWhat's behind South Dakota's coronavirus model? Health officials won't say.\n\nWhat’s in a model?\n\nTurns out South Dakota health officials are reluctant to share that information.\n\nThe people behind the state’s coronavirus response model, which Gov. Kristi Noem unveiled one week ago, have failed to release data used to make their assumptions. Meanwhile, health officials from the state’s three large health Systems – Avera, Sanford and Monument Health – won’t elaborate on how they contributed to the process.\n\n'No more than 10' rule for S.F. businesses could extend into May\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken could keep emergency prohibitions on select Sioux Falls businesses in place through the end of the month at least.\n\nSince March 26, Sioux Falls bars, restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues have been barred from having no more than 10 patrons on their properties at a time. Originally, the emergency rules adopted in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Sioux Falls were set to expire April 8. However, councilors this week OKed a two-week extension to the sunset, moving out the expiration date to April 22.\n\nNext week, Sioux Falls city councilors are expected to consider another extension to the \"no lingering\" ordinance.\n\nCase update: 89 new cases in South Dakota, most in Minnehaha\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health announced Friday that 89 more cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state.\n\nThe new cases bring the state's total to 536, a number that does not include pending tests in private labs and people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nNo new deaths were attributed to the disease. Six people have died from COVID-19 in South Dakota to date.\n\nThe number of people who have recovered from the disease increased to 177.\n\nIn Minnehaha County, 78 new cases were confirmed for a total of 352, while Lincoln County's confirmed case total rose by 5 to 38. The two counties combined account for 72% of the state's total cases.\n\nSioux Falls Health Department tours Smithfield facility, offers recommendations\n\nThe Sioux Falls Department of Health toured the Smithfield Foods facility and gave them some recommendations about how to curb the spread of coronavirus in the facility.\n\nSmithfield will close for three days Saturday after it was revealed that at least 80 workers tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nSioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken said the company is adding additional screening measures based on the health department's recommendations. That includes additional screening questions in addition to the temperature checks already being performed when workers arrive.\n\nThursday, April 9\n\nCafe worker in Lane, South Dakota tests positive for COVID-19\n\nA worker at the Lane Cafe in Lane tested positive for COVID-19, state health officials announced Thursday.\n\nThe person reported working last Wednesday through Saturday at the business.\n\nAnyone who visited the cafe during those dates should monitor for symptoms over the next 14 days, a news release from the South Dakota Department of Health said.\n\nThose who develop symptoms should call their health care provider and avoid contact with other people, according to the release.\n\nFirst responders ask for donated face masks amid COVID-19 outbreak\n\nThe City of Sioux Falls is asking residents to donate homemade face masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among first responders.\n\nResponders use N95 masks during patient contact, but the city is asking for cloth masks for responders to follow CDC guidelines and wear around coworkers and the public.\n\nThe 600 masks are needed for dispatchers, emergency medical services and firefighters, according to a news release Thursday. They could also be distributed by first responders to vulnerable communities and individuals they respond to.\n\nMask drop-off bins will be placed at Sioux Falls fire stations, or they can be mailed to SFFR Station 3 on 2820 South Minnesota Avenue.\n\nGov. Noem announces app to help trace spread of coronavirus;\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced a new app available to South Dakotans to help with tracing the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe app, called Care19, comes through a partnership with North Dakota. It tracks the user's location, and, if the person later gets COVID-19, the app will help the health department track who may have been in contact with the infected person.\n\nUse of the app is voluntary, but it's intended for use by those who are essential workers or who must be out in the community to do essential business.\n\nData tracked by the app won't be used for anything but contact tracing, Noem said.\n\nNearly 500 people had chosen to use the South Dakota function of the app as of 3:45 p.m. Thursday.\n\nSmithfield closure another blow to livestock industry\n\nHog prices were already in a free fall.\n\nScott Kirsch is expecting things to get worse now that Smithfield Foods has closed its Sioux Falls plant for three days as it works to address an outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nKirsch co-owns the Platte Livestock Market, where he’s already noticed the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the prices hog farmers are getting.\n\n“It’s going to be devastating to the industry,” he said of the closures caused by the worsening pandemic and resulting state of emergency.\n\nCase update: 54 more cases in South Dakota, majority in Sioux Falls area\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health announced that 54 more cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state.\n\nThat brings the state's total number of confirmed cases to 447, a number that does not include tests pending in private labs or people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of deaths in the state have not increased, remaining at 6.\n\nThe number of people who recovered from the disease increased to 161.\n\nMinnehaha County's confirmed case total increased by 46 for a total of 274 confirmed cases in the county, accounting for 61% of the state's cases. Adding Lincoln County's 33 cases, the Sioux Falls area accounts for nearly 69% of the states confirmed cases.\n\nSmithfield Foods to close plant for 3 days after becoming COVID-19 'hot spot'\n\nSmithfield Foods will close its Sioux Falls plants for three days, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe closure comes less than 24 hours after Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdom confirmed that more than 80 employees had tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe company will suspend operations in a large section of the plant on April 11 and completely shutter the Sioux Falls facility on April 12 and April 13.\n\n\"Smithfield is taking this action out of an abundance of caution for its 3,700 employees in Sioux Falls, a portion of whom have tested positive for COVID-19,\" said a news release sent to media Thursday morning.\n\nWednesday, April 8\n\nMore than 80 cases reported with workers at Smithfield Foods\n\nMore than 80 employees at a Sioux Falls food processing business have tested positive for the coronavirus, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed Wednesday.\n\n\"There are a number of cases connected, that number has changed every day,\" Malsam-Rysdon said.\n\nShe added that the more than 80 confirmed cases were employees, and that number did not include others who may have become infected from those employees.\n\nSmithfield Foods, Inc. saw its first positive case on March 26, and nearly a week prior officials said the plant would maintain normal operations and would not close or send employees home amid the new coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCases update: Confirmed cases see biggest one-day jump\n\nState health officials confirmed a total of 393 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in the state of South Dakota as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThat's an increase of 73 confirmed cases, or about 23% — the largest one-day total yet — since Tuesday, when the state had 320 confirmed cases of the disease, according to the South Dakota Department of Health's website. Those numbers don't include tests that are pending in private labs, or people who have the virus but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the state remained at 6.\n\nMinnehaha County once again was the location of the majority of the new confirmed cases, with 63 more added on Wednesday for a total of 228. Minnehaha County and neighboring Lincoln County, which now has 31 confirmed cases, account for nearly two-thirds of the confirmed cases across the state.\n\nMayor: Sioux Falls has several 'hot spots'\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken announced Wednesday that city officials have identified several areas considered hot spots within Minnehaha County, or areas where the novel coronavirus is spreading rapidly.\n\nTenHaken would not go into specifics of where the hot spots are, but said healthcare officials are working closely with at least one particular employer within the city. The announcement came as part of the city's daily update to media about the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus that's become a global pandemic.\n\nAsked whether the hot spots included Smithfield Foods after employees have raised concerns about working conditions and at least one confirmed positive case has been found within the business, TenHaken did not say the Sioux Falls plant was considered a hot spot directly.\n\nTuesday, April 7\n\nYankton Walmart pharmacy employee tests positive for coronavirus\n\nThe Department of Health is warning people in the Yankton area about the risk of potential exposure to the coronavirus at a Walmart pharmacy.\n\nState health officials said Tuesday that an employee at the Yankton Walmart pharmacy tested positive for COVID-19 and potentially transmitted the virus to others while working shifts on March 25 and March 30.\n\nCase update: Two new deaths, confirmed cases at 320\n\nWith 32 new confirmed cases today, South Dakota has more than 300 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nThe state now has a total of 320 confirmed cases, a number that does not include tests pending at private labs and individuals who have the disease but have not been tested.\n\nThe number of deaths in the state increased to 6.\n\nTenHaken appears on CNN to discuss response\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken was on CNN on Tuesday morning discussing the city's coronavirus response as well as Gov. Kristi Noem's stance on stay-at-home guidelines.\n\nCNN anchor John King prefaced the interview by saying South Dakota was just one of a handful of states that hasn't issued a stay-at-home order even though Noem said 70 percent of the state's population could get infected.\n\nThat's especially important in a state like South Dakota, TenHaken said, because of how mostly rural the state is with a large population center in Sioux Falls.\n\n\"A blanket strategy that you could look at doing, in some cases, is probably hitting a nail with a sledgehammer,\" he said. \"But in places like Sioux Falls where we have the density, I think people would be open to (further restrictions).\"\n\nPOET scales back ethanol production amid slowdown\n\nSioux Falls-based POET announced Tuesday that it will idle ethanol production at some of its facilities amid a drop in demand for gasoline.\n\nThe world’s largest biofuel producer said it would idle production at facilities in Chancellor, S.D., and Ashton and Coon Rapids, Iowa, and delay the start-up of a new plant in Shelbyville, Indiana. The company estimated it would reduce corn demand by 110 million bushels and 330 million gallons of ethanol.\n\nMonday, April 6\n\nNoem executive order puts restrictions on Lincoln, Minnehaha county residents\n\nGov. Kristi Noem plans to extend and more strongly word an executive order related to how the state should operate amid the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"We are at a critical juncture,\" Noem said. \"In order for us to continue to flatten the curve, I'm taking additional steps that will help us do that.\"\n\nThe governor will also issue a separate order specific to the Sioux Falls area urging specific individuals to stay home for three weeks. That includes those who are over 65 years old or who have conditions like diabetes, lung disease, kidney or liver disease, moderate to severe asthma or who have weakened immune systems.\n\n\"I need this group in Minnehaha and Lincoln Counties to stay home,\" Noem said.\n\nGov. Noem says public schools will remain closed the rest of the school year\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced Monday that she's recommending schools to be closed and that online learning be continued through the rest of the year.\n\nThe decision comes after the confirmed number of coronavirus cases neared 300 Monday, and extends her initial recommendation made mid-March for school districts to close through May 1 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to help slow the spread of the virus.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense to bring our kids back into our school buildings this year,\" Noem said.\n\nThe confirmed cases do not include tests pending in private labs or those who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, summer classes for all public universities will be online or done remotely, the South Dakota Board of Regents announced Monday.\n\n48 new cases, two more deaths confirmed in South Dakota Monday\n\nSouth Dakota has reported 48 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThe new cases, reported Monday, bring the total number of confirmed cases in South Dakota to 288, a number that does not include tests pending in private labs, or people with or without symptoms who have not been tested.\n\nThe state's death total also increased to 4. It's unclear whether the newly-reported deaths are separate from the deaths of a resident at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community who died from the disease on April 3, or state Rep. Bob Glanzer, who also died on April 3 after being hospitalized with the disease in late March.\n\nMayor TenHaken issues 'stay at home' proclamation for Sioux Falls\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken on Monday issued a proclamation strongly encouraging Sioux Falls residents to stay at home.\n\nThe proclamation outlines recommendations to businesses and residents in the city to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. See the guidelines here.\n\nMeanwhile, TenHaken, along with more than 160 municipal and county officials, signed a letter Monday requesting Gov. Kristi Noem to declare a public health emergency.\n\n\"What little authority counties possess, which is also untested in these circumstances, is cumbersome at best. In these difficult times, local governments need to know with certainty they are able to adequately address the COVID-19 emergency and that all levels of government are working cooperatively,\" the letter states. \"To accomplish this, it is imperative for you to encourage the Secretary of Health to declare a Public Health Emergency in South Dakota with your consent and exercise your authority.\"\n\nSunday, April 5\n\n28 positives reported, increasing to 240 cases\n\nSouth Dakota reported 28 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to 240. That number does not include tests pending in private labs or those who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nOf the new cases, there were 23 new positive tests from Minnehaha County, totaling 104 patients. There were also new confirmed cases in Codington, Lincoln (2), Spink, and Turner counties.\n\nSaturday, April 4\n\nSouth Dakota reports 25 new confirmed coronavirus cases, now at 212\n\nSouth Dakota reported 25 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases to 212.

There were three new cases reported in Yankton, bringing the total to 14, while Lincoln County added two new cases to get to 21 total.\n\nThe state's death total remained at two, but two deaths presumably tied to the coronavirus were reported later Friday night and were not included in the numbers.\n\nCoronavirus claims life of South Dakota lawmaker Bob Glanzer\n\nHuron state Rep. Bob Glanzer has become the fourth known fatality in South Dakota from coronavirus, dying Friday in Sioux Falls, according to his son Thomas Glanzer via Facebook.\n\nGlanzer, 74, had been airlifted to Sioux Falls from Huron on the morning of Tuesday, March 24. The Republican lawmaker told the Argus Leader on March 23 that he had a fever that was worsening and that he received a positive test result the day prior. He said he’d been self-isolating for about a week and didn’t think he’d had contact with others who had tested positive in Beadle County.\n\nFriday, April 3\n\nRetirement home reports state's third death\n\nA resident at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community has died from the COVID-19 virus, according to Avera Health officials.\n\nThe resident was one of three residents who was infected with the virus this week. The other two patients are still being cared for at the facility, according to a news release.\n\nThe age or gender of the person has yet to be released.\n\n“The health and safety of our residents is our priority, and we are deeply saddened by this loss,” said Justin Hinker, administrator for Avera Prince of Peace. “We will take all precautions possible to stop the spread of this virus in our facility.”\n\nUp to 600,000 South Dakotans could get coronavirus, will peak in mid-June\n\nUp to 70% of South Dakotans could get the novel coronavirus, according to projections shared by Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday.\n\nNoem and health experts from the state's major hospital systems on Friday shared projections on how the novel coronavirus will spread throughout the state.\n\nPreviously, Noem had said she expected 30% of the state to become infected by the respiratory illness, but that number has expanded to include up to 70% of the state, or 600,000 people. That's taking into account those who get the virus but will show no symptoms or very minor symptoms.\n\nSanford, Avera to offer rapid testing\n\nBoth of Sioux Falls' major hospital systems will be offering rapid COVID-19 testing.\n\nSanford Health now has the capability to get test results for the disease in 90 minutes, according to a press release by the healthcare system Friday.\n\nAvera will also have rapid testing starting next week, and the expected turnaround is 45 minutes, according to a press release Friday.\n\nConfirmed cases keep rise to 187 in South Dakota\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Dakota hit 187 Friday.\n\nThat's with an addition of 22 known cases, a number that doesn't include pending tests or those who are not being tested. The state lab and hospitals are focusing primarily on high-priority cases, meaning those with symptoms who do not fall into high-priority categories may not be tested. The data also does not include people who may have the virus but are asymptomatic.\n\nIn Minnehaha County, the number of confirmed cases rose from 54 to 68. Sioux Falls officials have prohibited certain businesses from having more than 10 patrons on their premises and closed local parks.\n\nThursday, April 2\n\nNoem to call on National Guard to build 100-bed units in South Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced Thursday she will be requesting help from the National Guard to build up capacity in South Dakota's two major cities to deal with the upcoming surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe National Guard will set up 100-bed supplemental units in Rapid City and Sioux Falls in the coming weeks, state health secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said, though it's unclear how soon the units will be ready. Officials have to find the right location first, she said.\n\nThe National Guard will go to those cities first, and then look at other communities across the state that may need help, Noem said.\n\nThe state will use federal funding to help cover the cost to use the National Guard.\n\nNeed to get tested for coronavirus? Here's what it will cost you\n\nSouth Dakotans with health insurance who get tested for the novel coronavirus hitting the country might never see a bill.\n\nBut for those who self-insure or go without, the cost could be hundreds of dollars, depending on where the COVID-19 swab is done.\n\nThe Argus Leader this week requested from the three healthcare systems in South Dakota — the state health office, Sanford Health and Avera Health — that are conducting the most COVID-19 testing how much each is charging for taking a sample, analyzing it and reporting the results back to the patients.\n\nSouth Dakota confirms 36 more cases Thursday\n\nSouth Dakota saw 36 more confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus as of Thursday morning.\n\nThat brings the state's total number of cases to 165 from Wednesday's count of 129 cases, a number that doesn't include the tests pending in private labs, or those without symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nThis is the largest one-day increase in known cases of the virus so far.\n\nFourteen more cases were confirmed in Minnehaha County, where nearly a third of the state's cases have been confirmed. Sioux Falls officials have prohibited certain businesses from having more than nine patrons on their premises, closed local parks and may issue a stay-at-home order.\n\nThousands more South Dakotans file for unemployment amid COVID-19 turmoil\n\nThousands more South Dakotans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a result of businesses across the state sending workers home and cutting hours amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn total, nearly 2,700 filed unemployment insurance claims with the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation in the week ending March 28. That's on top of the 1,761 who filed for unemployment the week prior, and continues a nationwide trend where a record-setting amount of people are out of work.\n\nWednesday, April 1\n\nSecond death confirmed, total jumps to 129 known cases in South Dakota\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has caused the death of a second person in South Dakota, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThat's along with 21 new confirmed cases in the state, including nine more in Minnehaha County — bringing the state's total confirmed cases to 129, a number that doesn't include tests pending in private labs, or people with symptoms who are not being tested for the disease.\n\nThe death announced on April 1 is the second caused by COVID-19 in the state, following the March 9 death of a man in his 60s from Pennington County. The age and gender of the person whose death was announced today is unknown at this time.\n\nQuint Hofer, husband of Mari Hofer, who died suddenly on Saturday morning at a Sioux Falls hospital confirmed that the 51-year-old mother of three from Huron tested positive for COVID-19. Quint Hofer said he received the positive test results Tuesday.\n\nInternet usage up as Midco adjusts to remote work, learning\n\nThe Sioux Falls area’s largest provider of broadband internet is making adjustments as it responds to the growing number of families working and learning from home.\n\nMidco staff noticed a jump in daytime traffic about mid-March as the state of emergency caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, reached Sioux Falls and the rest of South Dakota, forcing cancellations and closers and underlining the need for a home internet connection.\n\nAnticipating the greater need, the Sioux Falls-based telecommunications company made a number of proactive decisions designed to optimize the flow of data across its infrastructure, said Jon Pederson, Midco’s chief technology officer.\n\nVolunteers, businesses sew face masks during COVID-19 outbreak\n\nLinda Hoefert prays over each face mask she sews.\n\nShe prays for the nurse or doctor or technician who will wear the patterned cotton mask. She prays that it helps protect them as they work on the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak and that the people they are helping would be protected as well.\n\nHoefert is one of several volunteers donating their materials, skills and free time to sew handmade masks for hospitals. While several healthcare systems across the U.S. are running out of protective gear like masks in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, South Dakota-based healthcare systems say they haven't had a shortage of supplies yet.\n\nTuesday, March 31\n\nTwo residents at Avera Prince of Peace test positive for COVID-19\n\nTwo residents at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community in Sioux Falls tested positive for COVID-19, according to a news release from Avera on Tuesday.\n\nNeither resident has needed to be transferred to the hospital, and they were isolated from others as soon as their symptoms appeared, according to the news release.\n\nThe retirement community restricted all visitors to the building two weeks ago, so officials believe the transmission likely came from an employee.\n\nLatest coronavirus numbers report 12 hospitalized\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Dakota continue to rise.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health's latest case numbers posted Tuesday morning online show seven more cases were discovered since the same time yesterday.

Forty four people have recovered.\n\nTuesday's new cases were reported in: Kingbury, Lincoln, Minnehaha (4) and Yankton.\n\nThe state has reported one death as a result of COVID-19, a man from Pennington County.\n\nNoem: Cities have public health powers, but counties left out in final legislative day\n\nSouth Dakota cities have the power to take broad measures to stem a public health crisis, Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday, but a similar move to give county governments the same power failed in the final hours of the legislative session.\n\nNoem, speaking hours after the Legislature closed a marathon final day that included the passage of several emergency bills, said lawmakers had good debate on a day that lasted more than 16 hours.\n\n“Well, we got through it,” she said.\n\nRetirement home employee in Clear Lake tests positive for coronavirus\n\nAn employee at the Deuel County Good Samaritan Society in Clear Lake has tested positive for the coronavirus, the retirement home confirmed in a statement.\n\nThe employee has not been publicly identified at this time, nor has the employee’s position at Good Samaritan Society.\n\nThe statement noted the retirement home facility is working closely with federal officials to monitor the situation. Families of residents have been notified that there has been potential exposure from the employee. Extra precautions are being taken to monitor health of the residents and staff, the release said.\n\nSioux Falls closing off parts of parks to limit gatherings\n\nThe city of Sioux Falls is closing portions of parks in Sioux Falls to reduce people from gathering in large groups.\n\nThe restrictions mean basketball hoops will be coming down, playgrounds will be taped off and dog parks will be closed, Mayor Paul TenHaken said. Skateboard parks will also be closed.\n\nThe bike trail will remain open and people can continue to go to parks to walk their dogs or run, but TenHaken wants to limit the number of people who are gathering in groups.\n\nThe restrictions do not affect Falls Park, but the visitor's center there remains closed.\n\nMonday, March 30\n\nHelpline center sets up 24-hour hotline\n\nAvera Health and the Helpline Center are creating a 24-hour hotline for people who need some mental health support because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Helpline officials announced today.\n\nThe hotline will be available immediately, according to a press release from the Helpline Center.\n\nSanford doctor in Watertown tests positive for COVID-19\n\nSanford Clinic of Watertown confirmed Tuesday that Dr. William Devine has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSanford's policy is not to disclose identifying information regarding patients, but Devine chose to self-identify, according to the health care provider. His exposure is believed to be travel related, and he is now resting at home.\n\nBecause Devine self-isolated as soon as he developed symptoms, Sanford officials believe his exposures to patients was limited. Those who were seen by Devine on or after March 25 will be contacted by the South Dakota Department of Health. Sanford also encourages patients who have had recent contact with Devine to monitor themselves closely and call the Watertown clinic at 605-886-1565 or schedule an e-visit using My Sanford if they have COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nSouth Dakota reaches 101 total confirmed cases Monday\n\nSouth Dakota reported 11 new cases of COVID-19 Monday and brought the lab's pending test number to zero.\n\nThe new numbers provided by the South Dakota Department of Health Monday bring the total confirmed cases in South Dakota to 101.

There is no end date to the resolution.\n\nNoem says special session needed for 'significant' changes to state budget\n\nState lawmakers will meet next week to vote on a number of bills to help the state respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic, but Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday more work will be needed.\n\nThe governor said she's looking to call a special session in June to make \"significant changes\" to the state budget.\n\nNoem plans to sign existing bills in the meantime, but she's not going to spend those funds allocated for the next fiscal year until the state has a clearer picture of how the pandemic will affect state revenues.\n\nTwelve new confirmed cases reported in South Dakota\n\nTwelve new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been confirmed in the state as of Friday, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThat brings the state's total to 58 confirmed cases, a number that does not take into account the state's 20 pending tests or those with symptoms who are not being tested.\n\nCommunity spread of the virus has also been confirmed in nine counties with substantial spread in Beadle and Minnehaha.

Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Steve Barnett to postpone the joint city-school district election. In a letter to Noem and Barnett, City Clerk Tom Greco cited several reasons for postponing the election, including disinfecting polling places and poll workers who tend to skew older. Older people have been a key demographic facing serious complications from the Covid-19 pandemic. Greco wrote that 80% of his poll workers are 60 and above.\n\nMunicipal elections scheduled for April 14 across the state face similar dilemmas.\n\nUnemployment office scrambling to keep up with surge in claims\n\nMore than 1,700 people in South Dakota filed for unemployment benefits last week as businesses across the state send workers home amid COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nThe new figures released Thursday morning by the U.S. Department of Labor show the rise in South Dakota claims as well as the surge in claims in unemployment offices nationwide.\n\nIn South Dakota, the 1,703 claims received by the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation was a 907% increase from the 169 claims filed the week prior.\n\nAnd the spike is forcing the department to add staff and phone lines to its call center.\n\nVisiting loved ones in a nursing home during coronavirus\n\nThree times a week Janis Hoogestraat would visit her 92-year-old mother who is in assisted living.

As she rolled her fine, silver hair into curlers, she would tell her mom about what her grandchildren have been up to. They would spend time together looking at photos and reminiscing on the past.\n\nHer visits look a little different now because of the coronavirus. Hoogestraat can no longer paint her mom’s nails but now has to talk to her through the window in her room at Edgewood Assisted Living.\n\nRead more\n\nWednesday, March 25\n\nSen.

Adjustments to the budget could include revision or elimination of the 2% pay increase for teachers, state employees and Medicaid providers originally included in the spending plan.\n\nTenHaken says city going 'as far as we can' to prevent COVID-19 spread\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken addressed reporters and the public Wednesday afternoon to address the advent of community spread of the novel coronavirus in both Minnehaha and Lincoln County.\n\nBecause of substantial community in Minnehaha, meaning five or more confirmed cases whose origin cannot be traced, TenHaken wanted to reiterate the measures his administration is taking to slow the spread.\n\nLincoln County has now seen a moderate level of community spread, TenHaken added.\n\nIn response, TenHaken is recommending that the city board of health enact an ordinance to limit businesses to having fewer than 10 patrons at one time.\n\n\"It's a very strict ordinance,\" TenHaken said. \"It will be enforceable by a Class 2 misdemeanor\"\n\nConfirmed coronavirus cases jump to 13 in Minnehaha County, 'substantial' community spread\n\nEleven more people have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus — eight of them in Minnehaha County, where the South Dakota Department of Health says there is now \"substantial\" community spread.\n\nThe updated numbers from the South Dakota Department of Health say that there are now 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, with 268 tests still pending at the South Dakota Public Health Lab. That doesn't include the number of tests pending in commercial labs.\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Tuesday that he'd heard community spread was likely occurring in the city.\n\nThe increase in Minnehaha County brings the total number of confirmed cases up to 13, the same number as Beadle County where community spread was also confirmed as \"substantial.\" Those two counties have the highest rate of confirmed cases in the state.\n\nTenHaken to recommend mandating businesses limit patrons amid coronavirus spread\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken is recommending the Board of Health and City Council force select businesses not let more than 10 people occupy their buildings at the same time, an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in Sioux Falls.\n\nThe types of businesses that would be affected if the recommendation is adopted will be those listed in an executive order signed by Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this week. Those include bars, restaurants, breweries, cafes, casinos, recreation or athletic facilities, health clubs and entertainment venues.\n\nBusinesses can remain open, but they must comply by allowing no more than 10 people at one time, under the mayor's recommendation. A Class 2 misdemeanor is punishable by a $500 fine and/or up to 30 days in jail.\n\nLawmakers to meet via teleconference on Veto Day due to coronavirus\n\nThe South Dakota Legislature will meet via teleconference for the final scheduled day of this year's legislative session.\n\nLawmakers were scheduled to convene on Monday in Pierre to consider action on any vetoes from Gov. Kristi Noem, but decided to hold the meeting remotely due to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nThe meeting may also be used to consider emergency actions like budget adjustments or legislative action in light of the global pandemic. The public will still be able to listen to the meeting.\n\nSurgeries continue at S.F. Specialty Hospital\n\nThe Sioux Falls Specialty Hospital continues to perform surgeries for patients who are in pain, but those surgeries comply with Gov. Kristi Noem’s order for providers to cease elective surgeries, the hospital’s chief executive officer said Tuesday.\n\nNoem’s executive order said health providers should postpone “all non-essential elective surgeries to conserve (and thereby maximize) supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).”\n\nHospital CEO Dr. Blake Curd said that the facility has been taking steps for weeks to prepare for the pandemic and that the facility is following guidelines set by federal and state officials.\n\nTuesday, March 24\n\nTenHaken: COVID-19 community spread has likely hit county, which would prompt further action\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Tuesday afternoon that he's received updates from contacts in the medical community that community spread of the novel coronavirus has hit Minnehaha County.\n\nAnd if it's confirmed, recommendations to limit the movement of people in Sioux Falls will be coming.\n\nTenHaken relayed the information to the Sioux Falls Board of Health during a meeting at Carnegie Town Hall where the seven-member panel got a briefing on the status of COVID-19 in the community.\n\n\"Even in the last hour, I have received phone calls and information ... that there is likely some confirmed cases of community spread in our county,\" he said during the portion of the meeting when the board received general input from the public. \"If that is confirmed, that raises our response.\"\n\nSchool District staff member tests positive\n\nA staff member at Laura Wilder Elementary has tested positive for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement released by the Sioux Falls School District.\n\n\"All parents and staff members at Laura Wilder were notified of this confirmed case minutes ago,\" the statement read. \"We have provided guidance from the South Dakota Department of Health to families and staff.\"\n\nIt's unclear if this case is one of the 30 confirmed in South Dakota as of Tuesday, or if this is a new case in the state.\n\nPublic universities to hold remainder of classes online\n\nNow that South Dakota has instances of COVID-19 cases occurring through community spread, classes for South Dakota's six public universities and two special schools will be delivered remotely for the rest of the spring semester.\n\nThe South Dakota Board of Regents made the announcement in a press release Tuesday afternoon. The decision is effective immediately, and the spring semester is scheduled to end May 8, the release states.\n\nGraduations at each university have also been postponed.\n\nNoem: Escaped female inmates from same unit as inmate with COVID-19\n\nEight female inmates left a minimum-security unit in Pierre on Monday, the Department of Corrections said.\n\nThe inmates left the Pierre Community Work Center without authorization at 8:43 p.m. Monday by exiting an exterior door, according to a release from the DOC.\n\nWomen’s prison staff began escape procedures, and law enforcement was notified, according to the news release. The South Dakota Highway Patrol aircraft was used to assist ground operations to search for the inmates.\n\nThe walk-off occurred the same day the South Dakota Department of Health announced one case of COVID-19 at the Pierre Women's Prison, one of seven new cases on Monday. Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday confirmed those who escaped were from the same unit as the inmate who tested positive, but didn't know how close in proximity the women had been.\n\nSouth Dakota schools to remain closed until May; two more cases reported\n\nSouth Dakota schools will remain closed until May 1, Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday.\n\nThe governor said state employees will also continue to work remotely until May 2.\n\nShe added that the state will reevaluate in the coming weeks to see if students will return to school buildings before the end of the school year.\n\n\"With a virus that we're still learning about ... we're making sure that we're making the right decision and keeping kids out of school,\" Noem said.\n\nThe state saw two more positive COVID-19 test results as of Thursday afternoon, bringing the total confirmed positive cases to 30 with hundreds more test results pending.\n\nNoem said Tuesday that an additional two people have recovered from the virus.\n\nThe new cases are in Beadle and Brookings Counties.\n\nNoem also said she's still planning on holding veto day later this month. She's working to find ways to do that remotely, if possible.\n\nTenHaken: Health board and city council won't be taking actions on business closures today\n\nSioux Falls mayor Paul TenHaken says the city's health board and city council will not be taking actions today on whether non-essential businesses can stay open in the city.\n\nThe meeting at 2 p.m. is informational, he said, and the board will be discussing options.\n\n\"Businesses can stay open, but we are really going to be pinging you to operate in the most appropriate fashion,\" TenHaken said.\n\nOn Monday, Governor Kristi Noem issued an executive order that didn't mandate that businesses close, but that they must take actions to frequently clean and limit the number of patrons who are inside the building at a time.\n\nThat puts the onus on business owners, TenHaken said.\n\nSioux Falls police opt for citations, not arrests to prevent coronavirus spread\n\nSome offenses that typically merit a trip to the jail are meriting only citations and an ordered court appearance in light of COVID-19.\n\nBoth the Sioux Falls Police Department and the Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office have shifted priorities over the last couple of weeks to focus on keeping both officers and the community safe.\n\nThe police department last week announced changes to the reporting process for some crimes, urging the public to use online resources to alert police of offenses when a suspect or suspects are not present.\n\nAnd Monday, Police Chief Matt Burns told the Argus Leader that officers have been directed to issue summons and citations \"in lieu of some arrests\" to minimize exposure to the general public while the novel coronavirus continues to be a health threat for the community.\n\nAvera Health closing doors to most to visitors\n\nAvera Health is closing its hospitals to nearly all visitors to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, the Sioux Falls-based health care system announced Tuesday.\n\nThe only exceptions will be for births, pediatric cases, NICU and end-of-life care. Those visitors will be limited, according to Avera's announcement.\n\n“We understand that these restrictions will be difficult for patients, family members, friends and loved ones,\" Chief Medical and Innovation Officer Dr. David Erickson said in an emailed statement. \"Top priority is the protection of everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable.\n\nMonday, March 23\n\nCoronavirus cases could swamp South Dakota hospitals if projections hold\n\nGov. Kristi Noem estimated Monday that 30% of the state’s population is expected to get infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nThat estimate – which could be optimistic – would likely overrun the state’s medical capacity if cases are not spread out over a period of months. And it underscores why medical leaders have been stressing the need to space out infections over time – the “flatten the curve” approach to managing the disease.\n\nA 30% infection rate in South Dakota would lead to about 265,000 infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that about 20% of people who get infected are ill enough to require hospitalization. The most severe cases require intensive care unit treatment.\n\nThat rate would see about 53,000 hospitalizations.\n\nBut South Dakota doesn’t have nearly enough hospital beds to serve that level of hospitalizations. The South Dakota Department of Health currently licenses 11 hospitals statewide that have a capacity of 2,006 beds.\n\nNoem signs executive order after community spread found in 'several' counties\n\nGov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order on Monday setting a baseline for decision-making related to the novel coronavirus in South Dakota.\n\n\"We are doing this now because we do have community spread in South Dakota in several counties,\" Noem said. \"This is what South Dakotans should do. It is direction on doing the right thing.\"\n\nThe order is intended to set a baseline of guidance for businesses, community owners and health care providers. It recommends businesses limit groups to 10 or fewer and that health care providers stop doing elective surgeries.\n\nLyman, Hughes and Beadle County have seen community spread, Noem said. The Hughes County case is an inmate in the women's prison, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed.\n\nRead the full executive order.\n\nRemote learning will continue in Sioux Falls schools 'until further notice'\n\nSioux Falls Superintendent Brian Maher says his district is prepared for the possibility of a long-term closure, and that starting Tuesday, students will participate in remote learning until further notice in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMaher made the announcement during a briefing with the press Monday, before the district holds its first school board meeting since Gov. Kristi Noem recommended South Dakota schools be closed this week to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that's affected hundreds worldwide.\n\nAs of Monday, South Dakota had 28 cases, including one death, across the state as well as hundreds of pending tests. Noem announced the state also had its first cases of community spread in multiple areas after an increase in confirmed cases over the weekend.\n\nMinnehaha County, which includes Sioux Falls, currently has five confirmed cases, per state data. The state also closed schools the week prior as a precautionary measure to give school districts a chance to clean facilities and plan for the possibility of an extended closure.\n\nAvera, Sanford labs to begin coronavirus test processing\n\nBoth Avera and Sanford Health announced Monday that they will begin processing tests for coronavirus after winning regulatory approval from the government.\n\nAvera said it would have capacity to process about 200 tests daily, and Sanford said in a separate announcement that it would process 400 tests, with plans to double that capacity in coming weeks.\n\nTests will be processed at both of the systems' Sioux Falls laboratories.\n\nSen. Thune rebukes Democrats for 'dillydallying' over coronavirus bill\n\nU.S. Sen. John Thune accused Democrats of holding up the Senate's coronavirus bill during a partisan debate on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nThune raised his voice at Democrats in frustration during a debate on the Senate floor that devolved into screaming matches over the $1.8 trillion bill after Senate Democrats blocked the passage of the bill on Sunday. Thune's comments came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had a tense exchange with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., in which Manchin said the bill helps big businesses and Wall Street instead of health care workers and smaller businesses.\n\n\"Really?\" Thune responded. \"Are we going to do that again? Are we going to do this again, you guys coming over here to block votes and use the line that this is a bailout for big corporations?\"\n\nTenHaken recommends closure of non-essential businesses in Sioux Falls\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken said Monday he will recommend that the city health board close non-essential businesses.\n\nWithout a mandate from the state, TenHaken said, he's asked the board to consider closing businesses if the data provided supports that, and it does.\n\n\"We're at that point,\" TenHaken said, citing community spread of the novel coronavirus in Beadle County.\n\nThe health board will meet at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Public Health Director Jill Franken said their discussions will depend on a planned executive order from Gov. Kristi Noem, which is expected to provide clarity to businesses and municipalities across the state.\n\nSeven more cases reported, bringing state's total to 28\n\nGov. Kristi Noem said Monday that 30% of South Dakotans could get sick, according to projections.\n\n\"That is literally tens of thousands of people in our state,\" she said.\n\nThe state saw an increase of seven cases between Sunday and Monday, she added. That brings the state's total to 28. Positive cases of COVID-19 will continue to increase until May or early June, Noem said.\n\nAs the number of cases increase, the governor said she won't be able to specifically address each new case. She encouraged the public to rely on the data from the Department of Health website: http://covid.sd.gov/.\n\nRep. Bob Glanzer of Huron tests positive for coronavirus\n\nRep. Bob Glanzer, a Republican from Huron, has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nHe said he's had a fever that kept ramping up. He received the positive test result on Sunday. He's been self-isolating for about a week and doesn't believe he's had contact with any of the 10 people who have tested positive in Beadle County, he said.\n\nGlanzer, in his second term, represents Beadle and Kingsbury counties in the South Dakota House. He said he's not planning to attend the Legislature's final day on March 30.\n\nSunday, March 22\n\nNoem: Coronavirus won't peak in S.D. until at least May\n\nCoronavirus cases will continue to increase in South Dakota until at least May, according to projections Gov. Kristi Noem shared Sunday.\n\nNoem, in a Facebook live video Sunday afternoon, advised residents that the virus is \"not a short-term thing\" in the state.\n\n\"We will in June, July, August still be watching this trend going through South Dakota,\" Noem said. \"This isn't going to be over in two weeks.\"\n\nNoem also said we will have community spread in South Dakota, likely within days. Seven more cases were reported Sunday, bringing the state's total to 21.\n\nSioux Falls City Council asking governor to postpone election\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken, all eight city councilors and the City Clerk are urging Gov. Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Steve Barnett to take emergency action to postpone Sioux Falls' April 14 election.\n\n\"As Chair of the Sioux Falls City Council, I am writing to you on behalf of my colleagues and Mayor Paul TenHaken. We urgently request that you delay our local election until the June 2, 2020 Primary Election,\" wrote Sioux Falls City Council chairman Marshall Selberg in a letter sent to Pierre Sunday.\n\nIn a separate letter sent to the governor, City Clerk Tom Greco said the novel coronavirus and the response its compelled across the country could hinder Election Day in Sioux Falls, drive down voter turn out and cause voter confusion due to the necessity to change precinct polling places if the election is held next month.\n\nHuron closing restaurants, bars, other businesses\n\nHuron and Beadle County officials closed restaurants, bars and other businesses Sunday afternoon just hours after Gov. Kristi Noem announced that Beadle County had become the nexus for coronavirus cases in the state.\n\nNoem said Sunday morning that Beadle County had six additional cases and the county was on the verge of reaching the stage where coronavirus was being spread throughout the community. Noem called on officials in Beadle County to take action to curtail the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe closures included all recreation facilities, theaters and schools beginning at 12 a.m., as well as the public landfill. It did not apply to groceries or businesses serving off-site food. The closures were until further notice.\n\nWill Sioux Falls shut down businesses? That's up to city council\n\nThe Sioux Falls Board of Health will meet Tuesday to review next steps to combat the spread of COVID-19, which could include asking councilors to OK closing bars and restaurants in the city, the mayor's office said Sunday.\n\nThe development comes just minutes after the mayor of Rapid City on Sunday announced an emergency meeting of the City Council there, in which they will consider an ordinance to enact emergency measures that include the closure of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, clubs, cafes, casinos and recreation facilities.\n\nIn Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken has said repeatedly that he can't force private business closures through executive action. His deputy chief of staff, T.J. Nelson, told the Argus Leader Sunday that enforcing that sort of action can only be done through ordinance.\n\nAnd while there's no immediate plans to ask the City Council to do that, Nelson said it will be discussed by the Sioux Falls Board of Health, which will ultimately make any recommendations on further action to be taken up by councilors.\n\nHuron, Beadle County officials hold emergency meeting after more cases announced\n\nHuron and Beadle County officials are in an emergency meeting this afternoon after Gov. Kristi Noem called on local officials to take more measures to halt the spread of coronavirus.\n\nNoem on Sunday announced that six new cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Beadle County and that community spread was likely just days away. The county has the most cases in the state with 10 of the 21 announced.\n\nA joint city/county commission meeting was not open to the public. During the meeting, Huron Police Capt. Mark Johnson said Mayor Paul Aylward had been on the phone with Noem to discuss available options and what legal authority local officials have to enact more stringent measures.\n\n“Right now we want the public to know we are on top of this,” Johnson said.\n\nSeven more cases reported in South Dakota\n\nGov. Kristi Noem released more details on the confirmed positive novel coronavirus cases in South Dakota. Six of the seven new cases were in Beadle County. Here's the breakdown of the demographics of those cases:\n\nMale, age 60-69\n\nFemale, age 50-59\n\nFemale, age 20-29\n\nMale, age 20-29\n\nFemale, age 10-19\n\nMale, age 10-19\n\nThe seventh new case is a 60-69 year old man from Brown County. His case was related to travel.\n\nNoem said the new cases in Beadle County were related to the existing cases. After initial conversations\n\n\"Beadle County could be in a community spread situation within a manner of days,\" she said.\n\nSaturday, March 21\n\nLatest data from state shows little change, unclear how many tests run\n\nThe latest coronavirus data from the South Dakota Department of Health showed little change Saturday.\n\nNo new positive COVID-19 test results were reported, leaving the number of confirmed cases at 14. It is unclear both how many pending tests were run since the latest results Friday and how many new tests have been received by the state in the same time period.\n\nThe number of negative cases saw a decrease, but that number no longer shows a clear picture of the state's results. Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said that commercial labs processing tests from South Dakota were not sending the number of negative results, only the positives.\n\nFriday, March 20\n\nNoem to Trump: State had to get 'pushy' for chemical to run coronavirus tests\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem expressed her frustration at not being able to get a chemical to process coronavirus tests to the president and his leadership team during a call with governors on Thursday.\n\nSouth Dakota’s backlog of unprocessed kits grew to 385 after the state ran out of reagents earlier this week. The state lab in Pierre, where the processing is done, was able to resume on Thursday after getting some of the processing chemical.\n\nOn the call with President Trump, Noem said the state had to get “a little pushy with a few people” in order to get the supplies. She questioned how the testing agents were being triaged by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n“I just don’t want to not be a priority area because we’re a smaller state and less populated,” Noem said.\n\nTrump responded: “That will never happen to you, and it will never happen to your state.”\n\nSouth Dakota moves to cancel standardized testing amid coronavirus concerns\n\nSouth Dakota Secretary of Education Ben Jones is asking the federal Department of Education to cancel annual standardized tests for K-12 students.\n\nJones announced Friday that he'll be applying for a waiver with the department.\n\nThe waiver would allow the state to complete the school year without state assessments and standardized tests for third through eighth grade and 11th grade students.\n\nWith the school closures brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic, Jones said any testing done this year wouldn't provide useful data.\n\nNumbers unchanged from Thursday\n\nSouth Dakota reported no additional testing of COVID-19 Friday morning, a day after about 100 tests were completed after needed testing resources were delivered to the state.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem announced on Thursday three additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. According to an update on the South Dakota Department of Health website, that number didn't change as of noon Friday because the state did an update Thursday night. The total reported positive cases in the state remained at 14.\n\nThe state announced on Wednesday that it had run out of supplies to test the samples collected from patients on Monday. The state lab resumed testing Thursday on what they called high-priority cases after receiving reagent, a substance or mixture used in chemical analysis or other reactions.\n\nSioux Falls officials plead with residents to practice 'social distancing' this weekend\n\nSioux Falls officials have an important message for residents heading into the weekend: Don't give up on practicing social distancing.\n\n\"I can't stress this enough,\" Sioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken said. \"With the weekend coming, continue to practice social distancing for the entire health of the community.\"\n\nEven though there has been no reported community spread, Franken said people need to remain diligent.\n\n\"We do not have a vaccine to protect people in our community,\" Franken said. \"Our only course of action is to follow recommended community mitigation efforts. ... Given that our cases have remained steady, what we are doing is working, but we can't get into a false sense of security because we don't have community spread yet.\"\n\nThursday, March 19\n\nThree more cases reported in state\n\nGov. Kristi Noem said the state tested 94 high-priority COVID-19 tests on Thursday. Three of those came back positive, all from Beadle County. The infectious disease team is working to determine if any of those cases indicate community spread.\n\nNone of those cases required hospitalization, Noem said. Ages ranged from 30 to 60, and the cases were two men and one woman, though more specific information wasn't available.\n\nThat brings the total number of positive tests to 14, with 663 negative and 270 pending.\n\nNoem says testing will resume today\n\nThe number of pending COVID-19 tests in South Dakota continues to rise after the state public health lab ran out of supplies to run the tests, though Governor Kristi Noem said some high-risk tests would be processed Thursday.\n\nThere are now 385 pending tests for the new coronavirus, according to the South Dakota Department of Health. No new deaths have been reported, and the number of positive cases remains at 11 and the number of negative cases remains at 551.\n\nTenHaken closing all non-essential city buildings\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken is closing the few city-owned buildings in Sioux Falls that remained open after the city's COVID-19 response already shut the majority of them down.\n\nTenHaken said during a morning news briefing Thursday the closure of the City Center administration building and City Hall, as governments across the country continue to respond to the novel coronavirus. The closures are effective as of noon on Thursday.\n\nScheduled public meetings will continue at Carnegie Town Hall, though that building will also be closed when those proceedings are not in session.\n\nSioux Falls police urge online crime reporting to limit officers' exposure to public\n\nSioux Falls police are modifying the way they respond to certain calls, by asking the public to file online reports when possible in an effort to limit officers' exposure to others in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSpokesman Sam Clemens said if someone wants to file a police report, and the suspect is present, to call police right away. For everything else, online reports are encouraged.\n\nAvera announces postponement of some elective surgeries\n\nAvera Health announced Thursday that it will suspend some of its elective surgeries amid concerns over coronavius response.\n\n“Our physicians are working to balance patient safety and quality with the resources available. These resources include protective equipment like gowns and masks and intensive care beds,” said Dr. Kevin Post, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Avera Medical Group. “We emphasize that we are looking to postpone procedures, rather than canceling them altogether.”\n\nThe decision comes as hospitals across the country ramp up for an expected wave of coronavirus patients.\n\nHow the state plans to move forward with COVID-19 testing\n\nState lab officials were relieved Wednesday to receive \"critical\" supplies to test a hundreds-deep backlog of COVID-19 kits, and they're looking ahead to get more testing capabilities.\n\nGov. Kristi Noem on Thursday announced that the state had received testing supplies and could begin testing the most critical samples immediately.\n\nThe state, Noem said, received a shipment of reagent a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis or other reactions.\n\nIn statewide situation update conference calls Thursday morning, state public health lab leaders advised healthcare providers to send the lab samples from the most critical patients.\n\nWhitney: Will social distancing tear us apart? Not on your life.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 10, there was little indication that our world was changing forever.\n\nMy biggest concern was finding a parking spot to cover the Summit League women’s basketball finals at the Denny Sanford Premier Center, where nearly 8,000 fans turned out to watch South Dakota defeat South Dakota State for a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this is a magical time of year. March Madness is tipping off, spring break finds its footing, baseball is around the corner and outdoor wonders await. People are ready to expand their daily experience amid the lingering woes of winter.\n\nThat Tuesday night, I returned to watch the Summit League men’s finals with my son, greeting familiar faces in the concourse. As we took in the action, commenting on the players, there was no way to know that it would be the last stretch of normalcy we’d experience for a while.\n\nWednesday, March 18\n\nAirport taking hit as outgoing travel plummets\n\nTraffic at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport is down dramatically as travelers respond to coronavirus concerns, causing a significant drop in revenue.\n\nIncreasingly strict guidelines for travel and social gathering have already created what will be a lasting financial impact for Sioux Falls' airport and its airlines, which are likely just days away from announcing significant schedule reductions, said Dan Letellier, the airport's executive director.\n\nThe bulk of the decrease so far is a drop in outgoing travelers as people look to cancel their trips, though the Sioux Falls airport is still seeing travelers returning earlier from trips.\n\n\"The people you're seeing are those trying to get home,\" Letellier said.\n\nTenHaken urges businesses to adhere to 'no more than 10' gathering guidelines\n\nSioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken says there are no plans to mandate the closure of bars or restaurants in Sioux Falls.\n\nTenHaken said he doesn't have the authority to do so, but he is strongly recommending that restaurants, bars and other businesses where people gather adhere \"religiously\" to the recommendation that no more than 10 people gather in one place at one time.\n\nSen. John Thune says coronavirus needs 'swift and bold response' from federal government\n\nU.S. Sen. John Thune said the federal government needs to restore confidence in the U.S. economy and provide a \"swift and bold response\" to the coronavirus.\n\nThe stock market's drop in recent weeks due to the coronavirus is \"very concerning,\" Thune said in a media call on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think what's important right now is to calm the markets and to restore the confidence, is to demonstrate that our leadership in this country understands what's at stake and is prepared to go big and go bold and take the decisive action that's necessary to restore confidence,\" Thune said.\n\nWhat you need to know about collecting unemployment amid COVID-19 fallout\n\nThe country's response to the novel coronavirus is expected to put thousands, if not millions, out of work, with those in the food service industry heavily affected.\n\nUndoubtedly, many South Dakotans will fall into that category. That's why various funds are being set up to help soften the blow of the economic fallout from forced quarantines and closures.\n\nFor those who find themselves left without a job entirely, the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation offers unemployment benefits for those who qualify.\n\nSouth Dakota's public health lab lacking COVID-19 test supplies\n\nThe South Dakota public health lab hasn't had the supplies needed to run COVID-19 tests since Monday, according to a state update.\n\nThe state didn't receive the supplies it needed and there isn't a time frame for when the supplies will be available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or commercial suppliers, according to an update emailed by state epidemiologist Josh Clayton. He noted that there's a nationwide shortage of the supplies needed to run the tests.\n\nTuesday, March 17\n\nS.D. will not have school next week, Noem says\n\nSouth Dakota schools will not be in session again next week, Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNoem was in Sioux Falls this afternoon to meet with medical providers about COVID-19 after meeting with her Cabinet this morning.\n\n\"We will not be holding school next week in the state of South Dakota,\" Noem told reporters during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nCancelling school will give the state time to ensure adequate lab testing and supplies are in place for \"whatever may come our direction,\" the governor said.\n\nMayor wants $250K for 'One Sioux Falls' fund\n\nThe mayor's office is asking Sioux Falls City Councilors to set aside $250,000 for a new fund to help those who lose paychecks over COVID-19 quarantines and closures.\n\nAs proper safety guidelines change by the day, Sioux Falls businesses, owners and workers face uncertain times with financial hits as the only certainty. That's why a fund has been established to help people in Sioux Falls negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus and the quarantines in place.\n\nThe fund is set up in collaboration with the Sioux Falls Area Community Foundation, which will benefit residents in the greater Sioux Falls area and help avoid evictions and financial hardships if they are unable to work while closures and work restrictions last. It would also help them if they are unable to qualify for federal or state assistance.\n\nMinnehaha County reports new case, bringing state's total to 11\n\nOne positive COVID-19 case was reported in Minnehaha County on Tuesday, bringing the county's total to five cases.\n\nThe case was the only new positive case in South Dakota. The state as a total 11 positive COVID-19 cases and 551 negative tests as of Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health. The state had 35 pending cases on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe new case in Minnehaha County is a woman in her 50s, according to the health department.\n\nAvera, Sanford joining forces on coronavirus testing\n\nThe laboratories of Avera Health and Sanford Health will work together to begin processing coronavirus test results, the chief executive officers of the two regional health systems said Tuesday.\n\n“We’re made for this,” Avera CEO Bob Sutton said. “This is a calling we all have.”\n\nSanford CEO Kelby Krabbenhoft said the systems hope to be able to process hundreds of tests by the end of week to speed up results. The goal, he added, is to manage the disease as it works through the community.\n\n“It’s going to take its toll,” Krabbenhoft said. “It’s not going to be avoidable.”\n\nTesting is a key to monitoring and detecting the disease, and Avera Chief Medical Officer David Erickson said health officials want to do more. The two health entities working together can speed up getting those results to patients.\n\nSioux Falls to limit limit public gatherings at city-owned buildings to 10 people\n\nSioux Falls officials are asking the city council to limit the number of people who can gather at city-owned buildings at 10 people.\n\nThe Sioux Falls City Council will consider the regulations Tuesday night during its weekly meeting.\n\nThe new recommendation comes a day after the city proposed limiting public gatherings to 50 people. CDC and President Trump revised that guidance to 10 people Monday morning, and Sioux Falls is following suit.\n\nRestaurants and bars are not being forced to close, but Mayor Paul TenHaken says he is encouraging restaurants to offer delivery or drive-up service for food. He said bars and restaurants do not have to close, but they should limit how many people can be in the same proximity.\n\nHere's what we know about COVID-19 testing in state\n\nSouth Dakota now has COVID-19 tests for about 3,200 people after state officials said they requested more last week.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health will continue to request additional testing supplies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as needed, according to department spokesman Derrick Haskins.\n\n\"This is a very rapidly evolving area of South Dakota's response to COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nSouth Dakota's public health lab in Pierre is still able to provide test results to the requesting medical provider on the same day that it's tested at the lab, according to Haskins. The CDC has stopped requiring states to send tests to the federal agency for confirmation and has also stopped requiring two tests per person. A nasal swab is now only taken for the test. The decrease in per-person tests means providers can conserve the specimen collection supplies, he said.\n\nMonday, March 16\n\nNoem confirms one death in S.D. related to COVID-19\n\nGov. Kristi Noem confirmed Monday that one death in South Dakota can be directly linked to the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe governor addressed media and the public Monday afternoon after the state saw one additional positive case bringing the total number of positive tests to 10. The state has 494 negative tests and none pending, as of noon Monday.\n\nShe said her heart goes out to the family during this difficult time. The person who died was a resident of Pennington County but had not been in that county for two weeks prior to his death. He was in Davison County at the time of his death. His death had previously been announced last week, but Noem said at the time it wasn't clear if the coronavirus was the direct cause of death.\n\nMeanwhile, the state lab had up until this point been able to get test results back to patients within 24 hours, but due to lack of supplies to run the tests, results may take up to 48 hours. High- and medium-risk tests will be prioritized, Noem said, and she expects the delayed test results to be a very short-term situation.\n\nPublic universities moving classes online\n\nBeginning March 23, all classes at all public universities in South Dakota will be moved online temporarily, according to a press release Monday from the South Dakota Board of Regents.\n\nOn-campus and in-person classes are currently scheduled to resume April 6, the release states.\n\nThe regents are expected to revisit the situation and communicate any potential additional changes March 27.\n\nWhat's next for Sioux Falls schools?\n\nSuperintendent Brian Maher said it's too early to tell what the next steps could be, but he answered as many questions as he could during a media briefing with the Mayor Paul TenHaken, and Sioux Falls Public Health officials Monday.\n\n\"Our chief role is the development of students,\" Maher said. \"Almost always that development is academic in nature, but our role has changed from an academic responsibility to a social responsibility. Part of that responsibility is closing down our schools this week, and then who knows. That may be the beginning of this interruption.\"\n\nClick here for what schools are doing.\n\nSDHSAA cancels spring high school sports through April 5\n\nThe spring sports season has been canceled through April 5 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to a South Dakota Activities Association memo to member schools obtained by the Argus Leader.\n\nPractice for spring sports/activities is a \"local decision,\" the email reads, with schools asked to make the decision based on CDC guidance, state entity guidance, local information, the number of participants involved, the nature of the activity and local control.\n\nAdditionally, state basketball tournaments remain \"suspended/postponed\" at this time, as do all-state band and region music contests.\n\nOne new coronavirus case reported in Minnehaha County\n\nOne new positive COVID-19 case was reported in South Dakota on Monday after a weekend of no new cases.\n\nThe new case is a man in his 20s in Minnehaha County, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.\n\nThe new case brings the state to 10 positive COVID-19 cases. The number of negative tests is at 494, as of Monday.\n\nAll 10 cases resulted from travel out of state, the Department of Health said.\n\nSioux Falls planning to restrict gatherings to 50 people at city-owned buildings\n\nThe city of Sioux Falls is moving forward with a plan restricting public gatherings to 50 people or less in city-owned facilities based on CDC guidance.\n\nJill Franken, Public Health Director for the City of Sioux Falls, said the City Council will be discussing the plan to limit gatherings at city-owned facilities to 50 people at it's next city council meeting. The CDC guidance was for eight weeks, but it's unclear how long the restrictions will be for Sioux Falls.\n\nA state of emergency issued last week limited gatherings to 250 people at city-owned facilities.\n\nFranken is urging business owners and residents to also restrict gatherings to 50 people or less.\n\nAmerican Red Cross closes physical locations in South Dakota\n\nBoth chapters of the American Red Cross in South Dakota have closed their physical locations in response to the spread of the new coronavirus in the state.\n\nGretchen Hjelmstad, Regional Communications Officer and Marketing Director for the American Red Cross' Dakotas Region, said that non-essential staff will work remotely \"for the foreseeable future,\" but the organization will otherwise be operating as normal.\n\nNot many staff members work in the offices, Hjelmstad said, but the buildings can get a lot of foot traffic at times.\n\nAnyone in need of service should use the region's website or call the appropriate chapter's office number, Hjelmstad said. The 24/7 disaster hotline will also remain staffed.\n\nHere's what South Dakota daycares should be doing amid coronavirus concerns\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Social Services is urging childcare providers to take precautions to ensure the health and safety of children and families amid concerns about COVID-19.\n\nGov. Noem has asked the department to work closely with childcare providers across the state to institute commonsense practices to assist families in need, while also safeguarding the health of all South Dakotans.\n\nThose practices include:\n\nCovering coughs, staying home when sick and enhancing already required hand washing and sanitizing practices\n\nLimiting entry into the facility or home by putting into practice child drop off at the front door\n\nAssessing potential risk with staff and parents from travel to affected areas\n\nEnsuring that employees and children are not admitted when ill. Those showing signs of illness should be sent home and advised to call their primary healthcare provider for further screening and testing, if necessary\n\nReducing, postponing or cancelling events and gatherings, especially those involving large groups or exposure to the public\n\nUsing spring break or temporary closures while children are away to deep clean and disinfect the facilities, especially surfaces and items in high-touch areas. The CDC provides guidance regarding cleaning and disinfection\n\nImplementing regular deep-clean practices in addition to daily cleaning\n\nCoordinating with DSS licensing specialists, local public health officials and emergency management\n\nNoem working to activate business loan program amid coronavirus\n\nGov. Noem announced on Monday that she's working with the U.S. Small Business Administration to help South Dakota businesses affected by COVID-19.\n\nThe Governor's Office is working with the SBA to activate the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in South Dakota to help eligible small businesses and nonprofits impacted by COVID-19, according to the announcement.\n\nAffected small businesses and nonprofits need to download, complete and submit the EIDL worksheet.

The new deadline is May 3, 2023.\n\nHere's what you need to know to be up to date and ready to fly.\n\nWhat are enhanced, Real and standard IDs?\n\nThere are currently three types of driver's licenses, permits or non-driver IDs that New Yorkers can choose from.\n\nStandard IDs can be used for identification purposes.

You still need a passport to travel to those countries on a plane, though.\n\nReal or enhanced IDs are not mandatory, and they are not necessary to be licensed to drive or vote.\n\nHOMELAND SECURITY: Real ID travel deadline set for 2018\n\nNEW YORK: Clerks warn of trouble with driver's licenses\n\nWhy do we need these IDs?\n\nThese requirements are the result of the Real ID Act, which was passed by Congress in 2005 at the 9/11 Commission's suggestion that the federal government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nNew York is one of five states that currently issues enhanced licenses, which comply with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. That is a joint plan between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State that went into effect in 2009 and requires all travelers to present a passport or other acceptable document that proves identity and citizenship when entering the United States.\n\nEnhanced licenses include a Radio Frequency Identification chip that allows authorities to see someone's biographic and biometric data at a border inspection booth. Those licenses also have a Machine Readable Zone or barcode that authorities can read electronically if the RFID chip system is not available.\n\nHow do you know what ID you have?\n\nEnhanced IDs have your full legal name, your address and an American flag on the bottom right corner of the license. They also say \"enhanced\" at the top of the licenses.\n\nReal IDs also show your full legal name and address, but they have a star in the top right corner instead of an American flag.\n\nIf you received your license before Oct. 30, 2017, and it is not enhanced, then it is a standard ID. Standard IDs issued after Oct. 30, 2017, have \"Not for federal purposes\" on the top right corner of the license.\n\nHow do you get these IDs?\n\nReplacing or renewing a standard ID does not require a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles, but obtaining a Real or enhanced ID does.\n\nThere is no extra cost for a Real ID, though the regular transaction fees still apply. An enhanced ID costs $30, though, on top of the regular transaction fees.\n\nYou can get a Real ID at any time by going to a DMV office with proof of identity, such as a valid license, birth certificate or passport; proof of Social Security number or Social Security number ineligibility; proof of date of birth; proof of U.S. citizenship, lawful permanent residency or temporary lawful status in the U.S.; and two different proofs of state residence.\n\nIf the name on your license, permit or non-driver ID does not match the name on your identity, lawful status and Social Security proofs, then you must also bring court- or government-issued records explaining that.\n\nYou can apply for an enhanced license at a DMV office. If you have never had a driver's license before, you must apply for an enhanced learner permit first. If you don't need to drive, you can apply for an enhanced non-driver ID.\n\nTo find out which documents you need to apply for an enhanced ID, go to dmv.ny.gov for more information. An enhanced ID arrives in the mail in about two weeks.\n\nThe state says upgrade soon\n\nNew Yorkers have until May 3, 2023 to get their IDs up to par, but the state is suggesting that people take care of it soon. In June 2018, the DMV launched a campaign to boost public awareness of the new ID requirements, and in summer 2018 it held a statewide promotional tour and social media initiative.\n\n\"Real ID is available at all DMV offices statewide and we encourage you to get your new license or non-driver ID today, especially if you are renewing or applying for the first time,\" DMV Executive Deputy Commissioner Terri Egan said in a statement in June. \"Getting a new Real ID requires an office visit, and we expect lines to grow as the deadline approaches.

Garcia\n\nThe Santa Fe New Mexican\n\nThis fall has brought much confusion about identification requirements for domestic air travel, causing residents of New Mexico to line up in overwhelming numbers to obtain passports. In fact, the next available appointment to acquire a passport at Santa Fe's main post office isn't until mid-March.\n\nBoth the state and federal governments have had a hand in the uncertainty surrounding what kind of ID is required to board a domestic flight. On Oct. 19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to New Mexico officials notifying them it would not grant the state an extension to implement a national security law known as the REAL ID Act. At issue is a state law allowing residents to obtain drivers' licenses regardless of their immigration status. As a result, stated Homeland Security's letter, the federal government would not accept New Mexico licenses to enter some federal buildings, such as those on military bases or at national labs, starting Jan. 19, 2016.\n\nThe letter also said the federal government eventually would not recognize the state's licenses for domestic flight passengers, a warning the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has repeated for the past seven years across all 50 states, but never has enforced. Organizations that have analyzed the REAL ID Act say it may never be enforced for domestic air travel because of resistance by state governments, some of which have decided to defy the federal mandate.\n\nIn New Mexico, a state that says it wants to comply with the REAL ID Act, the issue of who gets a state-issued driver's licenses has been at the heart of a pitched political battle for five years. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has waged an unsuccessful fight to repeal the state law allowing undocumented immigrants to receive New Mexico drivers' licenses, a policy she calls \"dangerous.\" Democrats in the state Legislature, along with many Republicans in the Senate, have stood against Martinez, saying a two-tiered driver's license system they have devised would solve the problem. Despite all the infighting, some believe federal officials will take the heat if state driver's licenses someday aren't accepted for domestic air travel.\n\n\"If that day ever comes when TSA [the Transportation Security Administration] turns people away at the airport, the one getting all the blame is going to be TSA and Department of Homeland Security,\" said Jim Harper, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based libertarian organization. \"It's not going to be people turning to their state legislators and saying, 'How did you fail to do what the federal government wanted?' \"\n\nFor its part, Homeland Security says New Mexico drivers' licenses are still fine to use as identification to board domestic flights. If the agency ever changed that policy, all states would be given four months to adjust to the new dictate, said Philip A. McNamara, an assistant secretary with Homeland Security. The federal government says some 28 states, New Mexico among them, are not in compliance with the REAL ID Act. Oddly, at least one state that promised to defy the federal law, Utah, now is following REAL ID directives, Homeland Security says.\n\nIn New Mexico's case, the federal government says the state needs to do more than alter its drivers' licenses by checking the immigration status of applicants. For example, the state also needs to issue temporary REAL ID-approved drivers' licenses to people with short-term lawful status in the country. Those temporary licenses need to expire when the person's lawful status expires, Homeland Security says. Another federal stricture starts in January, when New Mexico driver's licenses won't be sufficient identification to enter some federal facilities — for example, White Sands Missile Range and Los Alamos National Laboratory. White Sands said it will continue to accept New Mexico drivers licences to access the range. And the lab already has a screening process that employees go through to receive clearance and an entry badge. A U.S.-born citizen needs to present a U.S. passport or birth certificate to get a clearance badge. An employee who is a naturalized U.S. citizen needs to present a certificate of naturalization, the lab website says.\n\nAir travel is the hot-button issue, though. After the Martinez administration announced the state didn't receive an extension from the federal government to implement the REAL ID Act, panic followed about whether passports would be needed to board planes for domestic travel. Numerous people feared their licenses were no longer valid to fly domestically.\n\nThen a piece of misinformation about domestic flights was printed in a newspaper. On Nov. 20, the Albuquerque Journal published an editorial inaccurately saying, \"NM law means you need a passport, terrorists don't.\" In response, McNamara of Homeland Security wrote a letter that said, \"Right now, no one needs to adjust travel plans, rush out to get a new driver's license or a passport for domestic air travel.\"\n\nNo state has ever been punished because it hasn't complied with the federal REAL ID Act.\n\nMoreover, the TSA has always accepted drivers' licenses for domestic air travel in all states that it says are not compliant with the REAL ID Act. Still, Santa Fe residents rushed to make appointments to renew or obtain passports. Similar scrambles have occurred all over New Mexico. In response to the high demand, the U.S. Postal Service scheduled six passport fairs across the state in December, including one Saturday in Las Cruces.\n\nMartinez campaigned hard on repealing the law allowing state residents without proof of immigration status to obtain a New Mexico driver's license, and for five years she has continued to push for its repeal. She has been adamant, even opposing a two-tiered driver's license bill earlier this year that would have allowed immigrants to continue driving, while still making the state compliant with the REAL ID Act. That bill cleared the state Senate 35-5, with all Democrats and most Republicans voting for it, a political setback for Martinez. But the measure died when the House of Representatives did not hear it. That left in place the existing law allowing undocumented immigrants to receive licenses identical to those issued to citizens.\n\nThe compromise bill was sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Stuart Ingle, R-Portales, and Sen. John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, among the more conservative state senators. They previously had sided with Martinez on a repeal bill, but they broke from her this year after studying the issue for themselves. They say the compromise bill would have enabled New Mexico to meet the federal standard while also allowing immigrants — who are crucial to the New Mexico economy — to continue driving lawfully. For instance, workers who harvest New Mexico's famous green chile crop are almost entirely Mexican nationals who do a backbreaking job that many Americans wouldn't take.\n\nMartinez has received plenty of plaudits and criticism in the state for her focus on the law allowing licenses for undocumented immigrants. But as other states, including Colorado, California and Illinois, have emulated New Mexico's licensing law, she also has begun to draw criticism from outside New Mexico.\n\n\"It's a little bit ironic that a Republican is seeking a larger federal government and a national ID system, whether it's to win political points or what. That's not actually what a Republican is supposed to stand for,\" said Harper of the Cato Institute. Last month, Peter Simonson, executive director of the New Mexico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the state should keep defying the federal government because the REAL ID Act would threaten states' rights.\n\n\"It is a federal overreach that strips rights from the states, tramples civil liberties, puts citizens' personal information at risk, while doing little to make us safer,\" Simonson said. \"The federal government's denial of New Mexico's requested extension should be recognized for what it is: a bullying tactic meant to force New Mexico into accepting a national ID card that nobody wants or needs.\"\n\nCongress approved the REAL ID Act in 2005 as part of a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission. In its report, the commission recommended that the federal government set standards for state identification cards such as driverss licenses. Even so, seven states that also issue driver's licenses or driving privilege cards to undocumented immigrants are in compliance with the REAL ID Act — including Utah, which had set out to defy it.\n\nThe first \"deadline\" for states to comply with the Real ID Act was 2008. But as some states refused, the Department of Homeland Security kept extending the deadline. It continues to grant extensions to certain states. Arizona, one state that has refused to comply with REAL ID, has received an extension from Homeland Security. New York, with some of the nation's busiest airports, also is not in compliance. But Homeland Security has given that state more time as well, until October 2016 at the earliest, to meet requirements of the federal law.\n\n\"New Yorkers can continue to use their current state-issued driver license or ID card to board domestic flights until DHS announces otherwise,\" New York's Department of Motor Vehicles says on its webpage. Harper said that, as part of the act, states need to share driver information with the federal government, essentially creating a national ID database. This is an important reason why some governors and state lawmakers have refused to participate in the program. They don't want the federal government to expand its reach to the local level, Harper said.\n\n\"It offends me that the federal government — a bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security — is trying to tell the New Mexico State Legislature what its policy should be,\" Harper said. \"That's contrary to how our government is supposed to work.\"\n\nMichael Lonergan, a spokesman for Martinez, said in an email that the governor wants to be compliant with the REAL ID Act because \"it's the law of the United States.\"\n\nHe said not being compliant with the act will inconvenience many New Mexicans. \"This would be disruptive to the lives of many New Mexicans and small-business contractors,\" he said. \"Complying with the law simply requires that New Mexico ends the dangerous practice of providing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, which is overwhelmingly supported by New Mexicans.\"\n\nUtah, a state that the federal government says is compliant with the REAL ID Act, allows undocumented immigrants to obtain a driving privilege card that also is recognized by the Transportation Security Administration as valid government identification to board a plane. The agency says it accepts driver's licenses or other photo identity cards issued by motor vehicle departments of the states.\n\nNew Mexico Rep. Paul Pacheco, R-Albuquerque, who previously sponsored bills to repeal New Mexico's licensing law for immigrants, recently softened his stance and says he will introduce a Utah-style bill in the House during next year's legislative session. Senate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez, D-Belen, also said recently said that a bill compliant with the REAL ID law \"will be introduced and passed again in the Senate during the upcoming 2016 session.\"\n\nIn many cases, implementation of the REAL ID Act seems to depend on the cycle of state politics. For example, five years ago, Utah approved a law to ban implementation of the federal act. But the state inadvertently complied when its legislature approved its two-tiered driver's license law. In Colorado, state lawmakers opposed the federal regulations, but the state's motor vehicle department had already implemented policies to comply with the REAL ID Act.\n\nIn Arizona, then-Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat who would later become Cabinet secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration, signed a law in 2008 barring the state from complying with the REAL ID Act. Her successor, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, also declined to recognize the federal law. But earlier this year, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed a law that would eventually make Arizona compliant. Arizona does not allow undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver's license. Its lack of compliance with the REAL ID Act is tied to other concerns the federal government has about its identification system.\n\nMontana, another state not compliant with the federal law, also does not issue drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security's website lists Minnesota as the only state that is not compliant with the federal law. But it also lists 27 other states that aren't compliant but have extensions, or their request for an extension is under review. New Mexico was denied an extension, yet it is listed as working toward compliance.\n\nContact Santa Fe New Mexican reporter Uriel Garcia at 505-986-3062 or ugarcia@sfnewmexican.com.

Look in the top right corner of your license. If you see a gold star, your license is Real ID compliant. If you don't have one, you'll need to upgrade your license or carry another Real ID compliant form of identification when you travel.\n\nWhat do I need to get a Real ID in Arizona?\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, you'll need to make an appointment with the Motor Vehicles Division. You can make an appointment at https://azmvdnow.gov.\n\nYou will need to present four documents to obtain a Real ID. These include:\n\n1. Proof of identity\n\nBring ONE of the following:\n\nCertified birth certificate.\n\nU.S. passport.\n\nPassport card.\n\n2. Proof of Social Security number\n\nBring ONE of the following:\n\nSocial Security card.\n\nW-2 form.\n\n3. Proof of Arizona residency\n\nBring TWO of these showing your current address:\n\nUtility bill.\n\nCredit card statement.\n\nBank statement.\n\nInsurance policy.\n\nDo kids need a Real ID?\n\nTSA does not require IDs for children younger than 18 if they are traveling with an adult within the United States. However, the agency recommends checking with your airline for its specific requirements.\n\nHow much does a Real ID cost?\n\nAn Arizona travel ID costs $25.\n\nDo you need a Real ID if you have a passport?\n\nNo. A U.S. passport or passport card will work. According to the TSA website, you can use any of the following:\n\nU.S. passport.\n\nU.S. passport card.\n\nDHS trusted traveler card (Global Entry, Nexus, Sentri, FAST).\n\nU.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents.\n\nPermanent resident card.\n\nBorder crossing card.\n\nState-issued enhanced drivers license.\n\nFederally recognized, tribal-issued photo ID.\n\nHSPD-12 PIV card.\n\nForeign government-issued passport.\n\nCanadian provincial drivers license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card.\n\nTransportation worker identification credential.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employment authorization card (I-766).\n\nU.S. Merchant Mariner credential.\n\nMy license is about to expire but I don't want to go to the MVD right now. What do I do?\n\nDon't worry. On Dec. 30, Gov. Doug Ducey issued an executive order \"deferring renewals of standard driver licenses with an expiration date between March 1, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021, by one year from their original expiration date.\"\n\nYou can check your new expiration date at https://azmvdnow.gov.\n\nHowever, the executive order only applies to the expiration date of your license, not its status as a Real ID. If your license is not travel-compliant, you will not be allowed through security. If you decide to wait to renew, check whether you have one of the other Real ID-compliant options in case you have an emergency and need to fly after Oct. 1.\n\nWill TSA accept my expired license?\n\nTSA is allowing some grace for those who haven't been able to renew their licenses during the pandemic. But it depends on the expiration date.\n\nTSA started allowing people to use a license that expired after March 1, 2020, at airport security checkpoints for one year after the expiration date. TSA plans to keep this policy in place until 60 days after the national emergency is lifted.\n\nAgain, that only applies to the expiration date. You'll still be required to present a Real ID after Oct. 1, 2021.\n\nYou can connect with Arizona Republic Consumer Travel Reporter Melissa Yeager through email at melissa.yeager@azcentral.com.

When that happens, people must have identification compliant with the act to pass through airport security or enter federal buildings.\n\nAs of that date, a standard driver's license or identification card won’t get you through a TSA checkpoint. You will need the enhanced driver's license known as the Arizona Travel ID.\n\nArizona has issued more than 2.1 million Arizona Travel IDs since their introduction, including 262,083 in 2023, ADOT spokesman William Lamoreaux said.\n\nHere’s how to get a Real ID in Arizona, including all the documentation you need.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nDo I need a Real ID to fly in 2024?\n\nNo. A valid, state-issued drivers license or identification card is enough to board a domestic flight, for now.\n\nWhen do you need a Real ID to fly?\n\nReal ID will be required to fly on domestic flights starting May 7, 2025.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security intended to begin enforcing the Real ID Act in May 2023, but it pushed back the deadline by two years.\n\nOfficials cited lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on states' abilities to ensure their residents have driver's licenses or identification cards that meet Real ID standards. They said progress was stalled because of licensing agencies' need to work through pandemic backlogs.\n\nNew at Sky Harbor Airport for 2024:Flights, restaurants, lounges and more\n\nWhat do I need to get Real ID in Arizona?\n\nTo get an Arizona Travel ID, ADOT requires one primary document for proof of birth, two documents for proof of address and a Social Security number.\n\nAcceptable documents for proof of birth include:\n\nCertified birth certificate.\n\nU.S. certificate of birth abroad.\n\nU.S. passport or passport card.\n\nPermanent resident card or resident alien card.\n\nUnexpired USCIS employment authorization document.\n\nI-94 form with an unexpired foreign passport and unexpired U.S. visa.\n\nU.S. certificate of naturalization.\n\nU.S. certificate of citizenship.\n\nAcceptable documents for proof of address must be issued from a business, organization or government agency and include your name and residential address. Documents must be in print. These include:\n\nUtility bills.\n\nCredit card or bank statements.\n\nInsurance policies.\n\nWhat is an enhanced driver's license?\n\nADOT issues the enhanced Travel ID and standard driver licenses. The difference between the two is the amount of documentation you have to provide to obtain one.\n\nHow do I know if I have a Real ID?\n\nThe Arizona Travel ID contains a gold or black star on the upper right-hand corner. A standard drivers license has no star.\n\nWhen Real ID takes effect, standard licenses with no star will no longer be acceptable identification for domestic flights. People without the upgraded license will need to present another form of Real ID-compliant identification.\n\nWhat if I don’t have a Real ID?\n\nIf you don’t switch from a standard driver’s license to the Arizona Travel ID, you will not be able to pass through airport TSA checkpoints without some other acceptable form of identification. These documents fit the Real ID guidelines, according to the Transportation Security Administration:\n\nU.S. passport.\n\nU.S. passport card.\n\nDHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST).\n\nU.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents.\n\nPermanent resident card.\n\nBorder crossing card.\n\nState-issued enhanced drivers license.\n\nAn acceptable photo ID issued by a federally recognized tribal nation/Indian tribe.\n\nHSPD-12 PIV card.\n\nForeign government-issued passport.\n\nCanadian provincial driver's license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card.\n\nTransportation worker identification credential.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card (I-766).\n\nU.S. Merchant Mariner credential.\n\nVeteran Health Identification Card.\n\nDo children need a Real ID?\n\nChildren under 18 don't need Real ID to fly within the U.S., as long as they're accompanied by an adult who does have Real ID, Lamoreaux said.\n\nHow much does an Arizona ID cost?\n\nA Real ID-compliant Arizona Travel ID costs $25.\n\nMichael Salerno is an award-winning journalist who’s covered travel and tourism since 2014.

Plus a photo that depicts you not smiling.\n\nAs one of the last states in the country to roll out Real IDs, New Jersey and its Motor Vehicle Commission ran into obstacles along the way, including computers that couldn't process Real ID updates and a cache of scanners that were obsolete.\n\nBut, as of Wednesday, Real ID upgrades are available by appointment in six agencies across the state. Trenton and Eatontown were the only publicly named locations where it is available.\n\nThe long awaited Real IDs will replace driver's licenses and identification cards used to get on domestic commercial flights and to access federal facilities.\n\nWondering how to update to Real ID? On Thursday, in a small back office of the Trenton Motor Vehicle Commission, that question was answered when a NorthJersey.com reporter went through the process to update his standard driver's license to be Real ID compliant.\n\nWhat documents are needed for Real ID?\n\nFor as long as New Jersey drivers have been making the slog to their local motor vehicle office, the winning number has always been six.\n\nSix points of identification, tallied together with combinations of acceptable documents, each worth a varying number of points. Birth certificate. Social security card. Even a credit card bill that has one's debt tastefully redacted with a Sharpie.\n\nBut with a more secure ID card comes a more secure protocol. So the new formula has been dubbed 2+1+6.\n\n\"In order to get a Real ID you’re going to need two proofs of residential address, one proof of social security and then six points,\" said Kim DiGiovanni-Abatto, the commission's deputy administrator of agency operations, as she sifted through the reporter's documents.\n\nThe acceptable documents range from a valid driver's license to a utility bill or credit card bill from the past 90 days. Some documents, such as a social security card and a driver's license, fulfill more than one category.\n\nOne tip when relying on bills and statements: redact sensitive information ahead of time.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:Realtors say these 5 North Jersey towns are hidden gems\n\nTRENDING:American Dream is set to open in six weeks. We finally got a look inside\n\nMy documents are in order. What's next?\n\nTwo commission employees will coordinate the update: one to enter an applicant's information and the other to verify documents.\n\nOnce the documents are cleared, they are scanned into the state commission's database. There's a difference that sets the process apart from previous years — your scanned information will be sent to a federal database.\n\nThe next steps boil down to a few key questions that may elicit varying levels of anxiety.\n\nOrgan donor or organ hoarder? Cash or card? No smile or no smile?\n\nThe bad news is that if you want to update to Real ID, you'll need a new head shot, said DiGiovanni-Abatto. The good news is the photo, likely a stiff and panic-eyed visage, is good for eight years, she said.\n\n\"For either upgrades or renewals, yes you will have to take your picture,\" said DiGiovanni-Abatto.\n\nAfter taking a photo — you will be told \"no smiling\" — you can have the commission employees take it again or accept your scowling driver's license photo.\n\nAfter the photo, an applicant will pay the $24 to upgrade an expired license to a Real ID, or $11 for an upgrade on an unexpired license. Then, applicants answer questions including whether they'd like to be an organ donor.\n\nAll done\n\nThe upgrade takes about 10 minutes, though some agencies that are not validated may take longer at first.\n\nThe update process earns you a driver's license you can use for domestic flights, a sense of accomplishment and a gold star in the upper right hand corner of your card, like a stamp of validation for an eager student turning in homework.\n\nThe star encased in the gold circle is the only real visual difference between the standard driver's license and a Real ID.\n\nFor now, in order to go through the process, you'll have to register online at realidnj.com to get an appointment at the nearest office that offers the upgrade. For the start of the roll-out, only six agencies will offer windows to upgrade to Real ID, but there are tentative plans to add more agencies to the list.\n\n\"That's the plan, but we're already adding asterisks,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nEmail: torrejon@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/09/28/arizona-real-id-deadline/3533976001/", "title": "Arizona Real ID: The new deadline and what you should bring to the ...", "text": "If you still don't have the travel compliant Real ID, you can move that item down your to-do list. The countdown clock has reset due to the coronavirus pandemic, giving you another year to get yourself a compliant ID before the new deadline of Oct. 1, 2021.\n\nThe original Oct. 1, 2020, deadline was supposed to mark the completion of the final phase of the REAL ID Act of 2005, which Congress passed on recommendation from the 9/11 Commission after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. That act aims to provide \"minimum security standards\" for the issuance of identification nationwide. It requires Americans to have a compliant ID to board U.S. domestic flights. (A passport has and will continue to be required for international flights.)\n\nBut the COVID-19 health crisis has delayed that plan.

If you see a gold star in the upper right corner, your ID is compliant.\n\nIf you do not see a star, then you'll need to either get a new ID or use another TSA- approved form of identification, such as a passport, passport card or military ID, when you fly after Oct. 1, 2021.\n\nAre Motor Vehicle Division offices open?\n\nYes. They are open. You should also be aware that you do need to make an appointment and those are limited to services you can only do in the office such as \"first-time driver licenses, first-time registrations and road tests.\" You will need to wear a mask when in the MVD offices.\n\nYou can also visit an authorized third party provider office.\n\nDrivers are encouraged to take care of license and registration issues online through AZMVDNow.gov or ServiceArizona.com to help alleviate backlog at the MVD offices. You can also call the statewide customer service phone line at 602-712-2700.\n\nWhat documents to you need when you get your Real ID?\n\nIn the meantime, you can start collecting the documents you need to get your Real ID. You need four documents to obtain one. These include:\n\n1. Proof of identity\n\nBring ONE of the following items:\n\nCertified birth certificate.\n\nU.S. Passport.\n\nPassport card.\n\n2.

It’s ridiculous. To top it off, Sununu is wasting our money on this political stunt.\n\nI see what’s happening here. Sununu endorsed the wrong candidate in the Republican primary (Nikki Haley), so now he has to somehow salvage his MAGA-credentials, and he's decided this desperate ploy is the way to do it. He's using our money to bolster his political future. And he calls himself a fiscal conservative!\n\nThis isn’t conservatism; it's fiscal malfeasance, and it’s pathetic.\n\nJim Mastro\n\nDover\n\nInflation matters in reporting Portsmouth salaries\n\nFeb. 18 — To the Editor:\n\nThe Portsmouth Herald has been publishing the number of employees for the city of Portsmouth who made at least $100,000 for as long as I have been a subscriber. The problem is it does not take into account inflation. According to the government’s inflation data $100,000 today would have been worth $54,798 in 2000. The Herald did not think a salary of $55,000 was newsworthy in 2000 so why would its equivalent be newsworthy today? In 2000, the median family income in New Hampshire was $50,930, according to the Census Bureau. $100,000 was nearly twice as large as that.\n\nBy 2023 the median income in New Hampshire was $83,877. $100,000 is less than 20% more than that. Being 20% above the middle income in a state is not newsworthy in my opinion. If the Herald is going to continue reporting on the salaries of the city’s employees, it should take inflation into account.\n\nWalter Hamilton\n\nPortsmouth\n\nTom King for Rye Select Board\n\nFeb. 19 — To the Editor:\n\nAs a Rye School Board member, I am excited and grateful that Tom King is running to extend his 20-plus years of public service to Rye by serving a second term on our Select Board. Tom has brought industry, intelligence and integrity to his work as selectman.\n\nTom does the work. He invests his time and diligence researching the issues and addressing constituents that come before the Select Board, issues such as drinking water safety, ensuring that his vote and influence will work on behalf of all of all citizens. From my seat on the School Board, I have seen how he invests his efforts to fully understand all aspects of school keeping, ensuring that our town remains relevant, safe, and inviting for our school children, all residents, and future generations.\n\nYears of public service provide Tom with the wisdom to weigh complex issues with fairness and attention to detail. He is unwaveringly honest and forthcoming in researching and in explaining issues to help Rye citizens comprehend the short and long-term impacts of all decisions. For example, Tom championed an initiative to streamline the process by which Rye contributes to regional non-profit agencies. He led the Regional Association Review Committee and the Select Board in establishing a just and transparent process for investing taxpayer funds in a fiscally prudent and ethically sound fashion.\n\nTom, and his wife, Sally, have served Rye with diligence and devotion on their respective committees for years. Always honest and thorough in independently researching and deliberating town matters, Tom has led our community with the utmost integrity as a member of the budget committee, the CIP, the historic district commission, the beach and the town center committees, along with the Select Board. So many forms of public service have given him the wisdom to consider all issues with the fairness and attention to detail that ensure sound leadership.\n\nA vote for Tom King for Rye selectman is a vote for Rye's health and humanity.\n\nSusan Cole Ross\n\nTeacher, Secretary, Rye School Board and vice chair, Rye Regional Association Committee\n\nLibrary is the vital center of Rye: re-elect Hodgdon and Ross\n\nFeb. 21 — To the Editor:\n\nThe Rye community is exceedingly fortunate to have two individuals willing to continue their service as library trustees — JoAnne Hodgdon and Jeff Ross. The library is, in fact, the vital center of the town of Rye. The scope of its activities and its remarkable responsiveness to the varied needs of the community make it a dynamic gathering place for our relatively small town.\n\nJoAnne Hodgdon and Jeff Ross have worked tirelessly over the past three years to integrate input from the Friends of Rye Library, an Advisory Group and the dedicated library staff into a distinctive plan for augmenting the library's current capacity. The passage of Warrant Article 9 and the re-election of Ross and Hodgdon in the town election on March 12 will dramatically enhance the role the library plays with the community at-large.\n\nAn expanded outdoor space would allow performances by junior high theatre arts classes and invited musical and dance artists. Study nooks would modernize the library's facilities for teen and adult users. Much careful planning, consulting and visioning have gone into creating a fiscally moderate plan for bringing our town library into the 21st century with attentiveness to what Rye residents have repeatedly voiced as a felt need for an iconic, central place for Rye towns folk — families, teens, children and seniors — to come together.\n\nRe-elect Ross and Hodgdon as library trustees who have done the hard work the community elected them to do. Pleased vote on March 12 and support Rye's wonderful library.\n\nRonna F. Werner\n\nRye\n\nWright is best choice for Rye\n\nFeb. 21 — To the Editor:\n\nThe town of Rye election will be taking place on March 12 at Rye Elementary School from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Campaigning is currently underway, and voters will soon choose the best candidate for the various open seats.\n\nWe are facing many challenges daily and I would like to share my views as I pledge support for Select Board candidate Rob Wright. He has been a resident in this town for 33 years, longer than most running for office. He is committed to identifying and resolving issues currently facing our community by working in unison with each layer of town government. Our town will benefit from responsible decision-making in all areas, especially financial. Rob has proven during his time serving the town that he is willing to listen, fosters good communication, and would be an asset to all citizens.\n\nRob and his wife Lori raised their two children in Rye, both of whom attended Rye Schools from kindergarten to eighth grade, and who remain in New Hampshire. They have blessed Rob and Lori with three grandchildren who they adore. Being an avid outdoorsman, Rob is deeply concerned with maintaining our natural resources and beautiful seacoast and will fight to keep Rye’s water clean.\n\nMy support comes from being a lifelong resident having previously served Rye for over 50 years. I am also a proud Vietnam veteran who for the past 54 years has paid tribute to veterans in town by placing American flags on their gravesites and WWI monument for every Memorial Day.\n\nPlease vote Rob Wright for Select Board on March 12. He is the leader our town needs.\n\nJohn Moynahan\n\nRye\n\nDog owners need to clean up mess on rail trail in Portsmouth\n\nFeb. 22 — To the Editor:\n\nWe are so thankful to the state of New Hampshire for the rail-to-trail path currently being developed off Islington Street in Portsmouth. We walk that trail daily and it is a perfect walking, biking, jogging trail for the city. However, we are concerned that it is being abused by some people. Yesterday we counted more than 40 piles of dog waste along the trail from the old WBBX road to Barberry Lane, and many plastic bags of dog waste were also deposited along the trail. We ask pet owners to please, please clean up after your dogs and leave the trail in good condition for others to enjoy.\n\nLinda and Ralph DiBernardo\n\nPortsmouth\n\n$100,000 salary no longer indicates wealth\n\nFeb. 21 — To the Editor:\n\nI would like to add some additional context in response to Jeff McMenemy’s article “192 Portsmouth employees paid $100,000-plus in 2023.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ CPI Inflation Calculator, $100,000 in early 2024 is the equivalent of approximately $76,000 in early 2014. Earning a “six figure income” is no longer indicative of significant wealth. Had multiple city employees’ earnings edged above $76,000 10 years ago, it’s unlikely the story would have been headline-grabbing.\n\nPatrick Ganz\n\nGreenland\n\nThuggery by the MAGA right\n\nFeb. 18 — To the Editor:\n\nLast week I ran across a news item that brought me up short: Nikki Haley, campaigning in South Carolina, had requested FBI Secret Service protection because of numerous threats she had received. In case you miss the significance of this, she is a Republican, campaigning in a Republican primary, in a Republican state, receiving threats that are almost certainly from Trump supporters. That same week, the special counsel in the Trump Mar-a-Lago documents case had to request that witnesses’ identities in the case not be revealed because of fear of harassment. This while planning is in progress to install 8-foot metal barricades around the federal courthouse in D.C. in preparation for the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings. This is just a short listing of recent events of a type that have become so commonplace that we seem to consider them normal.\n\nWhat has happened to our country? Can we no longer have free expression of ideas, hold traditional election contests, or conduct constitutionally protected legal proceedings without fear of harassment or even physical harm? This isn’t politics as usual; this is thuggery.\n\nIn this environment what normal person would ever want to run for public office, serve on a jury or appear as a witness in a politically involved court case? I hope our sitting politicians who with their silence and servility realize where this is heading. And if they don’t, we as voters had better set them straight this November before it’s too late: vote the MAGA sympathizers out, so we can return to some normalcy in our politics; bring back the old GOP.\n\nArlo Gambell\n\nRye\n\nNikki Haley is only good choice\n\nFeb. 23 — To the Editor:\n\nOur country is seriously divided with an election looming in the near future. Neither of the leading candidates offers any hope of healing this divide. Our current president is directing “crushing sanctions” on Russia as a result of the death of an opposition leader. Why weren’t these sanctions initiated years ago to crush Russia’s ability to wage war in Ukraine?\n\nThe president also is considering “executive action” to deal with the immigration crisis on the border, just weeks after saying there was nothing he could do until our dysfunctional Congress passed legislation. Again, why weren’t these executive actions taken years ago to aid in dealing with mass immigration? I’ll tell you why. The president’s actions are driven by his political pundits reacting to his declining poll numbers. His policy proposals and the timing of all of his actions are in response to his latest polls, with the focus of those actions on the next election. He doesn’t care about the overall impact of his decisions on the country, but how he can pander to his most vocal and active supporters. Even his green initiatives will be harmful to the economy, and of limited value to the environment because of the narrowness of his focus. He’s an expert at pandering.\n\nThis president is entirely focused on the next election, as he’s always been.\n\nThe other side of the coin can be even worse. The former president is a megalomaniac who surrounds himself with sycophants who fill feed his ego. His action as chairman, president, and presidential candidate are entirely driven by what is best for him and/or the Trump empire. He did some good things for the country as president, but only because it was advantageous to his financial holding. He’s not afraid to spend taxpayer money to finance his personal agenda. He borders on being an irrational actor (like his buddy in North Korea) on the international stage, and shows total disdain for the expertise and experience of his military advisors.\n\nHe reminds me of another historical figure who took control of his country through violence, also dismissed the advice of his military advisors, and pandered to his fanatical core of supporters by blaming all their troubles on outside influencers. They called him the “Bavarian Corporal.\" It didn’t end well for him or his country. I would hope we never travel down that road, but I’m concerned. Both leading candidates are free-spenders further endangering the long-term prospects for our economy, and both have little understanding of military issues and capabilities.\n\nThe Democrats have not put up an alternative to Joe Biden, so I’m out of luck there. Nikki Haley has vowed to continue the fight, and has the ability and desire to bring back the art of politics through collaboration and negotiation. I hope she can pull it off. She has my vote. As one of your contributors includes his rank thinking that may have bearing on credibility, I’ll include mine.\n\n“Dutch” Dunkelberger\n\nKittery, Maine (retired colonel)\n\nGold sneakers and the year of the dragon\n\nFeb. 18 — To the Editor:\n\nAs soon as the former president’s costly verdicts started being decided, the question became, how can someone pay over a half a billion dollars in fines, judgements and interest without breaking the law again? There is plenty of money out there, but how can someone legally accept money or cryptocurrency from Russia, China or Saudi Arabia without raising alarms? A dubious GoFundMe page type tax on the poor just doesn’t seem to be enough to cover everything. It got me to thinking. In Chinese culture, the colors red and gold have meanings. Red is associated with good fortune. “Gold is thought to represent good luck, wealth, prosperity and good fortune.” It would appear that gold sneakers and red hats could be a stealthy shout out to China. If you are charging $399 for a pair of sneakers that can be made for a few dollars a piece, you could pay off your legal debts if you could sell a couple of million pairs in China, Russia and Saudi Arabia. We’ll just have to see how much of the money/cryptocurrency is transferred, and from where, before the first pairs are even sold. The continual grift is getting old for this voter. As far as running the United States like a business goes, it is no wonder that our national debt went up about $2 trillion dollars a year while the former president was in office, based on his now-proven fraudulent business practices, poor human resources behaviors and multiple bankruptcies.\n\nDon Cavallaro\n\nRye\n\nTrump rated last among all presidents\n\nFeb. 20 — To the Editor:\n\nA recent poll of social science experts in presidential politics ranked Joe Biden 14th among 45 American presidents, while Donald Trump was rated dead last.\n\n\"The 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey was conducted online via Qualtrics from November 15th to December 31st, 2023. Respondents included current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Sciences Association, which is the foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics . . . as well as scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in key related scholarly journals.\" (Rottinghaus & Vaughn, 2024.)\n\nThe top five presidents were Abraham Lincoln , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , George Washington , Teddy Roosevelt, and Thomas Jefferson . The bottom five presidents in descending order were William Henry Harrison, Franklin Pierce, Andrew Johnson, James Buchanan, and Donald Trump.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not say hello to my friends in New Hampshire, who my wife Lenore and I met during our 23 years residence in the Granite State. After Lenore passed away, I moved to my present location to be closer to my daughter's family.\n\nGary Patton\n\nPrinceton, New Jersey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/27/9-things-know-delaware-gov-john-carneys-2023-spending-plan/6634926001/", "title": "9 things to know about Delaware Gov. John Carney's 2023 ...", "text": "Gov. John Carney's spending plan released Thursday includes pay increases for state workers, millions of dollars in school construction and an immense infrastructure spending plan bolstered by federal aid.\n\nCarney's budget for next fiscal year, which starts in July, includes a $4.99 billion operating budget, $56.9 million in grants-in-aid and a $1.18 billion bond bill. It also sets aside $215.9 million in a \"one-time supplemental\" bill.\n\nThe spending plan also puts $15.2 million into the budget stabilization fund, which would bring that fund to $302.5 million. That fund is essentially a piggy bank that the state can dip into during less fortunate years when revenue is scarce.\n\nScarcity is not a problem this year: Lawmakers expect a whopping $824 million in extra revenue, on top of gargantuan stimulus packages from the federal government to pay for roads, bridges and other government initiatives.\n\nCarney has promised no tax increases, budget cuts or staff layoffs next fiscal year.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nRepublicans, moderate Democrats and progressive Democrats can expect to brawl over how to spend the money. But over the years the Democratic-controlled Statehouse has swayed little from Carney's relatively cautious spending plan, which routinely allocates extra revenue into savings and one-time spending such as construction.\n\nCarney's office touts this year's spending plan as moving further to pay equity for state employees, increasing spending to help low-income students and English language learners in schools and paying for school construction in all three counties. The plan also pays to modernize courthouses in Kent and Sussex counties.\n\n1. Spending plan bolstered by federal spending packages\n\nThe American Rescue Plan, which Biden signed into law in March, gave $355 million for technology and capital upgrades, $135 million to housing, $121 million to health care facilities, $112.5 million to nonprofits, $107 million to universities, $100 million to COVID-19 response and $50 million to workforce development.\n\nThose funds have been distributed, according to Carney's office.\n\nThe infrastructure bill, gives $1.2 billion to federal highway funds, $355 million to clean water projects, $225 million to bridge repairs, $220 million to public transit and $100 million to broadband infrastructure.\n\nThose funds haven't been distributed yet. Carney's administration is still waiting for guidelines and distribution of the funds from the federal government for the infrastructure bill, which Biden signed into law in November.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING:What is coming to Delaware thanks to Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill\n\nAMERICAN RESCUE PLAN:How will Delaware spend $1 billion in federal COVID-19 funds?\n\n2. Attracting businesses\n\nOne of routine the pillars of Carney's spending plan, which is a priority for the next fiscal year, is attracting businesses to the state.\n\nThe spending plan puts $30 million toward the \"Strategic Fund,\" a pool of taxpayer money used to attract businesses.\n\nIt puts $10 million toward a \"site readiness\" fund to quickly convert existing properties for prospective employers. It also puts $10 million toward a \"graduation lab space\" for startups and tech companies, along with $10 million toward a transportation infrastructure fund.\n\nThe Riverfront Development Corp., the entity overseeing the city's riverfront improvements, will get $6.5 million.\n\nPAID FAMILY LEAVE:Revised paid leave bill has the support of business and Gov. Carney. What's in it for you?\n\n3. State workers get pay increases\n\nThe plan increases state worker pay to move closer to a $15 minimum wage, which is in tandem with a statewide law that lawmakers passed last year to apply the $15 minimum wage across industries by 2025.\n\nIt also includes state worker merit pay scale increases and 2% pay increases, as well as negotiated wages and salary steps. State retirees also get a $500 bonus.\n\n4. Environment, clean water\n\nCarney plans to spend $404.7 million on environmental initiatives. Most of that money — $367.2 million — will go to clean water, thanks largely to the federal infrastructure bill. The state also plans to spend $7.5 million on shorelines and waterways, as well as $30 million toward agricultural land preservation and \"open space.\"\n\nThe state's cover crop program to improve water quality and soil health gets $3.2 million. Its conservation cost-share program, which pays for protections against pollutants in state waters, gets $1.7 million. The Delaware Bayshore, a state program meant to protect coastal wildlife and wetlands, gets $500,000.\n\nSTATE OF THE STATE:8 takeaways from Delaware Gov. John Carney's 2022 State of the State address\n\n5. School construction\n\nThe state will also spend $7 million on the Wilmington Learning Collaborative, which would include a new governing board and partnership among the Christina, Red Clay and Brandywine school districts to better the city’s education system.\n\nIt will spend $12.8 million to implement recommendations from the Redding Consortium, a group of education stakeholders working on policies to improve education outcomes for students in Wilmington and New Castle County.\n\nThe plan spends $305.2 million on school construction and renovation, and $15 million on school building deferred maintenance.\n\nNew Castle County will get $82.4 million, Kent County schools get $89.9 million and Sussex County schools get $122.8 million for construction.\n\nSchool districts will get the following amounts in construction spending:\n\nNorthern New Castle: $50.6 million Christiana: $14.9 million New Castle County Vo-Tech: $33 million Colonial School District: $2.7 million\n\nAppoquinimink: $23.1 million\n\nCapital: $56.1 million\n\nCape Henlopen: $2.4 million\n\nSussex Tech: $32.5 million\n\nSmyrna: $19.9 million\n\nCaesar Rodney: $11 million\n\nIndian River: $47.1 million\n\nMilford: $37.4 million\n\nThe state also allotted $25 million in anticipation of construction bids that could cost more than usual due to inflation.\n\nCarney plans to spend an additional $4.5 million on funding for low-income students and English language learners through a program called \"opportunity funding,\" first proposed by his administration in 2018 as a way to give schools additional funding for English learners and low-income students.\n\nBecause of an October 2020 legal settlement that made the funding a permanent fixture in how the state allocates tax dollars for students, the state must spend $60 million on this program per year by 2025.\n\nCarney also plans to spend $20.6 million on mental health services in elementary schools. This was made possible by last year's House Bill 100 by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, which lets elementary schools hire a full-time counselor or social worker for every 250 students and one full-time licensed therapist for every 700 students. The program is expected to cost more than $25 million per year by 2024.\n\nSHORTENED NURSING CERTIFICATION:Facing staffing shortage, Delaware lawmakers move to shorten nurse assistant certification\n\n6. Higher education\n\nThe plan spends $45 million on tech upgrades and infrastructure at the University of Delaware, Delaware State University and Delaware Technical Community College.\n\nAbout $4.3 million will go toward scholarships at those three schools.\n\nThe plan spends $15 million on the Higher Education Economic Development Investment Fund for Delaware colleges, including the state's struggling private colleges.\n\nThe plan spends $921,000 to reduce staff and faculty turnover at DelTech and $100,000 to support DelTech's Bachelor of Education program.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gives an extra $107 million to colleges for pandemic-related projects.\n\n7. Public buildings get upgrades\n\nThe plan spends $26.8 million on libraries, $80 million on Kent and Sussex family courts, $21.8 million on Delaware State Police Troops 4 and 6 and $12 million on the Customs House in Wilmington.\n\nThe Department of Correction gets $11.6 million for facility improvements.\n\nThe plan also spends $8.8 million on public safety communications and equipment, $3.2 million on a new James T. Vaughn intake facility, $3 million on Baylor Women’s Correctional Institute renovations, $2.5 million on Howard R. Young Correctional Center renovations and $1.3 million on Leonard L. Williams Justice Center improvements.\n\nThe plan also spends $35.4 million on state agency capital improvements and deferred maintenance, $10.5 million on Carvel State Office Building renovations, $6 million on the Delaware Hospital for the Chronically Ill, $5.1 million on the Jesse Cooper Building, $3.5 million on Cleveland White Building renovations and $1 million on the Herman Holloway Campus.\n\nMEDICAL AID IN DYING:Delaware House committee clears bill allowing terminally ill people end their own lives\n\n8. What else?\n\nThe plan also spends $6 million on affordable housing; $4 million on \"Strong Neighborhoods,\" which aims to address abandoned and vacant properties; and $21 million on preserving historic and recreational sites.\n\nIt also spends $5.5 million on Downtown Development Districts, a designation created by the General Assembly in 2014 to attract investments from private developers in central corridors blighted by vacant buildings and economic stagnation.\n\nThe plan spends $7.6 million on police body-worn cameras and $390,000 on in-car cameras for police vehicles.\n\nThe plan spends $1.4 million on extended post-partum Medicaid coverage, $1.5 million on a therapeutic foster care program, $3.7 million on expungement programs and $735,000 on crisis beds in Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nIt also spends $996,000 on the Delaware Healthy Children Insurance Program, which provides low-cost health insurance to children whose parents don't qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe plan also spends $500,000 on a loan repayment program for health care workers and $300,000 to permanently fund the mental health services loan forgiveness program.\n\nIt also spends $11.5 million to support child care providers and workers by paying an increase in the purchase of care rates to support child care access for low-income families.\n\n2022 LEGISLATIVE YEAR:More money, new problems, and what else to expect from Delaware's 2022 legislative session\n\n9. What's next?\n\nTwo 12-person bipartisan groups of lawmakers called the Joint Finance and Bond Bill committees later this year will draft the state's official spending plans based on Carney's suggestions.\n\nThey'll hold hearings in February and March to talk about the fiscal measures with government agencies and other stakeholders, who often use the opportunity to ask for more money.\n\nThe final product will ultimately depend on the latest forecast from the Delaware Economic Advisory Council, which meets multiple times a year to predict how much money will come into the state in the near future.\n\nThat group last met in December and will meet again in March, May and June to update the forecast.\n\nWhatever it looks like, Carney has to sign the final spending plan into law by June 30 for an on-time budget.\n\nLEGAL MARIJUANA:Will marijuana ever be legal in Delaware?

Disclosures filed with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management reveal that about 8 million gallons of raw sewage have escaped the Decatur Utilities sanitary sewer system this year in 81 overflows, The Decatur Daily reports. The largest discharge happened last week when rain overwhelmed old pipes, and sewage began pouring from a manhole near the utility’s headquarters. It took the city-owned company more than 40 hours to stop the overflow. Decatur Utilities told the Environmental Department the heavy rains caused the problem, though the newspaper says similar companies in neighboring communities reported few to no sewer overflows during the same period.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: An air carrier that suffered a cyberattack has experienced more disruption than initially projected, according to a company announcement. The RavnAir Group on Dec. 20 experienced what it called a “malicious” cyberattack on its information technology network, Anchorage television station KTVA reports. The company canceled some Alaska flights of Dash 8 aircraft and said passengers could expect more schedule changes. This week the company announced the disruption was worse than initially reported. Restoration of systems could take up to a month, the company said. Additional flight cancellations and delays are possible for the group’s three airlines, RavnAir Alaska, PenAir and RavnAir Connect, the company said. The company is working with the FBI, a cybersecurity company and others to restore systems.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Three mountain lions found feeding on human remains near a popular Tucson hiking trail have been killed, authorities said Wednesday. They were not suspected of killing the person but were determined to be a danger to the public because they showed no fear of officers trying to remove the remains, the Arizona Game and Fish Department said in a statement. The area in the Coronado National Forest was closed for a day while officials attempted unsuccessfully to trap the mountain lions. The medical examiner will work to identify the name and cause of death for the person found Tuesday morning off the Pima Canyon Trail. The trail at the base of Mount Lemmon was reopened Wednesday, ahead of a planned Jan. 14 reopening, after authorities decided there was no danger to the public.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Thursday ordered the city to reinstate a police officer who was fired for fatally shooting a black motorist. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox reversed the Little Rock Civil Service Commission’s ruling upholding the termination of Officer Charles Starks over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February. Starks and another officer were attempting a motor vehicle stop at the time. Police commanders fired Starks in May, saying he violated department policy. Fox upheld the commission’s ruling that Starks violated policy requiring officers to move out of an oncoming vehicle’s path if possible rather than fire. But the judge said a 30-day suspension and reduction in salary to an entry-level officer are more appropriate sanctions.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCorona: A Southern California quarantine zone has been expanded in an effort to stop the spread of a disease that threatens the state’s multibillion-dollar citrus industry. The addition of 107 square miles encompassing the cities of Corona and Norco and part of Chino followed the discovery of a dozen trees with citrus greening disease in Corona, The Press-Enterprise reports. The quarantine zone now covers 1,127 square miles in parts of Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Orange counties. The quarantine forbids movement of fruit, citrus plants or foliage, but the fruit can be consumed on properties where it was grown. Citrus greening disease is also known as Huanglongbing or HLB. It is spread by a tiny, aphid-like bug called the Asian citrus psyllid. Infected trees develop mottled leaves, produce deformed fruit and eventually die.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two affiliated organizations with ties to hospitals and insurance companies have launched a six-figure public relations ad blitz against the creation of a “public” health insurance option in the state. The campaign began in December and comes ahead of the 2020 legislative session, which begins next week and is expected to feature an intense battle over how and whether to create the public option, the Colorado Sun reports. The so-called public option, as proposed by Gov. Jared Polis’ administration, would actually be run by private insurance companies that would offer plans with government oversight. The plans would be available at first only to people who buy coverage on their own, without help from an employer. But Polis administration officials have said they hope to expand the public option to small employers within a couple of years.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s Department of Consumer Protection is urging consumers to do their homework before signing a contract with a gym or health club. Commissioner Michelle Seagull says better health is often a New Year’s resolution, and there tends to be a spike in new gym and health club memberships in January. “But sometimes the excitement of working out wears off after a few months, and consumers are stuck in health club contracts that they just don’t use,” she says. “That’s why we’re encouraging consumers to do their homework and to be smart before making a commitment.” Connecticut law requires health clubs to have contracts in writing. The consumer protection department urges consumers to read them closely and know how much they will pay, when the bill will come in and what the cancellation policy will be. The department also recommends reading online reviews, talking to current customers and visiting the club in person.\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: The 2020 Hummers Parade went off without a hitch Wednesday following last year’s controversy, though parade watchers said it was not as good as past years and had far fewer marchers. Accompanying this year’s parade was a group of more than 50 protesters holding signs decrying racism. Hundreds more lined the streets to watch the annual parade that drew national scrutiny last year for a float depicting kids in cages that many deemed offensive. The loosely organized parade is a spoof of the Mummers Parade in Philadelphia, and floats often satire top news stories of the past year. The parade was led by unofficial Grand Marshal Jack Schreppler, who held an original American flag with 13 stars. About a dozen and a half small groups and a few lone individuals paraded through downtown Middletown on New Year’s Day. The most popular topic depicted this year was the Delabear from earlier this winter.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An apparently intoxicated man fell onto the tracks of a Metro station, causing some of the first delays of the new year, according to authorities. The man fell early Wednesday morning and was taken to a hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening, news outlets report. The fall is being investigated as an accident, according to a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority statement that says the man appeared to be “under the influence.” The man’s identity wasn’t immediately released.\n\nFlorida\n\nDeland: Fifteen cars were shot at while driving along Interstate 4 and Interstate 95 in Central Florida, authorities said Thursday. No injuries were reported, and the damage from the Wednesday shootings appears to have been caused by a BB or pellet gun, according a statement by the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office. The vehicles hit in the shootings were near Deltona, DeLand and Daytona Beach, according to a statement from the sheriff’s office. Witness accounts of the suspect vehicle vary. An investigation was ongoing.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The state’s waters are closing to shrimp fishing Jan. 15, but whelk season opens the next day. The annual shrimp fishery closure aims to allow shrimp to reproduce in large enough amounts and grow to large enough size to hopefully provide for a good shrimp harvest in the coming year, The News reports. The shrimp fishery tends to reopen in late May or early June, depending on conditions at the time. Meanwhile, the state’s whelk season is to open at 7 a.m. Jan. 16 and run through 8:15 p.m. March 31. Regulatory requirements for whelk trawls include the use of minimum 4-inch stretch mesh trawl gear and a certified turtle excluder device. Fishermen also need a state commercial fishing license with a whelk endorsement.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Telcom painted over an unauthorized mural on one of its buildings by renowned marine artist Robert Wyland. The artist acknowledged he did not have permission to spray-paint the Maui building, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The life-size image stretching 65 feet depicted a female humpback whale. Wyland said he apologized and hoped Hawaiian Telcom would not paint over the mural he created during work over two days. “I apologize for not running it up the food chain,” he said Monday. “I’m so passionate. I swear to God I don’t think about those things. I kind of painted it and look for forgiveness later.” Hawaiian Telcom never received a direct apology from Wyland, the company said.\n\nIdaho\n\nCarey: State land management officials have secured a conservation land use easement on the Cenarrusa Ranch ensuring the land in that area is not developed. The Bureau of Land Management and The Nature Conservancy in Idaho finalized the easement in the Pioneer Mountain foothills near Carey after years of discussion, The Times-News reports. The easement ensures protection of about 13 square miles of land including sage grouse habitat and migration corridors for wildlife, officials said. One of the longest pronghorn migrations in the west, a 160-mile journey crosses the ranch and includes grouse breeding grounds, land officials said. The easement is also expected to bring new recreation opportunities including more than 3 miles of access routes, officials said. “It’s the kind of place that makes Idaho Idaho,” Nature Conservancy Conservation Manager Tess O’Sullivan said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city seems to have closed out 2019 with a drop in the number of homicides for the third consecutive year, police say. Preliminary numbers Tuesday showed there had been 490 homicides in 2019, making it the first time the yearly number has dipped below 500 since 2015, when it was 491. The number of homicides in 2019 dropped 13% compared to 2018, when there were 565 homicides, according to police statistics. The declines happened across the city, including in historically high-crime areas. Police have credited the city’s dip in crime to the use of technology used to predict where shootings might occur, while experts also credited anti-violence programs that offer jobs and gang conflict mediation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city is a bombed-out disaster area in an upcoming G.I. Joe comic book. Being depicted as a war zone is less than flattering, but writer Paul Allor isn’t picking on the city. He lives here, and the story presents Indianapolis as putting up a fight against the bad guys of Cobra – long-running nemesis of the G.I. Joe team. Unfortunately, Cobra rules the world in Allor’s story. The organization has no problem making a cautionary example of Indianapolis. “Cobra essentially wipes the city off the map,” Allor said. What’s left? Downtown’s Soldiers and Sailors Monument, at least, is seen on the cover of “G.I. Joe” No. 5, scheduled to arrive in stores Jan. 8. And a survivalist biker gang, the Dreadnoks, is hanging out at the Indianapolis Art Center. Broad Ripple resident Allor also incorporates a reference to Guilford Avenue’s multicolored “rainbow” bridge.\n\nIowa\n\nFruitland: A service club intends to build a memorial for veterans in this Muscatine County community. The Fruitland Community Lions Club wants to place it near Fruitland Community Center instead of at a cemetery. A club committee decided the location near the center would allow more people to see it and would deter vandals, the Muscatine Journal reports. The committee worked with Louisa-Muscatine High School art students to devise a manageable and affordable design. It will have black granite walls with seating, a flag and lighting. Each veteran will have two lines on the wall, enough room to list names and service information, for $100. The memorial can fit 400 names. “We don’t want to leave someone off just because there’s no room. We’ll find room – we’ll buy more granite if we have to,” says Janina Hawley, the committee chairwoman.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The state has been able to reduce its carbon-dioxide emissions for a 10th straight year largely due to the rapid adoption of wind energy and a slow move away from coal-powered electricity. About 36% of all electricity produced in Kansas is from wind, the highest percentage of any U.S. state, the Kansas News Service reports. In 2019 alone, Kansas saw four new wind farms, adding enough capacity to power 190,000 homes for a year. In 2017, about half of Kansas’ total carbon-dioxide emissions came from burning fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, to create electricity. Plant upgrades and federal environmental regulations since have forced coal plants to clean up what was coming out of their smoke stacks. Carbon-dioxide emissions contribute to global warming.\n\nKentucky\n\nAshland: The city is hosting a dedication ceremony for several new statues, including two of Roman deities. Ashland’s Friday festivities will include a lighting ceremony, catered food, live music and a presentation by the artist, Gines Serran-Pagan, The Independent reports. The bronzed clay and fiberglass statues of Venus, Vulcan and the concept of Genesis were commissioned by an anonymous donor who hoped to memorialize three distinct parts of their hometown, according to the newspaper. “I am so grateful that Serran-Pagan’s magnificent statues will be part of Ashland’s riverfront landscape,” city manager Mike Graese said. “The generosity of the donor is, in my opinion, reflective of Ashland’s giving spirit. Mayor Steve Gilmore said he’s confident the statues will draw tourists from all over.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities announced Thursday that a man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of three homeless people. Jeremy Anderson, 29, was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul told news outlets at a press conference. Paul said evidence found inside Anderson’s home helped link him to the murders. The first two killings happened Dec. 13 when Christina Fowler, 53, and Gregory Corcoran, 40, were found fatally shot underneath an overpass, huddled in blankets beside an empty shopping cart. On Dec. 27, investigators discovered 50-year-old Tony Williams shot to death on the porch of a vacant home about two blocks away from where Fowler and Corcoran were found. Paul said Anderson lives two blocks away from where both shootings occurred.\n\nMaine\n\nFreeport: Coastal Maine has a lot of seaweed and a fair number of cows. A group of scientists and farmers think that pairing the two could help unlock a way to cope with a warming world. The researchers – from a marine science lab, an agriculture center and universities in northern New England – are working on a plan to feed seaweed to cows to gauge whether that can help reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. About a quarter of the methane in the country comes from cattle, which produce the gas when they belch or flatulate. The concept of feeding seaweed to cows has gained traction in recent years because of some studies that have shown its potential to cut back on methane. One of the big questions is which kinds of seaweed offer the highest benefit to farmers looking to cut methane, says Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine, and the project’s leader.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The governor has indicated he’ll continue to allow refugees into the state. The Capital Gazette reports Gov. Larry Hogan’s office released a letter Wednesday that was sent to the Trump administration. The letter said the state would continue to accept properly vetted refugees. The White House had set a Jan. 21 deadline for states and cities to decide whether they would continue to allow refugees to settle within their jurisdictions. “We are willing to accept refugees who the federal government has determined are properly and legally seeking refugee status and have been adequately vetted,” Hogan wrote in his letter. “This, as you know, is different from any kind of ‘sanctuary status’ for those in the United States unlawfully.” Maryland has accepted nearly 10,000 refugees under Hogan’s leadership since 2016. But the Republican was among 31 governors who wanted to refuse Syrian refugees in 2015 out of fear of terrorism.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is extending its electric vehicle rebate program. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito announced the rebates were being extended Wednesday to last through at least Dec. 31, 2021, and the administration will make at least $27 million available per year in 2020 and 2021. The program was phased out from Sept. 30 through Tuesday because a rapid growth in applications caused a lack of funding, Baker and Polito said, but the funding plan they proposed for an extension was largely adopted in a recent supplemental budget. Since 2014, the state has allocated more than $31 million for the effort, to incentivize the purchase of more than 15,000 electric vehicles and reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 39,000 metric tons annually, Baker and Polito said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDelta Township: The community has solved an olfactory mystery that could be dubbed “The Case of the Rancid Radishes.” Residents called officials in Delta Township last month, concerned about a smell they thought might be natural gas or sewer leaks. Township Manager Brian Reed and his staff got to the, well, root of the problem: rotting radishes in nearby farm fields. To be more precise, it was the unseemly smell of decomposing daikon radishes, a Japanese root vegetable. They had been planted in fields in the township and surrounding areas as a cover crop after a wet spring. The radish variety is among those recommended by natural resources officials to plant during such periods – not to harvest but to decompose in a bid to nourish the soil, aerate it and prevent erosion. Decompose they did, and when temperatures rose in December the scent permeated the air. The stench should subside with consistently colder weather.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State Attorney General Keith Ellison on Thursday called for the Minnesota Board of Public Defense to examine the process that led to the suspension of Hennepin County’s chief public defender, saying he believes Mary Moriarty was targeted for speaking out against racial bias in the criminal justice system. Separately, law clerks and lawyers in Moriarty’s office wrote to the board in her defense, praising her leadership and commitment to clients and calling for her reinstatement. And dozens of public defenders and public interest attorneys outside Minnesota signed onto a letter objecting to her suspension. Moriarty, appointed in 2014, was put on paid leave last week. She said officials expressed concerns about her management style, what they called inflexibility with other criminal justice officials and confrontations on the issue of racial inequality. They also questioned a series of tweets about historic lynchings in the Deep South, she said.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The Hattiesburg Cultural Center hosted a jazz brunch Wednesday in honor of Jeanette Smith, a prominent leader in the city’s civil rights movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s, WDAM-TV reports. She was 78 years old when she died in Atlanta in 2018. Her late husband, Dr. C.E. Smith, also was instrumental in Hattiesburg’s civil rights movement. Both of them served as the president of the Forrest County NAACP, which they joined in 1959. The center plans on hosting the brunch again next year to honor those who have made a difference for the civil rights organization, according to the station.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state’s levees need to be strengthened and repaired, especially in rural areas hit hard by prolonged flooding in 2019, according to an advisory group appointed by Gov. Mike Parson. St. Louis Public Radio reports the Flood Recovery Advisory Working Group on Tuesday released its report on ways to address flooding in the state and improve flood recovery. Parson signed an executive order in July creating the 24-member advisory group. Record flooding early last year and in the summer overtopped and breached dozens of levees along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Some parts of western Missouri experienced flooding for up to seven months. Rebuilding in flood-prone areas has led to repeated damage, said Dru Buntin, deputy director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Wildlife officials have opened the permit lottery for non-motorized watercraft on the Smith River in central Montana. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks annually awards floating permits to groups of up to 15 people to access a 59-mile section of the Smith River east of Helena. Applications must be submitted by Feb. 13 with a $10 non-refundable fee. The permit drawing is scheduled for March 2, officials said. The state regulates the river to combat overcrowding and allow users to take quality, multiday floats, park officials said. About 10,070 people applied for private floating permits last year, and about 1,300 were awarded, officials said. People can also buy a chance to win a super permit for $5 until March 12, officials said. That permit allows floaters to pick any day they want to take the river trip, park officials said. The entire float trip usually takes about four days and begins near White Sulphur Springs, officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nBrownville: Federal inspectors plan to review how well a nuclear power plant handled a water service safety problem blamed on a silt buildup from the Missouri River, which overwhelmed or broke through levees last spring. The Cooper Nuclear Station near Brownville was operating on full power Dec. 6 when employees detected that water wasn’t flowing through a pipe connected to one of the plant’s two safety generators, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in a news release Thursday. The generators weren’t running because they are designed to kick in and provide power for the plant’s cooling systems only when all five lines that power the plant are knocked out. If needed, the other generator was available, the NRC said. The plant generated power throughout the problem.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state Supreme Court has ruled that workers’ compensation rates for injured inmates are set at inmate pay rates instead of the minimum wage. Inmate Darrell White was assigned to the Forestry Division when he suffered a finger injury that left him temporarily disabled for 144 days in 2016, the Nevada Appeal reports. White filed for workers’ compensation disability benefits at the minimum wage set in the state Constitution after his release, but an appeals officer ruled that state law sets the amount of compensation at the average monthly wage the prisoner actually received when the injury occurred, officials said. White argued his compensation should be set at the constitutionally guaranteed $7.25 an hour. Court officials argued compensation should be about 50 cents a day, or $22.93 each month, based on what he was actually being paid.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: The City Hall clock tower, which officials say has lost its sheen and is sorely in need of a significant cosmetic overhaul, will be getting a full facelift ahead of the city’s 400th birthday celebration in 2023. City Manager Mike Joyal says the 80-foot tower needs a lot of work to get it in show-worthy condition for the city’s big birthday bash, the bulk of which will be celebrated during a 10-day schedule ahead of July 4, 2023. The historic bell atop the tower was rung July 4, 1976, to celebrate the nation’s bicentennial, according to city records. After that, Joyal says, as far as he has been able to determine, the last time the bell was rung was Sept. 11, 2001. The significance of the bell to Dover’s history makes it a must for ringing on the city’s 400th birthday, according to Mayor-elect Robert Carrier.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHowell: A man who set off fireworks near a movie theater as his friend made a marriage proposal created panic among moviegoers who mistook the fireworks for gunshots, leading to 911 calls and an evacuation, authorities said. Howell Township police responded to the Xscape Theater about 6 p.m. Wednesday and soon learned the theater manager had confronted a man who had lighted fireworks outside another business near the theater, authorities said. The remnants of the fireworks were located, and it was determined that no shots had been fired. A 23-year-old Lakewood man told police he had set off the fireworks as part of his friend’s marriage proposal at the other business. While noting there was no intent to cause panic at the theater, a post on the Howell police Facebook page stated that “obviously this was a very poor decision rather than an overt act.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A newly forged steel instrument that can pinpoint the path of stars and planets across the night sky using the naked eye is a throwback to the years just before the advent of telescopes, returning stargazers in the hills of northern New Mexico to the essentials of astronomy in the past. Installed at St. John’s College by graduates, the device is a remake of long-lost originals devised by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century to chart the location of stars and the orbits of planets. It consists of four interlocking rings – forged of precision steel and aligned with the north star and equator – combined with a sliding viewfinder that is moved by hand to measure angles between the any celestial object, the horizon and the equator. Lengthy, painstaking measurements from such an instrument in the late-1500s allowed Johannes Kepler to show that Mars revolved in an elliptical orbit around the sun.\n\nNew York\n\nVictor: The top Republican in the State Assembly was charged New Year’s Eve with driving while intoxicated in his state-issued vehicle, just a week after he wrote a newspaper column warning citizens against getting behind the wheel drunk. Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from Canandaigua who represents a district just outside Rochester, was arrested near his home after what he called a “lapse in judgement.” Authorities said they were called to a crash in Victor just before 10:30 p.m. after a vehicle ran into a ditch. Kolb was found to be the driver of the 2018 GMC Acadia that crashed in front of his home. An Ontario County sheriff’s deputy administered field sobriety tests, which Kolb failed, before taking him to jail. While there, authorities said a breath test indicated Kolb’s blood-alcohol content was over 0.08%, the legal limit for driving in New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state says it has secured an agreement with Duke Energy to excavate nearly 80 million tons of coal ash at six facilities. The Department of Environmental Quality said in a Thursday press release that it will be the largest coal ash cleanup in the nation’s history. It also settles various legal disputes between Duke and parties that include environmental and community groups. For decades, coal ash has been stored in landfills or in ponds, often near waterways into which toxins can leach. Duke Energy will remove coal ash from the Allen, Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro sites into on-site lined landfills. “This agreement is a historic cleanup of coal ash pollution in North Carolina,” said Frank Holleman, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: Authorities say an ice jam along the Missouri River near Mandan is causing water to rise, threatening property along the shoreline. Morton County officials say water in the Square Butte Creek area along Willow Road and Rosy Lane has risen approximately 18 inches since Tuesday. Commission Chairman Bruce Strinden toured the area Sunday afternoon. He says residents may want to move items from low areas. Authorities say they are working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to hold back on increased releases at Garrison Dam until the ice jam issue has been resolved. The Corps had increased discharges from the dam earlier in the week and planned another increase Thursday.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A ban on single-use plastic bags took effect Wednesday in Cuyahoga County, though the ban won’t be enforced with fines until July 1. Despite the long roll-out, most Giant Eagle grocery stores in the county eliminated the bags beginning New Year’s Day, Fox 8-TV reports. The company will have reusable bags for purchase, and customers will receive fuel perks for every reusable bag used. A few suburbs opted out of the ban, and Cleveland also opted out until July 1 to give a working group time to study the impact of reducing plastic bags on businesses. Some state lawmakers and business groups say such local bans make it harder for grocers and other businesses to operate, and proposed bills would prohibit local governments from forbidding the use of plastic bags. But Gov. Mike DeWine opposes those efforts, saying it would be a mistake for state lawmakers to override local government decisions.\n\nOklahoma\n\nSand Springs: A man stole a pickup truck with a sleeping passenger and a goat inside it and drove it all the way from Missouri to Oklahoma before releasing the terrified victim and animal and eventually being arrested, authorities say. According to an arrest report, two men in the truck parked outside an adult video store in Carthage, Missouri, early Wednesday morning. The driver went inside the store, and the passenger fell asleep. When the passenger awoke, a masked man was driving the truck and pointing a gun at his head, Tulsa TV station KOTV reports. The carjacking suspect, 40-year-old Brandon Kirby, drove from Missouri through Kansas. During the 130-mile ordeal, Kirby took methamphetamine, pistol-whipped the victim and continually threatened him, according to the arrest report. The Sand Springs Police Department said on Facebook: “OK 2020, it only took you 4.5 hours to get weird. Let’s slow down on the carjacking-goatnapping calls for the remainder of the year.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The number of nonaffiliated voters in the state has increased by nearly 60,000 since the beginning of this year, according to the Oregon Secretary of State’s office. As of last month, there were 951,908 nonaffiliated voters in Oregon – an increase of almost 7% since January 2019. The increase of nonaffiliated voters is largely due to the state’s “motor voter” law, passed in 2016, which automatically registers eligible Oregonians as nonaffiliated voters when they register with the Oregon DMV. “There are at least 300,000 new registrants since 2016 because of OMV (the Oregon Motor Voter Act),” says Paul Gronke, a political science professor at Reed College and political director of DHM Research. “And 80% or more of these did not respond to a postcard allowing them to affiliate.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The butter sculpture for this year’s Pennsylvania Farm Show was unveiled Thursday, featuring three of the state’s professional sports team mascots. This year’s sculpture, crafted from about 1,000 pounds of donated butter, shows Gritty, Swoop and Steely McBeam, mascots for the Philadelphia Flyers and Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Farm Show in Harrisburg, which calls itself the country’s largest indoor agricultural event, includes 12,000 competitive exhibits and draws about 500,000 attendees every year. It runs from Saturday through Jan. 11. Admission is free, but parking in Farm Show Complex lots is not. After the show ends, the butter sculpture will be taken to a farm in Juniata County to be converted into energy through a methane digester. New to the show this year are hard cider sales, an expanded rabbit competition and a waterfowl habitat with live ducks in the poultry area. There also will be a demonstration by people with bows riding horses.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s residents must now have health insurance or face a penalty on their taxes. The taxation division released a list of tax changes taking effect Wednesday, including the new health insurance mandate. Residents who do not have minimum essential coverage in 2020 and do not qualify for an exemption will face a penalty next year when filing a state tax return for 2020. A federal appeals court ruling this month in New Orleans struck down the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that people have health insurance, leaving President Barack Obama’s signature health care law in legal limbo. Rhode Island’s General Assembly passed legislation that was signed by the governor to enact the requirement and penalty in the state, with an effective date of Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state’s Department of Natural Resources is calling for citizens to recycle used oyster shells and discarded Christmas trees through programs aimed at boosting estuary health and promoting growth of marine life. The state is continuing to expand its oyster recycling and restoration program, where South Carolinians and restaurants can drop off used oyster shells, especially after events such as oyster bakes and holiday parties, The Post and Courier reports. The recycled shells are reintroduced to local waters, where they provide a surface for new oysters to grow, natural resources officials say. Live oysters then filter water, protect against erosion, and attract fish and other sea creatures to their reefs. The state’s Coastal Conservation Association and Natural Resources Department collectively donated more than $100,000 in equipment to pick up and transport the shells, the newspaper reports.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: South Dakota’s minimum wage is increasing slightly with the the start of the new year. The state’s minimum wage is now $9.30 per hour – an increase of 20 cents from 2019. Workers who receive tips are seeing their minimum wage rise to $4.65 per hour. The increases are part of a voter-approved measure in 2014 to raise the minimum wage, which was $7.25 an hour at the time, to $8.50 an hour. KELO-TV reports the minimum wage will continue to increase at the rate of the cost of living measured in the consumer price index. The state’s minimum wage was below $4 until 1992. The $7.25 minimum wage was set in 2010.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Elvis Presley’s Graceland is planning an auction of artifacts to be held during the late entertainer’s 85th birthday celebration Jan. 8. All the items up for auction Wednesday come from third-party collectors but have been thoroughly researched and certified by Graceland Authenticated, according to a news release from Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc. The mansion and all artifacts in the Graceland Archives continue to be owned by Lisa Marie Presley and are not for sale. The 288 artifacts include a golf cart, clothing, jewelry, autographs, concert memorabilia and Hollywood items. In addition, several Graceland experiences will be auctioned, with the proceeds benefiting the Elvis Presley Charitable Foundation. Items to be included in the auction were announced Monday along with registration information. The catalog is available at Graceland’s official online store.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge on Thursday sided with a hospital that plans to remove an 11-month-old girl from life support after her mother disagreed with the decision by doctors who say that the infant is in pain and that her condition will never improve. Trinity Lewis had asked Judge Sandee Bryan Marion to issue an injunction in Tarrant County district court to ensure that Cook Children’s Medical Center doesn’t end her daughter Tinslee Lewis’ life-sustaining treatment. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that opposes the “10-day rule” and has been advocating for Tinslee, said the girl’s mother will appeal the judge’s decision. Doctors at the Fort Worth hospital had planned to remove Tinslee from life support Nov. 10 after invoking Texas’ “10-day rule,” which can be employed when a family disagrees with doctors who say life-sustaining treatment should be stopped.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Operators of a copper mine have announced plans to extend operations by using an experimental method of extraction they say is safe despite concerns about potential groundwater contamination. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that officials with the Lisbon Valley Mine are seeking permits for an acid-based extraction method that involves pumping diluted sulfuric acid underground in San Juan County northeast of Monticello. The new process could extend the mine’s lifespan for at least another 25 years, officials said. Environmentalists have raised concerns about long-term water contamination for nearby residents reliant on groundwater for drinking and livestock. The Lisbon Valley Mining Company has managed the mine since 2008 when its former owner declared bankruptcy three years after opening, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The Vermont attorney general’s office sued the state’s largest dairy operation Thursday, alleging the farm built a 90,000-square-foot barn addition and a 10 million-gallon manure pit without the required permissions. Attorney General T.J. Donovan said the expansion of the Lumbra Farm in Berkshire between 2016 and 2017 qualified as a large farm operation under state regulations, but it was done without the required permits and planning input from the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets and state environmental officials. Donovan did not allege that the additions to the farm contributed to the water pollution woes that have plagued the state, but because the expansions were done without the needed permits, there was no way to determine if water qualify was affected. Vermont has been struggling for years to improve water quality in Lake Champlain. Agricultural pollution is considered one of the largest sources of that pollution.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state has executed nearly 1,400 people in its 412-year history – more than any other in the nation. But as a new Democratic majority prepares to begin the legislative session, some see an opportunity to end executions in Virginia. A bill to abolish the death penalty has been filed by Del. Lee Carter, a Democrat from Manassas, and several additional bills are expected. The push is backed by Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, along with some powerful voices: loved ones of murder victims. Thirteen family members sent a letter to the General Assembly in November asking lawmakers to abolish the death penalty. No death sentences have been imposed in the state since 2011, and only three people remain on Virginia’s death row. Since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the state is second only to Texas in number of executions, at 113.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The state’s snowpack is less than a year ago, and officials say it’s similar to the start of 2015, the state’s last big drought. The Capital Press reports the statewide snowpack is 47% of normal. It was 46% of normal at this time five years ago. “It’s very reminiscent of 2015, but this year we are way behind on mountain precipitation,” says Scott Pattee, state water supply specialist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Mount Vernon. “It’s worrisome. It’s the third-slowest start in snow accumulation statewide since the 1990s, and we had one of the driest Novembers on record.” The biggest concern is that the five mountain reservoirs serving the Yakima Basin are significantly behind in recharging, and 130% to 135% of normal snowfall is now needed in the Upper Yakima to get it back to normal by April 1, Pattee says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Thursday tapped the director of a General Motors dealership to lead the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles. Everett Frazier, who has worked in the auto industry for more than three decades, will start as DMV commissioner Monday, according to a news release from the Republican governor. “My goal is to treat everyone who comes through the door of the DMV as a guest,” Frazier said. “I am looking forward to being part of a team that will maximize the use of technology to make the DMV more efficient and customer-friendly.” Justice said Frazier’s experience in the auto business includes 25 years of managerial positions, most recently as the director of operations at the Thornhill GM Superstore in Logan County. Frazier has also resigned as a member on the state’s pharmacy board to assume the new DMV role.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative law firm on Thursday asked a judge to find the Wisconsin Elections Commission in contempt and impose $12,000 a day in fines until it immediately purges more than 200,000 voters from the rolls, a move Democrats are fighting in the key battleground state. A judge last month ordered the purge of voters who may have moved and didn’t respond within 30 days to notification sent by the elections commission in October. The bipartisan commission has deadlocked twice on attempts by Republicans to do the purge immediately while an appeal to the court order is pending. Rick Esenberg, leader of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty that brought the lawsuit, said the commission must purge the voters now. The judge in December ruled that the commission was breaking state law by not removing voters who did not respond to the October mailing asking that they confirm their address.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s population increased slightly in the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019 after three years of decline. Census figures released this week show Wyoming’s population grew by 1,158 between July 2018 and July 2019. The state’s total population of 578,880 remained below a peak of 586,000 in 2015. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the latest numbers were recorded before a coal company’s bankruptcy in 2019 furloughed hundreds of workers at two major coal mines for four months. Hard times in the coal, oil and natural gas industries caused many people to leave Wyoming starting in 2015. State economist Wenlin Liu says growth in the energy and construction industries accounted for Wyoming’s recent population increase. Liu says Wyoming’s that recovery now shows signs of slowing, with recent lower job growth and rising unemployment. Wyoming remains the least-populated state in the U.S.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/19/utility-bill-santa-return-ceres-zion-path-secured-news-around-states/40852997/", "title": "Utility bill Santa, return of Ceres: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The City Council has voted unanimously to repeal a controversial ordinance that required jail time for panhandlers. The ordinance passed in July required a mandatory two days in jail for panhandling but wasn’t being enforced because former Mayor Todd Strange never signed off on the city law. Mayor Steven Reed pushed the repeal through to the council Tuesday, according to a news release from the Southern Poverty Law Center. In November, the Montgomery City Council voted against an amendment that also would have criminalized giving to panhandlers after dozens of people showed up to a meeting protesting the move. SPLC attorney Micah West says repealing the ordinance doesn’t address state laws the city has been using to criminalize begging and soliciting for years. He says the city has issued more than 400 citations for begging or soliciting in the past year and a half.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: An Alaska Native advocacy group is seeking land and the establishment of Native corporations for communities that were omitted from a federal settlement, officials say. Alaska Natives Without Land wants a change to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act on behalf of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee Springs and Wrangell, The Juneau Empire reports. Some tribal communities were excluded when the act passed in December 1971, leading to the creation of Alaska Native regional, urban and village corporations. The act also transferred 68,750 square miles of land to those corporations, officials say. A change to the federal act would require a vote in Congress. Alaska Natives Without Land held an event Peratrovich Hall in Juneau last Saturday to build support and share information about the issue, says Todd Antioquia, the group’s campaign and volunteer coordinator.\n\nArizona\n\nPage: A popular tourist attraction that sometimes requires tourists to wait while professional photographers get the perfect shot is ending its photography-only tours. At the Upper Antelope Canyon, shafts of sunlight descend from the heavens, lighting the towering, multihued walls that flow on either side like molten waves. But the traffic jams from the popular photography-only tours of the slot canyon on the Navajo Reservation near Page are being discontinued Friday. Visitors can still take photos with phones or other cameras on regular tours, but no tripods will be allowed. The canyon’s narrow walls lend themselves to dramatic lighting. Guides often helped visitors get those postcard-perfect shots that made it appear as if the canyon were devoid of visitors. Guides with Antelope Canyon Tours were known to throw sand in the air, filling the shafts of light for a more dazzling effect.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Agriculture Department says it has hired a Game and Fish biologist to coordinate efforts to eradicate feral hogs. The department announced Monday that it had hired J.P. Fairhead as its first feral hog eradication program coordinator, a newly created position that’s part of a $3.4 million federal grant awarded to the department. Fairhead has been employed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission since 2008 as a natural resource program technician and field biologist. He’s also served as its feral hog eradication program coordinator since February 2013. Arkansas was one of 10 states to receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program. The department says feral hogs are estimated to cause nearly $1.5 billion in damage nationwide annually and approximately $19 million in the Natural State.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCitrus Heights: The home of a man suspected of being the notorious Golden State Killer was sold last month to a couple who intend to live there. Joseph DeAngelo’s 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath ranch home in Citrus Heights was sold for $320,000, a price near the bottom of the market for three-bedroom homes in that area, the Sacramento Bee reports. DeAngelo, a former police officer, is awaiting trial on charges that he broke into dozens of homes across California in the 1970s and 1980s, raping and often killing. Police linked DeAngelo to the killings through a DNA database. DeAngelo, 74, lived in the house for several decades and worked as a night mechanic in a Roseville supermarket distribution center. After his arrest, the house was treated as a crime scene by investigators searching for clues.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: People who traveled through Denver International Airport last Wednesday afternoon may have been exposed to measles, Colorado health officials say. Three children who were in the airport that day tested positive for the highly contagious disease after traveling to a country where there was an outbreak, officials say. Health officials don’t consider this an outbreak because the children are related, the Tri-County Health Department said in a statement. But they are warning people who were in the airport between 1:15 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Dec. 11 that they may have been exposed. It’s unclear how many people came in contact with the children. About 179,000 people passed through the airport that day, spokeswoman Emily Williams told The Denver Post.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: The planned permanent memorial to honor the 26 people killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting will be simpler but maintain the essence of the original design, members of the memorial committee said. “The heart of the memorial is still the sycamore tree with the water around it and the names of the victims inscribed on the side of the water,” Dan Krauss, the volunteer chairman of the Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial Commission, told the Connecticut Post. “You still have the engagement with the water and the peacefulness and reflection of walking along side of the ponds.” Changes include eliminating the planned pavilion, narrowing paths and limiting paved surfaces at the donated 5-acre site. The alterations will drop the estimated project budget from $10 million to $3.7 million. The dedication date has also been pushed back two years to December 2021.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Families living in homes on Dover Air Force Base say they have been experiencing ongoing problems with mold and leaks. Some families even speculate that ongoing illnesses are caused by conditions at their Eagle Heights Family Housing homes, managed by Hunt Military Communities. The issues come as lawmakers have begun applying pressure on military officials about persistent problems with privatized family housing at military sites. Hunt Military Communities did not respond to messages seeking comment, but at an October town hall, company representatives told Dover residents they had discovered issues with many of the home’s window weep holes, which are openings on windows designed to drain precipitation that collects in window tracks. The windows have not been replaced, according to residents interviewed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In a few weeks, the D.C. Council is poised to vote on marijuana legislation that is currently in effect for schools on a temporary basis. But a sixth grader from Northwest is lobbying for more permanent legislation from the council because it could very well save her life, WUSA-TV reports. The Student Medical Marijuana Patient Fairness Temporary Amendment Act was passed in September but will go to a full council vote Jan. 7. Zoey Carty has a rare form of epilepsy, and her mother says after six months of using CBD oil three times a day, as well as having an emergency syringe with THC, Zoey’s seizures decreased by 50%. Dawn Lee-Carty and Zoey now grow their own medical marijuana, but Zoey’s school will only allow mairjuana from an authorized dispensary.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who once spent a Christmas without electricity has paid the power bills for 36 families with past-due accounts. Mike Esmond says he will never forget the Christmas he and his three daughters spent in 1983 without heat and power because he couldn’t pay his bill. He says it was one of the coldest days on record in Pensacola at only 9 degrees and remembers icicles hanging off the window. The 73-year-old small-business owner says he doesn’t want any other families to spend the holidays shivering. He went to the city of Gulf Breeze this month and requested a list of all utility accounts at risk of having their gas and water turned off. Then he paid off all 36 of them, totaling about $4,600. Angela Cascio says she was stunned by the stranger’s kindness. The mother of four was struggling to choose between paying bills or buying presents for her kids. She posted on Facebook that “angels absolutely walk among us.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The first newborn right whale of the winter calving season has been spotted off the coast of Georgia. The critically endangered whales migrate each winter to warmer waters of the southeastern U.S. coast to give birth. Scientists estimate just over 400 North Atlantic right whales remain, making each newborn calf crucial to avoiding extinction. An aerial survey team spotted the first mother-and-calf pair of the 2019-2020 season Monday in waters off Sapelo Island, about 50 miles south of Savannah, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources said in a news release. Researchers have become increasingly worried about right whales’ prospects for survival as deaths in recent years have outpaced births. Seven right whales calves were recorded last winter during daily survey flights offshore of Georgia and Florida.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Police are reviewing body camera footage after fatally shooting a second man in less than 24 hours, amid an apparent uptick in crime in the city. Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard says she is concerned about a 20% increase in the number of violent crimes involving firearms. On Monday, police shot and killed a man who rammed a vehicle at officers, fled and fired at police. On Tuesday morning, an officer shot and killed a 27-year-old man with a stolen moped who lunged at him with a knife. The uptick in Honolulu crime includes the shooting death of a 71-year-old woman over the weekend. But Ballard says murders and rapes have decreased since last year. There have been some increases in aggravated assaults and robberies, according to police statistics. Gun violence is generally rare in Hawaii, where there are strict gun laws. “This is Hawaii; we’re not used to this,” Ballard says. “It’s really sad to see. Please stop. This is getting nuts.”\n\nIdaho\n\nMullan: Members of a union representing mine workers have rejected a tentative agreement that could have ended a 2 1/ 2 -year strike. United Steelworkers Local 5114 and Hecla Mining Company announced a tentative agreement in November that required ratification by a majority of union members, The Spokesman-Review reports. A third party counted 157 ballots Monday finding that 80 were against the proposed contract, union officials said. United Steelworkers represent about 200 workers at the Lucky Friday Mine near Mullan, officials said. United Steelworkers must notify Hecla Mining and return to the bargaining table, said Timothy Swallow, a union representative. Members have argued about the ability for lead miners to pick their own work crew, which has been a tradition at the 77-year-old mine, union representatives said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Hunters took more than 75,000 deer during the state’s seven-day firearm hunting season this fall, according to preliminary totals compiled by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. That number represents a 7% drop in the number of deer harvested from 2018, when nearly 81,000 deer were taken. But the second part of this year’s season, Dec. 5-8, saw an uptick over last year. More than 25,000 deer were harvested during the second season, a 14% increase from 2018. That more than made up the difference from the first weekend of firearm deer season last month, which saw a drop of nearly 9,000 deer taken compared with 2018. State wildlife officials say there are other hunting opportunities underway or approaching. Those include archery hunting and hunting with muzzleloaders, late-winter antlerless-only deer hunting and Chronic Wasting Disease hunting in certain counties.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: People illegally driving off-road vehicles in the Hoosier National Forest are leaving behind deep tire grooves that are causing erosion, an official says. Mike Chaveas, forest supervisor, told The Herald-Times that the erosion created by the all-terrain vehicles is more of a problem because the national forest, which spans 204,000 acres in southern Indiana from the Bloomington area to the Ohio River, is a patchwork of land sandwiched between private and other public properties. After soil is compacted by the vehicles, water is less likely to filter down off the surface, further into the ground. That leads to water following the trail, producing an artificial drainage path, which can erode the soil. That generates cuts and the formation of gullies. The muddy water and the sediment it carries ends up in the creeks and streams, which empty into larger bodies of water, including Lake Monroe.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The City Council has disbanded the city’s Citizen Odor Board. The council took the action Monday after concluding the panel was no longer needed after nearly 30 years of recording complaints. It had no enforcement powers. People still will be able to report stenches to the city’s 24/7 odor hotline: (515) 244-0336. If the city gets 10 complaints about the same smell within six hours, it will investigate the source. SuAnn Donovan, the city’s neighborhood inspection zoning administrator, said an administrative law judge would hear appeals from companies found to be significant odor generators. The council also eliminated the Des Moines Music Commission, which hadn’t met for more than seven years. City staffers said in a document given to the council that Des Moines now has a vibrant live music scene that no longer needs a commission’s help.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas plans to close its Confucius Institute in January, in part because federal funding for universities that host the China-linked facilities has been reduced. An email distributed Monday to faculty and staff from University of Kansas interim Provost Carl Lejuez said the school believes strong engagement with China is critical to U.S. higher education, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. “However, a Confucius Institute is not a necessary component for KU to productively engage with China, support collaborative faculty research, and prepare students,” Lejuez wrote. The Confucius Institutes provides education in Chinese language and culture. At one point, China had about 500 Confucius Institutes around the world, but several U.S. universities closed the organizations in response to the criticism about the Chinese Ministry of Education’s possible political influence in academics.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A gold bar worth almost $1,500 was found among donations to one of the Salvation Army’s red kettles. Louisville Area Commander Major Roy Williams told WAVE-TV that the bar was found over the weekend in a kettle at the Kroger in Prospect. It was the fourth straight year that a 1-ounce gold piece has been donated anonymously, he said. Other smaller gold and silver coins also have been found in recent days. The Louisville Area Salvation Army said it is still about $70,000 short of its fundraising goal. The charity hopes to raise $500,000 during its annual Red Kettle Campaign, which runs through Christmas Eve.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s transportation department will boost safety measures at its roadwork sites, the agency’s secretary announced at a ceremony honoring an employee killed on the job this summer. Department of Transportation and Development Secretary Shawn Wilson said Monday that the agency will require a “spotter” on two-person crews to watch traffic. A cone will be placed farther back from a work zone, equipped with an alarm that sounds if hit, to give workers advance warning if a vehicle veers into the area. The agency also said it is buying 70 trailers with flashing arrows to place in work zones, designed to absorb the impact from a crash before it reaches a work crew. In addition, the color of safety vests and uniforms will change from orange to a bright yellow/green mix, and emergency lights on the department’s vehicles will be upgraded to brighter, more visible colors.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunk: A lab has become the first to apply for state certification to test recreational cannabis. Nelson Analytics applied to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for a testing facility certification, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state is taking steps to ensure it has enough licensed labs to test all products prepared in state. The adult-use market does not open until March 2020. Officials say the licensing and regulation of testing labs is essential to guarantee public safety. Testing for pesticides, heavy metals and residual solvents will be delayed until the market is running – likely after a year, according to Maine officials. “It takes time for independent, top-quality labs to establish themselves and develop capacity necessary to support the growing volume of product,” says Erik Gundersen, director of the Maine Office of Marijuana Policy.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city got a needed boost in federal funding to fight crime when the state’s congressional delegation announced a $4.6 million package of grants for public safety initiatives for the region. The city will receive more than $2.9 million, while the rest of the money provided through the U.S. Department of Justice will go to surrounding Baltimore County and other stakeholders. Part of the city’s money is meant to help law enforcement identify and track guns, support children who are crime victims of the opioid crisis, and combat elder abuse. The announcement comes as the city has seen one of its most violent years on record, tallying 327 homicides so far. That’s up from 309 in 2018. Baltimore’s share of grants also will fund efforts at the state’s attorney’s office to address wrongful convictions.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCape Cod: Activists are working to ban commercial sales of single-use plastic water bottles at retail stores across the cape. The nonprofit organization Sustainable Practices successfully convinced most municipalities in the county this year to stop buying single-use plastic bottles and stop selling beverages in single-use plastic containers on town property. The organization said Monday that it now aims to have a petition article at the annual town meeting for every Cape Cod municipality this spring to extend the ban to commercial sales of plastic water bottles in stores, according to the Cape Cod Times. It called the municipal ban a “great first step.” Madhavi Venkatesan, the organization’s executive director, said she’s also hopeful the four municipalities that didn’t adopt the plastic bottle ban this year will do so by spring.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The largest contractor in the city’s demolition program is facing suspension again after it tore down the wrong house – for the second time in just a year. Detroit-based Adamo Group has been awarded more than $58.6 million to perform thousands of federally and city-funded demolitions since 2014. The company also has performed several large-scale, high-profile demolitions, including fulfilling the $5.9 million contract to tear down the former Joe Louis Arena. City officials confirmed Adamo tore down the wrong house, and the company received a violation notice Wednesday morning for the wrongful demolition. The contractor has seven days to appeal. The property was located one block over from the home it was actually contracted to demolish. The company, however, did not notify the city or state until last week.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: John Borger, one of the nation’s preeminent First Amendment lawyers, has died. He was 68. Borger had cancer for 15 years and died Monday night at his home in downtown Minneapolis, said his wife, Judith Yates Borger. Borger represented the Star Tribune and other media organizations for four decades before retiring from the Faegre Baker Daniels law firm in 2017, the Star Tribune reports. Star Tribune senior vice president and general counsel Randy Lebedoff called Borger “a brilliant First Amendment advocate who contributed greatly to our state and country by standing up for freedom of speech when it counted.” He was also the lead attorney representing the estate of “American Sniper” author Chris Kyle, which was sued for defamation by former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: “Do you recognize me,” pleads a sketch of a young black woman believed to be killed by confessed serial killer Samuel Little. Her mouth is drawn into a frown, her dark hair either short or pinned up in a hand-drawn sketch Little provided to law enforcement. Little began confessing to killings last year and has so far admitted to killing at least 93 people across the U.S. between 1970 and 2005. Five of those killings were of women he picked up near Gulfport, according to the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office. Only three have been identified so far. The sheriff’s office shared the sketch and asked for the public’s help in identifying the woman, believed to have been in her early to mid-20s before she disappeared prior to December 1992. The FBI considers Little the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, and he’s recounted his crimes in near-photographic detail, prompting him to create dozens of color portraits of the women he strangled.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The statue of a Roman goddess that prompted a brief controversy returned to the dome of the Missouri State Capitol on Tuesday. The statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, was taken down last year for structural and cosmetic repairs. A 550-ton crane lifted the 10-foot, 1,407-pound bronze statue back to the top of the dome, the Jefferson City News-Tribune reports. Last week, State Rep. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, asked Gov. Mike Parson to stop the state from returning the “false god” to the Capitol dome, citing his and Parson’s Christian faith. Parson did not respond to Moon’s letter, and supporters said the statue, which shows Ceres holding a bundle of grain, represents the importance of agriculture in Missouri. It was originally installed on the dome in 1924.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Billings Chamber of Commerce has started to remove parts of its campaign that was criticized by a local blogger who said campaign language and imagery was tone-deaf and racist. The Billings Gazette reports blogger Alexis Bonogofsky published an article Monday criticizing three billboards reading “Onward Pioneer” and “Conquer New Endeavors.” Officials say the campaign tagline read, “Today is ours for the taking – and tomorrow too.” Officials say the Visit Billings tourism website also promoted similar language. Bonogofsky says the campaign was not culturally sensitive to hundreds of years of genocide, forced assimilation and racism against Native Americans. Department executives say the “Forge Your Own Path” campaign was used for 18 months, and “Onward Pioneers” was one of the multiple aspects of the campaign set to expire in 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Dozens of people who helped respond to flooding in the state this year were honored Tuesday for work saving lives and rescuing stranded neighbors. Gov. Pete Ricketts and first lady Susanne Shore presented awards to individuals and groups that contributed to the effort. Special accolades went to James Wilke, a Columbus farmer who died trying to save a stranded motorist from floodwaters; the Nebraska National Guard; and a group of firefighters and volunteers whose air boat capsized as they worked to rescue a family from their home. Ricketts also honored air boat owners, a search-and-rescue task force and 45 individuals who assisted in various ways. Ricketts called the group “flood heroes” and said they “showed their strength, grit and compassion in countless ways.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Burning Man organization is tired of waiting on a decision that could potentially recover it millions of dollars. Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed a lawsuit in D.C. District Court on Friday after waiting four years to hear whether the U.S. Bureau of Land Management would be required to justify its nearly $3 million in annual charges to Burning Man. “This case is our attempt to break this cycle,” Burning Man spokeswoman Megan Miller said in a statement. The BLM, which oversees public land use, permits Burning Man organizers to hold a weeklong, 80,000-person event each year in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert. The Burning Man organization is seeking “relief from defendants’ ongoing, unlawful and prejudicial conduct towards (Black Rock City LLC) that threatens the viability of the iconic Burning Man event,” the lawsuit said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The overall number of people experiencing homelessness in the state is dropping, though four of its 10 counties saw increases in recent years, according to a report released Wednesday by a nonprofit advocacy group. The New Hampshire Coalition to End Homelessness draws on state and federal data for its annual report. Its comparison of the annual “point in time” counts shows the overall number of people experiencing homelessness decreased by 5% to 1,382 from January 2017 to January 2019, but the numbers went up in Carroll, Cheshire Coos and Hillsborough counties. And while the number of families and veterans experiencing homelessness decreased, the number of homeless students increased by 12% to 3,993.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday signed legislation restoring voting rights to convicts who are out of prison on parole or probation. The measure will restore voting rights to roughly 80,000 convicts. Murphy, a Democrat, cast the measure as part of a progressive agenda aimed at reducing racial disparity in the state’s criminal justice system, which has disproportionately higher rates of incarceration for black residents compared to whites. He also signed a bill aimed at making it easier for people convicted of lower-level crimes to clear their records. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, New Jersey would join 16 other states and the District of Columbia that bar only those convicts who are incarcerated from voting. Most Republicans opposed the bill, saying it lacked common sense since the convicts hadn’t yet paid their “debt to society.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTsaile: The first college established by an American Indian tribe in the United States is now working to create a law school. Formal efforts picked up speed with a recent two-day symposium held at Diné College on the Navajo Nation. Officials talked about everything from the college’s original mission and accreditation to student courses, judicial advocates and what community such an institution would serve. Rex Lee Jim, the director of the college’s Navajo Sovereignty Institute, said that ideally, the law school would specialize in emerging areas of Indian law that are significant to the Navajo Nation economy. Jim organized the symposium and will help set up an advisory committee going forward. Diné College began in 1968 as the first tribe-controlled institution of higher learning in the U.S.\n\nNew York\n\nRomulus: Tours of a rare white deer herd on a wildlife sanctuary at a former Cold War weapons depot are slated to end soon because of financial troubles, but the property owner says he’ll continue protection of the herd and look for ways to resume public access. The board of directors of the nonprofit Seneca White Deer Inc. voted to end tours Dec. 29 at the former Seneca Army Depot in upstate New York’s Finger Lakes region because donations weren’t meeting expenses, says the organization’s president, Dennis Money. Earl Martin, who is redeveloping the former military facility, told the Canandaigua Daily Messenger he’ll continue protection and management of the deer herd that roam 3,000 fenced acres set aside as a wildlife sanctuary. The sanctuary is home to the world’s largest herd of white deer. They’re not albinos but are leucistic. In the wild, such deer usually succumb quickly to predators and hunters because they’re so visible.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRocky Mount: A highway marker honoring a Native American Olympic gold medalist has gone missing, officials say. The marker honoring James “Jim” Francis Thorpe was still at its post in Rocky Mount as of last week, news outlets report, citing a state news release. The state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources is now asking for the public’s help in recovering the marker, according to the statement. Thorpe was born on an Oklahoma reservation in 1888 and became a professional baseball player in 1909 when he joined the Rocky Mount Railroaders in North Carolina, according to the state’s website about the marker. He also played professional football and was a standout in track and field, winning gold medals in the pentathlon and the decathlon at the Olympics in Stockholm three years later, it says. It was then that he was declared the “greatest athlete in the world” by the King of Sweden.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state will work with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to help develop a response plan for a potential spill of the Dakota Access pipeline, a state official says. State Emergency Services Director Cody Schulz says tribal leaders recently requested a response plan and resources to prepare for a spill near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the south-central part of the state. Schulz told a committee of state and tribal leaders headed by Gov. Doug Burgum that his agency would be happy to either “participate or facilitate” a training exercise. The state also would work with the tribe to obtain federal grant money for planning and equipment. Standing Rock Chairman Mike Faith, who sits on the panel, said oil spill response training would be “awesome,” and he appreciates the state’s effort to work collaboratively with the tribe.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The name of a slave owner will be removed from the University of Cincinnati’s largest college after a unanimous vote Tuesday by the school’s trustees. The University of Cincinnati Board of Trustees voted to formally end the association of Charles McMicken’s name with the school’s College of Arts and Sciences. The university created a commission last year to examine McMicken’s legacy. He owned slaves and created a will before his 1858 death that set aside funds to create a university for “the education of white boys and girls.” The board agreed with the commission’s recommendation that McMicken’s name be removed from the college, but his name will remain on other spaces on campus. Digital displays outlining his biography will be placed near those areas to more fully and fairly represent the histories associated with McMicken, according to the university.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Scientists surveying a cemetery and a homeless camp in the city found pits holding possible remains of black residents killed nearly 100 years ago in a race massacre, investigators have revealed. In a report presented Monday night to the 1921 Race Massacre Graves Investigation Public Oversight Committee, Oklahoma Archaeological Survey scientists Scott Hammerstedt and Amanda Regnier said forensic archaeologists scanning with ground-penetrating radar at the sites in north Tulsa found anomalies in the ground that they think should be excavated and tested further. “There have been other searches that have found some anomalies, but I think that ours is the most promising one,” Hammerstedt says. “There was a commission in the late ’90s, but their results never went anywhere.” The violence in 1921 left as many as 300 dead on Tulsa’s Black Wall Street.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A city auditor’s report released Tuesday says Portland leaders failed to fully deliver on promises they made to voters as they implemented arts, cannabis, affordable housing and street repair programs funded by voter-approved taxes and bond measures. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the audit focused on measures and taxes passed in 2016. The audit also analyzed the 7-year-old Portland art tax for schools and nonprofit programs that assesses a $35 charge per resident annually. Auditor Mary Hull Caballero’s report says the city has used vague language when laying out commitments to voters, doesn’t consistently determine how realistic it is to keep promises made, lacks consistent monitoring to make sure commitments are delivered on and has diverged from some voter promises due to bureau leadership changes and the city’s commission form of government.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s high court on Wednesday turned down an effort to resume cash welfare assistance to the poor and disabled while litigation continues over a law that ended the payments this summer. The Supreme Court’s six-justice majority said Commonwealth Court had grounds to determine that the groups challenging the law did not prove they were likely to prevail in the ongoing lawsuit. At issue is a Depression-era program, known as general assistance, that typically provided about 11,000 recipients with some $200 a month. The payments stopped in August after Republican lawmakers pushed through a bill that ended the $24 million annual program while also reauthorizing payments to Philadelphia hospitals.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A community development organization has announced it’s planning an affordable housing project for young adults who have been in foster care. The Smith Hill Community Development Corporation announced Tuesday that it received a $100,000 grant from the Housing Ministries of New England to pursue the project, The Providence Journal reports. The grant will be used for pre-development costs for the $3.5 million project in Providence, according to the executive director of Smith Hill Development Corporation, Jean Lamb. The target tenants for The Cornerstone of Smith Hill will have experienced hardships in their childhood and be 18-24 years old, the age when people are aged out of the foster system, says Kate Corwin of Smith Hill Community Development Corporation. The development company says it will provide 26 units.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: University of South Carolina fans will soon join a handful of other SEC schools in allowing alcohol sales at home athletic events. The policy was approved by the University of South Carolina board of trustees Tuesday, news outlets report. Sales of beer and wine will begin at Colonial Life Arena starting with the women’s basketball game against Kentucky on Jan. 2, followed by the men’s basketball game against Florida on Jan. 7, athletic director Ray Tanner says. The rollout will continue into football and baseball seasons at Williams-Brice Stadium and Founders Park. Prices will average about $8 per beer, Tanner says, and he hopes the change could bring in “seven figure” earnings but cautions that it’s hard to predict whether that will happen. Louisiana State University reported earning $2.2 million in alcohol sales this football season.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: South Dakota School of Mines & Technology has received its largest gift in the university’s history. The donation of $3.6 million from 1969 graduate Willard Goodman and his wife, Billie Kay Goodman, was made to the school’s Department of Civil Engineering and doubles its annual operating budget that funds scholarships, graduate student stipends, faculty endowments, student activities and lab facilities. Willard Goodman, who grew up in Philip and died in 2013, was appreciative of the support he received as a student from the head of the civil engineering department, Bill Coyle, a news release said. “When he would talk about his professor, Bill Coyle, he would start by saying, ‘I’m probably going to start to cry when I tell you this.’ He was very open about how South Dakota Mines changed his life,” said Brad Johnson, vice president for development of the South Dakota Mines Foundation.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Volunteer State won’t stop resettling refugees, Republican Gov. Bill Lee said Wednesday, rejecting the option offered to states by President Donald Trump’s administration. The issue forced Lee, who campaigned on his Christian beliefs, to consider his own experience helping refugees and weigh it against the will of fellow Republicans in the Legislature. GOP lawmakers had sued the federal government over its refugee resettlement program, and legislative leaders hoped Lee would accept Trump’s offer. “The United States and Tennessee have always been … a shining beacon of freedom and opportunity for the persecuted and oppressed, particularly those suffering religious persecution,” Lee said in a statement. In Lee’s conservative state, his pro-refugee decision was viewed as far from a sure thing. He wrote that his decision is initially valid for a year.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is liable for damages to a group of Houston-area homes and businesses that were flooded by two federally owned reservoirs during Hurricane Harvey because the inundation was due to how the federal government built and maintained the dams. The ruling by Senior U.S. Judge Charles Lettow on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., is part of a test case involving 13 properties located upstream of the Addicks and Barker reservoirs that were flooded during Harvey in 2017. Attorneys for the property owners said the Corps of Engineers knew for decades that the reservoirs’ capacity would exceed federal land and inundate homes and businesses on adjacent private property. Their lawyers say structures upstream of the reservoirs were built in areas known as flood pools, where water collects as the dams fill up.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A farming family has reached an agreement with land officials allowing permanent access to a portion of private land along a trail bordering Zion National Park. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the Bulloch family owns about 1.5 square miles of land known as Simon Gulch outside the park’s eastern boundary. Simon Gulch includes a 1-mile stretch of the 16-mile Zion Narrows Trail that starts outside the park, passes through the family’s private property and continues to Zion Canyon, officials say. The Trust for Public Land orchestrated the $1.5 million deal with the family that shields the land from development and guarantees permanent access to the trail, land officials say. The family has allowed hikers to pass through its property but posted for-sale signs last year, officials say.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlesex: A post-Christmas event will aim to create the world’s largest s’more. The annual S’morestice Celebration will be hosted at Camp Meade on Saturday, Dec. 28. This marks the second time organizers will be attempting to build the world’s largest s’more, inviting the public to be a part of the record-breaking campfire treat, but the event in 2018 did not have a Guinness world record official in attendance. The current titleholder for world’s largest s’more is Deer Run Camping Resort in Gardners, Pa., who in 2014 built a 5-foot by 5-foot s’more weighing in at 267 pounds. To best that, the S’morestice Celebration organizers plan to build their s’more to be 4 feet by 8 feet. Vermont bakeries and chocolatiers have contributed: Crackers and chocolate will be provided by Red Hen Baking and Rabble Rouser Chocolate. Aside from the s’more-related activities, the event will include bonfires, music and food.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state is the only one in the country whose workers’ compensation system doesn’t cover injuries sustained through repetitive work activities, like repeatedly lifting boxes over several weeks, a new state report says. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recommended in a recently released report that Virginia should allow such injuries to be compensated. Stakeholders argued that potential high costs to employers are why Virginia doesn’t allow such injuries to be claimed through workers’ compensation, the report said. But such injuries are not a “major cost driver” of workers’ compensation premiums in other states, the report says.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Puget Sound has a 75% or greater chance of being struck by a damaging earthquake in the next 100 years, according to a new earthquake danger assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey. The Daily News reports for a region hit by at least three fatal, brick-busting earthquakes in the past 70 years, that might come as little surprise. What the update released in late November does show is that Puget Sound is on par with California in the earthquake danger zone. Only western Nevada and a small area where Idaho, Montana and Wyoming meet share the red zone – the map’s highest level. The rest of western Washington has a 36%-74% chance of being hit by a damaging quake in the next 100 years. The USGS uses the latest research from academics, government and industry to produce the National Seismic Hazard Model.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The city is about to get a new park. The City Council has approved a donation of 65 acres of woodlands in South Hills that is set to become a new recreation area with trails and other activities. The land, which comes as three adjoined parcels, was donated by Callen Jones McJunkin and will be called the Herbert and Gloria Jones Woodlands. The purpose of donating the land was to preserve its natural setting and create a passive recreation spot, a news release from the city said. The city will maintain and enhance the area with the help of community volunteers. “Because of this generous donation, members of our community will have greater opportunities to take part in family fun and create lasting memories for generations,” Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers said Wednesday that the state will continue welcoming refugees, joining several other governors to make such an announcement since President Donald Trump gave states and counties the power to reject refugees. In a letter to the Department of State, Evers said Wisconsin has “a rich history of opening its doors” to people of all backgrounds and has done so for more than 16,000 refugees in the past two decades. Evers, a Democrat who defeated Republican Scott Walker last year, also criticized the Trump administration for creating “an overly cumbersome and inappropriate process” for agencies involved in refugee resettlement, and he said its policies risk discouraging immigration that’s essential to the state’s economy. Wisconsin took in 472 refugees in fiscal 2018 who came from counties including Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and many others.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor says he doesn’t support a proposal to increase his salary and those of the other four statewide elected officials. The Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday discussed boosting the governor’s pay by two-thirds and the other four statewide officials’ salaries by about 60%, KGAB Radio reports. Those four are the secretary of state, superintendent of public instruction, state treasurer and state auditor. The raises would take effect after the 2022 election. Wyoming’s elected officials have not had pay increases in almost 20 years. Wyoming’s governor makes $105,000 a year and the other four statewide elected officials $92,000 a year. Gordon said Tuesday that he ran for governor to serve the people, not because of the pay. He hasn’t suggested any change to elected officials’ salaries and is more focused on providing appropriate compensation for other state employees, Gordon said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/13/pig-heart-transplants-nuclear-siren-scare-white-bison-return-news-around-states/50484931/", "title": "Pig heart transplants, nuclear siren scare: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: A prisoner who prompted a nationwide manhunt when he disappeared from a jail this spring has been charged with killing the corrections official authorities said helped him escape. Casey White, 38, has been indicted on a murder charge for the shooting death of Vicky White, Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly announced Tuesday. The pair’s disappearance from an Alabama jail in April sparked a national manhunt that came to a bloody end in Indiana, where Casey White was captured, and Vicky White died. The indictment alleges that during the escape, Casey “White caused the death of Vicky White, who died from a gunshot to the head.” The indictment does not specify who pulled the trigger. Authorities have said Vicky White died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Casey White will plead not guilty at an arraignment hearing, defense attorney Mark McDaniel said in a statement. The defense previously pointed blame at Vicky White for the escape, saying Casey White was in her “care and custody” the entire time of his disappearance from jail. Alabama law allows a murder charge if someone “causes the death of any person” while engaging in certain other felonies such as escape or if the person “recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to a person.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The U.S. government on Monday agreed to a request from environmental groups to study increasing critical habitat designations in Alaska waters for North Pacific right whales, one of the rarest whale species in the world. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries estimates there are about 30 of the whales left after centuries of hunting, ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements have devastated the species. The agency in 2008 designated about 1,175 square miles in the Gulf of Alaska and approximately 35,460 square miles in the southeast Bering Sea as critical habitat for the whales. Two groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and Save the North Pacific Right Whale, in March petitioned the agency to expand the habitat by connecting the existing two areas. This would extend the Bering Sea boundary west and south to Alaska’s Fox Islands, through Unimak Pass to the edge of the continental slope, the agency said in a statement. The proposal would also extend the critical habitat area off Kodiak Island east to the Gulf of Alaska to include new feeding grounds the Center for Biological Diversity has said were confirmed by new research.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The leader of the state’s largest abortion provider said Tuesday that her organization will not resume the procedures in one county even though a federal judge has blocked a fetal “personhood” law that abortion rights advocates feared could lead to criminal charges against doctors and others. Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona, blamed “vague and confusing” statements from Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich about a near-total pre-statehood ban on abortions for the decision. That law has been on the books since at least 1901 but has been blocked since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. That injunction covers Pima County, home to Tucson, so the judge’s decision on the personhood law left open the possibility abortions would resume in Tucson. Brnovich announced last month that the pre-1901 law was enforceable and that his office would seek to have that injunction lifted, although it has not yet done so. “We are not going to put our patients, staff and communities at risk especially when a majority of our frontline providers and patients identify as POC, LGBTQ or immigrants and we know that the criminal justice system is particularly cruel to those communities,” Forteno said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A burn ban has been issued in Sebastian County due to hot weather and a lack of rainfall, County Judge David Hudson said Monday. The ban prohibits burning outdoors of trash, debris, brush or other materials while conditions are extremely hot and dry. “We urge all citizens to work together to protect the lives and property, themselves, their families and neighbors,” Hudson said. “The burning ban will stay in existence until sufficient rain has reduced the fire hazard.” Sebastian County has not had significant rainfall in over a month, and the forecast showed several more days of triple-digit heat with no rain through Sunday. The high temperature each day is expected to be near or above 100 degrees with higher heat indices. “Lawns, fields and wooded areas are exceptionally dry, and the flashpoint for outdoor fires is unusually low. Without any significant rain, conditions will continue to dry out vegetation and spread fire more quickly,” Hudson said Monday. Winds can make wildfires hard to contain and pose a hazard to firefighters who battle outdoor blazes in dry, hot weather. The fine for violators of the ban could be $25 to $300.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A TikTok video showing dozens of beachgoers running and jumping out of the way of two fast-moving sea lions has generated nearly 10 million views and sparked conversations about whether the mammals were going after people and reclaiming picturesque La Jolla Cove’s narrow strip of sand. But sea lion expert Eric Otjen of SeaWorld San Diego said what he saw was normal sea lion behavior for this time of year, when males spar as breeding season gets underway. Otjen said the male flopping along at a rapid-fire pace as he darted around people was fleeing the other male closer to the water’s edge that was chasing him because they were likely fighting over which females they could get. Both sea lions had ample opportunities to attack people but instead barreled past them, he said. “He’s got swimmers all around him on his way back out, but they don’t bother him. What this is all about is his right to mate,” Otjen said. “This behavior is not uncommon at all. The reason why the video has gotten like 10 millions views is because everybody is running like Godzilla is chasing them.” And with good reason, he said. “It may look funny that everybody is running, but it’s not a bad choice. You don’t want to be caught in the cross fire. Even if they don’t bite, it’s not a great feeling to have 200 to 300 pounds roll over you.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: People have a right protected by the First Amendment to film police while they work, a U.S. appeals court ruled Monday in a decision that concurs with decisions made by six of the nation’s other 12 appeals court. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruling came in the case of a YouTube journalist and blogger who claimed that a suburban Denver officer blocked him from recording a 2019 traffic stop. Citing decisions from the other courts over about two decades as well as First Amendment principles, the 10th Circuit said the right to record police was clearly established at the time and reinstated Abade Irizarry’s lawsuit. A three-judge panel from the court said that “Mr. Irizarry’s right to film the police falls squarely within the First Amendment’s core purposes to protect free and robust discussion of public affairs, hold government officials accountable, and check abuse of power.” While bystander video has played a vital role in uncovering examples of police misconduct in recent years, whether it is a right is still being determined in courts and debated by lawmakers. The nation’s five other appeals courts have not ruled yet on the issue, and the U.S. Supreme Court would likely not get involved unless appeals courts were on opposite sides, said Alan Chen, a University of Denver law professor and one of the First Amendment experts also urged the appeals court to rule in favor of the right of people to record police.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The state is boosting service along two Metro-North rail lines, a move that comes as ridership on the commuter railroad that serves Connecticut and New York moves closer to pre-pandemic levels. Gov. Ned Lamont announced six new express trains on the New Haven Line and seven new weekday trains on the Waterbury Branch Line began service Monday. It marks a 47% increase in service on the Waterbury line, a 27-mile stretch that has undergone safety and infrastructure improvements. “This is the biggest day on the Waterbury Branch ever,” Jim Gildea, chair of the Connecticut Commuter Rail Council and rider on the Waterbury line, said during a news conference in Bridgeport. “This is transformational – transformational not only for the rail commuter such as myself, to get us to our places of destination, but for economic development in the downtowns that this line runs through.” Waterbury Mayor Neil O’Leary said the expanded service coincides with a rise in population in parts of western Connecticut. He said about 4,000 people moved into his city, which is about a two-hour drive from New York City, during the coronavirus pandemic. He said improvements to the rail line were one of the biggest reasons.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A Delaware Superior Court judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by the state’s Democratic attorney general against agricultural giant Monsanto Co. over environmental damage from now-banned toxic chemicals known as PCBs. In recent years, PCBs have been at the center of multimillion-dollar settlements reached between Monsanto and multiple states whose waterways had been contaminated, but Judge Mary Johnston rejected public nuisance, trespass and unjust enrichment claims asserted by Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings. Citing her own 2019 ruling in a lawsuit filed by Jennings against opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma, as well as an earlier lawsuit by the city of Wilmington against gun manufacturers, Judge Mary Johnston noted that Delaware courts do not recognize product-based public nuisance claims. Johnston also said the state has no standing to bring trespass claims regarding PCB contamination of lands and waterways. The judge said while the state may have regulatory control of land and water, there is no basis to support the notion that it has exclusive possession of water. She also pointed out that the state had not alleged that Monsanto had control of the PCBs at the time of the alleged trespass.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington has announced dates and participating restaurants for next month’s Summer Restaurant Week, WUSA-TV reports. The summer promotion is happening from Monday, Aug. 15, through Sunday, Aug. 21. Participating restaurants will offer multi-course brunch and lunch menus for $25 per person and multi-course dinner menus for $40 or $55 per person for on-premises dining. Many restaurants will also offer cocktail pairings and to-go dinner meals, available at two price points: $70 or $100 for two people and $140 or $200 for four people. “Diners across the region can look forward to what will be a delicious promotion celebrating the season’s summer flavors with menus at great price points,” Kathy E. Hollinger, president and CEO of RAMW, said in a statement “This promotion is designed to give the most options for patrons as they dine their way around our great region.” This year’s slate of restaurants includes some returning heavy-hitters in the D.C. food scene, such as Michelin Star winners Cranes and Bresca, as well as some fresh faces, like the just-opened Il Piatto Italian restaurant and Annabelle, which features a menu crafted by a former White House chef who served three presidents.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A majority of Sunshine State residents oppose the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion rights, according to a new poll that also shows strong support in Florida for the gun violence prevention law recently signed by President Joe Biden. However, Floridians give Biden lower marks than Gov. Ron DeSantis on everything from his handling of the economy to COVID-19 and race relations. Just 34% of Floridians approve of Biden’s economic stewardship, according to the survey by the University of South Florida and Florida International University, compared with 50% who think DeSantis is doing a good job with the economy. The survey provides a snapshot of how Floridians view the abortion issue in the wake of last month’s blockbuster ruling striking down Roe, with 57% saying they oppose the decision. There are a wide range of opinions on what Florida policymakers should do next on abortion but little interest in banning the procedure in most or all cases, according to the survey. Just 9% of Floridians said they want a complete abortion ban, while 21% said they want a ban with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. DeSantis celebrated Roe being overturned and has promised to “expand pro-life protections.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican U.S. Reps. Jodi Hice and Andrew Clyde are calling on the University of Georgia to end any support for a “Crisis Pregnancy Center” mapping website developed by two professors. Andrea Swartzendruber and Danielle Lambert, both professors in the College of Public Health, created the website, which allows users to identify crisis pregnancy centers in a given city, state or ZIP code. Crisis pregnancy centers offer pregnancy testing and other limited medical services. They are often funded by religious and conservative groups and attempt to dissuade women from getting abortions, according to the website. The website says the centers “frequently provide inaccurate and misleading health information,” and it calls them “fake women’s health centers.” The purpose of the map is to allow people to identify the centers and help facilitate academic research into the centers. Hice and Clyde sent a letter to UGA President Jere Morehead on Saturday demanding that the university end any support for the mapping website. “The website is ... clearly nothing more than pro-abortion activism masquerading as academic research,” the letter said. Although it does not appear to be hosted on a UGA website, the letter points to the use of a UGA email address by the website’s creators as evidence of alleged university involvement.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Three former state prison guards were found guilty of civil rights violations for assaulting an inmate and trying to cover it up, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. A U.S. judge ordered Jason Tagaloa, Craig Pinkney and Jonathan Taum into custody after a jury convicted them last week, the department said. A fourth former correctional officer, Jordan DeMattos, previously pleaded guilty for his role in the 2015 assault and cover-up, and he testified for the government at the three-week trial, federal prosecutors said. The Hawaii Department of Public Safety fired the men in 2016. “Justice has been served as those involved were held accountable,” Public Safety Director Max Otani said in a statement. “The Department will not tolerate this type of behavior from any employee.” The guards punched and kicked the inmate while he was lying facedown in a pool of his own blood in the recreation yard at Hawaii Community Correctional Center on the Big Island, prosecutors said. They later wrote false reports omitting the beating, prosecutors said. They face up to 10 years in prison for depriving the inmate’s rights, 20 years for the false report and five years for conspiracy.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: An insurance company that covers counties and other public entities in the state says it won’t renew Canyon County’s insurance policy because of increasing risks and a high volume of claims. The Idaho Counties Risk Management Program sent a letter to Canyon County officials May 23 citing “numerous factors including adverse claim development and increasing risk exposures,” the Idaho Press reports. The Nampa-based newspaper obtained the document through public records requests. Canyon County Public Information Officer Joe Decker said the county’s elected officials were not able to offer comment on the ongoing situation. “We are working to evaluate all options, including potential renewal with ICRMP and the potential acquisition of replacement coverage,” Decker wrote in an email. “More information will be forthcoming when available.” Canyon County Commissioners responded to ICRMP in a June 2 letter that suggested the county might appeal the non-renewal notice. They took issue with the decision, saying that “the abruptness and comprehensiveness of this total separation, and the lack of warning or opportunity to cure any perceived issue, is shocking.” The commissioners also said the insurance company’s documentation showing the county’s “loss history” isn’t accurate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mourners shared memories and tears Tuesday during the funeral for the mother of a 2-year-old boy who lost both his parents in the attack on a suburban Independence Day parade, and they pledged to care for young Aiden McCarthy and ensure he shares in their memories of his mom and dad. Irina McCarthy, 35, and husband Kevin McCarthy died on the parade route in Highland Park on July 4. Strangers cared for their young son in the chaotic hours following the barrage of gunfire that killed seven people and wounded more than 30. A photo of the boy’s round-cheeked face spread online, eventually helping authorities to reunite him with his mother’s parents, who had lost their only daughter. Irina McCarthy’s friends who spoke during the funeral in Wilmette, Illinois, remembered her as a big-hearted, dedicated woman who cherished her relationship with her parents and threw herself into marriage and motherhood. Each speaker pledged to remain a part of Aiden’s life and make sure he hears stories of his parents, noting his own cheerful approach to life that echoes his mother’s smile and can-do attitude. “(Aiden) will be cared for by all of us,” said Vic Lichtenberg, a friend of Irina’s parents. “He will have a family, a home, and he’ll thrive and grow with us. Every moment, every time I look at that child, I see Irina.”\n\nIndiana\n\nNew Castle: Federal prosecutors have charged a former eastern Indiana police officer with civil rights violations, alleging he used excessive force during three arrests, including by kicking a man in the head and shooting another with beanbags from close range. The U.S. attorney’s office announced Friday that former New Castle police Officer Aaron J. Strong has been indicted on three counts of “deprivation (of civil rights) under color of law” and a single count of witness tampering. According to the charging documents, Strong, 44, kicked a man “in and about the head” during an arrest July 12, 2017. On the same day, he used a beanbag shotgun to shoot another man “at close range” in the back during an arrest, prosecutors allege. The federal grand jury that indicted Strong found that both of those incidents took place “without legal justification” and resulted in injuries to both men. The third incident for which Strong was indicted stemmed from a 2019 arrest in which he allegedly used an expandable baton to repeatedly strike a man who had reportedly already surrendered. That man later filed a federal lawsuit accusing Strong of hitting him more than 20 times with the baton, resulting in injuries to his “head, jaw, arms and back.” The 2019 encounter also led to Strong’s conviction on a misdemeanor count of criminal recklessness.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An assistant attorney general is suing the city and its police chief over his arrest during a June 2020 racial justice protest, alleging he was tackled, pepper-sprayed and handcuffed for no reason. The lawsuit filed by Assistant Attorney General Paxton Williams is among at least eight cases filed against Des Moines police. The cases involve protests following George Floyd’s death in the custody of Minneapolis police. Paxton, who is Black, alleges police used unnecessary and excessive force in arresting him in front of his home, a few blocks from the Iowa Capitol. The lawsuit, filed May 31 in Polk County District Court, says Williams felt the effects of the pepper spray for several days and suffered shoulder, arm and hip pain. According to court records, a failure-to-disperse citation that Williams received was dismissed under an agreement requiring him to avoid further criminal charges for six months. A representative for the police department did not immediately respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment about the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, Lynn Hicks, declined to comment, calling it a “personal matter.” Paxton also is suing a police sergeant and 10 unnamed officers. Paxton alleges the sergeant told him hours after his arrest that police video refuted Paxton’s claims.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Opponents and supporters of a proposed anti-abortion amendment to the Kansas Constitution are trying to reach suburban Johnson County voters to state their case on the hotly debated issue, dealing with historically hot weather as their door-knocking campaign ramps up. Both sides have spent millions in television advertisements and campaign activities in recent weeks. And opponents and advocates alike for the amendment are attempting to use the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, striking down the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion rights nationally, to motivate their supporters into turning out for the Aug. 2 vote. As volunteers canvassed houses recently, some voters were engaged and could nearly read back the talking points to volunteers. One was attempting to urge his daughter to vote on the amendment by absentee ballot from Malaysia, where she was on an internship. The vote is on whether the state constitution confers a right to an abortion. A “yes” vote would give the Legislature significantly more power to restrict or even outlaw the practice, though lawmakers would still need to vote to do so. Kansas will be the first state where voters will weigh in on abortion following the Dobbs decision.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has struck down a measure that would have weakened Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s appointment authority over a key ethics commission by shifting power to Republican officials to select a majority of the members. In his ruling Monday, Jefferson Circuit Judge McKay Chauvin said the measure severely “diminishes and diverts” the governor’s constitutional duty to ensure the state’s executive branch ethics code is “faithfully executed.” By shifting appointment authority away from the governor, the law empowered other constitutional officers who aren’t “charged with that same constitutional duty,” he said. The GOP-dominated Legislature passed the measure – House Bill 334 – this year over Beshear’s veto. The new law was set to take effect Thursday but is now blocked by the judge’s decision. Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s office said the ruling will be appealed. Under the measure, five statewide officeholders – currently all Republicans – each would make one appointment to the reconstituted state Executive Branch Ethics Commission. The governor would appoint two members to the panel that enforces the executive branch ethics code. The measure would have removed all five current commission members – all gubernatorial appointees.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Despite some Republicans hoping to overturn the governor’s recent vetoes, the GOP-dominated Legislature voted not to hold an override session this week. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards rejected 29 pieces of recently passed legislation, all but one authored by Republican lawmakers. Under Louisiana state law, an override session is automatically scheduled when a governor vetoes legislation, unless a majority of lawmakers in either chamber say it’s not necessary. Historically, a majority of representatives and senators send in ballots saying that the session is not needed. However, since 2021, the Legislature has returned to the Capitol twice to override the governor’s vetoes. Lawmakers had until the end of Monday to send in ballots opposing an override session. Twenty-five of the 37 senators and 39 of the 105 representatives returned ballots. With a majority of the Senate voting against the session, it was canceled, Senate President Page Cortez and House Speaker Clay Schexnayder announced in a letter Tuesday morning. Bills vetoed by Edwards, following the 2022 regular legislative session, included legislation that would have toughened criminal sentences and banned government entities from denying building entry based on a person’s COVID-19 vaccination status.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state has added a suite of new rules designed to cut down on catalytic converter thefts from cars. Catalytic converters are sometimes targeted by thieves because they contain precious metals and are fairly easy to detach from a car. The Legislature has passed a law that puts safeguards into the chain of custody for the converters to try to stop thefts. The rules require car dealers to engrave the auto’s vehicle identification number onto the catalytic converter. Recyclers must also engrave or permanently mark either the VIN or their license and stock number. The state’s new rules also require residents who remove unmarked catalytic converters to engrave or mark the converter with the VIN. The state’s new rules go into effect Aug. 8. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows called the thefts “an infuriating trend” and said the new law would “provide some peace of mind to Mainers who are worried they may be next.” The number of incidents of catalytic converter theft has spiked around the country over the past three years.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A video in which a Wicomico County Board of Education member’s teenage son holds a rifle and says a threatening statement against Black people, using a racial slur, was shared among students at Parkside High School on one of the last days of the school year. The community was already on edge – two days before the video was shared, in mid-June, Wicomico County Sheriff’s Office deputy Cpl. Glenn Hilliard, a Black man, was killed in the line of duty in Pittsville. Front of mind nationwide was the killing a few weeks prior of 19 children and two adults in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Wicomico County Board of Education member Tonya Lewis’s 15-year-old son was holding what was later determined to be a pellet rifle in the video. Wicomico County public schools issued a statement the week the video was shared assuring the public the incident was being investigated and saying, among other things: “We are shocked and revolted by both the language and the visual content of this video.” The statement noted federal law prohibits the school district from revealing information about individual students. The sheriff’s office announced June 29 that the teen was being charged with misuse of electronic mail and disturbing school activities, both misdemeanors.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: A Boston suburb that was the birthplace of two of the nation’s earliest presidents is planning to build a center honoring their legacies. Quincy officials on Tuesday announced the formation of a new nonprofit foundation to raise money and oversee the design and construction of the Adams Presidential Center honoring former President John Adams and his son, former President John Quincy Adams, as well as former first ladies Abigail Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams. Mayor Thomas Koch said the announcement marks the beginning of a formal, public process for building the “long overdue” center, which he hopes will offer more than a traditional presidential library and museum. “We’re in the infant stages, but we envision it as a center for civic engagement, a place to really get some education about the history of our country,” he said during remarks at the Adams Academy. The mayor has proposed the historic former school as a future home for the center. The school was built in the 1800s using money John Adams left to the city of Quincy, which is named after Abigail Adams’ grandfather, Col. John Quincy. Koch has also asked the Boston Public Library to transfer John Adams’ collection of more than 3,000 books to the city to serve as a focal point of the project.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state’s largest district court and bail reform advocates have agreed to settle a federal class-action lawsuit over cash bail practices, which activists say routinely and unconstitutionally jail poor and working-class defendants despite evidence of their inability to pay. Both sides say the reforms announced Tuesday strike at racial inequality in the criminal legal system. On any given day in Wayne County – which includes Detroit, the nation’s Blackest city – nearly three-quarters of those jailed are Black, a proportion much higher than their share of the population. If the reforms narrow that disparity, it could be a model for court systems nationwide, where race and wealth are significant factors in the administration of justice, advocates say. Detroit’s 36th District Court, the American Civil Liberties Union and The Bail Project, a nonprofit that pays bail for people in need, said the status quo wreaks unnecessary havoc on defendants’ jobs, homes and families. “This is a historic agreement that we believe can and should be a template for how courts around the country can adapt their bail practices to what is lawful, constitutional and sensible,” said Phil Mayor, senior staff attorney for the Michigan ACLU.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A farmer is accused of making $46 million by passing off chemically treated corn and soybeans as organically grown. James Clayton Wolf has been charged in federal court with felony wire fraud. Prosecutors say Wolf falsely labeled crops grown on his rural Cottonwood County farm as organic, defrauded grain buyers and undermined the nation’s organic labeling system. Organic farming uses seeds from non-genetically modified organisms. Crops are grown without chemicals or fertilizers and generate higher prices at market than non-organic crops. Organic crop certification is controlled by the federal National Organic Program, run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The grand jury’s indictment says Wolf’s organic farming certification was revoked in 2020. However, according to the document, Wolf continued selling non-GMO grain falsely labeled as organic through an “associate,” the Star Tribune reports. “Mr. Wolf is a 65-year-old career farmer, who has never been in trouble,” said Paul Engh, his attorney. “He’s led a good life and now seeks his vindication.” Wolf is scheduled to appear before a magistrate judge July 22.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Animal shelters across the Mississippi Gulf Coast are coping with too many animals and too few staffers and volunteers. The Sun Herald reports that one shelter, the Jackson County Animal Shelter, is being forced to considering euthanizing healthy, adoptable dogs. Kennels are stacked on top of one another with dogs of all ages and breeds at the Humane Society of South Mississippi in Gulfport. The shelter has 500 animals, more than it can handle. “It’s a capacity crisis,” said Katie King, the shelter’s development director. The Humane Society, like many other businesses and organizations on the Gulf Coast, is struggling to fill job vacancies during a tight labor market. It’s a similar story at the Jackson County Animal Shelter. When the Jackson County shelter is at its capacity, staffers are forced to euthanize animals that are not considered adoptable – those that are aggressive or so sick they cannot be treated by the shelter’s vets. “But we are running short on animals that are not adoptable, and we are fearful that we will have to do some that are to make space,” shelter director Joseph Barlow said. HSSM and the Jackson County Animal Shelter are looking for volunteers, as well as donations including cleaning supplies, food, treats and more.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Two leading Democratic state lawmakers on Monday asked the Republican governor to call a special session to pass legislation that would safeguard contraception and medical treatment for ectopic pregnancies after a near-total ban on abortion was instituted. Senate Minority Leader John Rizzo, of Independence, and House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, of Springfield, wrote in a letter to Gov. Mike Parson that medical and legal experts have “expressed concern and confusion” since the state law banning abortion except in “cases of medical emergency” took effect last month. Most notably, a large Missouri hospital chain briefly stopped providing emergency contraception, fearing that doctors who provide the medication could be at risk of criminal charges, even in cases of sexual assault. Quade said in a phone interview that constituents have called “fearful of whether or not they can get their birth control, if they can get the morning-after pill. What do they do with their IVF treatments, ectopic pregnancy, etc. You know, there’s still a lot of confusion around what the actual law means in the state of Missouri in terms of who can be prosecuted and what is covered.” Parson had already said he plans to call a special session to deal with tax cuts; Democrats want abortion added to the agenda to provide clarity.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native American leaders throughout the state are pushing for the return of a sacred white bison that has been housed at the Montana State Historical Society since his death in 1959. Big Medicine is the name given a white bison calf born on the range in 1933, The Daily Montanan reports. Not an albino, Big Medicine had a mostly white coat with a tuft of brown that sometimes appeared near his horns. Many Indigenous cultures, including the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes, regarded the birth as an omen of good fortune and renewed hope, and Big Medicine was kept alive on the range for 26 years, nearly triple the age of the average bull bison. The display at the Montana State Historical Society is right across from the archives on the second floor, and he remains one of the most popular attractions. However, the Montana Native American Caucus has supported the effort by the CSKT to bring Big Medicine home, back to where he lived, to be a part of a planned museum and interpretative center. Molly Kruckenberg, executive director of the historical society, said while the decision to return Big Medicine to the CSKT is in the hands of the society’s board of trustees, staff generally support the effort so long as the animal, in somewhat fragile condition, can be returned safely and preserved for the next generation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A newly formed nonprofit says it wants to create a community center for LGBTQ+ people in the metro area and as far away as western Iowa, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Mayor Jean Stothert has thrown her support behind the effort by Omaha ForUs, which said support groups and mental health services would be among the offerings it hopes the center can provide. JohnCarl Denkovich, director of programs for Omaha ForUs, said the city is among just seven in the 50 biggest U.S. cities without such a center in its metro area, according to the newspaper.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Homicides are down in Clark County in the first half of this year, but authorities say gun violence and domestic killings remain a real concern. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports at least eight people were killed because of domestic violence in the metro area in the first six months of 2022. Across Clark County, 89 people have been killed between Jan. 1 and June 30, including 74 deaths that were investigated by the Las Vegas Metro Police. Across all departments in the county, police investigated three mass shootings in the first half of this year, according to the Review-Journal. At least 30 homicides in the county involved men killed during a fight with another man. “Perceived disrespect associated with social media and in-person fighting has become a significant issue,” Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told the Review-Journal. “Instead of reacting with their words and feet and hands, now they’re reacting with guns, and that is a disturbing trend.” County authorities had investigated 104 killings by July 1, 2021 – 15 more than this year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State homeland security officials said Tuesday that a siren was inadvertently activated at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station and that there was no emergency and no danger to the public. The state Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and plant owner NextEra Energy Resources put out statements more than 30 minutes after beachgoers in nearby Hampton and Rye said they heard announcements about 11 a.m. about the beaches being closed because of a problem at the plant. “We are aware of the sirens calling for an evacuation near Seabrook Station,” said Bill Orlove, a spokesperson for plant. “The sirens’ activation was sent in error during testing of the system. ... Seabrook Station is currently operating with no issues that impact the nearby community. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.” Police and fire departments in the area said the beaches were not closed. “The Seabrook Station Alert was inadvertent there is NO EMERGENCY,” the Hampton Fire Department posted on Facebook. The plant is about 40 miles north of Boston and 10 miles south of Portsmouth. It has operated since 1990.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Workers at five casinos have ratified new contracts giving them significant raises and are now turning their attention to the two that have yet to settle, their union said Tuesday. Officials with Local 54 of the Unite Here union said 99% of workers who voted in ratification elections Monday approved the new pacts, under which housekeeping employees will immediately see their hourly salary increased to $18, up from varying levels at different casinos. Their pay will increase to $22 per hour at the end of the four-year contract. “It’s hard to sell a housekeeping job at $16 an hour,” said union President Bob McDevitt. “It’s a lot easier to sell one at $20 or $22 an hour.” He said the strike authorization vote is a way to prepare for the possibility that a work stoppage may be needed. “Casino workers have needed raises for a long time,” said Dave Dorfman, a cook at Harrah’s and member of the worker negotiating committee. “Now there is an easier way forward for us, and the money will go a long way towards affording my daily expenses. Next, we need to make sure that Resorts and Golden Nugget workers don’t get left behind.” The union plans to vote July 19 on whether to authorize a strike at those two casinos if new deals are not reached by then.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State regulators said Monday that several horses that were feared dead by animal advocates following a weekend of racing at one of the state’s premiere horse tracks are alive and well. Officials with the New Mexico Racing Commission said that only one animal died after being injured during recent trials at Ruidoso Downs and that photographs and veterinary reports submitted to the state show the other seven were in their stalls and were fine. The Washington, D.C.-based group Animal Wellness Action had raised concerns about the horses’ welfare. “Apparently it was so brutally hot the horses had to be vanned back to the stables after they ran, which of course to us means they shouldn’t have been running in the first place,” said Marty Irby, the lobbying group’s executive director. Irby leveled his criticisms as advocates push for track owners and regulators nationwide to be more vigilant now that new federal safety mandates took effect this month and as the industry prepares to adopt more uniform anti-doping rules. Irby was among those who testified before Congress in support of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, which was signed into law in 2020. It is being implemented in stages, with the racetrack safety program starting first. The anti-doping and medication rules are expected in early 2023.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Researchers at NYU Langone Health transplanted pig hearts into two brain-dead people over the past month – the latest in a string of developments in the long quest to one day save human lives with animal organs. The experiments announced Tuesday come after a historic but failed attempt earlier this year to use a pig’s heart to save a dying Maryland man – sort of a rehearsal before scientists try again in the living. “We learned so much from the first one that the second one is much better,” said Dr. Nader Moazami, who led the operations at NYU Langone Health. “You stand there in awe” when the pig heart starts to beat in a human body, he said. This time around, Moazami’s team mimicked how heart transplants routinely are done. Once last month and once last week, researchers traveled to a facility housing genetically modified pigs, removed the needed hearts, put them on ice and flew them hundreds of miles back to New York. They used special new methods to check for any worrisome animal viruses before sewing the heart into the chest of each deceased recipient – a Vietnam veteran from Pennsylvania with a long history of heart disease and a New York woman who’d benefited from a transplant earlier in life. Then came three days of more intense testing than living patients could tolerate before doctors disconnected life support.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal judge has blocked state laws that greatly restrict who can help people with disabilities request absentee ballots, fill them out and return them. A disabled person needing help to vote by mail can now seek assistance from anyone they choose, not just from a close relative or legal guardian as state law has limited, the State Board of Elections told county election officials after the decision filed Monday by U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle. He declared that such restraints in state law conflict with the federal Voting Rights Act, which allows people who are blind, can’t read or write, or have a disability to pick whomever they wish to assist them, save for the voter’s employer or union. The elimination of these restrictions applies to all citizens with such disabilities, not just the thousands who reside in hospitals, clinics or nursing homes, Boyle ruled in a lawsuit filed last September against the state board by the nonprofit Disability Rights North Carolina. “Voting is a fundamental right in this country, and these barriers not only violated federal law, they effectively denied the dignity, autonomy and humanity of disabled people by preventing their full participation in voting,” Disability Rights North Carolina CEO Virginia Knowlton Marcus said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to legalize recreational marijuana turned in more than 25,000 signatures to the secretary of state Monday in an effort to place the matter before voters in November. The group, New Approach North Dakota, needed 15,582 signatures to get the measure on the ballot for the general election. The organization’s campaign manager, David Owen, said all the additional signatures they gathered show there is broad support for legalization. “We’ve had signature-gatherers in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck, Minot, Williston …we were at Country Fest this weekend in New Salem. This was a campaign that was done in less than 100 days, and we averaged 2,000 signatures a week the whole way through,” Owen told KFGO. “We think that this really shows true, strong support across the state, the fact that we were able to get so many people to sign.” Secretary of State Al Jaeger’s office has 35 days to review the signatures and determine if enough of the petitions are valid to place the measure on the ballot. The New Approach initiative would allow people 21 and older to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts of cannabis. Public consumption of marijuana would not allowed under the proposed provision.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A Franklin County judge described the ongoing effort to put a “green energy” initiative on the ballot in city elections as an illegitimate attempt to steal taxpayer money when he sentenced its leader Tuesday to 120 days in jail for filing a false campaign finance report in 2019. Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Chris M. Brown also sentenced John A. Clark Jr., 50, to pay a $2,500 fine, work 250 hours of community service and serve five years of probation. “I’m specifically going to ask the community service be through the Columbus Parks Department so you can work with the people you were trying to steal money from. You’ll work in programs that would’ve been shut down had you been successful,” Brown said. Clark has led multiple petition drives in recent years to get a “green energy” initiative put on the Columbus ballot that, if any had passed, would have diverted more than $40 million of taxpayer money from the city budget toward ProEnergy Ohio LLC, a limited partnership group led by Clark. After a back-and-forth with the City Council and the courts, a version of the initiative that would have redirected $87 million to ProEnergy Ohio made it onto the ballot last November. It was soundly defeated. One of Clark’s attorneys said they’ll appeal the sentence, which they feel was overly harsh.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Three proposed new turnpike routes were approved Monday by the Oklahoma Transportation Commission despite concerns by one member about the process being rushed and the absence of a member representing threatened homeowners. The turnpikes are part of Access Oklahoma, a $5 billion, 15-year expansion of the state’s turnpike network that opponents say will uproot hundreds of homes and businesses where new toll roads are proposed between south Oklahoma City and Norman. PIKE OFF, a grassroots group battling the three turnpikes, unsuccessfully asked the commission to delay a vote until a new District 3 representative could be appointed by Oklahoma House Speaker Charles McCall. John Estus, House spokesman, said the appointment, required after the seat was vacated by T.W. Shannon, is one of hundreds requiring McCall’s attention. “While this is a recent vacancy, it has been prioritized and will be filled very soon,” Estus said. “Nobody has advised the speaker’s office on why the vote on this matter occurred before the appointment was made.” Secretary of Transportation Tim Gatz said the routes approved Monday can still be adjusted based on talks with property owners and other considerations.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Forestry officials said Monday that an invasive beetle known for decimating ash trees throughout North America and Europe was recently discovered west of Portland – a first for the West Coast. The Oregon Department of Forestry said the iridescent green emerald ash borer is considered the most destructive forest pest in North America and had been detected in 34 other states before it was discovered in Forest Grove on June 30, KOIN-TV reports. Officials said it’s the first discovery of the insect on the West Coast. The beetle is believed to have come from Asia through Canada to the U.S. about 20 years ago. The insects have killed up to 99% of the ash trees in some North American locations. The emerald ash borer was discovered in Oregon by Dominic Maze, an invasive species biologist for the city of Portland. He was waiting outside a summer camp in Forest Grove to pick up his children when he noticed several ash trees with D-shaped exit holes in their bark, state officials said. He recognized the holes as a sign of the emerald ash borer and then spotted the beetles. “It’s an ecologically vital tree, as it shades water, keeping it cooler for fish,” said Wyatt Williams, the Oregon Department of Forestry’s invasive species specialist. “The roots stabilize streambanks, reducing erosion.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s elections agency sued three Republican-controlled county governments Tuesday, seeking to force their election boards to report primary results that include ballots with undated exterior envelopes – the subject of several other lawsuits. The Department of State sued Lancaster, Berks and Fayette counties in Commonwealth Court, describing them as “outlier counties” that have not properly certified vote tallies from the May 17 election that included nominating contests for U.S. Senate, governor and most of the Legislature. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled May 20 that mail-in ballots without a required date on the return envelope must be allowed in a 2021 county judge race in Pennsylvania. Although the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the Senate vote-counting after the primary, three justices signed onto an opinion that said the 3rd Circuit was “very likely wrong.” A Commonwealth Court judge, in a separate case that was directly about reporting this year’s Senate primary election results, ruled June 2 that county boards of election should count mail-in votes that lack the security envelopes’ handwritten dates and report vote totals both with and without those ballots.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Low-income people who are charged with crimes will be spared from paying court costs and fees if they prove to the court they don’t have the financial means to pay those debts, under a new state law. Recognizing court costs can prove an insurmountable hurdle for some people that can tie them to the courts, state lawmakers this past session passed legislation that eliminates all costs, assessments and fees for those determined to be indigent. Such costs will also be waived for anyone who serves more than 30 days in prison under the law enacted late last month. “It’s done a great deal of healing and relief for those who have been in the system for too many years, too long,” said Cedric Huntley, executive director of the Nonviolence Institute. Huntley recalled one man finally feeling free to get his driver’s license after a judge waived his court costs. “It gives people an opportunity to explore other opportunities. It changed the way he viewed the system,” Huntley said. Previously, state law specified that judges “may” waive fees for those unable to pay, but that lenience was applied unevenly by judges. Under the new law, the fees will be automatically eliminated for the indigent and those serving sentences longer than 30 days.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The nation’s ninth-busiest port is at risk of pollution by more than 100,000 gallons of fuel from a Navy aircraft carrier that served in World War II and the Vietnam War before its decommissioning and designation as a National Historic Landmark. The USS Yorktown, located in Charleston Harbor, is experiencing continued corrosion on its outer hull. If hazardous materials leak into the harbor, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster warned it would impair commercial shipping and harm the ecosystem. McMaster – who has supported environmental protection in office but failed to get the endorsement of conservation groups in his 2018 gubernatorial bid – took steps Monday to minimize that risk. Speaking at Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum in Mount Pleasant, the governor announced an executive order directing the state’s Office of Resilience to study the cost of remediation efforts and remove all 140,000 gallons of fuel from the USS Yorktown. The aircraft carrier also picked up the Apollo 8 crew and spacecraft in 1968 after the first human mission to the moon. “This is a special place for a whole lot of reasons,” McMaster said at a Monday afternoon news conference. “It’s been entrusted to us. And we have to be sure that it continues to flourish.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A pair of campaigns trying to expand access to Medicaid through the November ballot announced Monday that they will join efforts to focus on passing an amendment to the state constitution. The announcement from the two organizations – South Dakotans Decide Healthcare and Dakotans for Health – puts to rest a potential rivalry between the two campaigns. Both brought separate ballot proposals to require the state to make Medicaid government health insurance available to people who live below 133% of the federal poverty level, which is currently about $18,000 for an individual or $37,000 for a family of four. South Dakota is one of 12 states that has not accepted federal incentives to expand Medicaid eligibility, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. South Dakotans Decide Healthcare, which is sponsoring Constitutional Amendment D and is backed by the state’s health care industry, said that Dakotans for Health would join its coalition rather than push its own proposal for a voter-initiated measure. “After conversations with South Dakotans Decide Healthcare members, we have agreed that the best path forward to accomplishing this goal is to join efforts behind one campaign,” Rick Weiland, the co-founder of Dakotans for Health, said in a statement.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: More of the state’s students met grade-level requirements in reading this year, but the number of students scoring below grade level has also grown. More than 36% of students are on grade level in English language arts, up from about 29% of students last year, according to results from this year’s state assessments. But 25.8% of students are also scoring below grade level – also up from 23.8% of students last year and the highest since 2017. This growing achievement gap is especially acute at some grade levels and among certain groups of students, including Black and Hispanic students and students with disabilities. And it comes as state education officials tout successes in literacy instruction and implementation of statewide efforts to boost reading skills for all students. Students’ TNReady or TCAP scores fall into one of four categories: mastered, on track, approaching and below grade level. A student who tests “on track” is considered proficient for their grade level. This school year, of all students tested from third grade and up, 35.1% of students scored on or above grade level.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s juvenile prison system is giving employees pay raises to address high staff turnover and staffing shortages that prompted officials to stop accepting new children into the facilities last week. Direct-care staff, including correctional officers and case managers, will be getting 15% raises. The salary hikes had been temporary following an emergency measure in April but will now be permanent, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department announced Friday. The raises are “the first step in stabilizing the agency,” said Interim Executive Director Shandra Carter. In a letter sent last month to Texas juvenile probation chiefs but only made public last week, Carter had said her agency would have to temporarily halt the intake of youth to its five state facilities as the juvenile justice department was “hemorrhaging” staff. Following media reports in 2007 that detailed physical and sexual abuse in state facilities and raised concerns with state judges and lawmakers, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department has worked to improve conditions at its facilities. In a May report to the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission, the agency’s ombudsman said a leadership overhaul due to “persistent problems” at the juvenile prison system, including on ongoing federal probe, has failed to address the primary cause of the agency’s current turmoil: chronic staff shortages.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A judge on Monday granted a request from Planned Parenthood to delay implementing the state’s trigger law banning most abortions, as implications of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade reverberate nationwide. With the decision, abortion remains legal up to 18 weeks in Utah, which is among a group of states where abortion rights have been thrown into limbo amid the legal and political challenges shaping the post-Roe landscape with states now holding the power to restrict abortion. “What I’m really doing is saying we have serious things to talk about,” Judge Andrew Stone said after granting an injunction delaying the trigger law. He said the status quo should remain in effect until a challenge from the state’s Planned Parenthood affiliate can be heard fully. Utah is among more than a dozen states with trigger laws designed to limit abortion upon the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The decision Monday comes two weeks after the court put a temporary hold on the law, which bans most abortions with exceptions for rape, incest or maternal health. Stone, appointed by a Republican governor, blocked its enforcement for 14 days after the state’s branch of Planned Parenthood sued. His decision effectively extends the hold and allows Planned Parenthood clinics to continue providing abortions until the case is resolved.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The newly established Vermont State University unifying three state schools has received accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Education, the Vermont State College System announced Tuesday. Vermont State University will be composed of Castleton University, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College and will welcome its first class in the fall of 2023. Consolidation talks started in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, as increasing costs and declining student enrollment exacerbated the college system’s financial challenges. “Achieving accreditation for Vermont State University is monumental,” Lynn Dickinson, chair of the Vermont State Colleges System Board of Trustees, said in a statement. “Accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Education recognizes our strategic planning work, holds us accountable for maintaining high educational standards, and ensures we make continuous quality improvements for our students.” Vermont State University will launch next July and open applications for its inaugural class in the coming months, said President Parwinder Grewal.\n\nVirginia\n\nLeesburg: A judge on Monday rejected an effort by the Loudoun County School Board to shut down a special grand jury investigating the school system’s handling of two sexual assaults. The school board has said the special grand jury empaneled by Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares is politically motivated and illegally usurps the mandate in the Virginia Constitution giving local school boards authority over educational affairs. Miyares argued that the special grand jury he empaneled is needed to uncover why the school system allowed a boy who had been accused of sexually assaulting a girl in one high school to transfer to another high school, where he was convicted of sexually assaulting a second girl. Miyares launched the grand jury after Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on his first day in office, issued an executive order requesting an investigation by the attorney general’s office. Both Youngkin and Miyares had criticized the Loudoun County board in their successful 2021 political campaigns. They argued the board was not forthcoming in how it handled the case as it revised its guidelines over policies governing transgender students. The assaults attracted national attention in part because the boy – who was convicted in juvenile court – was wearing a skirt when he committed at least one of the attacks.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The Biden administration on Tuesday released two reports arguing that removing dams on the lower Snake River may be needed to restore salmon runs to sustainable levels in the Pacific Northwest and that replacing the energy created by the dams is possible but will cost $11 billion to $19 billion. The reports were released by the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Business as usual will not restore salmon,” said Brenda Mallory, chair of the council. “The Columbia River system is the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest.” If the four Snake River dams were ultimately removed, it would be largest such project in U.S. history. In 2012 the Elwha Dam on Washington state’s Olympic Peninsula was removed to restore habitat. At the time, the National Park Service said the elimination of the Elwha Dam was the largest such project in U.S. history. Many salmon runs continue to decline, which environmentalists blame on dams, Mallory said, and her office is leading multi-agency efforts to restore “abundant runs of salmon to the Columbia River Basin.” Mallory cautioned that the Biden administration is not endorsing any single long-term solution, including breaching the dams.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The speed limit on two roads near Marshall University have been temporarily reduced while officials conduct a traffic study to determine if permanent changes are needed for pedestrian safety. Crews with the West Virginia Division of Highways installed new signs near the campus last week that reduce the speed limit on 3rd and 5th avenues from 35 mph to 25 mph, The Herald-Dispatch reports. The move stems from ongoing discussions among Huntington Mayor Steve Williams, Marshall University administrators and officials with the West Virginia Division of Highways following the death of a Marshall student last year who was struck by a vehicle on 3rd Avenue while crossing the street at the crosswalk. Days after Cox’s death, Williams asked the Division of Highways to conduct a traffic safety audit on the streets around Marshall’s campus. The study is ongoing, and officials are reviewing possible safety measures. Depending on the recommendations from the study, the speed limit will be evaluated.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A key Republican leader in the state Assembly has decided to resign early to head to a private-sector job rather than wait until his term ends. Majority Leader Jim Steineke announced in January that he wouldn’t seek reelection. He announced Monday that he will resign July 27. He said the Legislature’s two-year session ended in March, and lawmakers aren’t coming back to do anything before the new session starts in January, so it makes sense to enter the private sector now. The Kaukauna Republican was first elected to the Assembly in 2010 and just months later helped pass Act 10, then-Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to strip most public workers of their union rights. The GOP caucus made him assistant majority leader in 2013 and majority leader in 2015. Republican Reps. Mike Kuglitsch and Tyler Vorpagel also resigned early after announcing they won’t seek reelection. Michael Best Strategies announced it had hired Kuglitsch on June 14, about a month after Kuglitsch announced he wouldn’t run again. Municipal Electric Utilities of Wisconsin officials announced June 6 that they had hired Vorpagel, just five days after he announced he wouldn’t seek reelection. Republican Rep. Samantha Kerkman resigned June 7 after she won election as Kenosha County executive in April.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Citing earthquake safety, workers at the Teton County courthouse say they’re worried about themselves and the public inside the 1968 building, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. In March, a consultant presented county commissioners with the results of an engineering study that found the structure not sonically sound. In addition to judicial facilities, it also houses offices for local first responders, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/24/coral-threat-woman-bites-camel-reagan-home-peril-news-around-states/40194799/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A pygmy hippopotamus has been born at the Montgomery Zoo. The zoo last week announced the arrival of the calf born Aug. 4. The calf was born to first-time parents: mom Asali and dad Mikey. Asali gave birth to twins, but the zoo said the other calf lived only two days because of a condition that made it unable to nurse. The zoo said mom and baby will be housed in a temporary habitat located in the South America realm of the zoo, near the flamingos, until the calf is about a year old. The pygmy hippopotamus is a large mammal native to the forests and swamps of western Africa. The species is considered endangered in the wild.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The nation’s most expensive wildfire this year is one that started in June and still continues to burn on the Kenai Peninsula. The Swan Lake fire has so far cost about $46 million to fight, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. The Anchorage Daily News reports that puts it ahead of the Walker Fire in California, which the Idaho center says cost about $29 million to fight. A lightning strike in June started the Alaska fire in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. Rain later reduced fire activity, but it flared again in August’s hot, dry conditions. Fire officials said that as of Thursday, it had burned more than 261 square miles and was 57% contained. There were 265 firefighters battling the wildlife.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The expansion plans of Lowell Observatory have it close to opening a new open-deck observatory, a movable-roof facility featuring six telescopes for use both by researchers and by the public. The Arizona Daily Sun reports that the open-deck observatory is getting its finishing touches in preparation for an Oct. 5 grand opening. Its six telescopes include one designed for viewing galaxies and star clusters and another intended for studying the details of the much nearer – at least in astronomical terms – moon and planets in our solar system. Perched on forested Mars Hill overlooking downtown Flagstaff, Lowell is where astronomer Clyde Tombaugh spotted Pluto, then known as Planet X, in 1930. The private observatory was founded by Percival Lowell in 1894.\n\nArkansas\n\nWest Memphis: Carvana, a company that facilitates buying and selling used vehicles online, plans to open a $40 million complex in eastern Arkansas and create more than 400 jobs. The Arkansas Economic Development Commission on Friday announced Carvana will locate an inspection and distribution center in West Memphis. Gov. Asa Hutchinson says Arizona-based Carvana is changing the used car industry through technology and great customer service. Customers can browse thousands of vehicles on Carvana.com to finance, buy, trade in for an existing vehicle, or schedule delivery or pickup via the company’s Car Vending Machines.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The city’s famed cable cars are running again after a 12-day service halt to rehabilitate the gearboxes that help run the 19th-century public transportation system. The wooden cars were slowly climbing San Francisco’s hills Monday, with operators ringing their brass bells. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency removed the manually operated cable cars from streets Sept. 11. The gearboxes spin 30-foot-tall wheels in a cable car powerhouse that pull the 12 miles of steel cables under the cable car tracks that lift the engineless cable cars up the city’s steep hills. Officials say the work is part of an upgrade project started in 2017 to repair heavy equipment in service since 1984. It has an estimated cost of about $6 million.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: Officials say fish populations in the Animas River have been severely depleted due to suffocation caused by debris from a 2018 wildfire. The Durango Herald reports Animas River fish populations are down about 80% due to runoff filled with ash from the 416 Fire, which burned an estimated 84 square miles of mostly U.S. Forest Service land in the Hermosa Creek watershed in southwest Colorado. State wildlife officials say heavy rains and flooding from July to September 2018 caused the runoff. The first full-scale Colorado Parks and Wildlife survey conducted since then found a 64% decline from the river’s historical average amount of trout. Officials say there was a 95% decline from the river’s historical average of fish longer than 14 inches.\n\nConnecticut\n\nGroton: More than $2 million in federal grants has been awarded to a program to help create a clearinghouse for seaweed aquaculture research and promote southern New England shellfish aquaculture. Connecticut Sea Grant, based at the University of Connecticut’s Avery Point campus, will also be a contributor to two additional projects involving the development of model state legislation for seaweed sales and building a diverse seafood processing workforce. The funding is part of the National Sea Grant College Program, which focuses on marine research and sustainable development of marine resources. The National Sea Grant Seaweed Hub will receive $1.1 million in federal funds, while the shellfish initiative will receive $1.2 million.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State agriculture officials are expanding a quarantine in northern Delaware in an effort to combat the spread of the invasive spotted lanternfly. The quarantine now includes all of New Castle County north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. The state Department of Agriculture is urging the public to kill on sight and report the bug to the agency. The invasive pest feeds on more than 70 plant species, including maples, apple trees and hops. Adults resemble colorful moths and are active from July to December. Under the quarantine, businesses must have permits to move regulated articles within or from the area. Regulated items include plants, lumber and construction materials. The general public is urged to follow a compliance checklist.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of activists blocked major intersections across the nation’s capital Monday, demanding immediate government action on climate change. Under the banner of ShutDownDC, a broad coalition of activist groups sought to bring the morning traffic in the capital city to a standstill. At one site about three blocks from the White House, activists parked a yellow-and-pink sailboat in the middle of the intersection with several protesters handcuffed to the frame. Washington police have a standing policy to avoid mass arrests of protesters, if possible. And even those protesters who had to be cut free from the sailboat with welding equipment were not arrested. The Metropolitan Police Department did arrest 26 people who were blocking the entrance to a major tunnel.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A woman is expressing outrage after her 6-year-old granddaughter was handcuffed, arrested and fingerprinted because of a tantrum at school. Meralyn Kirkland acknowledges that her granddaughter might have been acting out in class last Thursday but says it was because the child had not been sleeping well because of a medical condition. In an interview with WKMG News 6, Kirkland said a staff member at an elementary school was kicked while trying to calm the child. That’s when the school’s resource officer, Dennis Turner, intervened and sent the first grader to a juvenile detention center for fingerprints and a mug shot. Orlando police say they’ve launched an internal investigation to determine if the resource officer followed proper protocol in arresting the girl on battery charges.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A mapping program is finding that rural broadband access in the state is worse than federal officials first thought. Lawmakers are trying to find ways of bringing more broadband service to rural areas – and they need to know the extent of the problem. However, WABE Radio reports lawmakers have only had inaccurate maps from the Federal Communications Commission. Deana Perry, who runs the Georgia Department of Community Affairs’ rural broadband program, told lawmakers the FCC maps used census blocks. If one person had broadband in a block, the whole block was classified as served. Now, a new state mapping program using different methodology is finding that there are vastly more underserved areas in Georgia than the federal maps showed.\n\nHawaii\n\nCaptain Cook: Just four years after a major marine heat wave killed huge swaths of this archipelago’s fragile reefs, scientists are warning that a return of record-setting hot water in the Pacific will cause more widespread bleaching and possibly coral death. One of the state’s most vibrant coral reefs thrives just below the surface in a bay on the west coast of Hawaii’s Big Island. On a remote shoreline far from the impacts of sunscreen and throngs of tourists, scientists see early signs of what’s expected to be a catastrophic season of coral bleaching in Hawaii. The ocean here is about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for this time of year. Coral can recover from bleaching, but when it is exposed to heat over several years, the likelihood of survival decreases.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge says a mining company in the state has not complied with court orders and continues to violate clean water rules. The Idaho Statesman reports U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Ronald Bush on Thursday determined Atlanta Gold had not achieved substantial compliance at its Montezuma Creek site above Atlanta in Elmore County. Atlanta Gold’s attorney Michelle Points said Friday that the company would have no comment on the ruling. The judge said Atlanta Gold’s treatment system remains incapable of treating higher volumes of water from annual snow melt or other high-water events such as heavy rains. He said progress has been made, but improvement does not equal substantial compliance with federal rules. Montezuma Creek is a tributary of the Middle Fork of the Boise River.\n\nIllinois\n\nDixon: Ronald Reagan’s boyhood home may have to close its doors due to financial woes. WREX-TV reports the Ronald Reagan’s Boyhood Home and Visitor’s Center seeks donations to stay afloat. Patrick Gorman, the center’s executive director, says the house in Dixon generates $30,000 annually through tours and the gift shop. Operating expenses cost about $70,000 a year, creating a $40,000 annual deficit. The home is listed on the National Register of Historical Places but receives no government funding. Jerry Schnake, the center’s assistant director, says it borrowed $100,000 from the home’s board of directors in 2016 for a restoration project, leaving it $70,000 in debt. Gorman says having to close the home would be a loss to the community and to anyone interested in history.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: The city plans to raze a long-abandoned hospital built 90 years ago to serve the black community at a time when black people weren’t welcome at so-called white hospitals. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports the St. John’s Hospital building has been vacant since it closed in 1950 and was repeatedly named one of the state’s most endangered buildings by Indiana Landmarks. Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson says the building deteriorated so badly that demolishing it is necessary for safety, as it could collapse. Northwest Indiana Landmarks Director Brad Miller says St. John Hospital is beyond repair. He says it played a crucial role, employing black doctors and nurses to treat Gary’s black community before hospitals started treating people of all races.\n\nIowa\n\nWest Des Moines: A new whiskey from a local distillery is hitting the shelves this fall – and it’s mostly made with corn. Foundry Distilling Co. is releasing its first-ever batch of Corn Whiskey, which rested for 10 years in used Templeton Rye barrels prior to bottling. Foundry owner Scott Bush says he took an interest in corn whiskey a decade ago while running Templeton Rye. The whiskey is made from 81% corn, 15% rye and 4% barley and bottled at 91 proof. Little more than 800 cases of Corn Whiskey will be made available for sale. A limited number of bottles can be reserved now or purchased beginning Nov. 2 at central Iowa retailers like Hy-Vee and Fareway. This spirit will be sold exclusively in Iowa, with an expected retail cost of $79.99 per bottle.\n\nKansas\n\nDodge City: A capuchin monkey is recovering after it was injured while apparently trying to stop an intruder from taking a younger monkey. Officials at the Wright Park Zoo say the older monkey, Vern, was hurt, and his son, Pickett, was found on the outskirts of Dodge City on Sept. 3. The younger monkey was not injured. The Dodge City Daily Globe reports officials initially thought Vern’s injuries were minor, but a veterinarian found injuries apparently caused by blunt force trauma. The monkey underwent surgery at Kansas State University on Sept. 10 to repair broken bones. Zoo spokeswoman Abbey Martin said Monday that Pickett is doing well and back on display. Vern remains in quarantine while he recovers. Dodge City police are investigating the incident.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State officials are preparing to launch a program that aims to increase the number of students seeking higher education after high school. The Council on Postsecondary Education says in a statement that the statewide launch of Gear Up Kentucky is planned for Wednesday at Eastern Kentucky University. Initially, 12 school districts have been chosen to participate in the program that’s being paid for through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs provides free services to help students perform better academically and to increase their knowledge about postsecondary options and financing. Council President Aaron Thompson says the initiative “is a game changing program” that will help close achievement gaps and streamline pathways to college.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGrosse Tete: Authorities say a camel at a truck stop petting zoo sat on a woman after she crawled into its enclosure. Iberville Parish Sheriff’s officials told The Advocate on Sunday that the Florida woman’s husband had been throwing treats to their dog under the camel’s fence. Their dog went into the enclosure, and the woman crawled under barbed wire to retrieve the pet. That’s when the 600-pound camel sat on her. She told deputies she bit the camel to free herself. The woman was brought to a hospital. Deputy Louis Hamilton Jr. said the couple provoked the camel and cited them for a leash law violation. Tiger Truck Stop is about 16 miles outside of Baton Rouge and keeps Caspar the camel as an attraction.\n\nMaine\n\nVinalhaven: Four properties owned by the late pop artist Robert Indiana are now in possession of the foundation that intends to transform his Star of Hope island home into an art museum, the foundation’s chairman says. The Vinalhaven properties, assessed at $1.4 million, include Indiana’s Victorian house, along with a large building that could serve as a studio and artist residence, another building that could serve as gift shop and ticket venue, and a small home, Larry Sterrs says. Indiana’s estate remains embroiled in a lawsuit by a company that held the copyright for his iconic “LOVE” series. The lawsuit was filed the day before Indiana’s death last year. With the property transfer this month, the foundation, which isn’t a party to the lawsuit, can continue its work to turning his dilapidated home into a museum to display his artwork and create art and arts education programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: A federal judge has thrown out a psychotherapist’s lawsuit challenging the state’s ban on treating minors with conversion therapy, the practice of trying to change a client’s homosexual orientation. U.S. District Judge Deborah Chasanow’s ruling Friday rejected Christopher Doyle’s claims that the law violates his First Amendment rights to free speech and religious freedom. The judge said prohibiting the practice of conversion therapy on minors doesn’t prevent licensed therapists from expressing their personal views about conversion therapy to minor clients. One of Doyle’s attorneys says they will appeal the judge’s decision. Gov. Larry Hogan signed the measure into law in May 2018, making Maryland the 11th state to enact legislation against conversion therapy for minors.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michael Bivins, a founding member of the bands New Edition and Bell Biv Devoe, is turning his attention from music to sports. The Roxbury YMCA in Boston says Bivins has teamed up with Puma to sponsor a basketball league for kids ages 9 to 13. Every Saturday for 10 weeks, eight teams will compete in the league expected to draw 100 youths. Puma and Bivins’ BivFam Foundation are covering all expenses. Bivins is a Boston native who still lives in the city and fondly remembers his own days playing youth basketball. In a statement from the Y, Bivins compared the league to winning a Grammy. “I wanted to – like we say in the music industry – remix it and bring it back,” Bivins says.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Fire has destroyed a building that is part of the city’s popular outdoor art project known as the Heidelberg Project. Flames were shooting through the roof before firefighters brought the blaze under control Monday morning. The building east of downtown Detroit has “you” painted all over it, one of many buildings with the work of artist Tyree Guyton. The rear was gutted, and piles of bricks were everywhere. Guyton is known for attaching shoes, clocks, vinyl records, stuffed animals and other objects to run-down homes in the neighborhood. A spokesman, Dan Lijana, says the Heidelberg Project has been hit with fire in the past. “Every time we’ve emerged from it stronger,” he says.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A disease spread by insects has killed a wild deer near Caledonia in Houston County and is suspected in the death of another deer nearby. The Department of Natural Resources said Monday that Houston County is the second county in Minnesota where wild deer have contracted epizootic hemorrhagic disease. The viral disease was confirmed in two farmed deer earlier this month near Rushford in Houston County and in four wild deer near St. Stephen in Stearns County of central Minnesota. The state’s first known instance of EHD was last October, when it killed six captive deer in Goodhue County of southeastern Minnesota. EHD is spread by a biting insect called a midge, or no-seeum. It’s not considered a threat to humans but kills deer quickly.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Archives and History is offering aid to offset the cost of field trips to the state’s twin history museums in the capital. The department says it has $25,000 to help students who attend most public schools to visit the Museum of Mississippi History and Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and is seeking to raise more. Students in the Biloxi, Jackson and Sunflower County districts are admitted free thanks to an endowment established by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. The department says bus company Cline Tours is providing free transportation to students in districts within 50 miles of one of Cline’s six hubs in Ridgeland, Oxford, Starkville, Hattiesburg, McComb and Memphis, Tennessee. Department director Katie Blount says the goal is for every Mississippi student to visit the museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpokane: Spokane School District has adopted a four-day week starting this fall to boost staff recruitment and retention. The district can’t offer salaries as high as neighboring districts because it is small and lacks resources. Students attend classes Tuesday through Friday with longer work days. Spokane Superintendent Della Bell-Freeman says this allows the district to offer more benefits to current and future employees. Those benefits include three-day weekends, fewer work days overall, and more family and free time. State lawmakers permitted this option for districts facing tough choices during an economic downturn in 2010, when state funding was limited. Since then, 61 districts have transitioned to a four-day week, including Spokane and 27 other districts this year.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Officials say it may take days to clear a rockslide in the city that damaged a home and temporarily trapped a state lawmaker who lives there. The Billings Gazette reports the house at the base of the Rimrocks was crushed early Saturday, and a neighbor helped free Republican Rep. Bill Mercer, an attorney who was trapped inside. The slide left a trail of large boulders blocking the residential street. Billings public works director Dave Mumford says the cleanup will begin after a geotechnical expert assesses the stability of the slide area. Mumford says it may take a few days to clear the street. He says people should avoid the area because the slope and the house both appear unstable.\n\nNebraska\n\nFalls City: Officials are considering declaring their community “a city of arts.” Station KNCY reports that the City Council is expected to make a proclamation next month. The southeast Nebraska community claims Saturday Evening Post illustrator John Falter as a native son, as well as painter Alice Cleaver, artist and author Alan Tubach and jazz musician Pee Wee Erwin. The curator at Stalder Gallery in Falls City, Christina Wertenberger, says such a proclamation would encourage other cities to adopt a similar proclamation and be a step forward in increasing people’s knowledge of the arts. Library Director Hope Schawang says the proclamation would be apt because the city has been collecting and preserving visual arts for more than 100 years.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A Las Vegas-based developer is proposing to build a 20-story luxury hotel in the heart of downtown Reno. CAI Investments has submitted an application to the city detailing its plans for a high-end hotel on Court Street just south of the Truckee River off South Arlington Avenue. The move comes more than a decade after the company first submitted plans for a massive tower in Reno. CAI Investments CEO Christopher Beavor said in a video posted on the company’s website that it will be the first “ground-up, non-gaming, non-smoking upper upscale hotel ever built in Northern Nevada.” It also is expected to include office space to help meet growing demand in the Reno area.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlymouth: High school students in the state who participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition will get an extra chance to show off their skills and possibly earn college scholarships. The Governor’s Cup competition being held Saturday at Plymouth State University will allow up to 50 high school seniors to earn scholarships for one semester at one of the University System of New Hampshire or community college campuses. More than 25 teams from high schools across the state are expected to participate. The off-season competition was created through a partnership involving Gov. Chris Sununu, FIRST New Hampshire, the university and community college systems, Eversource and BAE Systems.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Sampling in hundreds of homes exposed to lead in drinking water has found that up to 99% of city-issued water filters are working, city and state officials said Monday. Tests over the past several weeks were performed after water in two homes with lead pipes showed elevated lead levels last month despite using the filters. Since then, residents in about 14,000 homes have been receiving bottled water distributed by the city and religious groups. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday that about 300 homes were tested and that 97% of the filters worked effectively when the tap was turned on. That number rose to 99% if water ran for 5 minutes before samples were taken. City officials said they would continue distributing bottled water for the time being.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A federal judge has rejected an effort by a Native American tribe to reclaim Valles Caldera National Preserve. U.S. District Judge James Browning recently issued a sealed opinion denying Jemez Pueblo’s claim that its aboriginal property rights were never extinguished. In a court filing that summarized his findings, the judge said the federal government had clear title to the land, and the case was being dismissed. Jemez Pueblo considers the nearly 140-square-mile swath of federally managed public land as a spiritual sanctuary and part of its traditional homeland. The property is home to vast grasslands, the remnants of a massive volcanic eruption and one of New Mexico’s most famous elk herds.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: First lady Melania Trump rang the opening bell Monday at the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange’s first female president, Stacey Cunningham, escorted Mrs. Trump and discussed the exchange’s history with her. They were flanked by children from the United Nations International School while standing in front of a backdrop promoting Be Best, the first lady’s youth initiative. Mrs. Trump received applause on the exchange floor and chatted with the children, who looked excited and nervous. Earlier news reports said some parents had objected to what they perceived as a politically themed event. Participation was voluntary. Republican President Donald Trump is in New York for a three-day visit to the United Nations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: The state’s top education official says hundreds of iPads will be sent to students and teachers on an island damaged by Hurricane Dorian. North Carolina Public Schools said in a press release that Superintendent Mark Johnson announced Monday that the department of public instruction would send 200 iPads to Ocracoke School, where flooding forced 185 students out of their building. The department says it hopes the iPads will help students stay on schedule with schoolwork until their building can be reopened. Students are currently attending classes in a teaching center. The release says the Sept. 6 hurricane flooded Ocracoke School with more than 3 feet of water. Gov. Roy Cooper has asked President Donald Trump to declare the island a disaster area so federal funds can be accessed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: City leaders are considering a proposal to solve an ongoing dispute about whether a Western-themed bar should be allowed to keep a mural in front of the building. The Bismarck Tribune reports Lonesome Dove’s artwork and all other existing murals would be permitted under the proposed ordinance, but new murals would have to follow a different set of standards. Lonesome Dove owners Brian Berube and August Kersten sued the city over freedom of speech in May after they were ordered to remove the mural. The painting depicts the name of the bar along with a rearing horseman against brown hills at sunset. Attorney Robert Frommer, who is representing the Lonesome Dove, says the proposed initiative “raises significant constitutional concerns.” City commissioners will vote on the proposal Oct. 1.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Four transgender people challenging a state rule preventing people from changing the gender listings on their birth certificates have won their day in court. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson denied the state’s request that the lawsuit filed by the ACLU, Lambda Legal and the ACLU of Ohio be dismissed. The lawsuit contends the birth certificate rule imposed by the state Department of Health and the Office of Vital Statistics is unconstitutional. Most states already allow such changes. Ohio and Tennessee are the last two to prohibit them. A federal lawsuit challenging Tennessee’s rule was filed in April. Kansas ended a federal lawsuit there in June, when Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly struck a deal by agreeing to allow gender identity changes on Kansas birth certificates.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The new interim president at the University of Oklahoma is condemning the use of blackface after a student’s social media post showed a white man with a black substance painted on his face. OU President Joe Harroz said in a statement late Sunday that while wearing blackface is racist, free speech protections likely prohibit him from removing the student from campus. The university newspaper OU Daily reported that the student said he was wearing a charcoal face mask and had no racist intent. A group of black student leaders notified OU administrators about the post Sunday. Two students withdrew from OU last year after a video surfaced of a woman in blackface, and the university severed ties with a fraternity in 2015 after a racist chant was caught on video.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: A university study says a Pacific Northwest bat that migrates south for the winter faces a serious threat from wind turbines. The Bend Bulletin reports a study by Oregon State University-Cascades concludes that the hoary bat faces an uncertain future because its numbers have declined by 2% per year. A study author, Tom Rodhouse, says bats can be killed by collisions with propellers and by barotrauma, which occurs when bats fly through low pressure zones created by spinning blades of a wind turbine. The sudden change in pressure causes bats’ lungs to expand faster than the bats can exhale, resulting in burst vessels that fill their lungs with blood. Rodhouse says hoary bats often fly into danger zones because their sophisticated sonar capabilities can’t detect pressure drops.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The State Police says it hopes to resume collecting data early next year on the race of drivers whom troopers pull over after a news organization reported the practice ended seven years ago. Spotlight PA said Friday that the agency stopped recording the race of drivers in 2012. A state police spokesman says the change was due to studies indicating there wasn’t evidence of racial disparities in traffic stops. Spotlight PA says state police tracked that data until the mid-1970s, then resumed in 2002. A 2004 report found there wasn’t consistent evidence drivers were being stopped because of their race or ethnicity. The study also found, however, that there were “racial, ethnic, and gender disparities” in how stopped motorists were treated by troopers.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Federal justice officials say the city’s school district had failed its English learning student population for years. The Boston Globe reports it received a letter sent to the city by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division in 2018, stating the district was setting up English learning students “to struggle and, too often, to fail.” The letter says parents were improperly counseled to waive their child’s right to English language programs. After receiving the letter, the city announced it was overhauling its programs and hiring more teachers certified to teach those students. A city spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter but referenced a settlement into which Providence entered with the Justice Department last year to make sweeping changes and identify students in need of language services. The state is taking control of the struggling district.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAllendale: The state’s smallest county is once again breaking in a new leader, native son William Goodson. Allendale County has had to hire a new county manager about every three or four years in this century so far. It’s hard to keep people without family or other ties in a place with no Walmart and about an hour away from the nearest movie theater or interstate highway. The roughly $72,000 salary, while good for Allendale County, is about on par with the pay for running the parking department in Charleston. The county now has about 9,000 people, losing 14% of its population since the 2010 U.S. census. A half-dozen 1950s-era motels line U.S. Highway 301 through the heart of the county. Once the main New York-to-Miami tourist highway, it lost the vacation traffic decades ago after Interstate 95 opened two counties over.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: State regulators will ask the Legislature to require bigger financial guarantees for oil and gas wells in response to a failed 40-well natural gas project in the northwest part of the state. State minerals and mining administrator Mike Lees says the the department will ask for changes to the bonding requirements when legislators meet again this winter. The Rapid City Journal reports his comments came last week during a meeting of the state Board of Minerals and Environment. Lees says the department will propose that all oil and gas drillers be required to post bonds of either $50,000 per well or a $100,000 blanket bond for an unlimited number of wells, regardless of depth.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Division of Forestry has moved up its outdoor burn permit start date this fall. Burn permits are now required to start all open-air outdoor fires within 500 feet of any forest, grassland or woodland. Burn permits usually begin Oct. 15 and run through May 15. Permits will be issued by phone or online, if conditions allow. Tennesseans are encouraged to check local restrictions in their neighborhoods prior to conducting any burning activity. In Brentwood, Nolensville and Spring Hill, fire officials have suspended issuing burn permits, citing “persistent heat and drought conditions in Middle Tennessee.”\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A white police officer who fatally shot a black neighbor in his own home was distracted by a phone call with a colleague with whom she’d been romantically involved, a prosecutor said Monday at the start of the officer’s trial. Amber Guyger, 31, has said the shooting last year happened after she entered the neighbor’s apartment one floor up by mistake. She is on trial for the death of 26-year-old Botham Jean, whom she said she mistook for an intruder in her own home. The case is being heard by a jury that appeared to have a majority of women and people of color. Jean, an accountant from the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia, “was doing no harm to anyone, which was his way,” Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus said in an opening statement. He noted Jean was in his living room eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream when Guyger entered.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Municipal officials say they want to reevaluate an ordinance that allowed banners for a gay pride festival to be hung from city light posts. Banners in St. George for the Pride of Southern Utah festival Saturday have caused a discussion of possible limits on signage hung from city-owned property. The festival that drew hundreds of people to the city in southwest Utah also caused online debates about the banners on St. George Boulevard. The discussion began after an email from Councilwoman Michele Randall saying she was unhappy with the banners was posted on social media. Randall’s message says the city council should reconsider allowing “political statements” on municipal property. Mayor Jon Pike says the policy that likely predates the current council should be reconsidered.\n\nVermont\n\nBrandon: The town is drafting a law that would restrict development within its river corridors. The Rutland Herald reports the benefit to the town of Brandon would be that the community would pay less after a federal declared disaster. Ed Bove, of the Rutland Regional Planning Commission, says river corridors are where the riverbeds tend to move during or after storms. They are not to be confused with floodplains, which are where water rises and inundates the area. He says the development restrictions for designated river corridors don’t completely prohibit development, but what gets built into them needs to be designed a certain way, and building permits must be sent to the state for review. Some areas of Brandon are prone to flooding.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Prison officials are unconstitutionally limiting public access to executions in the state by blocking witnesses from seeing certain steps in the process, four news organizations allege in a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Richmond alleges the department is violating the First Amendment by using curtains to block witnesses from seeing “crucial steps” in carrying out a lethal injection or electrocution – the two execution methods allowed under state law. “These limits on witnesses’ ability to view Virginia’s executions severely curtail the public’s ability to understand how those executions are administered, or to assess whether a particular execution violates either the Constitution or the state’s prescribed execution procedures, or is otherwise botched,” the news organizations state in the lawsuit.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: New state rules for selling cattle are scheduled to take effect in October, hiking fees and nudging producers into using USDA-approved radio-frequency identification tags. The Capital Press reports ranchers who use the “840” tags – a three-number international code for the U.S. – will be able to report sales online to the state Department of Agriculture. The department hopes the convenience will motivate more cattlemen to use the tag. The 840 tags allow animal-health officials to track a cow from birth to slaughter. The USDA intends to make 840 tags mandatory by 2023. The federal agency says tracking every cow will limit crippling trade sanctions if a livestock disease breaks out. The 840 tags and online reporting will be voluntary, for now.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A bill expected to be introduced during the 2020 legislative session could end greyhound racing in the state. News outlets report Republican Senate President Mitch Carmichael released an opinion piece Tuesday calling for an end to the practice. He’s now facing opposition from some state delegates. The Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports the casinos make video lottery payments of about $15 million each year to the West Virginia Lottery Commission. The lottery commission transfers the money into purse accounts at the casinos and the racing commission. Carmichael says the money subsidizes the greyhound industry but could be better invested in roads and education. Democratic Delegate Shawn Fluharty says ending greyhound racing would eliminate as many as 1,700 jobs in West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A group of lawmakers is introducing a bill that would allow American Indians from anywhere in the United States to pay resident tuition at University of Wisconsin System schools. The bill’s chief sponsors, Democratic state Rep. Nick Milroy, Republican Rep. Jeff Mursau and Democratic Sen. Jeff Smith, say they hope the bill will encourage more American Indians to attend college in Wisconsin, increase campus diversity and serve as a step toward reconciliation after so many tribes lost their land in the 19th century. The bill’s chances are murky. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately respond to emails inquiring about the measure’s prospects.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: An attack by hackers on a health organization’s computer systems has forced a hospital to cancel some surgeries, stop admitting patients and transfer some current patients to other facilities. Campbell County Health spokeswoman Karen Clarke said Saturday the Campbell County Memorial Hospital’s emergency room in Gillette is still operating, but the ransomware attack has made some patient care services unavailable. Clarke said elective surgeries for Monday were canceled, and other surgeries are being evaluated case-by-case. Campbell County Health sent notice Friday that all of its computer systems had been affected by the attack. In a ransomware attack, hackers take a computer system hostage and demand money in exchange for restoring access. Officials say there is no evidence any patient data has been accessed or misused.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/12/fearless-girl-lizard-invasion-superman-building-news-around-states/50062795/", "title": "Fearless Girl, lizard invasion: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Two families with transgender teens and two physicians sued the state Monday to overturn a law that makes it a crime for doctors to treat trans youth under 19 with puberty blockers or hormones to help affirm their gender identity. The lawsuit was filed in federal court three days after Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the measure into law. Ivey is running for reelection this year and faces challengers in next month’s GOP primary. “By signing SB 184 Governor Ivey has told kind, loving, and loyal Alabama families that they cannot stay here without denying their children the basic medical care they need,” Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “She has undermined the health and well-being of Alabama children and put doctors like me in the horrifying position of choosing between ignoring the medical needs of our patients or risking being sent to prison.” The parents of a 13-year-old transgender girl in Jefferson County and a 17-year-old transgender boy in Shelby County are participating in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs are known as Roe and Doe in the court filing to protect the children’s identities. The Southern Poverty Law Center; the Human Rights Campaign, a national advocacy group for the LGBTQ community; and other groups are representing the plaintiffs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is not on track to finish its work within a voter-approved session limit. The 90-day mark will be reached Sunday. The voter-approved limit took effect in 2008, but lawmakers face no penalty for failing to meet the deadline and can continue working beyond it. The state constitution permits regular sessions of up to 121 days, with an option to extend another 10 days. Lawmakers last finished within the 90-day limit in 2013, according to statistics from the Legislative Affairs Agency. The state House over the weekend passed its version of a state operating budget, which the Senate still must consider. Senate President Peter Micciche did not have an immediate update on when the operating budget would reach the Senate floor. Differences between the versions that pass the House and Senate usually are worked out by a conference committee. The House version called for a $1,300 “energy relief” payment to Alaskans and a dividend of about $1,250. A long-standing formula for calculating the annual dividend was last used in 2015. While many lawmakers see that formula as unsustainable, agreement has yet to be reached on an alternative. The dividend amount in the meantime generally has been set by lawmakers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state House voted Monday to delay the effective date for legislation signed last month requiring voters to provide evidence of their citizenship, which has already prompted two lawsuits amid fears by voting rights advocates that it could cancel the registrations of thousands of people. If approved by the Senate and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, the citizenship requirement would take effect after the 2022 election, a concession demanded by a GOP lawmaker who provided the final vote to pass the bill out of the Senate. As it stands now, that requirement and others in a bill signed March 30 will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends, which is likely to fall between the primary and general election. Monday’s update also would make a technical change that appears aimed at addressing concerns the bill could require hundreds of thousands of people who registered before 2005 to provide proof of citizenship. Arizona is the only state that requires documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A 2013 Supreme Court decision on Arizona’s law said anyone who registers using a federal voter registration form, which does not require documentation of citizenship, must be allowed to vote in federal elections. The controversial new law seeks to block those voters from voting for president or by mail.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A medical marijuana producer is opening a retail location in the city’s suburbs. Good Day Farm, which has operations across the South, on Tuesday unveiled Berner’s By Good Day Farm. Occupying 4,034 square feet of prime retail space in the Little Rock suburb of Chenal, the retail collaboration marks the Cookies brand’s entry into the Arkansas medical cannabis market and will provide the state’s patients with an expanded assortment of curated cannabis products and exclusive merchandise. “I never imagined our first store in the South being in Arkansas; I actually never pictured opening a store in the South in general,” said Berner, founder and CEO of Cookies, who goes by one name. “We are extremely excited about our partnership with Good Day Farm and look forward to providing real menus and a curated customer journey for those in Arkansas, especially those who have never experienced cannabis before. The last time I was in Little Rock, I was on a tour with Snoop (Dogg), and we had a blast. I look forward to setting the tone with Good Day Farm and giving Arkansas a taste of California.” A grand opening event will be held Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: A judge has ordered the Southern California city to throw out approval of a long-planned housing project, ruling that developers hadn’t adequately considered how new homes could affect potential wildfire evacuations. The Santee City Council in late 2020 approved the Fanita Ranch project, giving the green light to 3,000 new homes in hills northeast of San Diego. In her decision, Superior Court Judge Katherine Bacal wrote that eight resolutions and ordinances giving approval must be overturned, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The newspaper said the judge expressed concern that the plan didn’t fully address whether thousands of new residents would have time to flee during an emergency like a wildfire. The project, overseen by HomeFed Fanita Rancho, is not dead, and developers said they would revise the environmental impact report to address the judge’s concerns. Messages left by the Union-Tribune with the city’s manager and attorney were not immediately returned. The decision was celebrated by environmental groups that sued to stop the project, arguing that building more homes would only increase the risk of fire.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An advisory board has begun the process of removing the disparaging word “squaw” from 28 of the state’s peaks, valleys, passes and creeks. The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board met for three hours Sunday and considered task force recommendations and suggestions from local communities, The Colorado Sun reports. The board approved new names for nearly two dozen features but deferred a handful of name changes to a federal task force and steered clear of suggestions for naming features after people. The board also said all of its recommendations should take a back seat if Indigenous tribes suggest a better replacement. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may once have simply meant “woman.” But over generations, it morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in November created a committee to strip the name from federal maps. The Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force in February identified 660 features on federal land with the name, including 28 in Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A bill that would allow terminally ill adults in the state to request medication to help them die was suddenly derailed Monday by an unusual parliamentary procedure during a committee vote. Advocates had expressed optimism this would finally be the year, after roughly a decade of emotional debate, the legislation would get a vote in the full House of Representatives and Senate and be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. However, Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the top House member on the General Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, made a motion to “divide the committee.” That meant only senators on the panel could vote on the legislation. In Connecticut, both House and Senate members comprise committees. Ultimately, the senators defeated the bill on a 5-4 vote. Democratic Sen. Mae Flexer of Windham voted with the four Republicans in opposing the measure. “It says a lot about support for medical aid in dying, both inside and outside the Capitol, that opponents had to resort to a rarely used parliamentary maneuver to defeat the legislation,” said Tim Appleton, campaign director for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices, arguing there’s strong support among Connecticut residents for the bill. He predicted the vote will mean “immeasurable suffering” for people who are already terminally ill.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A high-ranking state medical official who is also a former legislator has opted for a bench trial instead of a jury trial on charges of official misconduct and falsifying business records. The trial of Rebecca D. Walker began Tuesday afternoon in New Castle County Superior Court. Walker is the director of nursing in the state Division of Public Health and a former state House representative. She is accused of submitting phony records regarding employee alcohol and drug testing over a period of almost five years while she served as deputy director of the state Division of Forensic Science. Walker was placed on paid administrative leave from her nursing post after being indicted in April 2021 but was allowed to return to work less than three weeks later. As Democratic vice-chair of the House Health and Human Development, Walker co-sponsored and helped pass a bill in 2014 that created the forensic science division. Months later, without a public job posting, she was hired as deputy director of the division at a salary of more than $92,000. The indictment alleges that between May 2015 and February 2020, Walker, “with the intent to defraud,” falsified employee substance abuse testing records, indicating that employees had passed tests they never received.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission saying it found evidence the NFL’s Washington Commanders engaged in unlawful financial conduct. In the letter obtained by the Associated Press, the committee said the team withheld ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable ticket deposits from season ticketholders. The committee said emails, documents and statements made by former employees indicate team executives and owner Dan Snyder engaged in “a troubling, long-running, and potentially unlawful pattern of financial conduct.” The committee is sharing documents with the FTC while requesting the commission take any action necessary to make sure the money is returned to its rightful owners. Congress launched an investigation into the team’s workplace misconduct after the league did not release a report detailing the findings of an independent probe into the matter. After testimony from former employees, that investigation expanded to the organization’s finances. Lawyers Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent more than 40 former employees, including some who testified, called the letter “damning.” “It’s clear that the team’s misconduct goes well beyond the sexual harassment and abuse of employees already documented,” they said in a statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state will create new grant programs to help fathers become more engaged with their own children and with children whose fathers aren’t in their homes under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday. The Department of Children and Families will manage the grant program and work with nonprofit organizations to promote the importance of fathers being a part of their children’s lives. It will also create a mentor program to help children who don’t have a father in their lives. “This has huge ramifications for someone’s ability to be able to realize their God-given potential,” DeSantis said. “Any dad who may not be engaged, we want to be able to support. We’ve got programs, we’ve got community groups, we’ve got nonprofits. … You’re not a man by leaving your kids hung out to dry. You need to be there.” DeSantis signed the bill at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice facility and was joined by former coach Tony Dungy.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: The state’s wildlife agency is asking residents to report sightings of an invasive lizard that can pose a threat to native species. The state Department of Natural Resources is trying to locate and remove South American tegus from Georgia before the lizards can thrive in greater numbers. So far, the state’s only known wild population has been found in Toombs and Tattnall counties in southeast Georgia. Wildlife officials hope to stop the black-and-white lizards from spreading further. They can grow up to 4 feet long and weigh up to 10 pounds, and the reptiles have a wide-ranging appetite that favors eggs of turtles, alligators and ground-nesting birds. “They can live almost anywhere and eat almost anything,” Daniel Sollenberger, a DNR wildlife biologist, said in a news release. “We are focusing our efforts to accomplish two goals: document the extent of where tegus occur in the wilds of southeast Georgia and remove those animals as soon as we can after they are detected.” Officials aren’t sure how tegus got introduced into the wild in Georgia, but they are commonly kept as pets. Last year the DNR removed a single tegu that was spotted on a game camera and later captured in a trap. Seven were collected in 2020. Wildlife officials warn if tegus become established in the wild, they will be nearly impossible to eradicate.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor said Monday that he is not currently considering reinstating a mask requirement for public indoor spaces. Hawaii was the last state in the nation to lift its indoor mask mandate at the end of March. “I don’t anticipate reinstating the mask mandate at this point,” said Ige in an email. The state has seen an uptick in new coronavirus cases since the rules were lifted. “We did expect a slight increase in case numbers after spring break, and we have seen that in the last week or so,” Ige said. “However, we are not seeing the kind of surges that are currently happening on the mainland. Hospitalizations continue to be low here, and we are in a good place.” Philadelphia reinstated its mask mandate Monday amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, and other cities across the country are seeing a rise in cases. Ige said if the conditions warranted it, he might consider requiring masks again in the future. “If there is a big spike, we may have to revisit masks,” he said. “However, I noticed over the weekend that many people continue to wear their masks indoors. We know that masks work, and they make a difference in keeping our communities safe.” Public schools in Hawaii still require children to wear masks indoors, a measure the governor said he continues to support.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge ruled Monday that a mother accused of conspiring to kill her children, her estranged husband and a lover’s wife is now mentally competent to stand trial on some of the charges in Idaho. Daybell and her new husband, Chad Daybell, face numerous charges in the complicated case involving allegations of bizarre spiritual beliefs involving “zombies” and doomsday predictions. Prosecutors have said Lori and Chad Daybell espoused the religious beliefs in an effort to encourage or justify the murders. The case against her had been hold for months after Judge Steven Boyce ordered her committed to a mental facility so she could undergo treatment in an effort to make her mentally fit enough to assist in her own defense. Boyce’s new order said Lori Vallow Daybell “is restored to competency and is fit to proceed” in the Idaho murder case. He did not provide other details about her treatment or mental condition. She is scheduled to be formally arraigned in court next week, and both Lori and Chad Daybell are set to stand trial together early next year. They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Lori Daybell’s children, 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as Chad Daybell’s first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A convicted felon who pleaded guilty to charges that he opened fire on police in 2020, wounding three officers, was sentenced Monday to 31 years in prison. The sentence comes two months after Lovelle Jordan, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder and five counts of aggravated battery to a peace officer, the Chicago Tribune reports. The charges stem from a July 2020 shooting that came shortly after Jordan was arrested in connection with a carjacking in downtown Chicago. Police had driven him to a station on the city’s Northwest Side. Officers patted him down, but while they found he was carrying drugs in his pockets, according to authorities, they did not see that he was carrying a small loaded pistol. Jordan was handcuffed behind his back. At the time of the shooting, Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said that officers had searched Jordan before he was transported, but he apparently had the gun “extremely secreted, probably very close to his private area” and was able to retrieve the weapon during the ride to the station. Jordan was somehow able to move his cuffed hands from behind his back, grabbed the gun and opened fire when an officer opened the door for him at the station. Dozens of shots were fired in a shootout between Jordan and three officers were shot. Jordan was also shot and was left paralyzed.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: State officials have chosen the preferred route of a proposed highway that would run from the Ohio River to Interstate 69, linking small southern Indiana communities to I-69. The Indiana Department of Transportation announced its selection of the “Alternative P” route over several other options for the Mid-States Corridor in a public notice published Monday. The route would start in Spencer County and use existing U.S. 231 until it links with Interstate 64. A new, 54-mile portion of the road would then branch off and run parallel to U.S. 231 before linking with I-69 just north of the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center in Martin County. That route would mostly bypass “developed” parts of towns along the path, including Jasper and Loogootee, the notice said. Mid-States Corridor Project spokeswoman Mindy Peterson declined to provide specifics – including why INDOT chose “alternative P” – until an environmental impact statement is released Friday. Public hearings on the preferred route are set for April 26 at WestGate Academy in Odon and April 28 at the Jasper Arts Center on Vincennes University’s Jasper campus. INDOT and the project’s supporters say it will improve southern Indiana’s highway connections. Opponents have argued that building a new highway would damage the region’s forests and caves.\n\nIowa\n\nOxford: Iowa Farm Sanctuary has become the first in the state to be accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, joining the ranks of more than 150 GFAS-accredited and -verified sanctuaries, rescues and rehabilitation centers worldwide. “It’s a huge accomplishment, and there’s so much buildup to it. We were confident that we are accreditation-worthy, but it was just all the work that we put into it,” said Katie Valentine, assistant director of operations at the Iowa Farm Sanctuary. The Iowa Farm Sanctuary was founded by Shawn and Jered Camp in 2016. The nonprofit focuses on helping animals with special needs like Ellie, a cow who was born blind. Not all residents at the farm sanctuary have special needs. Many come from dangerous situations, like Kathy the goat, rescued from a hoarder. Accreditation from GFAS vouches for organizations with stakeholders such as donors or a foundation. An organization must meet the GFAS Standards of Excellence, which contain guidelines for housing, veterinary care, well-being and handling, financial stability and more. “In Iowa, which is a state known for having a lot of animal agriculture, Iowa Farm Sanctuary really stands out because unlike (in animal agriculture), they are providing individualized care to their residents,” said Jessica Harris, program director of farmed animals at GFAS.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday signed a bill pushed by Republicans to overturn three communities’ policies that could help immigrants stay in the state illegally. The bill was filed after Wyandotte County passed a “sanctuary” ordinance in February that would provide local identification cards for immigrants and other residents and would prevent local law enforcement from helping the federal government enforce immigration laws unless public safety is threatened. Lawrence and Roeland Park have similar ordinances. The Democratic governor said in a statement announcing that she would sign the bill that immigration policy is a federal responsibility and can’t be resolved at the local level. “Both Republicans and Democrats in Washington have failed to address immigration issues for decades,” Kelly said. “We need a national solution, and we need it now.” The Kansas House and Senate passed the bill in recent weeks, and supporters had the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override a Kelly veto. The bill nullifies the three existing ordinances and bans future ones that restrict cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill also says a local ID isn’t valid for voting.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill allowing lawyers to carry concealed weapons anywhere in the state, including courtrooms, drew a veto Monday from Gov. Andy Beshear, who said it could spark dangerous situations. The Democratic governor said he was contacted by judges, prosecutors and the state Fraternal Order of Police requesting that he veto the measure. The proposal was attached as an amendment to an unrelated bill by the Senate before it cleared the Republican-led Legislature in the final hectic days before lawmakers took their “veto period’” break to allow Beshear to review stacks of passed bills. The gun-carrying allowance would apply to lawyers arguing cases as well as attorneys personally involved in cases, including domestic disputes or divorces, Beshear’s veto message said. The bill is one of a raft of measures vetoed recently by the governor. Lawmakers will be able to take up veto override efforts when they reconvene Wednesday for the final two days of this year’s session. The governor said he supports Second Amendment rights to bear arms, but his veto message raised potentially dangerous scenarios in courtrooms if the measure becomes law. “Courtrooms are venues of often volatile disputes that can be filled with emotion and tension,” wrote Beshear, a former state attorney general.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The group Red Hot Chili Peppers has been added to the lineup of the 2022 New Orleans Jazz Fest. The rock band’s appearance is set for Sunday, May 1, and will be its first at the event since 2016. The group has sold 80 million albums, collected six Grammy Awards and been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their 12th studio album, “Unlimited Love,” was released April 1. Last month, the festival announced plans to find a replacement for the Foo Fighters, which canceled all upcoming concert dates after the death of the band’s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. Their scheduled time slot has now been filled by the Chili Peppers. The 2022 festival will run April 29-May 1 and May 5-8 at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. The Who, Stevie Nicks, Lionel Richie, Luke Combs, Willie Nelson, Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, Charlie Wilson and Erykah Badu are among the headliners for this year’s festival. Started in 1970, Jazz Fest annually celebrates the unique culture and heritage of New Orleans and Louisiana, alongside performances by nationally and internationally renowned guest artists. It is returning after a two-year hiatus brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lawyer for the former mayor made the case in court Tuesday that his client was served an eviction notice in retaliation for organizing on behalf of tenants. Ethan Strimling, the mayor of Portland from 2015 to 2019, appeared in court after he was served with the eviction notice last year and refused to leave. Strimling’s case has gone to court because his landlord, Geoffrey Rice, started legal proceedings to make him leave. Strimling’s attorney, Scott Dolan, said during opening statements in the case that the eviction was “a clear case of retaliation” for organizing the tenants’ union, the Bangor Daily News reports. Rice’s attorney, David Chamberlain, said during his own opening statement that the eviction was about economics. Rice offered an example that Strimling violated a section of his lease by leaving his window open in April. That presented a potential cost for Rice, who paid the heating bill. Portland voters passed a rent control ordinance in November 2020. That ordinance encouraged residents to organize.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A former police detective was found guilty of several federal crimes Monday, including providing a gun that he knew would be planted on a suspect. A federal jury convicted Robert Hankard of corruption and conspiracy charges, including allegations that he conspired with others to plant a BB gun on a suspect whom another officer had run over and later lied about it to a grand jury, news outlets reports. Hankard was also convicted of falsifying an application for a search warrant and an arrest report in another incident where drugs were planted on a suspect and of falsely testifying to a federal grand jury. The prosecution was part of the fallout from the rogue Gun Trace Task Force, which was supposed to take illegal guns off the streets, but instead members robbed drug dealers, planted drugs and guns on innocent people, and assaulted seemingly random civilians. Hankard didn’t testify and remains out of custody until his sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill passed by the state Senate aims to assist members of communities disproportionately harmed by the enforcement of past marijuana laws in participating in the growing cannabis market. The legislation would create a new fund that supporters say will increase equity in the cannabis industry in part by addressing the lack of access to capital that has kept many would-be entrepreneurs from taking part in the new industry. Opening an average cannabis retail shop can require more than $1 million, backers of the legislation said, with the numbers even higher for manufacturing facilities – as much as $5 million. Another hurdle is federal cannabis law preventing businesses from accessing traditional bank loans, leaving many entrepreneurs vulnerable to predatory financial deals and damaging equity partnerships. The bill would create a social equity fund to facilitate new access to capital by making grants and loans, including forgivable and no-interest loans. The fund would receive 10% of annual revenue collected from the marijuana excise tax, an estimated $18 million for the 2023 fiscal year. If approved, the state would join a handful of other states in pioneering the program. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: PFAS compounds, the emerging contaminant “forever chemicals” raising public health and environmental alarms, are found in greater quantities in the treated water leaving the state’s wastewater treatment plants – the water returning to streams, rivers and lakes – than in the not-yet-treated water entering the plant, a new Western Michigan University study found. The study highlights the complex cycling of PFAS, which have been tied to cancer and other health problems, through the environment and through human attempts to address it. When PFAS are removed from a contaminated site – either physically excavated or through charcoal filtration – the removed contaminants typically end up in a landfill. When that landfill leaches liquids, they are typically captured and either piped or trucked to a wastewater treatment facility. But such facilities aren’t required to treat for PFAS. The increase in PFAS detection in wastewater treatment plant’s outflow doesn’t mean the plants are introducing more chemicals. Rather, it appears that PFAS chemicals that scientists cannot readily detect in the wastewater entering plants are being transformed into detectable PFAS compounds during the treatment process, said Matt Reeves, lead author of the study, hydrogeologist and associate professor at Western Michigan, who specializes in the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors revealed in a hearing Monday evening that they offered plea deals to three former police officers charged with aiding and abetting the murder of George Floyd, but the defendants rejected them. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill held the hearing mostly to consider whether he has the authority to allow live video coverage of the upcoming trial set to begin in June for former Officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng. They’re charged with aiding and abetting both manslaughter and murder when former Officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement for 91/ 2 minutes on May 25, 2020. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back. Lead prosecutor Matthew Frank did not disclose details of the plea offers in open court but said they were identical and were made March 22 after a jury convicted the three in a separate trial in February on federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd’s death, according to pool reports from inside the courtroom. Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, said it was hard for the defense to negotiate when the three still don’t know what their federal sentences will be. The judge in that case has not set a sentencing date, and all three remain free on bail.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A death row inmate has told a judge under oath that he wants to continue appealing his case, months after saying he wanted to give up his appeals and request an execution date. George County Circuit Court Judge Kathy King Jackson issued an order Monday noting the current wishes of the inmate, Blayde Nathaniel Grayson, who appeared before Jackson on Thursday and said he wants to continue his appeal in federal court. Grayson, 46, was convicted of capital murder in 1997 for the stabbing death the previous year of 78-year-old Minnie Smith during a home burglary in south Mississippi’s George County. He said in a handwritten letter to the state Supreme Court in early December: “I ask to see that my execution should be carried out forthwith.” Grayson also said then that he wanted to end all of his appeals. Grayson’s attorney, David Voisin, submitted a letter days later asking justices to disregard Grayson’s request because Grayson still had an appeal pending in federal court. On Jan. 28, the state Supreme Court ordered that Grayson be put under oath before a circuit judge to say whether he wished to go forward with his request for the state to schedule his lethal injection. That hearing happened Thursday.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledges mistakes in her handling of the prosecution of former Gov. Eric Greitens but won’t face severe penalties for those mistakes. The “joint stipulation” agreement was announced Monday at the outset of a disciplinary hearing before a three-person panel. In the agreement, Gardner concedes she failed to produce documents and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers in the 2018 criminal case. The agreement says Gardner’s conduct “was negligent or perhaps reckless, but not intentional.” It calls for a written reprimand. A more severe punishment – suspension or disbarment – would likely cost Gardner her job because state law requires elected prosecutors to hold active law licenses. The panel would still need to sign off on the agreement and make a recommendation within 30 days to the Missouri Supreme Court, which ultimately decides punishment. It’s unclear when the court might make a final decision. Gardner is St. Louis’ first Black female circuit attorney and one of several progressive prosecutors elected in recent years with a focus on creating more fairness in the criminal justice system. She told the panel Monday that the mistakes were due to the fast-moving nature of the Greitens case.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental officials unlawfully approved a large copper mine in central Montana despite worries that mining waste would pollute a river that’s popular among boaters, a state judge ruled. Officials with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality failed to conduct an adequate review of the proposed Black Butte mine north of White Sulphur Springs, Judge Katherine Bidegaray said in Friday’s ruling. Work began last year on the mine along a tributary of the Smith River, a waterway so popular among boaters that the state holds an annual lottery to decide who can float down it. The underground mine sponsored by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. Environmentalists had sued over potential pollution from the mine and asked Bidegaray to reconsider its permit. Her ruling leaves that permit in place for now. She asked the two sides in the case to submit legal briefs within 45 days to address what should happen next. State officials said the mine permit includes requirements that will protect the Smith River. They plan to appeal the ruling, Department of Environmental Quality Director Chris Dorrington said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bill that would have allowed people in a majority of U.S. states to carry concealed handguns without a permit died Monday when Nebraska lawmakers derailed the proposal after hearing concerns from law enforcement officials. The bill would have made Nebraska the 26th state to adopt so-called constitutional carry legislation. Supporters in Nebraska fell two votes short of the 33-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster led by opponents, which prevents lawmakers from advancing it this year. Permitless concealed carry is already allowed in 25 conservative-leaning states. The Nebraska bill won initial approval last month but stalled Monday on the second of three required votes in the waning days of the legislative session. “To say I’m frustrated is an understatement,” said Sen. Tom Brewer, the bill’s sponsor and a leading gun rights advocate in the Legislature. Nebraska already allows gun owners to carry firearms in public view, as long as they aren’t in a place where it’s prohibited and don’t have a criminal record that bars them from possessing one. To legally conceal the gun, they’re required to submit to a Nebraska State Patrol background check, get fingerprinted and take a gun safety course at their own expense.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More Nevadans today are pessimistic about financial security and rising inflation than in recent years, a new poll of likely voters found, suggesting a negative shift in public opinion on the Silver State’s economy. The poll conducted last week by Suffolk University for the Reno Gazette Journal shows that Nevadans’ outlook on the economy mirrors how they feel about their elected officials both at the state level and in the White House. Just over 40% said their standard of living is worse now than it was four years ago – before Gov. Steve Sisolak and President Joe Biden assumed their respective offices and replaced Republican incumbents. About half said Nevada is headed down the wrong track. Suffolk surveyed 500 voters across the state, all of whom indicated they will likely vote in the midterm elections later this year. About 43% said their annual household income is less than $75,000, with 13% making less than $20,000 annually. Nevada’s median household income in 2020 was about $62,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing as president, and 47% said they want their vote in November “to change the direction” Biden is leading the nation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A commission to address domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking will meet again following a ten-year absence, according to an executive order signed Monday by Gov. Chris Sununu. A state task force that examined how the judiciary handles domestic violence cases recommended that the commission be brought back. The original commission was created by Gov. Stephen Merrill and was active from 1993 to 2013. Sununu’s executive order said the state “remains committed to fostering a multidisciplinary approach to both better address the needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, and promote a consistent response to hold offenders accountable for their actions.” It said that combatting and preventing domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking “remains a priority” for Sununu’s administration, and a commitment to reconvene the commission “is an additional measure to ensure victims remain safe and offenders are held accountable.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNorth Haledon: Hundreds of people are signing petitions to keep a 25-foot star shining at High Mountain Park Preserve as the mayor continues to defy an order to take down the solar-powered decoration. Mayor Randy George said Monday that he is prepared to reinforce the public relations onslaught at a special meeting next month at Eastern Christian High School. The agenda, he said, will be to organize more support against The Nature Conservancy, the Virginia-based nonprofit that asked for the star to be permanently removed. “I’m doing everything I can to harass them,” the mayor said. Meanwhile, the borough has backing from an influential source. The township of Wayne is helping the cause, and its mayor said he “does not object” to the star on the mountain. Wayne owns most of the 1,260-acre park, but according to the conservancy, it does not own any portion of the preserve where the star is placed. That part was given directly to the nonprofit by North Haledon in October 2000. Barbara Brummer, the conservancy’s director for New Jersey, wrote in a letter to George that the star is a safety hazard because hikers are climbing on it and visiting the mountain after dark to see it lit up. “Another very important consideration,” she wrote, “is that the star and its accompanying equipment have a negative ecological impact.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election regulators are resisting efforts by a conservative-backed foundation to post statewide voter registration information on a public website where it can be searched by names or addresses to view whether people voted in past elections and sometimes their party affiliations. The website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. The Voter Reference Foundation, created by Republican former U.S. Senate candidate Doug Truax of Illinois, announced in December that it would add registered New Mexico voters to its website database VoteRef.com that was established in the wake of the 2020 election and now includes voter rolls from at least 20 states. That move has prompted calls for a state investigation into possible misuse of election records and a preemptive lawsuit by Voter Reference Foundation to ensure its plans to publish the details about New Mexico voters. The foundation has said its goal is to usher in a “new era of American election transparency.” But New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said in an interview Monday that the foundation’s efforts violate state law that restricts the use of voter registration data to political campaigning or noncommercial government purposes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The 4-foot bronze Fearless Girl statue that was deposited in front of Lower Manhattan’s Charging Bull in 2017 will remain in its current spot opposite the New York Stock Exchange at least until early next year while city officials wrestle with a permanent disposition for the popular symbol of female empowerment, a city board decided Monday. Members of the Public Design Commission granted an 11-month permit extension and said they would spend the next six months exploring a way for New York City to take ownership of the statue, which is currently the subject of litigation between artist Kristen Visbal and State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based asset-management firm that commissioned it. “We today, the Public Design Commission, cannot make this a permanent piece of art,” commission president Signe Nielsen said. “We can urge that steps be taken to enable this work to be considered for the public collection.” The statue of a spunky young girl was supposed to be a temporary installation when State Street commissioned it in 2017 to urge higher representation of women on corporate boards, but permits to keep it on display were extended several times once it became a major tourist attraction. Fearless Girl was moved to its current location in December 2018 and has continued to draw selfie-taking visitors. Visbal, meanwhile, began selling replicas of the statue around the world. State Street, which had an ownership contract with the artist, sued Visbal, alleging the replica sales violated the agreement, and Visbal countersued, arguing that the company was infringing on her rights. She has urged the city to take ownership of the piece itself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: City officials have settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former firefighter who said she had endured a hostile work environment in which the fire chief and others inflicted emotional distress. John Hunter, the attorney representing former Asheville firefighter Joy Ponder, confirmed Tuesday that his client will get $155,000 in compensatory damages. She also voluntarily dismissed her claim in U.S. District Court, Hunter said. He said it was unusual for a gender discrimination case to survive summary judgment. “The city didn’t come forward with settlement offers until that happened,” he said. A federal judge ruled in March that the discrimination lawsuit filed by Ponder, one of the highest-ranking women in a North Carolina fire department, could proceed based on a claim of “disparate treatment.” Attorneys for the city of Asheville and Fire Chief Scott Burnette had asked U.S. District Court Judge Martin Reidinger for a pretrial summary judgment throwing out all claims by Ponder. Reidinger dismissed claims against Burnette, writing in his order that he could not be held responsible under the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s Title VII against employment discrimination because the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said “supervisors are not liable in their individual capacities for Title VII violations.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to legalize recreational marijuana in the state submitted paperwork Monday to begin the approval process. If it’s approved by North Dakota’s secretary of state, the group would need to gather 15,582 signatures by July 11 to get the measure on the ballot for the general election in November. The proposed measure would allow any person over the age of 21 to use limited amounts of marijuana and purchase products from registered establishments in North Dakota. The measure would put policies in place to regulate retail stores, cultivators, and other types of marijuana businesses. A similar effort failed in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hampered the group’s signature-gathering. Cannabis was a major topic in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year. State representatives brought bills to legalize and tax the drug, but the Senate killed the bills that were passed by the House.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: From X-ray body scanners to anti-drone technology, the state is ramping up efforts to keep contraband out of prisons as drugs and other illicit goods flood inside – even when visitation was curbed during the pandemic. The anti-contraband measures are aimed at anyone who enters prisons, whether inmates returning from an outside assignment, visitors or staff members, said Annette Chambers-Smith, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. “Every time we solve one thing, we have to build a better mousetrap for the next thing,” Chambers-Smith told the Associated Press. The scope of the problem was underscored last month when federal authorities announced the arrest of a South African woman on suspicion of helping to smuggle hundreds of sheets of drug-soaked paper into at least five Ohio prisons. The woman is accused of soaking papers in legal correspondence, which is exempt from normal inspection routines. The state said it conducted about 1,000 drug seizures a month in state prisons from March through September 2020. Numbers slowly decreased through 2021 and now average just under 500 a month, according to state data.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law Tuesday that makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bill, which takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns next month, makes an exception only for an abortion performed to save the life of the mother. Abortion rights advocates say the bill signed by the GOP governor is certain to face a legal challenge. “We want to outlaw abortion in the state of Oklahoma,” Stitt said during a signing ceremony for the bill, flanked by anti-abortion lawmakers, clergy and students. “I promised Oklahomans that I would sign every pro-life bill that hits my desk, and that’s what we’re doing here today.” Under the bill, anyone convicted of performing an abortion would face up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The measure does not authorize criminal charges against a woman for receiving an abortion. Sen. Nathan Dahm, a Broken Arrow Republican now running for Congress who wrote the bill, called it the “strongest pro-life legislation in the country right now, which effectively eliminates abortion in Oklahoma.” There is no enforcement mechanism for women who order abortion medication online from out-of-state suppliers. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a bill last year to prevent such online purchases, but that measure was blocked by the state Supreme Court.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A recently released report shows an ice storm in 2021 decimated hundreds of acres of trees in the city. The report from Salem Public Works Department says a citywide analysis found a 17.6% tree canopy loss from August 2020 to May 2021. City staff said about 10 acres of tree canopy was lost to development, but the bulk of the loss – more than 1,000 acres – was because of the Feb. 15, 2021, ice storm. The report to the city says thousands of trees fell, and branches buckled under the weight of ice during the storm. Historic and heritage trees, some hundreds of years old, were downed. “Large Oregon white oaks were particularly hard hit by the ice storm as their large diameter branches accumulated heavy loads of ice, resulting in massive limb breakage and whole trees keeling over,” city staff said in the report. Initial reviews found about 10,000 trees were damaged, and 1,000 trees were removed from city property following the storm. The city spent more than $6.3 million on ice storm-related cleanup. New tree growth and new planting projects have helped offset that loss, the city said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Ex-President Donald Trump slammed GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill McSwain on Tuesday, complaining the former federal prosecutor did “absolutely nothing” to investigate Trump’s false claims of widespread election fraud after Democrat Joe Biden won the state in 2020. McSwain, who spent nearly three years as the top federal prosecutor in Philadelphia under Trump, had been seeking his endorsement, calling the presidential election in Pennsylvania a “partisan disgrace” as he sought to curry favor with the former president. McSwain has often touted his connection to Trump while campaigning for the GOP nod in a crowded primary field. Instead, Trump turned on him. “One person in Pennsylvania who I will not be endorsing is Bill McSwain for Governor. He was the U.S. Attorney who did absolutely nothing on the massive Election Fraud that took place in Philadelphia and throughout the commonwealth,” Trump said in a statement. “Do not vote for Bill McSwain, a coward, who let our Country down. He knew what was happening and let it go.” Trump’s false claims of a stolen election have been debunked by the courts, his own Justice Department and numerous recounts, and no prosecutor, judge or election official in Pennsylvania has raised a concern about widespread fraud.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: After years of neglect, the most recognizable feature on the city’s skyline, the Superman Building, will be rescued. Gov. Dan McKee announced Tuesday that the building’s owner is planning to turn the vacant landmark into an apartment building with offices and shops, with help from state and city funding. Officially known as the Industrial Trust Building, at roughly 430 feet high, it is the tallest building in Rhode Island. It has been vacant for nearly a decade. McKee said the $220 million redevelopment project will reinvigorate downtown Providence and bring the Superman Building “back to life.” Opened in 1928, it resembles the Daily Planet headquarters in the old “Adventures of Superman” TV show. McKee said $26 million will come from state housing and economic development programs, and $15 million will come from the city through a loan and a direct contribution. Massachusetts-based High Rock Development committed to providing more than $42 million and will take advantage of federal tax credits and seek a tax stabilization agreement from the city, McKee said. High Rock Development bought the building in 2008. In 2013, the sole tenant, Bank of America, moved out. The value of the building dropped, and it fell into disrepair.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A unique gold medal celebrating a battle victory that helped turn the tide in the American Revolution brought a world-record $960,000 at auction. An anonymous buyer of the Daniel Morgan at Cowpens Medal won with a bid of $800,000 on April 4. With the 20% buyer’s premium, the final price was $960,000, according to Stack’s Bowers Galleries in Costa Mesa, California. The medal honors Revolutionary War Gen. Daniel Morgan and his victory at the 1781 Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. It was struck in 1839 at the Philadelphia Mint. “Everyone’s pretty excited,” said numismatist John Kraljevich of Fort Mill, who specializes in rare, early medals and authenticated the anonymously consigned medal. The front of the medal depicts Morgan leading an infantry charge on horseback against a retreating British cavalry. The back features a Native American woman placing a crown of laurels on Morgan’s head. The original medal was struck in Paris in 1789 and given to Morgan in 1790. After his death in 1802, grandson and heir Morgan Neville owned the medal and stored it in a bank vault in Pittsburgh. It was stolen in 1818 during a robbery. In 1836, Congress authorized the strike of a single replacement, and it remained in the family until about 1885. At one point the medal was acquired by famed financier banker J.P. Morgan, who incorrectly believed he was related to Daniel Morgan, Kraljevich said. The medal then disappeared from view and was thought to have been lost or melted. Only in recent months did it reappear when consigned anonymously to the auction house.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House on Tuesday impeached Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over a 2020 car crash in which he killed a pedestrian but initially said he might have struck a deer or another large animal. Ravnsborg, a Republican, is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota history. He will at least temporarily be removed from office pending the historic Senate trial, where it takes a two-thirds majority to convict on impeachment charges. Ravnsborg pleaded no contest last year to a pair of traffic misdemeanors in the crash, including making an illegal lane change. He has cast Joseph Boever’s death as a tragic accident. In voting 36-31 to impeach Ranvsborg, the Republican-controlled House charged him with committing crimes that caused someone’s death, making “numerous misrepresentations” to law enforcement officers after the crash and using his office to navigate the criminal investigation. “When we’re dealing with the life of one of your citizens, I think that weighed heavily on everyone,” said GOP Rep. Will Mortenson, who introduced the articles of impeachment. A spokesman for Ravnsborg did not reply to a request for comment after the vote. Tim Bormann, the attorney general’s chief of staff, said his staff would “professionally dedicate ourselves” to their work while Ranvsborg is forced to take a leave.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will soon decide whether to sign off on adding harsh penalties against public schools in his state that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports. The GOP-controlled Legislature finished advancing the proposal Monday, with Senate Republicans approving the measure 26-5. The House had previously approved the bill last month. Lee, a Republican, hasn’t said publicly whether he supports the legislation. However, he signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, lawmakers decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. “What this bill does is put teeth in that legislation,” said Republican state Sen. Joey Hensley. Under the legislation headed to Lee’s desk, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of a state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Many of the state’s cattle ranchers are culling herds because of rising costs for feed and fuel, along with the looming prospect that ongoing drought conditions could worsen this summer. Consolidation of the meatpacking industry in recent years also has reduced the market power of ranchers, who sit at the very beginning of a lengthy line of processors, packers, wholesalers and retailers in bringing beef to consumers.“I tell (people) the packers are making all the money,” said Shelby Horn, general manager of Abell Livestock. Cattle prices have been climbing along with increased consumer demand for beef as the broad economy continues recovering from its pandemic-induced downturn. But they haven’t yet risen enough to offset the multiple headwinds facing many ranchers, Horn and other experts say. Texas is by far the largest producer of beef cattle in the country, with a herd that totals about 4.5 million animals – 2.3 million more than Oklahoma, the second-largest producer, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sales of beef cattle and calves in Texas generate about $8.5 billion annually and constitute the state’s top agricultural commodity. But the Texas herd shrunk 3.5% last year – or by about 160,000 head – outpacing a 2.3% decline in the U.S. beef cattle herd overall.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The state’s increasingly popular national parks will offer free entrance Saturday to kick off National Park Week. The nationwide celebration, lasting through April 24, aims to “boost awareness of the value and availability of recreational areas, encouraging people across the country to spend time in America’s treasured national parks,” according to a U.S. Senate press release. In celebration, entrance into all national parks will be free April 16. That includes Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Capitol Reef.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in the state increased by 33% in 2021 to a record number of 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported. The report released last week found that fentanyl was involved in 93% of last year’s opioid deaths, while the percentage of deaths that involved heroin dropped from 25% in 2020 to 10% last year. Cocaine was involved in 48% of all opioid-related overdose deaths, according to the report. The study also found that use of methamphetamine and the drug xylazine, a veterinary sedative, were increasingly contributing to opioid-related fatal overdoses among Vermont residents. The 2021 figure of 210 was up from 158 in 2020. The report lists opioid fatalities going back to 2010, when there were 37. Chittenden County had the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths last year at 38, while Rutland County had the highest rate of opioid deaths per 100,000 residents at 48, according to the report.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin has proposed substantial changes to a hemp bill aimed at reining in the retail sales of products containing a psychoactive form of THC, including amendments that would create new misdemeanor penalties for marijuana possession. The bill is among more than 100 pieces of legislation the Republican governor is seeking to amend, his office announced late Monday, just ahead of a deadline Youngkin faced to take action on bills sent to his desk. Lawmakers will meet April 27 to consider the governor’s proposed amendments and will also have the chance to override his vetoes. The hemp measure rewrote the definition of marijuana in state code in a way industry players said would have severely curtailed the sale of CBD products that don’t produce a high, in addition to ending the retail sales of delta-8, a chemical cousin of pot’s main intoxicating ingredient, sales of which have proliferated around the country. Youngkin’s amendments would also create a Class 2 misdemeanor offense for possession of more than 2 and less than 6 ounces of marijuana and a Class 1 misdemeanor for possession of more than 6 ounces and less than 1 pound. A 2021 law passed when Democrats were in full control of state government laid out a years­long pathway toward retail sales and legalized the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana. Anyone possessing an amount between an ounce and a pound is currently subject to a small civil fine.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A new law could reshape the way child dependency cases are handled in the state, potentially leading to more children staying with family members without those relatives being required to adopt them. Under the current practice, Washington state forces relatives to adopt children when neither parent can take care of the child. If family members don’t wish to adopt, the Department of Children, Youth and Families removes children from those placements, even if those relatives still want permanent kinship guardianship, and places the child up for adoption. “We’re removing children out of relatives’ homes, loving relatives’ homes, because they’re unwilling to adopt,” said Shrounda Selivanoff, director of public policy for the Children’s Home Society of Washington and a proponent and writer of the legislation. Children’s Home Society said the state currently “prioritizes termination” of parental rights instead of using other options, the News Tribune reports. Termination of parental rights is not required when a dependency case ends, they said. Under the new law, the state won’t be allowed to move children from their relatives’ care if those relatives don’t want to adopt. Financial assistance also has been expanded for relatives who are eligible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Free tire collection events are scheduled around the state this month. The events are 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 23 behind the Go-Mart in the Cabin Creek community in Kanawha County, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 23 at Clay County High School, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 23 at the Old Oak Ridge Trucking Lot in Elkins and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 30 at the HL Wilson Trucking Lot in Moorefield, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said. Each person may dispose of up to 10 tires. The tires must be off the rims. Only car and light truck tires are accepted, the agency said. Ongoing tire collections are held regularly in Boone, Brooke, Calhoun, Fayette, Hancock, Mason, Mercer, Monroe, Pocahontas, Putnam, Tucker, Wayne and Wyoming counties. Upcoming tire collection events are listed on the department’s website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: New data shows a sharp increase in Type 2 diabetes among children in the state, and doctors think COVID-19 could be a factor. Figures from UW Health Kids shows a nearly 200% increase in the number of cases over the past several years. Dr. Elizabeth Mann, a pediatric endocrinologist and director of the Type 2 Diabetes Program at UW Health Kids, said it’s a trend medical experts have noticed for years, but it’s taken a worrisome turn recently. “Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve just seen a sharp increase beyond what we had expected,” Mann said. In 2018, 5.8% of pediatric patients with new onset diabetes at Madison’s American Family Children’s Hospital had Type 2, a disease that primarily affects adults. In 2021, that number grew to 16.4%. And so far in 2022, 1 in 6 pediatric patients at the children’s hospital with new onset diabetes has Type 2, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “In kids, this Type 2 diabetes just acts a little bit more aggressively,” Mann said. “So it’s not only that we’re seeing Type 2 diabetes at younger ages, but it also seems to be a more severe form where kids are needing more medications and have more significant complications from it.” In Type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form overall, the pancreas produces insulin, but the body has developed a resistance to it. Mann said it’s a common misconception that Type 2 diabetes is purely a result of diet and activity levels. She said genetics and epigenetics play a big role in making people more susceptible.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State wildlife officials have detected avian influenza among wild birds in Wyoming, include Canada geese and great horned owls, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}]}

But the father didn’t learn of the incident from school officials until the following Thursday afternoon (Jan. 21). The students were not in school the Jan. 18 (Monday) due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.\n\nPOUDRE: New app helps parents track PSD buses\n\n“That’s an extremely long time to pass with that kind of thing happening,” he told the Coloradoan.\n\nHe said school officials called to tell him a disciplinary action had been taken, but no one told him about the initial incident. He was concerned to learn that his daughter rode the bus with the boy in the days following the incident.\n\n“It was a big failing,” the girl's father said. “This is quite serious, and I’m concerned with the lack of response that happened. I’m saddened that this went on, and that my daughter bears the weight of it all.”\n\nTodd Lambert, assistant superintendent of PSD's elementary schools, said the district cannot comment publicly about specific children or disciplinary actions, citing a need for student privacy.\n\nLambert told the Coloradoan on Wednesday that it's important the district is factual with parents, which can mean additional time before a parent is notified. But he also said PSD \"would like to have been more timely\" in communicating what happened with the girl's father.\n\n\"The more sensitive the issues, the more we need to make sure we've got the facts straight,\" he said. \"We have to consider the families of all students involved.\"\n\nLaurel Elementary School Principal Tommie Sue Cox did not respond to multiple interview requests by the Coloradoan.\n\nNEW SCHOOLS: PSD bond could top $350M\n\nA written statement from Lambert confirmed the district was aware of an incident on a bus on Jan. 15 and said the district reached a resolution \"that we have been told is satisfactory to both the school and families.\"\n\nThe girl's father disagreed.\n\n\"There are a lot of ideas in place, but I haven't seen any actions and that's why I'm still upset,\" he said. \"I've heard nothing concrete, I've seen nothing concrete.

That's a 19-point jump since the Smarter Balanced Assessment was first administered.\n\nIn math, it's seen a 22 percent jump, going from 20 percent proficient in 2015 to 42 percent this year.\n\nLaurel Middle School, which once was one of the lowest performing schools in the state, has also made strides. At the so-called priority school, 40 percent of students were proficient in math this year, while 55 were proficient in English.\n\nSearch: 2018 School Test Scores data\n\n\"It's very rewarding,\" Laurel Superintendent Shawn Larrimore said, adding that a lot of the district's educators have been through some very trying times as they were put on academic review and ordered to improve.\n\nRather than give up, they banded together, streamlining the district's academic focus, monitoring teacher and student performance as closely as possible and helping foster a culture of academic problem-solving.\n\n“First and foremost we want to emphasize research-based strategies, the most impactful research-based strategies,\" Larrimore said.\n\nDistrict administrators have also been spending more time in the classroom, observing teachers and giving them feedback on how to improve.\n\n“We’ve been in more than 1,000 classrooms each year for three years,\" Larrimore said.\n\nLaurel School District also uses something called Smarter Interim Assessments, the state education department said.\n\nThe interim assessments are essentially short tests that give teachers an idea of how their students are doing before the big, summative tests in March. They focus on the same content and report scores on the same scale as the Smarter Balanced Assessments, which means educators can gauge how well their students will perform.\n\nIf students don't understand specific concepts or topics, their teachers can add another lesson on those or work with students one-on-one to get them up to speed, said Theresa Bennett, director of the state Education Department's Office of Assessment.\n\nThrough the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, teachers have access to a digital library that has thousands of classroom activities and lessons they can use in their classrooms.\n\n\"The level of information that we get from the interim assessments is extremely informative,\" special education teacher Kati Hartstein said. \"We know specifically which students are struggling in what areas, and then we can go to the digital library to find lessons and resources for that specific topic.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Bennett said, the interim assessments are optional and some school districts and charter schools aren't using them.\n\n\"We encourage them to,\" she said, adding that Laurel's success might motivate them.\n\n\"They've made a lot of really great changes,\" she said of the Sussex County district.\n\nThey're not the only downstate school district to show improvement, she said.\n\nSeaford went up 5 percentage points in math this year and 4 percentage points in English. The district's Douglass Elementary School had the strongest math gains of any school in the state, the data show, a nearly 14 point increase over last year.\n\n\"Our schools have become places of learning that provide enriching experiences for every student,\" Superintendent David Perrington told the Department of Education.\n\nThe school district celebrated its success on Facebook last week. A school counselor, who felt frustrated when he first came to work for Seaford six years ago, was thrilled by the district's progress, he said.\n\n\"When I first moved to Delaware and began working at Seaford School District, to say I was unhappy would have been an understatement,\" Adam Mong said. \"Going to work every day was stressful, chaotic and left me feeling defeated and unsure about working in education. But I stuck it out, and I’m about to enter year six. And I’m sure glad I did! Sure, there are still stressful days, but now I feel supported and part of a FANTASTIC team of teachers and staff. We started at the bottom, but now we’re here! And this year, the (Fredrick Douglass Elementary School) staff is ready to BE THE ONE!\"\n\nUp in Kent County, Capital School District's Town Pointe Elementary and Fairview Elementary were both in the top 10 schools to improve in math, making double-digit gains, according to the Department of Education.\n\nTo help move the needle, the school focused on small group instruction, professional development and coaching. In English, teachers focused on academic vocabulary, Capital's Supervisor of Elementary Instruction Pam Herrera said. That means words that are traditionally used in academic dialogue and text, versus everyday conversation.\n\nTeachers also used \"mentor sentences,\" which are basically examples of good writing that students can use to improve their grammar, structure and style.\n\n“Our educators and students worked hard to achieve these successes,” Secretary of Education Susan Bunting said in a statement. “We’re seeing more schools and districts using tools provided by the state to help inform instruction and improve student learning. We will continue supporting our teachers so that we can collectively improve achievement levels across the state.”\n\nBut not everyone is happy with the way those successes were highlighted last week. While the education department touted \"steady\" achievement gains, much of the progress was below the canal, DelawareCAN Director Atnre Alleyne pointed out.\n\nHe wanted to know what was happening in New Castle County and Wilmington.\n\n“We're seeing very little change from last year’s results, and yet state leaders want us to focus on a few pockets of growth that don’t scale up to an overall system moving in the right direction,” he said in statement. “Kudos to Laurel and Seaford, and to all the classrooms that show us gains are possible — especially with students that have been traditionally poorly served. But what are our state leaders doing about the schools where 5 percent of kids or less are proficient in key areas?”\n\nStatewide scores are flat and Priority Schools — the lowest performing 5 percent of Title I schools in the state — saw marginal growth in the past two to three years, Alleyne said.\n\nIn the Christina School District, a particular point of emphasis for the Carney administration, just a third of students are proficient in math and just 40 percent are proficient in reading, he said.\n\n\n\n“All year long, the governor and state education officials have been talking about helping students in Wilmington and the Christina School District,” Alleyne said. “I find it telling they said so little today about the kids in those schools.”\n\n2018 TEST SCORES\n\nDelaware parents question value,effectiveness of state tests\n\nHere are the 7 charter schools at top and bottom of Delaware testing\n\nRoom for improvement: What to know about Delaware's 2018 state test scores\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

At one point in the fall, Superintendent Shawn Larrimore said, the town of Laurel faced a case rate and percentage of positive tests twice that of anywhere else in the state.\n\nFROM THE FALL:Delaware issues stay-at-home advisory, indoor mask order; remote learning suggested\n\nThree days into the district’s transition to hybrid learning in November, the number of teachers needing to quarantine pushed the district to halt in-person learning throughout the holidays. Shortly after, Gov. John Carney announced a statewide pause to in-person learning.\n\nIn Laurel, the past year has been “a journey of course correction and of lessons learned,” Larrimore said.\n\nNow, with a few months left in the school year, the district is deciding how to spend its most recent round of federal funding, from the recently enacted American Rescue Plan.\n\nDelaware schools have been allocated $410.7 million in federal funding.\n\nWhen the district received earlier rounds of federal funding, “we were so focused on mitigation efforts and just getting the doors open,” said Assistant Superintendent Ashley Giska.\n\nNow, the district hopes to use the money to improve learning acceleration, address disparities, and support the social-emotional well-being of students after a year of uncertainty and trauma.\n\n“Our goal is not March 2020. That’s not the bar,” Cardona said. “Our kids deserve more.”\n\nIn recent weeks, President Joe Biden has pushed states to prioritize vaccinating teachers and school staff. In Delaware, all school staff who wanted the vaccine had gotten their first shot as of mid-March.\n\nPfizer announced Wednesday morning that clinical trials have shown its two-dose vaccine to be safe and 100% effective for children 12 and older. Expanding use of the vaccine awaits approval from the federal government.\n\nCardona called the news “promising,” especially for families who otherwise wouldn’t have felt comfortable sending their children to school.\n\n“As a father, when I saw that report this morning, I thought about my own children,\" he said, \"and I thought about the progress that we’re making in this country toward recovering.\"\n\nNatalia Alamdari covers education for The News Journal.

He asked to use vacation time through July 29, or, if that's not possible, to immediately resign effective Monday.\n\n\"I am proud of the accomplishments that have been made in early childhood,\" Francis said in his letter, thanking the staff of his department, Assistant Superintendent Karen Branham and JCPS Superintendent Donna Hargens and the school board.\n\nFrancis leaves amid a restructuring of the early childhood department and shortly following the district winning its bid to continue providing early childhood education through the federal Head Start program with a nearly $75 million, 5-year grant.\n\nDuring his short tenure as early childhood director, Francis was investigated twice for unprofessional behavior to his staff and others.\n\nThe most recent JCPS investigation into his behavior, related to a Head Start policy council meeting in March, determined that Francis was condescending and disrespectful to members of the committee.\n\nA JCPS spokeswoman said that JCPS officials spoke with Francis during his yearly evaluation about the March meeting - where some council attendees allege that Francis yelled at the members and made accusations that his integrity was being impugned.\n\nJCPS spokeswoman Allison Martin said that no formal disciplinary action was taken against Francis related to the March meeting and subsequent investigation.\n\nThat investigation appears to have been a continuation of a \"pattern of unacceptable behavior\" that the district had previously identified when it gave him a 10-day suspension in December for allegedly intimidating one of his employees.\n\nIn that instance, Francis allegedly engaged in a shouting match with one of his employees that was viewed as disrespectful and intimidating, according to a letter that notified him of his suspension.\n\nThat letter referenced at least one previous incident of unacceptable behavior that was in Francis' file.\n\nIn 2010, Francis was suspended for five days and ordered to take anger and conflict management classes while he was working in JCPS' human resources department after he allegedly failed to check the certification of a teacher transfer and was \"insubordinate when (he) refused (a) directive to withdraw the transfer,\" according to district documents.\n\nBefore coming to JCPS in 2006, Francis was a superintendent of a few school districts, most recently Laurel County Schools in Kentucky. He served there for about a year before resigning, according to news reports.\n\nThe Laurel County Board of Education, in a 2006 vote to terminate Francis' contract, submitted a 20-page document that alleged in part that he \"harassed and intimidated school employees\" and that there was an \"environment of fear and intimidation that looms over the heads of school employees.\"\n\nFrancis came to JCPS after Laurel County but left in 2010 to work in Tennessee. He returned in 2014 as a compliance specialist before being promoted to the director of early childhood.\n\nReporter Allison Ross can be reached at 502-582-4241.

School Board member Bridget Ziegler then shared an image of the flyer on social media, saying it was inappropriate.

Apparently, she still has a job,\" she said. \"This woke teacher needs (to be) fired.\"\n\nBanned Books Week\n\nOn Sunday, the county shared a post on Facebook promoting Banned Books Week at the library. Banned Books Week has been celebrated at libraries nationally for more than 40 years, and it isn't the first time the county has recognized it.\n\nThe social media post included a link to the 10 most challenged books of 2021. The No. 1 challenged book, \"Gender Queer,\" is a coming-of-age memoir of an adolescent's journey with gender identity.\n\nThe county edited the post hours later to remove the link to the list.\n\nChristian Ziegler, a county commissioner and husband of School Board member Bridget Ziegler, took to Facebook to criticize the original post.\n\n\"This is insane, totally inappropriate, and I cannot imagine our county staff EVER considering, let alone posting, a recommendation for this type of material,\" he wrote in the post.\n\n\"Gender Queer,\" which is in five of the district's public libraries, is a graphic novel that contains depictions of sex. The book was also named as one of the books in a thrown-out lawsuit against the school district over alleged sexually-explicit materials in schools.\n\nBanned Books Week came up during Tuesday's public comment section as well. Lisa Schurr, one of the founders of Support our Schools, emphasized the week during her time. She said she wanted to donate The Diary of Anne Frank, but couldn't because of the district's freeze on all book donations and purchases.\n\nFollow Herald-Tribune Education Reporter Steven Walker on Twitter at @swalker_7.
