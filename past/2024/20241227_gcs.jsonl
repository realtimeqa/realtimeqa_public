The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/15/delaware-governors-race-whos-endorsing-the-candidates/74780427007/", "title": "Delaware governor's race: Who's endorsing the candidates?", "text": "As the primary election grows closer, the candidates for Delaware governor are ramping up their campaigns.\n\nThe Democratic candidates – Lt.

Mike Ramone and Bobby Williamson – will each be facing a three-way race for First State voters next month.\n\nThe primary elections are set to take place on Tuesday, Sept. 10.\n\nThe winners of the Democratic and Republican primaries will then face each other in the general election, which is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nHere’s what we know about who has endorsed these candidates so far.\n\nUpcoming:Candidates for governor, congress to face off in Delaware Journalism Collaborative debates\n\nWho endorses Bethany Hall-Long?\n\nHall-Long has served as the state’s Lieutenant Governor since 2017, after spending over a decade in both the state Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nIf elected, Hall-Long aims to promote universal childcare and early education, increase access to affordable housing and expand the state’s workforce.\n\nSince announcing her candidacy, Hall-Long has received endorsements from several state officials – including current Governor John Carney – and several unions across the First State, including the Delaware AFL-CIO and the Delaware State Education Association (DSEA).\n\nAccording to DSEA President Stephanie Ingram, the organization supports Hall-Long in part because of her previous experience and dedication to improving the lives of all First State residents – specifically those of children and working families.\n\n“Lt. Gov Hall-Long shares our commitment to serving all of Delaware's students, and we are confident she will keep her promise to engage and partner with public school educators, parents and community members as we work together to strengthen public education in the First State,” Ingram, a fourth-grade teacher in the Colonial School District, said in a statement.\n\nAnd amid the release of a forensic audit of Hall-Long’s campaign finances this past July, many, including Senators Stephanie Hansen and Nicole Poore, have reaffirmed their support.\n\n“[Hall-Long] has the depth and breadth of experience in state government, and in the issues that matter most to Delawareans, that we need,” Hansen, who represents Middletown, said in a statement.\n\nPoore, who represents New Castle, also remarked on Hall-Long’s compassion and commitment in her years of public service, and how her track record should be driving this election, as opposed to simply merits.\n\nSen. Jack Walsh, who represents Christiana, who also endorsed Hall-Long, agreed, noting how she has a \"very deep understanding\" of Delaware's political landscape and a clear vision for its future.\n\nWho endorses Matt Meyer?\n\nA born-and-raised First Stater, Meyer was previously a small business owner and public school math teacher. He has served as New Castle County Executive since 2017.\n\nIf elected, Meyer intends to increase public safety, expand access to housing and healthcare and raise funding for public schools across the First State.\n\nOn Aug. 2, the American-Ethiopian Public Affairs Committee (AEPAC) unanimously voted to endorse Meyer’s campaign, specifically noting the executive’s previous business experience in Africa as a key factor for their support.\n\n“Given his life’s journey, from serving as the founder of a small business in Kenya to working as a diplomat in a war zone to teaching grade school math in our state’s classrooms, we are certain Matt Meyer is the right leader for Delaware and its growing Ethiopian American Community,” AEPAC executive chairman Mesfin Tegenu said in a press release that same day.\n\nThe AEPAC could not be reached for comment.\n\nFormer state chairman of the state Democratic Party Erik Raser-Schramm also endorsed Meyer, emphasizing his ability to consider new solutions and adapt to unexpected changes.\n\n“Sometimes when people are at a crossroads, they stop, or sometimes they turn back,” Raser-Schramm wrote in an op-ed for Delaware Online this past July. “As someone who worked with Meyer, I saw a leader who time and time again faced challenges head on, arrived at crossroads and saw the opportunity in adversity.”\n\nIn a statement to the press, Meyer's campaign also mentioned receiving support from the Delaware Democratic Party Pride Caucus.\n\nThe caucus also could not be reached for comment.\n\nRelated:This PAC says it doesn’t support candidates, but runs ad that lauds Matt Meyer\n\nWho endorses Collin O'Mara?\n\nThe first Democrat to file his candidacy, O’Mara currently serves as president and CEO of the non-profit National Wildlife Federation.\n\nAccording to his campaign website, if elected, O’Mara pledges to improve the state public education system, create sustainable jobs and help Delaware become the first state in the nation to achieve 100% clean energy and zero-net emissions.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 1 release, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund and National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Action Fund collectively announced their endorsement for O’Mara.\n\nAs LCV Action Fund Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said in a statement, O’Mara has been a “tireless advocate” for both the environment and surrounding communities, and emphasized the need to have leaders who push for a cleaner, more sustainable future for all Delawareans.\n\nPresident and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund Manish Bapna echoed Sittenfeld’s sentiments, noting how O’Mara “knows how to bring people together to get big things done” amid an ongoing climate crisis, and will be considered “one of the nation’s greenest governors.”\n\nThat same day, LCV Action Fund, the NRDC Action Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) Action Votes also announced an independent expenditure effort to help elect O’Mara in the Democratic primary election.\n\nAlong with other groups, these organizations intend to help “boost O’Mara’s candidacy” amid the ongoing race, including investing in running ad campaigns on both television and digital platforms.\n\nThe first endorsement for O’Mara’s campaign came from the Delaware Working Families Party this past spring.\n\nO'Mara's campaign also named additional endorsements from the Friends of the Earth Action Fund and the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund.\n\nAn in-depth look:Who has Working Families endorsed for Delaware governor, General Assembly?\n\nWho is endorsing GOP candidates?\n\nWith a Democratic dominance in state politics, the Republican slate of candidates for governor has fewer endorsements.\n\nThe Delaware Republican Party has thrown its support to political veteran Ramone. Ramone nor the Delaware Republican Party could not be reached for further comment.\n\nRamone, who represents Pike Creek, has held his seat in the House since 2008, and first announced his intentions to run in May instead of seeking reelection.\n\nWith no endorsements, Price asks those interested in contributing to his campaign to instead donate to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nA retired New York Police Department officer and Lewes resident, Price has a platform that includes advocating for insurance reform, expanding career readiness and vocational pathways and increasing the presence of law enforcement to combat violent crime.\n\nWilliamson appears to have support from community members, but no major endorsements.\n\nA lifelong Bridgeville resident and self-described businessman, Williamson intends to “advocate for law enforcement, public safety and reduction in crime,” support the growth of small businesses and defend protections under the Second Amendment, according to his campaign website.\n\nMore:Delaware's governor race gets crowded with 3-way primary for Republicans, Democrats\n\nOlivia Montes covers state government and community impact for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

Others shoot up drugs to forget.\n\n\"I really just wanted to sleep my life away,\" admits Aubrey Heary, who blew her half-million-dollar Bradley settlement check on heroin, luxury cars and extravagant gifts for friends and family. Now 33, she is fighting to take a more active role in the life of her 3-year-old son, who was adopted by her parents when she lost custody.\n\nIn Lewes, Bradley's demolished BayBees Pediatrics site is still on the market, and his clapboard home has been gutted. Residents say they're not trying to whitewash the serial child molester's stain on the community, but they'd prefer if Bradley's name was never mentioned again –– in the news media or in casual conversation.\n\n\"We'd like to get past that,\" explains Pat DeBiasse, a ruddy-faced plumber, and firefighter who moved to the area with his wife years after Bradley had been put behind bars.\n\nThe DeBiasses purchased Bradley's Savannah Road home last year for $300,000, less than half its market value, from the church whose parking lot abuts the property.\n\nBethel United Methodist was gifted the three-story house with its sagging gable roof after no buyers surfaced and the bank wanted it off the books. The local Historic Preservation Commission barred anyone from leveling the nearly century-old, structure.\n\nThe DeBiasses are investing $200,000 in a down-to-the-studs overhaul to create an airy three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath oasis located less than a mile from the beach. The home sits across the street from the Lewes firehouse, where Pat, a volunteer firefighter, can hop on the first truck after the bell.\n\nAsked what he plans to salvage, Pat points to an ornate banister and glides a dusty hand across it. The wood is weathered from the palms of previous inhabitants, including Bradley and his four children.\n\nBeyond the coin-operated Buzz Lightyear ride that warned \"Do not leave child unattended,\" Bradley grabbed the tiny hands of his patients, some of them still in diapers, plying them with promises of popsicles and Barbie dolls.\n\nAs parents paid their bills, he led their infants to hidden, video-monitored rooms. There, he brazenly violated them, muzzling their shrieks and sedating them with nitrous oxide. He didn't discriminate against those who had autism or suffered from hearing loss.\n\nAshen-faced children nearly suffocated from being forced to perform oral sex on him. One girl was raped on video four times before she turned 2.\n\nIn the end, a total of more than 1,400 identified victims and other patients who were too young to talk shared an unprecedented $123 million settlement paid by Bradley's employer, Beebe Medical Center; hospital insurers; the Medical Society of Delaware; and other defendants.\n\nWhen they reach age 18, Bradley's victims become old enough to claim their \"blood money,\" as Heary calls it. Dozens already have, trying to appear upbeat about college or job prospects as they sign papers, lawyers involved in the case say. Payments range from a few thousand dollars to more than $400,000 in the most heinous abuse cases.\n\nThe News Journal recently interviewed victims, their families, attorneys, child advocates, health care executives and state regulators involved in the landmark case and its aftermath.\n\nArchive:Coverage of the Earl Bradley case\n\nThe collateral damage is far-reaching.\n\nMarriages have dissolved, as one guilt-ridden parent turned against the other. Lawyers and police detectives, who were forced to watch 13 hours of Bradley's homemade video tapes, still hear the blood-curdling screams of children being molested, sodomized and raped.\n\nOf the 86 patients recorded, the average age was 3. The youngest was 3 months old.\n\nAll five Sussex County forensic interviewers, responsible for rehashing details with victims over several months, quit after the job was done, said Randall Williams, executive director of the Children's Advocacy Center of Delaware.\n\n\"It did take an immense emotional toll …,\" he said. \"During that period, everyone knew how important it was to keep going.\"\n\nOne of Delaware's most prominent child advocates, then-Attorney General Beau Biden, passed up an opportunity to run for his father's U.S. Senate seat to successfully prosecute Bradley. Biden died of brain cancer in 2015, before he had the chance to run for governor of his home state. His family foundation enshrined his legacy of protecting victims of child abuse.\n\nAt the urging of Biden and others, state legislators swiftly passed a package of patient protection bills in 2010 that made it easier to suspend the license of a doctor who poses a \"clear and immediate danger\" and increases the fines levied against individuals who fail to report suspicious conduct.\n\nThat action had no effect on a handful of local doctors, who were implicated in the Bradley case for not reporting his behavior. All still hold active medical licenses with no disciplinary actions, according to state records.\n\nAmong them is James P. Marvel Jr., a prominent orthopedic surgeon who retired from Beebe last year. A state-commissioned report found that Marvel, two-time president of the state Medical Society and the grandson of Beebe's co-founder, defended Bradley's record to police detectives and failed to investigate multiple allegations of the pediatrician's inappropriate behavior with young girls while he led the medical trade association.\n\nMarvel has repeatedly refused News Journal requests for interviews. He could not be reached for comment recently.\n\nSince Bradley's conviction, no other Delaware doctor has been reported to the state Division of Professional Regulation for engaging in sexually inappropriate behavior with a child, division director David Mangler said. Three doctors, however, have had their licenses revoked for inappropriate sexual conduct with adult women, according to state records.\n\nNobody in the law enforcement or medical communities alerted Delaware's Board of Medical Practice to Bradley's inappropriate contact with girls despite a 1996 investigation by Beebe, a 2004 complaint to the state medical society reported by Bradley's half-sister and former office assistant Lynda Barnes, and two police investigations in 2005 and 2008 overseen by the Attorney General's Office.\n\nMangler noted that there was confusion at the time about which agency handled the licensing of doctors. The board has since educated the community about its function and improved coordination with law enforcement, he said.\n\n\"I do believe that the board is much more sensitive to the fact that they have a legal and moral obligation to the public,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Beebe's sprawling complex, where Bradley previously served as chief of pediatrics, has rebounded from near-bankruptcy and recently announced a $180 million expansion, including a new Women's and Children's Department.\n\nAfter being accused in the civil lawsuit of dereliction of duty and medical negligence in connection with Bradley, the hospital instituted a robust internal reporting and oversight process to respond to allegations of doctor abuse, according to senior executives. Beebe, like other hospitals, now requires that a chaperone, such as a parent, be present before a pediatrician can conduct an intimate exam on a patient under age 16.\n\nThe Lewes medical center's settlement contribution represented more than half of its net income at the time. Beebe's final $100,000 payment is due in November.\n\n\"You can never assume that because you have a respected physician in the community that everybody thinks the world of, that person can't do something terrible,\" Jeffrey Fried, Beebe president, and CEO, said recently.\n\nSTORY:Beebe Healthcare receives $10 million donation\n\nToday, more than 4,700 people — a minority of them pedophiles — are listed on Delaware's sex offender registry, which represents the third-highest rate per capita in the nation, according to research by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n\nPedophilia, a sexual attraction to prepubescents, is defined as a mental illness — but only when acted on, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nBradley was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia to a mother who was a raging alcoholic and a father who stockpiled photographs of naked girls, according to an earlier News Journal interview with a Bradley relative. At age 87, Bradley's uncle was convicted of lewd behavior and exposing himself to young girls in central Pennsylvania.\n\nA member of the Latin honor society and rifle club, Bradley did not crack a smile in his senior yearbook photo. Years later, his Temple University medical school yearbook page was decorated with cartoon doodles, along with a photo of Bradley holding an unidentified girl about 2 years old. She was not his daughter.\n\nBradley would have his own daughter in 1984, after marrying a woman who graduated with degrees in nursing and law. By the early 1990s, he established a solo practice near his home and also treated patients at Frankford Hospital in Northeast Philadephia.\n\nIn 1994, a mother discovered Bradley with his hand down the front of her 21-month-old's diaper in a darkened toy room. She called him a \"sick bastard\" and filed a police report. Bradley accused the mom of \"extortion\" and soon set up shop in Milford and Lewes.\n\nPost-Bradley, Delaware vaulted from its ranking as one of the worst states for disciplining doctors for misconduct to leading the nation in patient protection reforms. The \"Bradley bills\" increased the penalty for failing to report to the state medical board potential abuse by a doctor — $10,000 for the first offense and $50,000 for a repeat offender.\n\nBut problems persist. Nationwide, unscrupulous doctors continue to benefit from a self-regulating profession and secretive disciplinary process, a 2016 Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found. That same system shielded Bradley from at least eight accusations of sexual misconduct from 1994 to 2009.\n\nAs many as 1 out of 4 girls and 1 out of 6 boys will experience some form of sexual abuse before the age of 18, according to research by child advocacy organizations.\n\nNinety percent of child victims of abuse know their abuser; 60 percent are sexually abused by a person the family trusts.\n\nThe same year that Bradley received the maximum sentence allowed, the Diocese of Wilmington and several religious orders throughout the diocese distributed more than $110 million to 152 adult survivors who were sexually abused by area Catholic priests. Tens of millions more were paid in confidential settlements with dozens of other childhood rape survivors who had been abused in families; other churches; nonprofit groups; or in public, private or religious schools in Delaware.\n\nIn 2012, after the Wilmington Diocese emerged from bankruptcy, Pennsylvania State University began compensating child molestation victims of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. The toll is a quarter-billion dollars and climbing.\n\nVigilance is key to preventing child sex abuse, experts agree. Yet inadequate funding has hampered the Biden Foundation's mission to educate at least 5 percent of the First State's population in steps they can take to prevent, recognize and react responsibly to the crime, according to foundation CEO Patricia Dailey Lewis. So far, the foundation has trained about 25,000 people, she said, including the University of Delaware and Delaware City police departments and Wilmington police recruits.\n\nSTORY: The front line of child abuse in Delaware\n\nA state mandate for all publicly funded schools to provide age-appropriate child sex abuse prevention training has been put on hold for up to two years while government agencies attempt to coordinate a curriculum.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, former Gov. Jack Markell signed Erin's Law, named for Erin Merryn, an Illinois-born survivor of sexual abuse. The law required all publicly funded schools to provide child sexual abuse education for kindergarteners through six-graders, as well as related training for teachers and other staff members, starting this school year.\n\nBut less than a month before the academic year kicked off, the General Assembly amended the statute to extend the training deadline to the 2019-2020 school year. That gave state agencies more time to coordinate the three-hour child abuse trainings with suicide prevention, anti-bullying programs and more, according to Department of Education spokeswoman Susan Haberstroh.\n\nHaberstroh said some districts already offer child abuse prevention programs, but she couldn't provide a list because the department doesn't track it.\n\n\"All deadlines are being met,\" she said.\n\nAt the same time, the number of reported child abuse incidents statewide continues to grow, nearly doubling to almost 21,000 over the last six years. The number of substantiated incidents has stayed mostly flat at about 1,100 cases, according to child advocates, who blame a shortage of case workers.\n\nState officials counter that what matters most is accurately analyzing each situation and reacting appropriately, with the goal of keeping the family whole whenever possible.\n\nEarlier this year, the Children's Advocacy Center, which collects evidence in criminal child abuse cases, sustained a nearly $100,000 state budget cut to its three locations. To make up the difference, leaders froze one of six forensic interviewer positions and are rolling back operating hours.\n\nCiting Bradley's \"overall impact\" on inmates and correctional officers, the state moved the 63-year-old from James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna to a state prison in southern Connecticut last year.\n\nThere, Bradley continues to fire off handwritten, well-crafted court appeals.\n\nPublicly, he has expressed no remorse for his crimes.\n\nHis victims wish they, too, could rescript the narrative.\n\nUnlike the perpetrator, their ending hasn't been written yet.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nTO REPORT CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT\n\nIn Delaware, call (800) 292-9582 or visit iseethesigns.org.

The event, titled \"Firewall for Freedom,\" outlined the key issues that the ACLU plans to address under the upcoming administration.\n\nMORE:'A blatant attempt': Rep-Elect Sarah McBride responds to transgender bathroom ban measure\n\n\"We have a monumental task ahead of us,\" said ACLU of Delaware Executive Director Mike Brickner.\n\nThe ACLU of Delaware highlighted three major areas they intend to focus on: immigration, reproductive rights and education – all of which have been major themes of Trump's campaign.\n\nProtecting immigrants in Delaware\n\nCharito Calvachi-Mateyko, immigrants' rights organizer with the ACLU of Delaware, echoed many of the fears that immigrants across the nation have recently expressed. At the same time, she urged undocumented immigrants in Delaware to not let those fears keep them from accessing the public benefits and resources available to them.\n\nThe previous Trump administration caused a continuous \"chilling effect\" on immigrants utilizing \"critical services\" like Medicaid, Calvachi-Mateyko said.\n\nCalvachi-Mateyko also asked lawmakers to take steps to mitigate the impact of potential actions by the incoming administration, like the proposed mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. This could take the shape of suing the federal government to prevent such policies from going into effect.\n\nAffirming reproductive rights\n\nThe second item on the ACLU of Delaware's agenda was one that has been a major priority for the organization since the overturning of Roe v. Wade: access to abortions. While abortion remains legal in the First State, Campaign Manager Helen Salita said more protections are paramount.\n\nSalita said she expects a Trump presidency will bring new attacks on reproductive rights, as well as gender-affirming care. It's why the ACLU is urging state lawmakers to expand shield laws that protect the privacy of individuals accessing these types of healthcare.\n\nREAD UP:Delaware lawmakers targeted IVF, pregnancy centers and abortion access with these bills\n\nDelaware law currently protects people from retaliation and targeting by states where these types of services are illegal. However, Salita said the law does not extend those same protections when it comes to the federal government – a fact that the ACLU is urging Delawareans to press lawmakers to change.\n\nPublic education\n\nDecisions about the future of public education in the U.S. and the rights afforded to students were the final areas of concern outlined by the ACLU at Thursday's meeting. The issue intersects with many others also on the docket, such as the rights of LGBTQ and immigrant students.\n\nDelaware's anti-discrimination laws apply to schools, Brickner said; but with a changing political climate, it may be important to remind districts about the protections that remain in place.\n\nMORE TO READ:What does Trump's Agenda47 say about education? What to know after Linda McMahon's selection\n\nBrickner also raised the issue of the attempts to limit or influence how certain topics, such as American history, are taught in schools. While he acknowledged much of the advocacy on that front is being done at the national level, he said it was important for Delaware to make its positions clear.\n\n\"We must not sit idly by while (Trump's) agenda trounces our rights and liberties,\" Brickner said. \"Our state officials can take action right now to help mitigate the harm he will cause and truly allow the First State to be a firewall for freedom.\"\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

He has a different group of people around him, and he’s prepared to do significant damage to our democracy – and to the LGBTQ community.”\n\nSince early last year, Trump has outlined the gender policy changes he would make or seek as president as part of Agenda 47, his official campaign platform. Most aim to curb the rights of transgender youth, their health providers and educators.\n\n“They definitely want to deliver on the promises they were making,” said Isa Noyola, a trans Latina who serves as deputy director of the Transgender Law Center, a national civil rights organization based in Oakland, California. “They will go in with a lot of precision and effort to deliver for their base. They know the inner workings of the bureaucracy enough to now be very targeted, and they’re not wasting time. The attacks are going to come swiftly.”\n\nThe community believes it has reason to fear another Trump term. Under his previous administration, LGBTQ+ health care protections were rolled back and transgender individuals were banned from military service, though that ruling was later reversed by the Biden administration.\n\nAttacking the trans community was part of Trump’s game plan, Renna said, a hallmark of his campaign rallies and speeches. While such rhetoric appealed to Christian conservatives, it also included numerous false or outlandish statements about transgender issues.\n\n“The transgender thing is incredible,” Trump said in an August interview with Florida-based group Moms 4 Liberty. “Think of it: Your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation. The school decides what’s going to happen with your child.” The claim was later debunked.\n\nEarlier that month, he falsely labeled as men two Olympic boxing gold medalists who were both born and raised as women.\n\n“It’s not surprising that he found the community a convenient target,” Renna said. “The community is very vulnerable, and the public still needs to be educated as to who our trans and nonbinary siblings are. But the rhetoric he puts out there creates a permissible climate of hate.”\n\nA survey conducted late last year by the Trevor Project, a national LGBTQ+ youth support agency, found that 90% of LGBTQ+ youth felt the political climate negatively affected their wellbeing. The agency announced Friday that demand for its crisis services saw a nearly 700% increase the day after the election compared to weeks prior, and some regional organizations such as Missouri’s GLO Center offered extended hours for “post-election decompression.”\n\n“When someone says the horrific, defamatory and inaccurate things he is saying, it has an impact,” Renna said.\n\nJami Taylor, a professor of political science and public administration at Ohio’s University of Toledo and a trans woman, described the current atmosphere as “an existential crisis for the trans community.”\n\n“There’s a lot of fear, and it is warranted,” Taylor said. “It’s bad, and there’s no sugarcoating that. You can’t look at people and say it’s going to be OK when you’re not sure it’s going to be OK.”\n\nWhat do the election results mean for you?Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nWhat Trump has said about gender identity\n\nIn his Agenda 47 platform, Trump says he “will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies” on gender affirming care “on Day One.”\n\nGender affirming care, endorsed by major health groups like the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, includes using hormones to delay puberty and promote physical development that align with a child’s gender identity.\n\nAbout 5% of young adults identify as transgender or nonbinary, about three times the rate of the general population, according to a Pew Research Center poll released in 2022. Data compiled by the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles indicates about 300,000 youth ages 13 to 17 identity as transgender nationwide.\n\nAmong Trump’s proposals are passing laws banning what he calls “child sexual mutilation,” eliminating health care providers offering gender-affirming care for youth from Medicare or Medicaid eligibility and supporting private lawsuits against doctors who offer such care.\n\nTrump said he would also push Congress to pass laws establishing male and female as the only federally recognized genders, to be assigned at birth; promote school education focused on the traditional nuclear family; and defund schools whose staff members discuss gender identity with students.\n\nTaylor said she expects Trump to be more aggressive on transgender rights in his second term compared to his first, with gender affirming care and restrictions on transgender sports participation among the incoming administration’s priorities.\n\n“I suspect they’re going to go significantly further based on their rhetoric,” she said.\n\nWhile the transgender community has previously weathered election campaign targeting, a fundraising letter distributed this week by the national group Advocates for Transgender Equality said this cycle was different given the Trump campaign’s intense focus on gender identity issues.\n\n“He targeted our existence,” the letter read. “He targeted our rights. He promised he would continue to target trans people if he won – and we know he will keep his promise.”\n\nPreelection survey data collected by Data for Progress indicated 74% of Americans were turned off by anti-transgender political ads, but “an overwhelming number of candidates who ran those ads won,” Taylor said. “Winning is the ultimate metric. Correlation isn’t causality, but still, you look at the scoreboard.”\n\nNoyola, of the Transgender Law Center, said the community “is exhausted” as a result of its use as a tool to push Trump’s agenda.\n\n“The rhetoric and vitriol have been relentless – the rallies, the messaging, the way he’s used transgender identity as a wedge to instill fear,” she said.\n\nNow, the mood has shifted to worry about what will happen next.\n\nWhat will a Trump administration actually do?\n\nTaylor, of the University of Toledo, said she finds Trump’s proposal to limit federal recognition of gender identities most frightening and questions whether it’s even possible given historical state control over vital records.\n\n“Federalism is going to come into play,” she said. “The Trump administration can’t just wave a magic wand and get rid of trans people.”\n\nAnd such policy changes, she said, can be also become a liability should they go too far.\n\n“I do think the administration runs the risk of overplaying their hand,” Taylor said. “If they go after things like identity recognition and health care for trans adults, that’s going to be harder to defend.”\n\nIn other words, while it’s one thing to wield such issues as a campaign strategy, it’s quite another to actually target a population through government policy.\n\n“People don’t like to see other people victimized by government,” Taylor said. “Once government policy starts going after people, it starts to be less popular.”\n\nJen Grosshandler, executive director and co-founder of GenderCool, a Chicago-area-based national group uplifting the positive experiences of transgender youth, agrees. She believes the primary impetus for Trump’s election was the economy.\n\n“Everyday folks do not want their elected officials trying to hold back the rights of folks raising transgender kids,” said Grosshandler, parent of an 18-year-old transgender daughter. “We know they may try to get some of this done, but there will be an inflection point where you will see everyday people say, stop focusing on this and focus on why we elected you.”\n\nIn the meantime, she said she expects to see more families of transgender youth move to Illinois.\n\n“We’re in an extraordinarily supportive state, and we’re probably going to welcome more and more families,” Grosshandler said. “It’s really sad that that is going to be a reality. But good people are everywhere and the majority of them do not want to get up in the business of how we are raising our children. I really don’t think it behooves anyone to spend their time trying to hold back families like ours.”\n\nResults of a Pew Research Center survey released in 2022 showed Americans closely divided on laws restricting instruction about gender identity in elementary schools, with 41% in favor and 38% opposed. About 2 in 10 respondents didn’t feel strongly either way.\n\nAnd while 58% said they favored laws requiring trans athletes to compete on teams aligned with the sex they were assigned at birth, 64% said they opposed discriminating against trans people in jobs, housing and public spaces.\n\nTransgender community prepares 'for the long haul'\n\nNoyola said she is inspired by the community’s resiliency in the face of constant attack. It continued even after Trump left office as state legislatures nationwide saw hundreds of bills proposed over the last four years aimed at restricting trans rights, particularly for youth.\n\nAccording to translegislation.com, 2023 marked the fourth consecutive record-breaking year for anti-trans bills considered in the U.S., including bans on gender-affirming care for youth and criminalization of physicians who provide such care.\n\n“We will survive this administration like we did last time,” Noyola said. “Just as the Trump administration has learned, we have learned how to organize ourselves and we know the kind of stamina it requires from us for the long haul.”\n\nRenna, of the National LGBTQ Task Force, said advocacy organizations are not naive and have long been planning for various election scenarios.\n\n“We’re shocked at the scope of Trump’s win, but not shocked it was possible,” she said. “How fast these things will happen, we don’t know. But as a community, we owe it to each other to be prepared.”\n\nRenna thinks those who voted for Trump based on their wallets will soon realize the consequences of their actions.\n\n“I think there will be voter regret,” she said. “My greatest hope is that no one election can destroy this great democracy. I think people will fight back.”\n\nNoyola said the community already is fighting. The first Trump administration, she said, inspired a wave of trans leaders and the resistance has only grown.\n\n“They want to see us cower and will try to weaken our movement, but if anything it’s going to bolster our organizing,” she said. “It’s called for us to show up in not just token ways.”\n\nAnd despite the gloom, Noyola said, this week’s election brought signs of progress, with transgender persons making political inroads: Delaware’s Sarah McBride became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress, while in Iowa, Aime Wichtendahl became the state’s first openly transgender lawmaker in a statehouse that has been hostile to transgender rights.\n\n“We’re in all aspects of public life,” Noyola said. “Even though this administration will double down in its attacks against us, we remain unwavering. We’re not going away.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/election-2024-the-key-races-to-watch-in-all-50-states/75674463007/", "title": "Election 2024: The key races to watch in all 50 states", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nElection Day will be about more than just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nThough the presidential election is commanding the most attention, a host of down-ballot races across the country will determine control of Congress, the direction of state legislatures and major policy battles on issues such as abortion rights and marijuana.\n\nHouse races in states like Arizona, Alaska and California will determine control of the control of the 435-seat House, where Democrats seek to upend the current 220-212 GOP majority.

Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2017/05/12/public-hearing-address-delaware-prison-working-conditions-concerns/320245001/", "title": "Public hearing to address Delaware prison working conditions ...", "text": "Members of the Delaware Senate Labor Committee hope for some answers Monday about the working and safety conditions inside the state's prisons.\n\nA public hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. in the Pusey and Jones Room at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. The testimony will focus on the working conditions and safety inside Delaware prisons, with a focus on James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, according to Sen. Bob Marshall, D-Wilmington West, chair of the committee.\n\nMarshall subpoenaed state Department of Correction Commissioner Perry Phelps and former Vaughn Warden David Pierce to testify. Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, and Michael Begatto, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 81, have also been called upon to speak.\n\nBut their testimony isn't expected to touch on the events of Feb. 1, when DOC correctional officer Lt. Steven Floyd St. was killed by inmates who took control of Building C at Vaughn for 18 hours.\n\nFULL COVERAGE:Prison Hostage Crisis\n\nWHO IS INVESTIGATING:Ex-judge recuses self from prison takeover investigation\n\nWHAT THEY SAY:Correctional officers go public with safety concerns\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the event on Feb. 1,\" Marshall said. \"This is focusing on Jan. 31 and back. ... but all matters relating to Corrections and practices and culture will be discussed.\"\n\nPhelps, however, has been named in a federal lawsuit against him and multiple other current and former officials with the state. The lawsuit, filed by attorneys representing the widow of Floyd and five other prison employees held hostage, says Delaware officials put money before safety for more than 16 years.\n\nThe state and the DOC, both of which have also been named in the lawsuit, don't comment on pending litigation. Others named in the lawsuit have either declined to comment or not returned calls for comment.\n\nThe criminal investigation into what happened inside Vaughn prison on Feb. 1 remains ongoing and officials have said little more on details involving the case. No one has been charged with crimes.\n\nAn independent investigation by two retired Delaware judges into what led to the uprising inside Vaughn remains ongoing, as well, with a report due by June 1.\n\nBut Marshall said he can't control what members of the committee ask those called to testify or others who choose to attend the hearing and offer thoughts.\n\n\"I have no way to control comments made,\" he said.\n\nState Attorney General Matt Denn and the Rev. Christopher Bullock, chairman of the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice, were also invited to speak on the prison conditions.\n\nBullock led a small group of activists Thursday from Legislative Hall to Woodburn, the official governor's mansion in Dover, in hopes of reaching Gov. John Carney's ears regarding issues inside the prison. Flanked by mothers, wives and family members of inmates inside Delaware correctional institutions, he called for better conditions and the need for more educational programs for inmates.\n\nBullock has long pushed for better health care inside Delaware prisons for years and has re-upped his effort in the wake of cries from inmates who say they are not treated fairly.\n\n\"The Department of Correction needs a complete overhaul,\" Bullock said at the rally. \"This model is no longer viable.\"\n\nLeaders like Marshall share similar thoughts given the lack of information surrounding the prison system, especially information provided to the Senate Labor Committee, he said.\n\n\"The key here is the 'Delaware normal way' has not worked or doesn't appear to be working,\" he said. \"Political solutions have not solved issues relating to security, safety and even the culture that inmates live in.\"\n\nMembers of the public are invited to attend the hearing.\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Thursday, Oct. 31.\n\nThere's less than a week until Election Day, and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focused on the crucial battlegrounds set to determine the race for the White House.\n\nTrump is holding two rallies on Wednesday, one in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and another in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Harris is holding rallies in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Raleigh, North Carolina, before traveling to the University Of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Wednesday also reacted to President Joe Biden appearing to refer to Trump's supporters as “garbage.\"\n\nHarris told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland that while the president has clarified his comments, she does not agree with criticisms of voters based on who they are supporting in the election, including Trump's insults against voters on the left. Congressional Democrats running in tight 2024 races across the country also criticized Biden's “garbage” remark.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage from the campaign trail.\n\nHarris rallies in Wisconsin; Nevada, Arizona next\n\nHarris told an overflow crowd in Madison, Wisconsin on Wednesday night that Donald Trump is “unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power.”\n\n“I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” Harris said at the Alliant Energy Center, reciting lines she gave in her “closing argument” speech the previous night at the Ellipse in Washington. “He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table.\"\n\nThe rally in Wisconsin, one of the seven critical battleground states in the election, took Harris back to the city she grew up in from the ages 3 to 5. An overflow crowd of more than 13,000 attended, the Harris campaign said.\n\n“Just like the Wisconsin state motto tells us: we will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future,” Harris said.\n\nHarris is set to travel Thursday to Arizona and Nevada for campaign rallies in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. She then returns from the brief western swing back to Wisconsin for get-out-the-vote events Friday in Outagamie County and Milwaukee.\n\nIn Madison, Harris gave what’s become her standard stump speech in the final days of the campaign, railing on Trump as a vengeful former president focused only a m himself and casting herself as a president “for all Americans” who would enter the White House with a “to-do list” of priorities. The folk rock band Mumford & Sons performed ahead of Harris' speech.\n\nAs she spoke, Harris faced multiple interruptions from pro-Palestinian protesters who oppose Israel’s war against Hamas – a common occurrence during her rallies.\n\n“We all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out as soon as possible, and I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known,” Harris said.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump again sidesteps committing to election results\n\nFrom the seat of a personalized garbage truck in Wisconsin, Trump told reporters Wednesday he would accept the results of the election – “if they find no evidence of cheating.”\n\nThe former president has for years made false claims about fraud impacting the 2020 presidential election, allegations that were rejected by courts across the country.\n\n“I hope that we’re going to declare a victory,” Trump said during remarks to the press before his speech in Green Bay tonight.\n\n“I think we’re going to have a big enough victory to maybe have it that night,” he added.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris says gender, race won't be why she gets votes\n\nIf she wins next week’s election, Vice President Kamala Harris would be several firsts: the first woman elected president. The first Black female president. And the first Asian American president.\n\nBut in an interview with ABC News Wednesday, Harris said she doesn’t expect the history-making component of her candidacy to be the reason people vote for her.\n\n\"I’m fully aware of my gender and race, let’s start with that,” Harris said with a laugh. “I know that it will be very significant in terms of the glass ceiling will be broken, but I do not expect that anyone is going to vote for me because of my gender or race.\"\n\n“It has to be because I earned their vote with a plan to make their lives better,” Harris said.\n\nHarris was also asked whether she believes being a female candidate has subjected her to a “double-standard” in her race against Trump. Former first lady Michelle Obama, during a campaign rally week, said the media and others are holding Harris to a “higher standard than her opponent.”\n\n“I need to earn the vote of the people, and that is the work I'm doing,” Harris responded.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump in Wisconsin: ‘How do you like my garbage truck?’\n\nDonald Trump arrived at his event in Wisconsin in the passenger seat of a garbage truck, specially designed with a Trump 2024 sign on the side. It's a reference to a comment Joe Biden made on Tuesday in which he appeared to call Trump supporters “garbage.”\n\n“How do you like my garbage truck?” Trump asked reporters ahead of his rally in Green Bay Wednesday. “This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden.”\n\nTaking questions from the press before his speech on Wednesday, Trump again denied knowing comedian Tony Hinchcliffe. Hinchcliffe over the weekend performed at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally and called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage.” Biden on Tuesday said his comment was only a reference to Hinchcliffe's insulting joke.\n\nStill, Trump has repeatedly insulted Democratic leaders and voters for months on the campaign trail, including calling some Democrats \"the enemy from within\" and more dangerous than the country's foreign adversaries. He has also described Harris and her allies as \"Marxists,\" communists,\" and \"low IQ\" individuals.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump makes 'garbage' his primary campaign issue\n\nSo far, \"garbage\" has been one of Trump's main themes in the final days of the campaign.\n\nTrump brought up Biden's reference to \"garbage\" right off at the bat at his Green Bay rally, and denounced the Harris and Biden campaigns for other insults hurled at the Republican nominee and his supporters, from \"fascist\" to \"Nazi.\"\n\n\"They treat our whole campaign like garbage,\" Trump told the Wisconsin crowd.\n\nTrump, who has described his opponents as \"Marxists\" and \"communists,\" also used the terms \"Crooked Joe\" and \"Lyin' Kamala\" and accused them of running a \"corrupt administration.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nTrump will declare victory if he loses, Liz Cheney alleges\n\nFormer Rep. Liz Cheney said Wednesday the country should prepare for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to declare victory on Nov. 5, even if he loses.\n\n“We all need to be ready for the fact that on election night, he's going to declare victory, even though he will not be the victor,” she said.\n\nAs USA TODAY reported in an exclusive story this week, a Trump-aligned group is has telegraphed that it is planning to sue over this year's election results, according to one of group's founders.\n\nCheney, a lifelong Republican, made the comments during a conversation hosted at George Washington University that covered the role of media and rise of disinformation. She along with her father — former Vice President Dick Cheney — has endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 White House race after years of speaking out against Trump.\n\nShe co-chaired a House select committee’s investigating of Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, but eventually lost her primary battle to a Trump-backed challenger.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHarris says campaign is 'ready' for premature Trump claims\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said her campaign and team of lawyers are prepared if Republican nominee Donald Trump declares victory prematurely on election night before all ballots are counted in a repeat of the 2020 election.\n\n“We are, sadly, ready if he does,” Harris said in an interview Wednesday with ABC News. “If we know that he is actually manipulating the press and attempting to manipulate the consensus of the American people based on fiction … we're prepared to respond.”\n\nWith mail-ballots that skewed toward Democrats still uncounted, Trump declared victory on election night 2020 based on preliminary leads he built from in-person voting. But when the mail ballots were finally counted, he lost the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to Joe Biden and lost the election.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Trump lobbed countless false accusations of voter fraud to try to overturn the election. And on Jan. 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters tried to stop Congress’ count of electoral votes during an attack at the Capitol.\n\n“I think he is capable of anything, as proven by what he did on January 6,” Harris said when asked whether she is concerned Trump might against interfere with Congress’ certification of the election results.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump inflates number of supporters\n\nTrump is overestimating the number of his supporters who are alleged \"garbage.\"\n\n“I have to begin by saying 250 million Americans are not garbage,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThere are roughly 350 million Americans (including those not registered or too young to vote), according to the United States Census population clock. The voting age population is estimated at more than 262 million, according to the Census Bureau, but not all of them are Trump supporters.\n\nIn 2020, Trump won about 47% of American voters or just over 74 million voters.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and David Jackson\n\nCornel West asks Supreme Court to make PA polling sites advertise him as a write-in option\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Cornel West has asked the Supreme Court to make Pennsylvania polling sites let voters know they can write in his name on Election Day.\n\nWest filed that emergency request days before Tuesday's election after failing to get on the ballot in the battleground state. He is more likely to draw votes away from Vice President Kamala Harris than from former President Donald Trump.\n\nPennsylvania's top court backed the secretary of state's decision that West lacked the required affidavits for most of his presidential electors so was ineligible.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n'No Obamacare:' Mike Johnson says Republicans will overhaul health care if Trump wins\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told a crowd of supporters Monday night that there will be \"no Obamacare\" if former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans win the upcoming election on Nov. 5.\n\nRepublicans will propose “massive reform” to the Affordable Care Act if they win control of both chambers in Congress and the presidency, Johnson, R-La., said at a campaign event for Republican House candidate Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania on Monday evening.\n\n“Health-care reform’s going to be a big part of the agenda,” Johnson said about Republicans' plans. He added that the GOP wants to take a “blowtorch to the regulatory state,” with healthcare among the key sectors they plan to focus on.\n\nRepublican leaders have floated repealing the ACA – a law that provides insurance coverage to millions of Americans and protects those with pre-existing conditions – since it was enacted by Democrats in Congress and President Barack Obama in 2010. Trump promised during the 2016 campaign to eliminate the law.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n‘How dare he’: Brett Favre criticized Joe Biden 'garbage' comment\n\nFootball star Brett Favre appeared at a Trump rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, ahead of the former president’s remarks. While on stage, Favre responded to Biden’s comments on Tuesday in which he appeared to refer to Trump supporters as “garbage.”\n\n“I can assure you we’re not garbage. How dare he say that?” Favre said.\n\nBiden quickly said he was only referring to a comedian who made insulting jokes at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally over the weekend.\n\nFavre, 55, played for the Green Bay Packers for 16 seasons, retiring from football in 2010. In his speech Wednesday he touted Trump’s record as the reason for his support.\n\n“It’s time to bench Kamala and put in the starting quarterback,” Favre set, setting off chants of “Brett!

Pennsylvania has 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state ,and polls show it tied between Trump and Kamala Harris.\n\n\"The Trump campaign seems to be setting the stage for a repeat of 2020,\" Penn State Behrend associate political science professor Robert Speel told USA TODAY. \"If the Electoral College depends on Kamala Harris winning Pennsylvania, I think the Trump campaign is laying some groundwork to question the results from Pennsylvania.\"\n\n–Sarah D. Wire\n\nHunter Biden says another Donald Trump presidency would be 'the end of America'\n\nThe president’s son, Hunter Biden, painted a bleak picture when asked what he worries about most this election season: “Losing our democracy to a fascist minority,” Hunter Biden told Politico in written statements Wednesday.\n\n“This is not a normal election where we are arguing about tax rates or school vouchers,” he added. “A second Donald Trump presidency is potentially the end of America as we’ve known it.”\n\nHis interview with Politico marks Hunter Biden’s first comments about the 2024 presidential election, since his father, Joe Biden, ended his bid for reelection over the summer. The embattled member of the first family referenced Harris’ friendship with Joe Biden’s other son, Beau Biden, who died in 2015. Harris served as California’s attorney general while Beau Biden was in the same role in Delaware.\n\n“President Biden chose Kamala Harris to be his vice president and passed the torch to her because of her dedication to service, her unyielding pursuit of justice and her profound decency,” Hunter Biden told Politico. “These are the qualities that my brother so admired about Harris when he was alive, and I know he would be so proud of her now.”\n\nHunter Biden faces sentencing on gun charges and tax charges, in separate cases, later this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris tells Gaza protesters election is about ‘your right to be heard’\n\nKamala Harris pushed back Wednesday at pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted her speech during a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, telling them that the election is about “your right to be heard.”\n\n“Let me say something,” Harris said as Gaza protesters shouted over her remarks. \"We are six days away from an election, and ours is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard.\n\n“That is what is on the line in this election. Look, everybody has the right to be heard, but right now I am speaking,” Harris said, turning to a line she’s previously used to respond to protesters.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Nov. 5 election, interruptions from demonstrators protesting the humanitarian toll of the Israel-Hamas war, particularly Israel's actions in Gaza, have been a regular occurrent for the vice president on the campaign trail. Harris often reiterates her support for an immediate cease-fire agreement and the return of hostages in Gaza, but this time she opted to turn the focus to the election.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHarris reiterates she'll be 'president for all Americans'\n\nIn her speech at a Pennsylvania rally Wednesday, Kamala Harris pledged to be a \"president for all Americans,\" emphasizing dark rhetoric from Donald Trump about dealing with political enemies. Harris' address also came as Joe Biden sparked backlash Tuesday night after appearing to call Trump's supporters \"garbage.\"\n\n\"At this particular moment, it should be emphasized that unlike Donald Trump I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy from within,\" Harris told the crowd in Harrisburg.\n\nThe vice president made a similar pitch in North Carolina earlier on Wedneday. She has disagreed with the president and \"any criticism of people based on who they vote for.\"\n\n\"(Trump) wants to put them in jail; I'll give them a seat at the table,\" Harris said in Pennsylvania.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nPuerto Rican reggaeton star Nicky Jam withdraws Trump endorsement\n\nPuerto Rican reggaeton star Nicky Jam withdrew his support on Wednesday for Donald Trump in next week's election, the latest fallout after a comedian insulted Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage\" during the Republican presidential nominee's Sunday rally in New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn a video post on Instagram, Jam said he decided to endorse Trump last month because he thought the Republican nominee would be better for the economy.\n\n\"Never in my life would I have imagined that a month later a comedian would come and insult my country and speak so poorly about my country,\" said Jam, speaking in Spanish from the seat of a vehicle. \"For that reason, I'm withdrawing my support for Donald Trump and am stepping aside from any politics. Puerto Rico will be respected.\"\n\nSeveral Puerto Rican stars, including Grammy-winning artists Bad Bunny, Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, have condemned the \"garbage\" insult, which came from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by the stage name Kill Tony. In addition to calling Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage,\" Hinchcliffe made crude jokes about Latino and Black people.\n\nPuerto Ricans form a growing segment of the population in Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes up for grabs, the most of any of the seven battleground states. The insult has ignited a backlash in Allentown, Pa., the state's third largest city that's more than half Latino.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin endorses Donald Trump for president\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to set foot on the moon, endorsed Donald Trump for president on Wednesday, saying that he was impressed with how human space exploration was “elevated” under the former president’s administration.\n\n“Under President Trump's first term, America saw a revitalized interest in space,” Aldrin said in a statement. “His Administration reignited national efforts to get back to the Moon, and push on to Mars – programs that continue today.”\n\nAldrin cited Trump’s executive order reinstating the National Space Council and him signing into law the creation of a U.S. Space Force.\n\nHe said that more broadly, the nation is facing “major economic challenges, stability in our communities, and rule of law concerns.”\n\n“For me, for the future of our Nation, to meet enormous challenges, and for the proven policy accomplishments above, I believe the nation is best served by voting for Donald J. Trump,” he wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTop anti-abortion group contacting millions of voters\n\nCanvassers from one of the nation’s largest abortion opponents, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, have visited 4 million homes persuading voters to cast a ballot for Donald Trump, the group confirmed in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAbortion opponents have largely stuck with the former president over Kamala Harris, though Trump angered some conservative groups when he announced earlier this year he believes abortion rights or restrictions should be left up to individual states.\n\nAbortion has ranked as one of this year’s top voter issues, two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The decision upturned a constitutional right to abortion and returned decisions about abortion accessibility to individual states.\n\nIn their efforts “to protect life across America,” SBA Pro-Life America aims to reach 10 million voters in 2024 from states they have identified as battlegrounds: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris keeps small lead over Trump in final Economist/YouGov election poll\n\nHarris is leading Trump by more than one percentage point in a new Economist/YouGov out Wednesday, further indicating a close race.\n\nThe poll of 1,446 registered voters showed 47% of registered voters either planned to vote for Harris or had already voted for her, while 46% indicated they supported Trump. Due to rounding, the gap is actually closer to two percentage points, the poll stated. Harris' lead among registered voters is within the poll's margin of error (± 3.4 percentage points).\n\nThe poll was conducted from Oct. 26 to Oct. 29 and is the final Economist/YouGov poll planned before the election. Forty percent of respondents said they had already voted.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nResearchers: 16 counties where election deniers could try to refuse to certify a White House winner\n\nResearchers at the nonprofit advocacy group Informing Democracy are keeping an eye on 16 counties nationwide they consider a top concern for potentially refuse to certify the presidential election or deadlock to prevent certification.\n\nThe deadline for states to certify a winner is Dec. 11. Courts have traditionally ruled certification is a ceremonial function that election boards can’t refuse. But Informing Democracy researchers identified the counties where election boards have members who have denied elections or promoted misinformation serving as a majority or as half of an evenly divided board.\n\nLindsey Miller, the group’s director of strategic research, Cochise and Mojave counties in Arizona; Alcona, Bay, Kalamazoo, Tuscola and Wayne counties in Michigan; Washoe County in Nevada; Pickaway and Portage counties in Ohio; and Berks, Bradford, Butler, Fayette, Lancaster and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.\n\n“Those are areas that we think are a top concern,” Miller said. “The places we are most concerned about are where election deniers are concentrated.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nBiden will attend successor’s inauguration in January\n\nPresident Joe Biden will attend his successor’s inauguration in January regardless of whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump wins next week’s election, the White House said Wednesday.\n\n“This president believes in the peaceful transfer of power, and that’s what you’re going to see this president do,” White House spokesman Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nBiden recognizes that the American people want to see a peaceful transfer of power, and attending the inauguration of the new president is part of that process, Jean-Pierre said. “He is certainly going to partake,” she said.\n\nOutgoing presidents traditionally have attended their successor’s swearing-in ceremony on the steps of the Capitol on Jan. 20. Trump broke that tradition in 2021 and refused to attend Biden’s inauguration.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nHarris emphasize ‘common ground’ after Biden ‘garbage’ comments\n\nVice President Kamala Harris renewed her vow to work with Americans across the aisle and find common ground following President Joe Biden’s comments where he referred to former President Donald Trump's supporters as “garbage.”\n\n“North Carolina, I am asking for your vote. I am asking for your vote and here is my pledge to you, as your president, I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face,” said at a get-out-the-vote rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday. “I am not looking to score political points, I am looking to make progress.”\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Harris pledged she would be a president to all who supported her - and all who didn’t - as she made a pitch to undecided voters. Harris on Wednesday ahead of her North Carolina rally said she disagreed with Biden’s comments and “with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.”\n\nThroughout the North Carolina rally, Harris underscored how she would be willing to work with people who don’t agree with her policies.\n\nWhen interrupted by pro-Palestine protests, Harris responded: \"Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table.\"\n\n- Rebecca Morin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump denounces 'garbage' attacks - and launches attacks of his own\n\nDuring a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, it took Donald Trump a little more than ten minutes to denounce President Biden's \"garbage\" comment, telling supporters that's what he and Harris really think of them.\n\n\"You can't lead America if you don't love Americans,\" Trump told supporters in Rocky Mount, N.C. \"And you can't be president if you hate the American people ... and there's a lot of hatred.\"\n\nSeeking to boomerang the Democratic attacks, Trump also reminded the cheering crowd that their opponents have described them as Nazis and fascists. Trump has described Harris and her allies as \"Marxists,\" communists,\" and \"low IQ\" individuals.\n\nTrump began the Rocky Mount event by alluding to the attacks and describing opponents as \"horrible people.\" He also told his followers: \"Some people you just can't get along with.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nWho will win the election? Kamala Harris, according to election historian\n\nRenowned election forecaster Allan Lichtman has predicted correctly the last nine out of 10 presidential elections, and he's standing by his prediction that Kamala Harris will win the election next week.\n\nLichtman said on his YouTube channel Tuesday night that despite polls showing a night-bitingly close race, his prediction isn't wavering.\n\n\"Nothing has changed to change my prediction that I made on Sept. 5,\" Lichtman said, \"in defiance of the polls.\"\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nMichigan, Maine Democrats in tight races criticize Biden 'garbage' remark\n\nA pair of congressional Democrats running in tight 2024 races became the latest members of President Joe Biden’s party on Wednesday to criticize his “garbage” remark about Donald Trump's supporters.\n\nElissa Slotkin, the Democratic Senate candidate running in Michigan, and Rep. Jared Golden, who is running for a fourth term in Maine, both took issue with the comments from the sitting president of the United States.\n\n“In terms of what President Biden said yesterday, he shouldn’t have said it. I mean, it’s inappropriate. And, for me, I just think that kind of talk is the last thing we need in our politics,” Slotkin told WWJ Newsradio, a local Michigan radio station.\n\nWriting on X, Golden also raised concern with Biden's comments. \"Any elected official or candidate who calls Americans or America 'garbage' is flat out wrong. We don’t need leaders to add fuel to partisan fires that are dividing us.\"\n\n\"Americans are bound together as citizens of our great country,\" added Golden in a follow-up tweet. \"What we need most is to work together toward common goals and to overcome common challenges for the good of our communities and country.\"\n\nGolden represents a large rural district encompassing central and northern Maine. His race against Republican challenger Austin Theriault, a former NASCAR driver, is considered a toss-up, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nSlotkin, a three-term U.S. congresswoman, is running against Republican Mike Rogers for a Senate seat left open by retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Numerous polls show Slotkin leading by a few percentage points against Rogers.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro have also sought to distance themselves from Biden's remarks with just days to go before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nBiden on Tuesday addressed offensive comments that comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made at Trump’s rally on Sunday, where he called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.\"\n\nThe president during a virtual event with Voto Latino disavowed those comments and went on to say: “The only garbage I see floating out there are his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American,” according to a transcript released by the White House.\n\nThe president and the White House quickly clarified that the Biden was talking about Hinchcliffe specifically.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Rebecca Morin\n\nYouth turnout to break records?\n\nVoter-registration nonprofit Vote.org says that 80% of the nearly 2 million voters it helped register in this election cycle are aged 18-34, a key demographic courted by politicians. Because young people typically vote at lower rates than older Americans, they represent a significant pool of votes that can reshape elections if they participate.\n\n\"This surge of engagement shows that voters know what’s at stake in this election and intend to have their say at the ballot box,\" said Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey.\n\nVote.org worked with both large and small influencers, from social media personalities at historically Black colleges and universities all the way up to pop superstar Taylor Swift, who helped spark a record-breaking 35,000 people to sign up on National Voter Registration Day this fall, a 22.5% increase jump in voter registrations from 2023.\n\nIn 2020, about 50% of people aged 18-29 voted, according to Tufts University's Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. In comparison, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 75% of people aged 75 and older voted in that election.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Hailey said restrictive voting measures passed in many states - from making it harder to vote by mail to limiting polling locations and raising registration requirements - suggests there are politicians who want fewer people to participate in the 2024 election.\n\nYoung people see through that, Hailey said, adding: \"If your vote didn’t matter, then there wouldn't be so many efforts to make it harder to vote. The close races we’re seeing up and down the ballot highlight the power each and every voter holds: when you cast your vote, you’re taking a significant step towards deciding the future of your community and our democracy.\"\n\n- Trevor Hughes\n\nWalz pressed on whether the campaign is speaking enough to men, Arab Americans\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz said in a Wednesday interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that the Harris campaign's message to both men and Arab Americans, particularly in Michigan, will prove successful on Nov. 5.\n\n“I think it is working and on Election Day, it will work when we win this election,\" Walz, the two-term Minnesota governor, said.\n\nMany Arab Americans in Michigan have been hesitant to support Harris and Walz after the Biden’s administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. An exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Harris and Trump are deadlocked in Michigan, 47% to 47%, among 500 likely voters.\n\n“I think the message here is, for those folks, is that there's one ticket here that is going to find the pathway to stabilization in the Middle East, but also one that is going to respect their human rights here, push back against Islamophobia, make sure that they have the right to fully engage in our system here,” Walz said on CBS.\n\nThe Harris campaign also is trying to address a notable gender gap. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that women decisively Harris, 53% to 36%, while men overwhelmingly support Trump, 53% to 37%.\n\nAsked about the Harris campaign's message to male voters, Walz replied, “For the women in their lives that they love, their wives, their daughters, their partners, whoever it may be, this election, really, their lives are at stake.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGeorgia polling places could be ‘ghost town’ on Election Day after heavy early voting\n\nGeorgia election officials say turnout is running so high with early in-person voting and absentee ballot returns that polling places could be a “ghost town” on Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nNearly 3.1 million people voted in person by Wednesday morning, according to Blake Evans, the state elections director. About 200,000 absentee ballots have been accepted, out of 341,520 issued, he said.\n\nOfficials urged anyone who still has an absentee ballot to deliver it to an election office or drop box rather than mail it.\n\nThe 45.4% turnout is about two-thirds of the entire turnout in 2020, according to Gabe Sterling, chief operating officer for the state secretary of state. The 2020 turnout was second only to 1960 turnout, when the voting population was much smaller before the Voting Rights Act, he said.\n\n“There is a possibility it could be a ghost town on Election Day,” Sterling said. “We’re going to have a record turnout, more than likely.\"\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nVoter roll lawsuits offer insight into how Trump could challenge 2024 election results\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has declined to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election, and lawsuits challenging state voter rolls provide a roadmap of how he could fight the outcome.\n\nThe lawsuits build on election fraud claims that Trump has been making – without proof – since his first presidential run.\n\nIn late November of 2016, Trump claimed without evidence that he only lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton that month because millions of people voted illegally. At his Jan. 6, 2021, \"Stop the Steal\" rally, Trump similarly alleged that noncitizens – who aren't eligible to vote in federal elections – cast 36,000 ballots in Arizona in 2020.\n\nIn this election, the Trump campaign is again suggesting the election may be rigged by noncitizen voting.\n\n\"While radical Democrats have allowed non-citizen voting in California and D.C., states such as Walz's Minnesota have no system to keep non-citizens off the rolls, resulting in an open door to illegal voting,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nSeveral lawsuits over voter rolls have been dismissed, and some were filed within 90 days of the Nov. 5 election, which is a period under the National Voter Registration Act when states generally can't purge groups from their registration lists.\n\nFor some, those realities raise the question of why the lawsuits are being filed at all, and especially – in many cases – so close to an election.\n\n\"The natural conclusion is it's to set the stage for claiming an election was stolen,\" David Becker, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, which works with Republican and Democratic election officials to strengthen confidence in elections, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nConservative super PAC posts Trump ads on tents for homeless population\n\nRed tents offering temporary housing picturing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are popping up in the Los Angeles area.\n\n\"Hate this tent?

It's \"Red Shelter Initiative\" is aimed at \"combating homelessness\" by placing \"high-quality, weather-resistant tents across the city\" according to the PAC's website. It also says its trying to \"increase conservative representation in the media\" and re-elect Trump to the White House.\n\n\"We are committed to working with our donors, to ensure all money is held until a satisfying political game-plan to end the danger for both the homeless and housed is reach by our elected officials. For now, citizens are safer with a barrier of a tent between them.\"\n\nPosts circulating online of the tents are pushing back on the project, claiming that political advertising on these shelters is exploitive.\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger endorses Harris\n\nFormer California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he will vote for the Democratic ticket in the presidential election.\n\n\"I will always be an American before I am a Republican,\" he wrote in a social media post Wednesday. \"That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\"\n\nThe professional bodybuilder and actor turned GOP politician served as governor from 2003 to 2011. California is Harris' home state.\n\nSchwarzenegger encouraged his followers to vote even if they disagree with him, but gave reasons he will not support former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"I want to move forward as a country, and even though I have plenty of disagreements with their platform, I think the only way to do that is with Harris and Walz.\"\n\n--Rachel Barber\n\nGeorgia secretary of state 'ready to defend the results'\n\nGeorgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who famously resisted former President Donald Trump's call to \"find\" nearly 12,000 votes to overturn President Joe Biden's victory in the state in 2020, reiterated his commitment Wednesday to upholding the results this election.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Raffensperger said his grandson lost a playoff baseball game the night before, but the whole team accepted the loss with grace.\n\n\"Just as an American, I think that's wonderful, because I think that's what America is,\" Raffensperger said.\n\n\"I have no control over human behavior,\" Raffensperger went on. \"I will hold both parties accountable to you, the voters of Georgia, and I stand ready to defend the results of the election with election officials all across the states. We will do our job.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHarris breaks with Biden over 'garbage' comment about Trump supporters\n\nVice President Kamala Harris disagreed with President Joe Biden's comments where he appeared to refer to former President Donald Trump's supporters as “garbage,\" saying that while the president clarified his remarks, she does not agree with criticisms of voters based on who they're supporting.\n\n“First of all he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,\" she told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Harris pointed to her speech on the Ellipse on Tuesday evening where she pledged to be a president for all Americans as she courted undecided voters.\n\n\"I've been very clear with the American public, I respect the challenges that people face,\" Harris added. “I am serious, what I mean when elected president, I will represent all Americans, including folks who don't vote for me and address their needs and their desires.”\n\nBiden on Tuesday addressed offensive comments that comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made at Trump’s rally on Sunday, where he called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.\" Biden during a virtual event with Voto Latino disavowed those comments and went on to say: “The only garbage I see floating out there are his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American,” according to a transcript released by the White House.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nWalz dismisses concerns that Democrats’ recent rhetoric undercuts unity message\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz insisted in a Wednesday interview that his comparison of Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally to a Nazi event and Biden’s recent ‘garbage’ comment do not undercut the Harris campaign’s message of unity.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Walz said on 'CBS Mornings.'\n\n“I've represented rural areas. I've represented Democrats, Republicans, independent, same thing with the Vice President,” added Walz, a former Minnesota congressman and now the state's two-term governor.\n\nWalz argued that Trump’s rhetoric is responsible for causing division in the country. “President Biden was very clear that he's speaking about the rhetoric we heard at that so it doesn't undermine it,” Walz said.\n\nBiden’s comments come after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe said Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage” at the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally. Biden said during a zoom call with a nonprofit organization that the only “garbage” he saw “floating out there” were “his supporter's,” though it was not clear at the time whether he was referring to Hinchcliffe or all of Trump’s supporters. Many Republicans interpreted it as the latter.\n\nWalz also rebutted reports that Biden is being sidelined by the campaign.\n\n“President Biden's the president the United States. He's running it. Vice President Harris is our candidate and will be the next president. And I think there's two different positions there,” Walz said.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nJosh Shapiro, top Harris surrogate, reacts to Biden’s ‘garbage’ remark\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a top surrogate for Harris, reacted to the fallout stemming from President Joe Biden’s “garbage” comment on Tuesday night that many Republicans claimed were directed towards Donald Trump’s fans\n\nBiden’s comments come after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe said Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage” at the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally. Biden said during a zoom call with a nonprofit organization that the only “garbage” he saw “floating out there” were “his supporter's,” though it was not clear at the time whether he was referring to Hinchcliffe or all of Trump’s supporters.\n\nMany Republicans interpreted it as the latter. Biden later posted on X, formerly Twitter, that he “referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage.”\n\n“I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support,” Shapiro said on CNN’s “The Source” when asked about Biden’s remark.\n\nThe White House had attempted to clean up Biden’s comment, saying that he was referring to the rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as “garbage.” Pressed on whether he thinks Biden needs to come out and clarify his comment, Shapiro said that the president “will decide what he wants to say.”\n\n“It’s certainly not words that I would choose and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and not attacking supporters of either candidate,” Shapiro said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWalz distances Harris campaign from Biden’s comment: 'We want everyone'\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, on Tuesday said Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is clear they want all Americans to be included in their campaign.\n\n“Let’s be very clear: The vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this,” Walz said during an interview with ABC News.\n\nThe comments come after President Joe Biden came under fire for comments he made while denouncing an offensive joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico during a rally for Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden over the weekend.\n\nBiden said: “The only garbage I see floating out there are his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American,” according to a transcript released by the White House. Biden and the White House later clarified that the president was talking about “the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by” Hinchcliffe specifically.\n\nWalz said that Biden had “clarified his remark.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nDemocrats launch final-hour anti-Trump swing state ads\n\nAfter Harris gave her closing argument to voters last night in Washington, Democrats are launching their own final message this morning, calling Trump “unfit to lead.” The Democratic National Committee purchased full page advertisements in 25 local newspapers across this year’s seven battleground states.\n\nIn it, the words “Unhinged. Unstable. Unchecked.” appear above Trump’s mugshot, taken in Atlanta in August.\n\n“In the final week of the election, Democrats are not leaving any stone unturned, reminding voters in key battleground states that their vote means the difference between chaos and revenge with Donald Trump, or a New Way Forward with Vice President Harris,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump bashes Kamala Harris, avoids talk of racism and Jan. 6\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump practiced the politics of avoidance Tuesday in Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring an 80-minute rally in Allentown, Trump did not discuss allegations of racism stemming from his Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden, but did praise Latino and Puerto Rican voters.\n\nNor did he discuss at length Vice President Kamala Harris' competing speech accusing him of being a threat to democracy and abetting the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nInstead, he maintained his standard attacks on Harris and urged supporters to get out and vote. \"We're going to win the whole deal,\" Trump said.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nWhite House releases transcript of Biden remarks denouncing offensive jokes\n\nJoe Biden denounced offensive jokes that podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe made about Puerto Rico during Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally over the weekend, but the president also made a comment some prominent Republicans quickly called insulting to the former president's supporters.\n\n“Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage,’” Biden said during a Zoom call Voto Latino, an organization encouraging Latino and Hispanic youth to become politically engaged. The president said the Puerto Rican people he knew in his home state of Delaware were “good, decent, honorable people.”\n\nBiden added that the only “garbage” he saw “floating out there” were supporters, though it was unclear if he was referring just to Hinchcliffe or all of Trump’s fans. The White House released a transcript Tuesday night attempting to clarify that the president was referring to Hinchcliffe's act.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes closing argument at site of Trump's Jan. 6 rally\n\nWith the White House illuminated behind her, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris made a plea to undecided voters on Tuesday night to \"turn the page\" on Donald Trump, as she sought to rewrite the legacy of the Ellipse from the Republican's Jan. 6 speech that preceded an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHarris' address at times touched on the optimistic approach she said she'd bring to the presidency. Swinging away at Trump, the Democratic presidential candidate also blasted her Republican opponent for cultivating turmoil when he was in the White House.\n\n- Rebecca Morin and Francesca Chambers\n\nHarris and Trump deadlocked in Michigan\n\nLess than a week before Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are deadlocked in the battleground state of Michigan, according to an exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll.\n\nHarris and Trump are tied, 47% to 47%, a statewide poll of 500 likely voters shows.

To the southwest, the light brown and white sand beach extends all the way to a cluster of cottages on the shore at Quonochontaug.\n\nTo the north, behind a grass- and thicket-covered dune where piping plovers nest, is Ninigret Pond, the largest salt pond in the state. To the south, far on the ocean’s horizon, the Mohegan Bluffs jut out at the tip of Block Island.\n\nFrom where I stood, the views, in all directions, are what make Rhode Island so special.\n\nLast October, after I walked along the beach at Quonochontaug – pronounced kwana-ka-taug – which lies southwest of East Beach, I had hoped to get back to the state’s southern shore sometime soon. But the cold winter and rainy, overcast spring kept me on inland trails through forests, old farmland and along riverbanks.\n\nWhen the sun finally broke through and temperatures climbed into the 70s, I headed to East Beach, a long, narrow, easterly extension of Quonochontaug Neck that forms a barrier beach separating the Atlantic Ocean from Ninigret Pond.\n\nA pine-lined path brightened by beach roses\n\nOn a warm, May morning, two hiking buddies and I set out from a small state lot (visitors have to pay a fee during the summer; see below) and walked to the head of a sandy road for vehicles. We noted the sign: “Caution 4 Wheel Drive Only CRMC Permit Required.”\n\nThe wide road of soft sand heads east and is lined by short pitch pines, with cones on the branches and along the path. We also spotted rabbit paw prints in the sand and white-flowered woody bushes, called beach plums. In other spots, white and purple rugosa roses, commonly called beach roses, had started to bloom.\n\nA light breeze gave us a whiff of the ocean.\n\nWhat kind of birds will you see there?\n\nA single-engine plane droned overhead but didn’t drown out the tweets in the bushes. I’m no bird expert, but hikers report sighting a variety of birds in different seasons.\n\nIn the spring and summer, piping plovers and least terns nest on the beach and the dunes. At other times, red crossbills, white-winged crossbills, redpolls and pine siskins can be found feeding in the pines.\n\nIn the fall, northern gannets feed offshore, swallows flock to the area and cave swallows sometimes migrate to the beach.\n\nDuring the winter, yellow-rumped warblers and red-breasted nuthatches feed among the tree trunks. Northern harriers also fly through the area, and short-eared owls can be seen.\n\nWhile we walked, openings in the thickets along the road on the right offered a peek at the clean, deserted beach and ocean and, on the left, to Ninigret Pond, one of the coastal lagoons that can be found from Westerly to Narragansett.\n\nThe Native leader who gave Ninigret Pond its name\n\nThe pond is named for Ninigret, (1600-1676), who was a sachem of the Niantic and Narragansett tribes. The Indigenous people once fished, hunted and lived in villages along the shoreline.\n\nNow there are cottages on the far shore of the pond, and we spotted a barge on the water where oyster farmers were pulling up traps. The pond is dotted with small islands and fringed with coves, channels, salt marshes and tidal pools. I dug out my map and located Foster Cove and Coon Cove at the edge of the Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge on the other side of the pond. Governors Island was a little further east.\n\nContinuing on, the road is lined in places by wooden storm fences and stretches of yellow ropes that set off sections of the dunes. A sign reads:\n\n“Do Not Enter\n\nThese Endangered Birds, their Nests and Eggs are Protected\n\nU.S. Federal Law.”\n\nAt one point, a U.S Fish & Wildlife Service jeep drove up behind us. We stepped off the road, and the driver waved.\n\nAs she passed, I tried to step in the deep jeep treads in the soft sand, but I felt my legs getting tired. I hope that was just from trudging through the soft sand, and not age.\n\nThe road went by several lots where vehicles could pull off. At one spot, an angler practiced casting near a camper parked nearby.\n\nWhen the road ended after about 2.5 miles, we took a trail through scrub and brambles and noted the signs that marked federal property, part of the Ninigret refuge. At one point, the trail led down to the beach, and we got our first look at the breachway in the distance.\n\nCharlestown Breachway, a channel from pond to ocean\n\nThe flat beach started to tilt uphill to the dunes, and the walking was a little uneven, but there were sites to see. After a half mile, we stopped to inspect some wooden wreckage that was built of thick beams and had washed up on the shore. At first I thought the remains must have been a pier, but then I noted that the ends of the beams were curved and wondered if it may have been some type of a barge.\n\nJust ahead are two parallel, hundred-yard lines of huge boulders that form the Charlestown Breachway. A section of one of the jetties had been broken by crashing waves.\n\nThe outgoing tide was draining through the channel from Ninigret Pond to the north to the ocean, creating a fast-running current. Upstream, a kayaker put in and was navigating a lagoon at the edge of the waterway. As we paused for a break, a motorboat sped up the breachway from the ocean and headed toward the pond. Three young men in the boat waved as they passed.\n\nIn a parking lot on the far side of the channel, a U.S. flag and a Rhode Island flag snapped in the southeast wind.\n\nWe also saw beachgoers carrying chairs and headed to the shore. Just to the north, there’s a state campground where about a dozen campers were parked, with their owners resting on chairs set up along the breachway.\n\nWhat happened to the 1800s summer colony at Quonochontaug Beach?\n\nWe rested for a few minutes and then retraced our steps, with the breeze at our backs. We could see the long stretch of beach, with waves lapping at the shore, running all the way to Quonochontaug, also called Quonnie.\n\nQuonochontaug Beach was settled by summer colonists in the 1800s. The Hurricane of 1938 destroyed an inn and a row of shorefront cottages, killing dozens of people. The beach cottages were never rebuilt.\n\nIn contrast, East Beach, perhaps because of its very narrow barrier beach, has remained largely untouched and undeveloped.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Environmental Management, East Beach State Park was set up in 1967 and encompassed 174 acres by 2000. In 2006, the state added 250 acres by buying four parcels for about $2 million.\n\nAs we walked, we passed a washed-up lobster trap, pieces of driftwood and several lengths of angle iron. Seagulls squawked and took flight as we approached. Several tiny piping plovers played tag with the waves.\n\nLooking to the south, about 13 miles out, the outline of Block Island is visible. In the foreground, fishing trawlers, sailboats and motorboats crossed Block Island Sound.\n\nAt one point, a fisherman passed us, headed for the breachway, with a rod in one hand and a white bucket in the other. He said he'd hoped to hook a striper but was disappointed that he had to cast from shore, because the break in the jetty no longer allowed him to walk out to the end of the rocks.\n\n“That’s the ocean,” he said.\n\nAs it got later into the morning, we saw a barefoot couple walking the beach, a photographer with a tripod over his shoulder and a few sunbathers who snoozed in beach chairs.\n\nAfter walking 3 miles back, we turned inland from the beach to where we'd parked. A small white car was stuck in the sand right below the sign for “4 Wheel Drive Only” and a AAA truck was towing him out.\n\nIn all, we walked 6.1 miles over three hours.\n\nTo me, Rhode Island’s beaches are best in the offseason, before the crowds arrive. But tell that to the thousands of people who’ll head to East Beach this summer.\n\nWhen a beach is this beautiful all year round, though, I don’t mind being outnumbered.\n\nIf you go ...\n\nAccess: From Route 1 in Charlestown, follow East Beach Road south.\n\nParking: Available at a small state lot that fills quickly in the summer. A fee is charged.\n\nDogs: Not allowed from April 1 to Sept. 30. Dogs must be leashed in the offseason.\n\nDifficulty: Easy, through soft sand and along a beach.\n\nDistance: 6.1 miles\n\nGPS coordinates: 41.37259, -71.67231\n\n'Walking Rhode Island' book signings\n\nJohn Kostrzewa’s book, “Walking Rhode Island: 40 Hikes for Nature and History Lovers with Pictures, GPS Coordinates and Trail Maps,” is available at local booksellers and at Amazon.com.

But it’s steeped in history.\n\nThe Pokanoket lived, fished, farmed and hunted here for thousands of years on part of their ancestral lands, called Sowams, which stretched across the East Bay and included some of Seekonk, Swansea and Rehoboth, Massachusetts.\n\nThe land also was the site of the First Baptist Church of Massachusetts, one of the earliest churches in North America, which was founded by settlers in the 1600s.\n\nNear the church, the first skirmish of the brutal King Philip's War (1675-1676) between the Colonial farmers and the Native Americans is believed to have taken place.\n\nBesides all that history, Nockum Hill has meadows, coastal wetlands, salt marsh, woodlands and farmland, all part of the 82-acre Doug Rayner Wildlife Refuge. The sanctuary is named for the late naturalist and conservationist who protected endangered species and habitats on Nockum Hill and along the Palmer River, Barrington River and Hundred Acre Cove.\n\nThe town acquired the land in the 1960s and designated it a wildlife preserve in 1994. The Barrington Land Conservation Trust was granted a conservation easement in 2005, and currently the land is managed by the Doug Rayner Management Committee and the land trust.\n\nFounding spot for the First Baptist Church of Massachusetts\n\nI drove to the trailhead off George Street, crossing the border from Swansea into Barrington, and passed strawberry, rhubarb, lettuce and horse farms with names such as Pinegate, Four Town Farm, Cronin’s Crossing and Grays Farm. On a scorching June morning, I spotted water jets spraying the green fields and paused at a white-fenced paddock to watch young horseback riders circle the ring.\n\nThe trailhead, next to the private, historic Joseph Allen house, which was built in 1763, is marked with a tall stone slab and a greenish, weathered plaque that reads:\n\n“The First Baptist Church of Massachusetts was founded near this spot\n\nA.D. 1663\n\nRev. John Myles”\n\nMyles (1621-1683) was an Englishman from Wales who emigrated with his congregation to North America in the early 1660s. He carried with him the Ilston Book, one of the earliest records of the Baptist Church in Wales and named for a meeting place near Swansea, a Welsh town.\n\nThe congregation settled in Swansea, Massachusetts, and Myles founded the First Baptist Church of Massachusetts. (Barrington later broke off from Swansea.) Other founders listed on the stone table at the trailhead are James Brown, Nicholas Tanner, Joseph Carpenter, Eldad Kingsley, Benjamin Alby and John Butterworth.\n\nWas the meeting house a casualty of King Philip's War?\n\nSome historians believe that their meeting house was attacked on June 20, 1675, at the start of King Philip’s War, and that the church and Myles’ house burned to the ground. Archeologists have surveyed the land, looking for evidence in the fields, farmland and woods that now cover the property.\n\nI set out with 10 hikers on a guided walk led by Peter McCalmont, chairman of the Doug Rayner Wildlife Refuge Management Committee, and Charlie Brown, retired wildlife biologist for the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and co-manager of the refuge.\n\nWe walked through a white gate to start our walk. Because the paths aren’t blazed, I took a cellphone picture of a colorful map posted on a fence.\n\nThe trail starts off on the paved Rayner Road along an overgrown wooden fence. Not far in, we paused to watch two deer prancing across fields about a hundred yards on the right. On the far side of a field of corn and a stand of bamboo stalks, a walker followed a gravel road that looped into the preserve. Ahead of us, two turkeys emerged from the underbrush and crossed the path.\n\nAs we walked, our guides noted the invasive species, such as Japanese knotweed and bittersweet, that flourish along the walkway, crowd out native plants and grasses and have to be constantly cut back.\n\nWhat kind of wildlife might you see there?\n\nAfter a short distance, we reached Little Meadow, which was once a paved lot with a corrugated building and served as a dumping ground for sludge and other debris. The asphalt was taken up and the field is now heavily vegetated, lined with bird boxes and marked as a “pollinator habitat.” Goldenrod grows there at various times of the year.\n\nOur guides pointed out Eastern blue birds that perched on fence posts and tree swallows that darted across the sky. Birders also report spotting clapper rail, seaside sparrows, marsh wrens, gray catbirds and cedar waxwings along other paths.\n\nContinuing onto the Point Trail, with the farm fields on the right and a thick, deciduous, oak-dominated forest on the left, we reached Big Meadow. The area was cleared of stumps and saplings and is now filled with a dense underbrush, native grasses, cedar, pine and oak trees and several dozen bird boxes poking up above the foliage. I spotted butterflies fluttering above the milkweed, St. John’s wort, yarrow, black-eyed Susans and wild lupin, which has been introduced there.\n\nSeveral trails that lead around or away from Big Meadow were closed because of a sensitive wildlife area, including one path that led to the shoreline, where members of the church on Nockum Hill once held baptisms. We turned west, walked down a short bluff, and then turned north on a different path.\n\nThrough the trees, we could see the Runnins River, which meanders south before flowing into Hundred Acre Cove and the Barrington River before flowing into Narragansett Bay. I also noted that we passed a shrub-covered earthen berm on the right that partially hid a police pistol range that law enforcement officers use for target practice several times a year.\n\nHundred Acre Cove is nearby\n\nThe path led up a hillside to the main trail where we'd walked before. We turned east along the northern lip of Big Meadow and then went northeast onto the heavily shaded, grassy Woodland Trail, which once may have been a farm lane. A short side spur on the right leads to the long shoreline of Hundred Acre Cove, one of the largest salt marsh estuaries in Rhode Island. Anglers report the waters are filled with white perch, striped bass and herring.\n\nBack on the Woodland Trail, we looped back through a thick forest to Rayner Road and returned to where we'd started.\n\nIn all, we walked about 1.5 miles over 90 minutes.\n\nThe preserve’s history, especially the origins of the church and its reported role in King Philip's War, caught my attention. But there are also plenty of birds, trees and flowers to see in the meadows, making them great places to pause during an easy, enjoyable summer walk.\n\nIf you go….\n\nAccess: Off Warren Avenue headed east, take George Street to the trailhead on the right.\n\nParking: Available in a small lot.\n\nRestrictions: Dogs, joggers, bikes, horses and motor vehicles are prohibited.\n\nDifficulty: Easy on flat paths.\n\nGPS coordinates: 41.77230, -71.31161\n\nJohn Kostrzewa’s book, “Walking Rhode Island: 40 Hikes for Nature and History Lovers with Pictures, GPS Coordinates and Trail Maps,” is available at local booksellers, retailers and at Amazon.com.\n\nThe Walking Rhode Island column runs every other week in the Providence Sunday Journal.

Some say the town was named after him, and some say there was once a creek that ran into the bay called Slaughter Creek in his honor.\n\nAnother legend, Lewis said, is that the name came from the annual arrival of horseshoe crabs, which often get flipped over in the surf and die. The town is now a horseshoe crab sanctuary, with plenty of helping hands to flip the ancient-looking creatures over as they breed en masse.\n\nThe final tale is that in the 1600s, there was a miscommunication between Dutch settlers and Native Americans, Lewis said.\n\n“That’s the hardest one,” he said. “They decided to show the Native Americans their god, and showed them their cannon.\"\n\n“But who knows why it’s really named Slaughter Beach,” he said. “It certainly isn’t named Slaughter Beach because anybody here is into slaughtering animals.”\n\nSlaughter Beach Mayor Harry Ward said on Wednesday that he is open to the suggestion if residents are interested in a name change, and will bring up the suggestion at the next town meeting. But because of how PETA handled the situation — by issuing a press release before he or anyone else had a chance to discuss the proposal — Ward said it is unlikely he will respond to the Virginia-based group.\n\nPETA did not respond to calls for comments Tuesday evening.\n\nThe president of PETA, Ingrid E. Newkirk, said in the statement that the name is contrary to the reputation of the family-friendly town.\n\n\"Unfortunately, many people don’t look deeply into the origins of words and names, but that doesn’t diminish the negative connotations — especially for impressionable young minds — of a word like “slaughter,” which conjures up images of dead and dying animals,\" Newkirk said.\n\nPETA even offered to chip in financially for the cost of new signs, the press release said.\n\nPETA Public Outreach Coordinator Hannah Kinder said on Wednesday that the organization sent a media release out before hearing back from the town in an attempt to \"get more attention to the cause and make it more well-known and show the compassionate choice in the situation\" and offer those who support the idea a chance to speak up.\n\nKinder said PETA has sent similar requests to other towns over the years, but to her knowledge, none have taken the organization up on the offer.\n\nIn the town of 233 residents, not everyone was against the idea.\n\nOne resident and rental owner of 17 years, Glenn Stieffenhofer, said he hopes this will spark a healthy conversation on the name.\n\n\"I have mixed opinions, but it's good to know that PETA has initiated the conversation and wants to team up and help pay for it,\" he said.\n\nStieffenhofer said the name has definitely helped increase his rental inquiries.\n\n\"I think more people are interested in the home because of the name,\" he said.\n\nAnother resident, Bill McSpadden, who lives full-time in his grandparents' bayfront cottage, said PETA should have just sent town officials a letter and not issued a press release.\n\n“What are we going to do, start changing everybody’s name?” he asked, noting Broadkill Beach and the Murderkill River. “Does it sound better? Potentially. But I’ve been here all my life and I’m proud to say I’m from Slaughter Beach, and I don’t have a problem with it.”\n\nIn a few months, as they do every spring, nature enthusiasts and birders will descend on the town bordered by the bay and the marsh to watch thousands of shorebirds feast on horseshoe crab eggs.\n\nThis weekend, the town will also celebrate a rather unpopular frequent flyer — greenheads. The first Running from the Greenheads 5k will raise funds for the Delaware Nature Society and the Slaughter Beach Memorial Fire Company.\n\nSoon the town also will celebrate a new boardwalk on the marsh, which will feature interactive displays and lead to a recently installed osprey nest platform.\n\nMORE ON DELAWARE NAMES\n\nDelaware Backstory: The Murderkill River doesn't have a grisly past\n\nThe backstory on odd Delaware place names\n\nContact Josephine Peterson at (302) 324-2856 or jhpeterson@delawareonline.com.

When I hiked inland, I passed an old farm site where a slave worked for 26 years to win his and his family’s freedom.\n\nThough it was a short trip, the venture into Connecticut taught me quite a bit.\n\nWe set out on a cool but sunny March morning from the trailhead off Palmer Neck Road, which skirts the west side of Barn Island, a 1,013-acre preserve managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). At a gate, a flat granite stone is etched with a dedication to Louis Bayer (1906-1996), the late state game warden and artifact collector who worked to preserve the marshes at Barn Island.\n\nAfter the war, the state purchased the land in several pieces over many years. The funds came from local, state and federal sources, including an excise tax on sporting arms and ammunition through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act.\n\nThe preserve’s name comes from a barn on the southern tip of the island that the U.S. Navy used for dive bombing and machine gun target practice during World War II.\n\nTrail begins in a sustainable garden of native plants\n\nThe trail starts out through a sustainable garden of plants that thrive in a coastal environment and require little maintenance, except weeding. The plants also slow the spread of invasive species, such as Japanese barberry, Oriental bittersweet and Japanese honeysuckle, while providing food for birds, insects, mammals and microorganisms.\n\nFrom an overlook at the garden’s edge, there’s a sweeping, panoramic view to the south of the ocean, with Watch Hill in the distance. With binoculars, you can see some of the cabanas near the Watch Hill Yacht Club, but Napatree Point is partially blocked by an island. The Pawcatuck River flows into the bay from the east.\n\nJust below the overlook is a sprawling marsh – a mixture of inland freshwater and ocean salt water. The tidal marsh was formed thousands of years ago as rising ocean waters flooded the coastal land and deposited marine sediments that supported the growth of wetland grasses.\n\nI was intrigued by the tidal creeks that run inland from the ocean and are crossed by man-made, straight-as-an-arrow trenches that form a crosshatch in the wetlands. I learned later that the trenches were dug in the 1930s to drain stagnant water from the marsh to eliminate mosquito-breeding habitat.\n\nBut the trenches drained too much water and damaged the habitat of migrating ducks, geese and birds. So, a network of low earthen dikes was built to create shallow ponds with interconnecting channels to hold water on the marsh surface. The open water provides a habitat for minnows, which feed on mosquito larvae.\n\nAfter a long look, we followed a flat, wide path of crushed stone that turned downhill and crossed a low impoundment across the marsh.\n\nWhy are salt marshes so important to the shoreline ecosystem?\n\nThe dike was lined with tall reeds and some salt-tolerant plants, such as salt-meadow cordgrass. We also passed what’s called salt panne, a shallow depression in the marsh surface where plants that have adapted to high levels of salinity live. They also provide a feeding habitat for shorebirds, wading birds and waterfowl.\n\nAlong the impoundment, we studied several round metal culverts installed under the dikes in the 1970s that allow the flushing of tidal water, called a tidal exchange, which helps native plants to thrive. I had learned while walking along Rhode Island’s coast that salt marshes are a critical part of the shoreline’s ecosystem because they support nurseries for fish, feeding grounds for wading birds and nesting areas for migratory birds. They curb erosion, prevent flood damage and improve water quality.\n\nI also remembered a hike at Touisset Marsh in Warren, where rising water from Chase Cove sometimes floods a tidal creek and had degraded the low saltmarsh.\n\nAlso, Alex Kuffner, a Providence Journal writer and a former colleague, has written extensively about the impact of climate change and rising seas on the Rhode Island coastline and endangered birds such as the saltmarsh sparrow.\n\n200 species of migratory birds visit the marsh\n\nFarther down the path, we reached a junction and turned right on a wide dike flanked by marsh on both sides. We saw ducks, egrets, herons, mergansers and an empty osprey nest.\n\nWe met a pair of birders, who said that in various seasons they had identified many of the 200 migratory birds that fly into the marsh. They also told us a tower off the beach is part of a network from Canada to Florida that collects the signals of 40 migratory birds that are tagged with transponders. The information is used to track the birds and preserve the habitats where they land along the East Coast.\n\nEnvironment:The quahog holds a dear place in RI’s culture. Could its days be numbered?\n\nThe trail continues for about a half mile, passing a cemetery that dates to the 1600s, before ending at the property line. We decided, however, to explore the high ground of the preserve, so we turned, retraced our steps to the junction and turned right on a red-blazed trail that passed through a stand of trees painted with faces. The path led slightly uphill into an upland forest of oak, hickory and maple trees.\n\nSide spurs led to fields that are managed to provide cover and food for Eastern bluebirds, blue-winged warblers, cottontail rabbits and bobwhite quail.\n\nA golf course was once proposed for the wooded area in the northern part of the preserve. But when environmentalists raised concerns that the downhill drainage of fertilizers and other chemicals would damage the coastal marsh, the state purchased 144 acres in 2004 with funds from the federal government and The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental group.\n\nThe story of Venture Smith, a former slave turned landowner, businessman and author\n\nWe followed an old farm road through the woods to a marker for the Venture Smith farm site. After the hike, I learned Smith was enslaved in West Africa at age 10 and shipped to New England, where he worked for 26 years before buying his freedom and that of his two sons, his wife, his daughter, and several other Africans.\n\nAs a freeman in 1770, Smith bought acreage, including the farm where he had previously worked, on the current Barn Island site.\n\nHe later sold the land and died on Sept. 19, 1805, at age 76 as an American citizen, businessman, landowner and author, who some believe is among the first African Americans to write and publish his own autobiography.\n\nIn April 2022, the U.S. Congress recognized April 10 as “Venture Smith Freedom Day” and cited a phrase from his book: “My freedom is a privilege which nothing else can equal.”\n\nContinuing on the trail, we passed through old farmland marked with lines of stone walls and small earth-and-stone bridges that crossed streams and rivulets carrying runoff from the hillside.\n\nAfter about a mile, the trail opened on Palmer Neck Road at a narrow bridge over railroad tracks that carry Amtrak trains. We turned left and followed the road, with houses on the right with waterfront views of Wequetequock Cove. The road led back to where we parked. In all, we hiked 4.2 miles over two hours.\n\nBefore we left, we wanted a last look at the bay and walked a short distance down the road to a boat launch. From a short rock jetty, we studied the marsh in the foreground, the ocean and Rhode Island’s coastline in the distance. After hiking on both sides of the border, I realized there were more similarities – including environmental challenges – than differences between the states.\n\nThat lesson was worth the walk.\n\nIf you go ...\n\nAccess: Off Interstate 95 south, take exit 91 and turn left on Connecticut Route 234 east (Pequot Trail).

Really large.\n\nThe world knew the size of her fortune, the length of her yacht and the speed of her Vickers Viscount turboprop jet with its Rolls-Royce engine. But her family, friends and retinue of cooks, footmen, chambermaids and chauffeurs were the ones aware that no matter the extent of Post’s cereal inheritance, there were few as generous and big-hearted.\n\n“There are others better off than I am. The only difference is I do more with mine. I put it to work,” she once told an interviewer.\n\nHer staff especially was mindful of Marjorie Post’s uncompromised standards at Palm Beach, whether accommodating notable houseguests, holding extravagant black-tie dinners or underwriting a charity gala. They could attest she was as confident hosting dignitaries beneath the gold-leaf ceiling in Mar-a-Lago’s living room as she was welcoming underprivileged children with peanuts and hot dogs to a circus tent put up on her lawn.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nSo they were probably not surprised in April 1944 when Mar-a-Lago, Post’s more-than-100-room ocean-to-lake enclave with a nine-hole golf course, was converted into an occupational therapy center for convalescent World War II veterans housed at The Breakers, then operating as the Ream General Hospital.\n\nHer readiness to share her private realm during wartime foreshadowed what she expected might be one of her lasting legacies: her dream of having Mar-a-Lago repurposed for a greater good, as a presidential retreat and sanctuary for visiting heads of state.\n\nMore:PHOTOS: Building Mar-a-Lago: History of Trump’s winter White House\n\nHowever ambitious Post’s aspiration, the mansion’s construction posed obstacles that at times made its completion in 1927 as unlikely as the roundabout way it has finally fulfilled Post’s objective — as the Winter White House of President Donald Trump, who bought the property in late 1985 and opened his private Mar-a-Lago Club a decade later.\n\nMore:DONALD TRUMP IN PALM BEACH: Latest news, photos, videos\n\nMrs. Hutton builds\n\nIn April 1925, news broke that E.F. “Ned” Hutton, then 50, and his 38-year-old wife, Marjorie, had made plans to build a new home in the town’s South End. By then, the couple’s architect, Marion Sims Wyeth, and his associate Maitland Belknap had already created drawings for a “master’s house, another for the children, another for guests, and other unique features,” according to a report at the time in The Palm Beach Post.\n\nThe couple had found Hogarcito, their Golfview Road villa, “too small for their needs and not near enough to the ocean,” especially since her daughters from a previous marriage were now joined by their new half-sister, Nedenia, born in December 1923. Setting out to elaborate on Hogarcito’s camplike configuration, Wyeth formulated a sprawling house extending more than 500 feet in length along the coral-rock ridgeline.\n\nSet back from the ocean boulevard with its more imposing, crescent-shaped profile visible from the lakeside, the house was then described as “the largest residential undertaking in the resort’s history.”\n\nThe month after the Palm Beach announcement, Ned Hutton was reported aboard the yacht Hussar anchored off shore in the South End, along with the Huttons’ friend, Broadway impresario Flo Ziegfeld, inspecting the ongoing preconstruction work. The 17-acre parcel was being cleared and the foundations set. Along the estate’s South Ocean Boulevard frontage, crews planted 14 of the island’s tallest coconut palms.\n\nAnd then, things got complicated.\n\nOn May 9, Joseph Urban arrived at Palm Beach and registered at the Hotel Billows. Urban and Ziegfeld had been partners since 1915, when Urban moved from Boston to New York to design sets for The Metropolitan Opera and the Ziegfeld Follies. During the previous year, the renowned Viennese illustrator and architect had worked as a scenic designer for William Randolph Hearst’s Cosmopolitan Pictures. Urban was summoned to Palm Beach to plan sets for Palm Beach Nights, a production set to open in January at Hutton and Ziegfeld’s Montmartre nightclub on Royal Palm Way, and confer on the interior decoration of the Huttons’ new house.\n\nFour months later, a local newspaper headline read: “Broker planning home at cost of million dollars.” The Hutton house’s architect was identified as Urban, and the article noted that “acting with Mr. Urban in preparing the plans is Marion Sims Wyeth.” Apparently, the Huttons had decided to forego Wyeth’s conservative architectural sensibilities, replacing them with Urban’s flair for scenic effects.\n\nWyeth termed his work “quiet, subdued and rational.” The Beaux Arts-trained architect would later distance himself from Urban’s theatrical aesthetic at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBy the time the $500,000 building permit was issued in mid-January 1926, Urban’s phantasmagoric vision was in place, enhanced by the arrival of father-and-son Austrian sculptors known as Franz Barwig the Elder and Franz the Younger. The two artist-craftsmen were members of Urban’s Viennese Secessionist Movement and were recognized for their wood, bronze and stone animal carvings.\n\nWith construction well underway, Urban supervised each room’s layered design schemes and furnishings while ensconced on a lakeside houseboat. The Barwig studio’s stone saws were abuzz. But in the spring, construction suddenly stopped, as rumors circulated that the Huttons were planning to buy Playa Riente, oilman Joshua Cosden’s palatial Mizner-designed house on North Ocean Boulevard. Contemporaneous reports declared the Huttons weren’t going to complete their “great mansion.” Instead, it would be demolished.\n\nIn late March 1926, Ned Hutton announced a halt to construction because the adjacent property to the south, then named Causeway Park, was sold to developers who planned “an encroachment with unrestricted commercial development.” Six weeks later, Palm Beach learned it was Anna Dodge — widow of Horace Dodge and then considered one of the richest women in the world — who sold the property to developers and bought Playa Riente for $2.8 million.\n\nThat summer, Hutton bought the lakeside parcel of the proposed development and restarted construction of the house. A few weeks later, Hutton and Anthony Drexel Biddle Jr. formed the Oceanfront Realty Co. and bought Causeway Park’s ocean frontage for $600,000. They hired Urban to design the private Bath & Tennis Club’s new clubhouse, as a mid-September hurricane had washed away the club’s original private cabanas that had occupied the south end of The Breakers’ beach.\n\nBy January 1927 the Huttons’ opulent winter cottage was fast nearing completion. Although most often described as Hispano-Moresque, the architecture of Mar-a-Lago may have been more accurately regarded as “Urbanesque.” Its façade was centered by a large arched glass window, while an entrance drive lined with Washingtonian palms deposited guests beneath a side-elevation porte cochere. Clad with Genovese Dorian stone enriched by Barwig-carved sculptures and reliefs, the sheltered entry’s steps led through an elaborated arch surrounding a wrought-iron grille glass door. It opened into the entrance hall’s prismatic flourish of geometric niches covered with centuries-old Havemeyer tiles and embellished with Spanish lanterns, marble busts and coats of arms.\n\nPaneled double doors adorned with carved cherubs opened into the living room ringed by archways interrupted by Venetian silk needlework panels and crowned by an adaptation of the Thousand Wing Ceiling found at Venice’s Accademia. From the living room, guests could make their way into the dining room — a replica of the 16th-century original installed at Rome’s Palazzo Chigi — then step down to the lakeside loggia and patio, or step up through a triple-arched passage to an oceanside loggia.\n\nOn Jan. 14, the Bath & Tennis Club’s opening was delayed until the multitude of workers vacated the Huttons’ construction site across the street. A week later, the Huttons arrived at their newly completed residence, by then reported to have cost $2 million.\n\nThe house would be known as “Mar-a-Lago,” translated from the Spanish for “sea to lake,” but also a clever take on the lady of the house’s first name.\n\nMrs. Hutton entertains\n\nDuring their first season in the house, Marjorie and Ned Hutton hosted two significant social affairs. In late February, they held a recital and benefit for the Women’s Guild at The Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea. In the dazzling entrance hall, Marjorie stood in the receiving line with the guild’s officers and welcomed several hundred guests. Before the sunset musicale began, guests were invited to tour the mansion’s ground-floor rooms. During the performance, the Huttons sat on the upper terrace above guests who were accommodated on the lower patio, which was paved with polished stones from Long Island and composed in an Alhambra pattern.\n\nThe Fancy Dress Ball at the Everglades Club was unquestionably the season’s social Everest. For their first pre-ball dinner party, the Huttons laid a red carpet across the lawn. Each course was served on a Spanish pottery service with Venetian glassware. Following dinner, guests were driven to the gala. When all 100 of the Huttons’ guests made their entrance together, styled by Parisian and Hollywood costume designers, club members were reported to have gasped at the sight.\n\nMore:PHOTOS: What did Marjorie Merriweather Post wear?\n\nMore:Exhibit to focus on society queen’s gala attire\n\nBy late March, the season was over and the Huttons were gone. And by the following month, the sound of hammers again reverberated throughout Mar-a- Lago, as Urban and a contingent of workers began making what the press described as “extensive alterations and enlargements.”\n\nThe flurry of activity coincided, of course, with the spectacular bust of the building boom that had kept developers and workers frantic during the previous three years before it screeched to a halt.\n\n“I remember it very well,” Post recalled for a 1969 article in the Palm Beach Daily News. “We refused to cease construction after nearly everyone advised us to stop. Had we stopped and discharged workmen, this would have added more unemployed, so we went ahead.”\n\nPalm Beachers could set their calendars by the Huttons’ late January arrival each season. In 1929, Mar-a-Lago hosted a luncheon for Grand Duke Alexander Michaelovitch, father of Prince Nikita, presumptive heir to the Russian throne. There was a card party benefit for the Animal Rescue League. In March 1929 came their first of several circus benefits.\n\n“I still have a movie of it,” Post later recalled. “We gave the show twice for charity and once for our friends,” adding that the party “raised a great deal of money for charity.”\n\nWhile the Huttons were accustomed to the unnerving aspects of their status as public figures, the completion of their new 360- foot yacht Hussar V might have otherwise been the chatter of the 1931 season — if there hadn’t been so many whispers about the status of their marriage. Their time apart grew each season with briefer stays at Palm Beach. In September 1935, a month after their split was reported, Marjorie Post received a divorce decree in New York on the grounds of adultery.\n\nWithin months after the divorce, she married Washington lawyer Joseph Davies, who was subsequently named ambassador to Russia. Engaged in her new role as an ambassador’s wife with a much larger international platform, she broadened her cultural and social horizons.\n\nMar-a-Lago remained shuttered for five seasons. Following the couple’s diplomatic posts abroad, they made only brief visits in the early 1940s to Palm Beach, where they focused mainly on a number of charitable events. Whether as a result of her personal life or her newly acquired global experiences, Marjorie Merriweather Post would spend the next several decades pursuing a more consequential role for Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMrs. Merriweather Post builds a legacy\n\nDuring the 1944 season, Joe and Marjorie Davies came to Palm Beach. Because of wartime dim-outs along the oceanfront, the couple took a short-term lease on a smaller lakeside house. That April, Marjorie volunteered Mar-a-Lago as a training center for returning servicemen. Thatch-roof huts were erected for workshops in leather tooling, sculpting, furniture repair, printing and carpentry. The compound’s staff and service buildings were converted into art studios, private counseling offices, radio repair shops, motor mechanic garages and rooms to show training films.\n\nBy the time the couple returned to Palm Beach in 1948, it had been seven years since they last stayed at Mar-a-Lago. She continued her charitable work during the 1950s, and later, helped turn the Red Cross Ball into an eminent diplomatic event. In 1961, she built a pavilion with a 30-foot-by-50-foot dance floor, designed by her longstanding friend, architect Marion Sims Wyeth.\n\nAlthough Mar-a-Lago’s square-dance evenings became a coveted invitation and one of her passions, Mrs. Merriweather Post, as she was called after her fourth divorce, had begun her quest to make Mar-a-Lago more than an architectural magnum opus but a prominent national destination. Post offered the property to the Town of Palm Beach during a time when Palm Beach mansions were being supplanted by subdivisions and Jean Flagler Matthews set out to preserve and restore Whitehall, the Gilded Age mansion built by her grandfather, hotel-and-railroad tycoon Henry M. Flagler. Town leaders worried about Mar-a-Lago’s potential disruptive crowd of tourists.\n\nSo she proposed that the State of Florida use Mar-a-Lago as a “place to house people of importance, a presidential retreat, or temporary quarters for visiting heads of state.” State officials were alarmed by the operating costs.\n\nFinally, after years of lobbying efforts, the federal government acquired Mar-a-Lago by an act of Congress in October 1972. When Post died the following year, she believed Mar-a-Lago had realized its ultimate destiny. But the estate’s preservation and upkeep expenses proved more than the National Park Service’s budget could sustain. Mar-a-Lago was returned to the Post Foundation in 1980.\n\nFive years later, 40-year-old New York real estate developer Trump paid a recorded $5 million for Mar-a-Lago, then considered something of a white elephant, and reportedly bought the furnishings for another $3 million. (He later acquired the beach parcel for a reported $2 million.) He and the first of his three wives, Ivana, renovated the house, restoring many rooms to look as if Post still lived there.\n\n“I thought I was buying a museum,” Trump told Palm Beach Life in 1986. “I never thought it was going to be a particularly comfortable place, but I thought it was so incredible as a statement that it would be wonderful to own. The fact is, it has turned out not only to be a museum but a very comfortable home.”\n\nBy 1995, Trump had won the town’s approval to open his private club. He has continued to maintain private quarters there, which he uses on visits with first lady Melania and their son, 10-year-old Barron. His adult children also visit frequently.\n\nPalm Beach is an island of gilded mansions but few with a history as high-spirited as Mar-a-Lago, a winter “cottage” very nearly demolished before it was completed. Decades after Marjorie Merriweather Post thought she had accomplished her greatest ambition, Mar-a-Lago’s story, which might have once been a reminder of Palm Beach’s opulent past, today has the good fortune of playing an even more prominent role in the nation’s history.\n\n*\n\nAugustus Mayhew is the author of “Lost in Wonderland: Reflections on Palm Beach” and “Palm Beach: A Greater Grandeur.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/05/delaware-most-influential-people-2024-community-impact/71987408007/", "title": "Delaware's most influential people who are making a difference in ...", "text": "Suzanne Thurman: Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute, founder and executive director\n\nSuzanne Thurman is one of the state's top first responders when it comes to rescuing marine mammals.

Lack of programming and education. Extended periods of time in solitary confinement.\n\nPrisoners in Building C at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center have been protesting — sometimes violently — conditions inside the Smyrna-area prison for more than half a century.\n\nForty-five years ago, in what is now Building C at Vaughn, Watson was part of the “Smyrna 5,” a group of young, black men who broke out of their cells and stabbed a correctional officer after he canceled a committee meeting scheduled for that night.\n\nLast year, it happened again, only this time the correctional officer didn’t survive.\n\nFor nearly 18 hours on Feb. 1, 2017, inmates seized the building, taking hostages and demanding better programming, education, and treatment from prison staff.\n\n“The same conditions down there existed in the '70s,” said Watson, who was medically released from Vaughn in April 2017 due to bone cancer. “It just built up again. Inmates through the entire institution have made it explicitly clear that there are problems … but their pleas fell upon deaf ears.”\n\n­This time, state prosecutors charged 16 men with the murder of Lt. Steven Floyd, and two more with helping to organize the riot. The first four of these defendants headed to trial Monday. Two of the men — both already serving life sentences for murder — are representing themselves.\n\nMore: What really caused Delaware's prisoners to revolt at Vaughn Correctional Center?\n\nWatson has been in Vaughn since before the 1973 stabbing. And he was still there in 2017 when inmates revolted. From his eyes, the prison is much the same. There are new buildings and new technology, but he said the issues that led to the Smyrna 5 attack are little changed from the 1970s.\n\nThe 68-year-old Watson has been in the New Castle County courtroom every day. He said he is there to support the defendants who are fighting what he sees as the same fight he waged against the state 44 years ago. Thomas LeGrande, another member of the Smyrna 5, has also attended.\n\n“I was in max for 20 years,” Watson recalled. “I was in segregation and isolation because I was marked a ‘political revolutionary.’ … When you treat a man like an animal, how do you expect him to act?”\n\n'Keep fighting'\n\nIn 1973, in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, the Smyrna 5 were seen as young, black political activists to some, and an example of the prison’s worst by others.\n\nTheir trial pulled droves of supporters to the Wilmington courthouse, according to News Journal archives. At times, the masses of people and the tension of the trial led to fights and chaos in the courtroom.\n\nMore than once, the Smyrna 5 walked out in defiance of a legal system they believed was hindering their right to a fair trial.\n\nThe courtroom looks a bit different today than it did 44 years ago, and a walkout would be nearly impossible given the two correctional officers assigned to each defendant.\n\nRead what happened when the Smyrna 5 walked out of the courtroom\n\nThe four men on trial are handcuffed every time they leave the courtroom and they aren’t permitted any items, even at the defense tables, that could be fashioned into weapons.\n\nBehind them, a consistent group of family, relatives and advocates fills the pews on the right side of the courtroom.\n\nEach day, the men enter, giving a nod to a loved one in the crowd or slightly raising a hand in greeting. More often, their eyes scan the room for a familiar face.\n\nThe moments are fleeting, but occasionally they draw a smile. Take the time Watson flashed a closed fist in solidarity to Dwayne Staats, one of two men representing himself, as the second day of trial wrapped to a close.\n\n“Keep fighting,” Watson called out. Staats nodded.\n\n“I know what they (correctional officers) did to me when they thought we stabbed the guard,” Watson later said. “I can only imagine what they’re doing to them now.”\n\nFrom trial: Prosecutor: Lt. Floyd found beaten, handcuffed, face down in water\n\nWatson knows three of the four men on trial personally. He spent time in maximum security alongside many of them and understands why the prison system and the state are threatened by the prisoners. He said C Building was always simmering, but even more so in the months before the uprising.\n\nDuring opening statements, Staats — who is charged with murdering Floyd, and already serving a life sentence for murder — spoke quietly but with conviction as he urged the jury to consider why certain inmates would assist the state and why they may point fingers at the men seated at the defense tables.\n\n“They’re begging the DA for freedom but all they’re willing to sacrifice is the innocence of others,” he said. “I didn’t wear a mask on Feb. 1, 2017, and I’m not wearing a mask now.”\n\nWhat Watson saw in those moments when Staats spoke to the jury were shades of the political revolutionary he came to know when he found himself in maximum security with Staats.\n\nStaats and Jarreau Ayers, who is also charged with murder and is representing himself in the trial, were well-liked in the prison, Watson said.\n\nThey also maintained a certain level of respect from other inmates for their beliefs, he said.\n\n“I believe Staats espoused to that (political revolutionary) philosophy,” Watson said.\n\nThe case against them\n\nState prosecutors have made clear in the first week of trial that they plan to show how these four defendants wielded this influence and status within Building C to spark the February 2017 riot.\n\nThere will be no time of death announced for correctional officer Floyd because investigators said they don’t know it. And they won’t be able to say which blow was the one to kill the officer inside the prison building because of a lack of DNA evidence and surveillance footage.\n\nAudio from hostage negotiations, letters exchanged between inmates, and the state’s star witness — a prisoner who was charged as part of the riot and took a plea in exchange for truthful testimony — will help to build their case.\n\nRoyal Downs, serving a life sentence, pleaded guilty to riot, though the prosecution has already played audio from the riot that hostage negotiators identified as Downs. The defense has argued this prisoner was a key player in the uprising.\n\nAnd the defense — including the inmates inside C Building with Downs during the riot — will look to discredit and identify every inconsistency that is introduced.\n\n“This case is based off the backs of individuals who willingly admit they lie to get deals,” Ayers told the court in his opening statements.\n\nLast month, after his court-appointed defense attorney discovered a conflict in his ability to represent Ayers, the inmate opted to defend himself. Since then, he told the jury he has read almost 3,000 pages of court documents “at least twice.”\n\n“And the only thing I walked away with from that was with one clear truth early on … inconsistencies and contradictions,” he told the jury. “I’m going to point out every lie, every contradiction every time, until there’s no more inmates on that stand.”\n\nSelf-representation doesn’t happen often in big Delaware cases, but Watson and LeGrande weren’t entirely surprised to see two of the first four defendants representing themselves.\n\nMuch like their own case, the two men said it can be hard to trust the legal system that landed you behind bars in the first place and this lack of trust likely led them to represent themselves now.\n\n“I think they’re doing well, as someone not familiar with the law,” Watson said of Staats and Ayers. “Their lives are on the line and when your life is on the line, you’ll do whatever it takes.”\n\nEmotional witness testimony\n\nSpitting at the judge, removal from the courtroom and walkouts were all a part of the drama that unfolded 44 years ago for Watson and LeGrande.\n\nBut the first week of the Vaughn trial has gone without much of the vocal outcry that is likely to get you tossed from Judge William C. Carpenter Jr.’s courtroom.\n\nInstead, the defense has pulled to the forefront the relationships built and maintained between inmates and prison staff as each hostage took the stand to face some of the men prosecutors say held them captive.\n\nPatricia May, the 69-year-old counselor held hostage for the duration of the riot, tearfully recounted the steps inmates took to make her feel safe. One sang to her when a prison-issued radio was unable to pick up her favorite Christian rock station. Another made sure she had toilet paper when she went to the bathroom.\n\nStaats questioned May about how she felt working in Building C before the riot, and she said she feared for her life and that tensions within that prison building were growing worse by the day and everybody knew it.\n\n“I had fears that I was going to get killed,” she said on the stand.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, after questioning the counselor about her experience as a hostage, Staats tried to tell the counselor he was sorry and insinuated that it was he who had come into her office with a knife, but before he could get any further, state prosecutors objected.\n\nVaughn prison counselor held hostage describes 'beautiful moments'\n\nIf Staats wanted to testify to what he did that day, he would have to take the stand, the judge instructed.\n\nStaats said he felt he owed it to the woman who served as Building C’s counselor for nearly two months.\n\nThe judge quickly told the jury to disregard that comment, stressing that this was a court of law and not a counseling session. But the moment reached the counselor, who wiped tears from her face as they rolled down her cheeks.\n\nWhen defense attorney Ben Gifford approached the podium to question her, she was still crying.\n\n“I’m sorry, that was just,“ she said, trailing off. “A combination of all the feelings that came out, you know.”\n\nStaats wasn’t the only one to connect with a witness on the stand.\n\nCorrectional officer Winslow Smith, who was taken hostage during the riot but the first to be released during the standoff, answered questions from all four defense teams about what he saw and knew during the siege.\n\nAs Ayers wrapped up his cross-examination, he brought up his own relationship with Smith, stressing that he didn’t want to speculate on it but didn’t believe they had any issues.\n\n“No,” Smith replied. “I recommended you for a couple jobs.”\n\nAyers nodded.\n\n“I know, Smith. No further questions, your Honor.”\n\n'Recognize my fight'\n\nIn the closing arguments of the Smyrna 5 trial, court-appointed defense attorneys for the five young men described in detail the trouble they caused at the state prison.\n\nOne defense attorney, Roger P. Sanders, characterized the five as “young black men who refuse to do the white man’s bidding,” who have read the works of Black Panther defense minister Huey Newton, among others, and live by them.\n\n“Some of them are surly, some of them are arrogant, all of them are proud,” said defense attorney Alfred J. Lindh in his closing arguments. And every member of the Smyrna 5 was found guilty and convicted of attempted murder on Feb. 1, 1974, 43 years to the day before the 2017 uprising.\n\nRead the full story from the day the Smyrna 5 trial ended and all the men were found guilty\n\n“We should have beat that trial,” Watson said this week, shaking his head.\n\nThe men were returned to prison, where some — including Watson — would spend much of his sentence in maximum security. Over time, some were moved out of state.\n\nConditions didn’t change inside Vaughn, and arguably, they worsened — leading to a riot that correctional officers, counselors and inmates alike say they all saw coming.\n\nHistory has a way of repeating itself. Nowhere is that more true than inside Delaware prisons, where conditions don't change as quickly.\n\nIt will likely be weeks before a New Castle County jury determines a verdict in this first trial. The judge expects the arguments to last four weeks before the court gears up to do it four more times for four new groups of defendants.\n\n“I really believe they began with these four because they think they’re leaders,” Watson said. “So if they beat them, then it’ll scare the rest in this case.”\n\nYet to Watson and LeGrande, watching a similar story play out in front of their eyes from the other side of the courtroom, fear isn’t the driving force for the men seeking justice.\n\nIt’s about dignity and respect and life — qualities that they say have long been forgotten in Delaware’s criminal justice system.\n\nEven Ayers in his opening statements acknowledged the difficulty that the jurors will face in reaching a verdict in the coming weeks. Falling on the other side of what prosecutors and society say is true can be difficult.\n\nBut he hoped they would have the courage to “unbiasedly recognize my fight.”\n\n“So when y’all faced with making that decision and y’all faced with those emotional dilemmas, y’all have the chance to say I didn’t see any reliable evidence to send a man to jail for the rest of his life,” Ayers told the jury. “That’s a hard decision to make.”\n\nDELAWARE'S 2017 PRISON TRIAL\n\nVaughn prison counselor held hostage describes 'beautiful moments'\n\nInmates, attorneys question credibility of state's Vaughn prison riot investigation\n\nProsecutor: Lt.

Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, according to an independent review of its health care services.\n\nThe review, commissioned in the wake of the Feb. 1, 2017 uprising that left one correctional officer dead and two others badly beaten, found that the combination of an \"inadequate electronic health record system\" and too few nurses and health professionals creates delays in care or missed appointments.\n\nThis, compounded by correctional officers being forced to work overtime at least once or twice every two weeks due to shortages, leads to fatigue and frustration among all parties involved.\n\nEscorting inmates to off-site appointments also leaves the number of officers at Vaughn during any given shift even lower, according to the independent review by National Conference on Correctional Health Care Resources Inc.\n\n\"The greatest shortage is with our nursing,\" said Bureau Chief of Correctional Healthcare Dr. Marc Richman, who stressed that nationally, nurses are at a premium.\n\nRichman said the state Department of Correction is looking into new ways to recruit health care staff, especially as new facilities open throughout the state that may be more desirable for nurses entering the field.\n\nBut recruiting has for years plagued the DOC, which has seen no end to staff shortages, especially following the riot. The state agency is projected to surpass $30 million in overtime pay this budget year — a 37.7 percent jump over the $22.2 million paid out in extra time last fiscal year.\n\nDOC turns to telemedicine because of doctor security fears following riot\n\nThe conditions that led to last year's deadly prison riot were blamed, in part, on severe understaffing, forcing administrators to ask — and even mandate — overtime shifts. Yet, despite DOC efforts to curb overtime, massive resignations since the riot have forced the use of more overtime. Similar effects were seen in health care staffing.\n\nIn response, the DOC has increased its use of telemedicine or connecting inmates with offsite doctors using Skype-like technology.\n\n\"We're going to have to make sure we stay ahead and incentivize employment,\" Richman said. The prison system is also creating the Health Care Efficiences Process Work Group to implement these changes and better address problems facing health care within the DOC.\n\nThis review was one of many recommendations made by an independent review team of retired Delaware justices who were charged with further examining the events that led to last year's riot.\n\n\"We took this recommendation seriously and hired the gold standard in correctional health care to come in and interview officers, medical staff and inmates to assess how we are doing and how we can improve,\" said state Department of Correction Commissioner Perry Phelps in a statement Wednesday. \"We appreciate the validation that our sick call process is operating properly and are committed to implementing changes to expand inmates’ access to health care.\"\n\nIn addition to staff shortages, this review found that inmates often receive little to no instruction on the \"sick call\" process — the only way for those incarcerated to request access to health care.\n\nInmates are required to submit a form when they have a concern about their physical, dental or mental health, forms that are collected daily and then reviewed by nurses to determine who is most in need of care. Ideally, if inmates are presenting clinical symptoms, they are seen within 48 hours of their request or 72 hours on weekends.\n\nThe review found that inmates are being seen for their requests — but noted that these visits may be delayed for a multitude of reasons, including long waiting room times, court dates, more urgent healthcare matters or scheduling issues attributable to the faulty electronic record system.\n\nThe News Journal has received dozens of reports regarding missed health care appointments and unresolved complaints. Phelps said similar complaints to staff prompted this review.\n\nMost notably, former Vaughn inmate Steven Sipple said he received inadequate treatment and response to more than 15 written requests for medical attention. Now, he has terminal colorectal cancer, which Sipple and his attorney say could have been prevented had he received proper care in prison.\n\nThough specific cases were not discussed, Richman said the review found that emergency medical care was being delivered to inmates.\n\nThe review did recommend the DOC replace the electronic medical records system due to the chronic problems it creates for both inmates and staff. It frequently loses data, according to the report released to the public Wednesday, and is inefficient in helping staff schedule appointments, input new information and renew requests for medication.\n\nRichman said the prison is already reviewing the records system, known as iCHRT, to determine how to best \"enhance or replace it\" and the costs associated with all options.\n\n\"The connectivity issue is being addressed by the addition of dozens of additional Wi-Fi access points that have been installed at JTVCC over the past several months,\" he said. \"(The Department of Correction) has made considerable improvements in these areas, and we remain committed to eliminating all barriers to efficiency in providing health care.\"\n\nThe independent review also noted that the sick call grievance process is receiving complaints unrelated to medical needs, in addition to requests to see a doctor.\n\nBecause the sick call process is not equipped or meant to handle other complaints, Phelps said another independent agency will be brought in to best determine how those grievances should be addressed.\n\nThe report’s findings and suggestions are “encouraging” to prison advocates like the Rev. Christopher Bullock, a founder of the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice.\n\n“The recommendations come from three outside experts, which is encouraging that we had fresh eyes on the situation versus internal folks,” Bullock said, calling the recommendations “on point.”\n\nWhile previous recommendations to improve Delaware’s prison system have been made in the past, Bullock said he believes there is a sense of urgency because of the conditions that led up to the riot last year that claimed the life of correctional officer Lt. Steven Floyd.\n\n“The Floyd incident really lit a fire under a lot of people,” he said. “It was unfortunate, but I think it also shined a light on what’s really going on.”\n\nJAMES T.

The temporary special assistant would also produce public reports at six months and a year, with a focus on the implementation of recommendations made by the independent review team looking into the nearly 18-hour siege at the Smyrna-area prison that resulted in the death of Lt. Steven Floyd.\n\n\"It’s time to focus on addressing the difficult problems facing our prisons,\" said Carney, who was flanked by DOC Commissioner Perry Phelps and several state lawmakers. \"We cannot let this report collect dust on a shelf. Our plan would take appropriate action to address the review team's recommendations and to help enhance safety and security for correctional officers and inmates at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center and across Delaware's correctional system.\"\n\nThe Rev. Christopher Bullock, who heads the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice, welcomed the special assistant position. But he cautioned that the selected person needed to have a background in corrections and a \"heart for redemption and re-entry so that offenders can be assets to Delaware, not liabilities.\"\n\nBullock said he would like to see a plan that involves clergy and faith-based institutions to help inmates with moral and spiritual development.\n\n\"You cannot exclude God in this plan,\" he said.\n\nOther items in Carney's plan are:\n\nHave state police and DOC conduct an after-action review of the siege and identify improvements to incident management protocols and policy.\n\nAllocate $2 million to purchase new cameras at Vaughn, which will require General Assembly approval.\n\nDirect the state's Department of Technology & Information to prepare a strategic technology plan and assume operational responsibility for technology needs across Delaware’s correctional system.\n\nContinue collective bargaining with the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware (COAD) with the goal of increasing base pay for correctional officers to decrease use of mandatory overtime.\n\nPrepare and implement a plan to eliminate staffing shortages and have the department report its progress every three months until the shortage is eliminated.\n\nRecruit a new bureau chief of community correction with expertise in managing re-entry programs and reducing recidivism. This person will work with the Criminal Justice Council to deliver recommendations by November to improve re-entry programs and reducing recidivism.\n\nWilmington attorney Thomas S. Neuberger, who is one part of the legal team representing Floyd's widow and other employees taken hostage, said this might be a difficult task to achieve with the state facing a $400 million dollar budget deficit as it gets ready to start a new budget year next month. Instead, the state should look at releasing non-violent offenders, he said.\n\n\"Now is the time for the governor to use his executive powers of pardon and clemency, along with the probation and parole office, to reduce the number of non-violent prisoners held for probation violations, minor drug use, lack of bail money, etc.,\" Neuberger said.\n\n\"If the money is not there for a secure prison system, on July 1 the governor, by executive action, should decrease the prison population so there is a safe ratio of [correction officers] to violent prisoners,\" he said. \"Send non-violent inmates home to their families and community and put enough officers in Vaughn to control the gangs and killers who took the life of Lt. Steven Floyd.\"\n\nFailures to address previous problems within the Department of Correction, coupled with the recent mixing of gang members, a lack of programs for inmates, and an \"us vs. them\" mentality between rank-and-file and officials, ultimately led to the death of Floyd and the injuries of other correctional officers held hostage.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Charles Oberly III and retired Judge William Chapman, who spearheaded the independent report released last week, said that some of the failures they reported on were problems found in a 2005 review of what led to serial rapist Scott A. Miller abducting and sexually assaulting a Vaughn prison counselor on July 12, 2004.

Sean Lynn, D-Dover, the primary sponsor.\n\nThe resolution — along with a separate bill aimed at allowing some prisoners early release and credit off their sentences due to the pandemic — represents the first legislative involvement of the Delaware General Assembly in COVID-19 outbreaks in local prisons, which have seen more than 1,750 prisoners infected and 12 die.\n\nIn December, Delaware Online/The News Journal determined that of the 5,700 or so inmates who have spent at least three weeks in lockup since the virus was first detected in local prisons, some 1,428 had tested positive — a rate approaching 1 in every 4.\n\nSince then, more inmates have been infected, though correction officials say only a handful are symptomatic.\n\nSince the pandemic began, Delaware Online/The News Journal has published a series of stories providing accounts of the department's response from those inside prisons.\n\nAt first, people inside primarily complained about the decision not to provide prisoners with masks, a decision correction officials defended before reversing.\n\nMore recently, prisoners have questioned whether decisions made by prison officials have exacerbated the spread of the virus, said vulnerable inmates who said they have not been protected sufficiently and that the pandemic response is slowing inmate efforts to earn time off their sentences.\n\nIn correspondence with reporters as well as litigation, they also claim medical needs outside of COVID-19 are not being addressed in a timely manner. The inmates have also disputed aspects of how prison officials say they are handling the outbreak.\n\n\"Nobody in a leadership position can say they handled this well,\" said Charles Colburn, who is imprisoned at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna. \"Nobody expected this.\"\n\nAt each turn, Claire DeMatteis, commissioner of the Department of Correction, and prison leaders under her have disputed those opinions as \"false narratives\" and portrayed the situation as under control.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Correction, through a spokesman, said that its officials have been \"actively and responsibly engaged with legislators, inmate families, and other stakeholders throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\" and that won't change \"with or without this resolution.\"\n\nDIFFERENT STORY: Prisons, inmates and their families dispute Delaware's response to COVID-19 outbreak\n\nLynn said the resolution was spurred by him reading complaints from inmates.\n\nLynn, DeMatteis and Dover attorney Stephen Hampton, who frequently sues the state on behalf of inmates, sparred via email about the situation in prisons over the Christmas holiday, correspondence which was part of Lynn's motivation for seeking the legislative inquiry, he said.\n\nLynn specifically mentioned delays in non-pandemic related health issues, a frequent complaint by prisoners in recent months.\n\nAn excerpt of that correspondence include DeMatteis' defense of how prison's have handled outbreaks can be found at the end of this story.\n\nLynn said the \"frequency and the scope and the sheer volume\" of complaints dictates that \"something needs to be done\" to help both prisoners and officers working in the facilities.\n\n\"If the Department of Correction was to be believed, everyone that is making those complaints is lying which stretches credulity,\" Lynn said.\n\nThe resolution, if passed, would create a committee that has subpoena power to demand documents and testimony beyond the powers of existing legislative committees, Lynn said. The committee would have access to otherwise protected health care information for former and current inmates, according to a draft of the resolution.\n\nLynn called \"healthcare rights and issues\" in prison a \"cyclical issue,\" citing historical problems and a flood of lawsuits in recent years against the prison's former nonprofit health care provider.\n\nThat provider, Connections Community Support Programs Inc., agreed last year to end its contract with the prison system early, before the pandemic took hold, and a new provider was later selected by officials for the contract that is worth more than $50 million annually.\n\nThe early release from Connections' contract came after lawsuits filed by people like the family of Luis Cabrera, who died in pain of a perforated ulcer as the prison health care providers \"negligently\" failed to render aid, according to his lawsuit.\n\nCabrera's family settled last year, but another federal lawsuit by an employee that tried to blow a whistle on the alleged negligence surrounding his death continues in the courts.\n\nLynn said the focus of the committee will be on COVID-19 related issues, but prior issues may come up as \"historical precedence.\"\n\nA final draft of the resolution circulated Tuesday night included sponsors from both parties.\n\nRESOLUTION: Lawsuit over a son's cancer death in prison ends\n\nAt a press conference regarding the state's larger COVID-19 response, Gov. John Carney, who appointed DeMatteis as head of the state's correction system, stated that she has done a \"really good job\" managing the pandemic behind bars.\n\nHe added that it's \"always difficult to sort out fact from fiction\" regarding complaints by prisoners.\n\n\"I get my facts from the commissioner and I know in any kind of inquiry legislators would get the facts from her as well,\" Carney said.\n\nHe said he was not aware of the draft resolution when asked Tuesday.\n\nThe resolution is one of two proposed laws relevant to COVID-19 and prisons filed ahead of the General Assembly's coming legislative session.\n\nThe other, House Bill 37, would give early release to some inmates who have served time during the pandemic.\n\nThat legislation would create a \"public health emergency credit\" for Delaware prisoners by providing six months of credit off their sentence for each month they've been imprisoned during the pandemic. The benefit would be capped at erasing one year.\n\nRep. Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle, who is the legislation's primary sponsor, was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe synopsis on the legislation states that the credit would have the \"practical effect\" of moving forward release dates for inmates with less than a year remaining in prison thus reducing the prison population. This will relieve pressure on staff and create \"better conditions for those that remain incarcerated to socially distance,\" the legislation states.\n\nFamilies and advocates like the local American Civil Liberties Union have been calling for such actions since the beginning of the pandemic. They argue that social distancing is impossible in the close quarters of prison.\n\nCorrection officials said they are working to tally the number of inmates that would immediately benefit from the change.\n\nWhen asked what position Correction's leadership has taken on the proposal, a spokesperson said the department is \"mindful that the lengths of prison sentences are set by the courts,\" not by correction officials.\n\nThe statement stated that \"significant sudden adjustments to court-ordered release dates for large numbers of inmates\" may impact court-ordered treatment provided to prisoners and reentry planning. It would also \"drive the need\" for additional parole \"resources.\"\n\nThe statement did not indicate a specific position in favor or against the legislation.\n\nDeMatteis has previously said such actions are \"not justified\" and that the state's prisons are not overcrowded.\n\nSpokespersons for Carney did not reply to an email seeking his position on the legislation. Previously, he said he does not believe releasing prisoners is necessary.\n\nOn Tuesday, he said the prison population is already down partially because the wheels of the court system have largely halted without the ability to call jurors during the pandemic.\n\n\"We are not detaining the number of inmates that they normally would,\" Carney said. \"That is frankly creating some issues in some communities in my view with respect to the violence we are seeing on the streets.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on specific communities or instances of violence.\n\nWhile the legislation would have the effect of releasing prisoners who have a year or less remaining, the bill's synopsis says it is also intended to recognize \"that the conditions of confinement during a public health emergency like the current one can be considered significantly more punishing.\"\n\nPrison visitation has been on hold and opportunities for programming and reduction of a prisoner's sentence through work assignments have also been disrupted.\n\nColburn, the prisoner at Vaughn, said when he tested positive for COVID-19 last month, he was moved from Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington to the Smyrna-area prison where he is housed in more restrictive conditions than the lockup he earned through good behavior and participation in prison programming.\n\n\"It is unfair that we are being treated the way we are being treated,\" he said.\n\nHe said some inmates, including himself, have been hesitant to admit they have symptoms fearing their housing assignment and work opportunities will be put to the side during a series of indefinite quarantines some feel amount to \"punishment.\"\n\nHe has a year left on his sentence and would benefit from the early release.\n\n\"We are still human,\" he said in a phone interview Tuesday night. \"No matter how you look at it, we are part of the human race.\"\n\nHe said there are many prisoners who consider themselves rehabilitated, have completed prison programming, but are now serving what he referred to as \"dead time\" just waiting for the expiration of their sentence.\n\n\"I have done a lot to reform myself and become a better person,\" Colburn said. \"What is the difference of me getting out now or 12 months from now?\"\n\nThe early-release legislation has been assigned to a committee, but it is unclear when it might move forward.\n\nIf you are a prisoner in Delaware, you can contact reporter Xerxes Wilson by searching for xwilson@delawareonline.com in the Getting Out email app. Prison officers and staffers may contact reporter Xerxes Wilson by emailing the same address.

The state continues to keep taxpayers in the dark by dodging questions about how Delaware oversees contracts.\n\nThe records provided to Delaware Online/The News Journal included financial audits conducted by an outside accountant hired by Connections; “monitoring desk reviews” that only go back to late 2019; and “residential site cost reconciliation” documents, which provide an accounting of costs associated with Connections’ residential facilities, but no scrutiny on the operations.\n\nEARLIER REPORTING: Despite mounting evidence, Connections dodged state scrutiny for years\n\nNONPROFIT REWARDS LEADERS:While feds say Connections was falsifying documents, nonprofit was rewarding top leaders\n\nFORMER EMPLOYEE CONVICTED: Former Connections nurse convicted of falsifying records, lying to investigators about inmate death\n\nState agencies contracting with Connections relied on the nonprofit self-reporting financial issues and non-compliance with state and federal regulations to ensure millions of state tax dollars were spent appropriately.\n\nIf any independent oversight was exercised, state officials have been reticent to say, avoiding specific questions about scrutiny of vendor contracts.\n\nWhile auditing and oversight requirements for Connections as well as state authorities are outlined in several contracts the health department had with the nonprofit, the state did not provide any records of “independent peer reviews” – an oversight measure outlined in a Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health contract with Connections that expired in March this year.\n\nDHSS spokeswoman Jill Fredel in an email in response to a list of detailed questions, said, “provider management is an important priority” for the department.\n\n“Contract monitoring requirements may vary based upon the division procuring the service, type of service, funding source, or federal requirements,” she said in the emailed statement. “Across the department, we have recognized the need for strong contract monitoring and have been working to centralize business operations to maximize our resources, maintain consistency across our divisions, and ensure accountability.”\n\nAfter this article was published Thursday to DelawareOnline.com, DHSS provided answers to some follow-up questions.\n\nThe department defended including provisions within Connections' contracts to prevent the release of records to the public.\n\n\"These complaints remain confidential due to the compelling state interests in keeping informants and complainants protected, ensuring the integrity of its investigatory functions, and the provision of a robust and frank opportunity for complainants to reported alleged misconduct,\" Fredel said, citing a provision within state public records' access that allows department's to withhold \"investigatory files.\"\n\nWhen asked why officials couldn't redact identifying information so the public could access contract compliance audits, Fredel said they are \"abiding by what the courts have ruled.\"\n\nJohn Flaherty, a member of Delaware Coalition for Open Government, said the department could easily redact any names and identifying information. It's the substance of the audit or complaint that the public is interested in, he said.\n\n\"I would say that the state is obstructing what should be the legal dissemination of public documents here by making up this mythical investigatory files,\" he said. 'If that’s the case, then everything they provide could be an investigatory file, it could be potential litigation and it goes on and on and on.\"\n\nLimited oversight was initially baked into the contract Connections had with the Department of Correction to provide mental health, substance abuse and physical health services to Delaware’s prisoners.\n\nThat practice hasn’t changed, even despite a 2019 Delaware Online/The News Journal investigation revealing the lack of oversight in relation to claims that Connections falsified medical records.\n\n“To the extent permissible under 29 Del. C. 10001, et. Seq., the parties of this agreement shall preserve in strict confidence any information, reports or documents obtained, assembled or prepared in connection with the performance of this agreement,” a confidentiality clause baked into a contract awarded to Connections for adult withdrawal services in Kent and Sussex counties reads.\n\nProtected from scrutiny\n\nWhen Connections first took over healthcare in Delaware’s prisons in 2012, the contract signed with the Department of Correction restricted the state’s ability to watch what the nonprofit was doing, preventing the department from using data or information that Connections had already covered in its own reviews.\n\nQuality assurance audits that DOC was required to do were abandoned shortly after the contract was signed, leaving the only scrutiny of Connections operations to be conducted by the nonprofit itself. These “peer review reports” conducted by Connections, however, are blocked from public scrutiny, according to DOC’s denial to release the records in April 2019.\n\nAt the time, DOC Healthcare Services Chief Marc Richman said he didn’t know why the state would limit its own auditing operations and acknowledged that future contracts could remove or alter those provisions.\n\n2019 INVESTIGATION: Prison contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment, sources say\n\nPRISON CONTRACT ENDS: Connections Community Support Programs to exit Delaware prisons amid controversies\n\nYet, other state departments followed suit, crafting contracts with Connections that included language to keep any records and reports related to evaluating the nonprofit’s performance confidential.\n\nDelaware is not known for accountability and oversight, nor for transparency. Independent studies have consistently ranked the state among the bottom nationwide for government transparency and accountability.\n\nThe First State’s Freedom of Information Act has several carveouts that government entities use to block access to public records, including any documents part of an “open investigation” or pending or potential litigation, police personnel records and arrest reports. FOIA also allows agencies to charge requesters exorbitant fees for reviewing records to ensure they are responsive to the request.\n\nThese FOIA exemptions give government agencies an \"out\" to deny a request, but it is not a requirement. The language in the Connections' contracts makes it a requirement to not release the information.\n\nThe health department initially demanded a nearly $2,000 payment to search for all financial audits and program reviews of Connections’ contracts. Its FOIA coordinator ignored requests to have a conversation about the records to help par down the request, ultimately leading to the news outlet appealing the decision to the state Attorney General, who ruled in the state department’s favor.\n\nIt took several months of back-and-forth with state health officials and FOIA coordinators to gain access to any responsive records, and questions regarding how those records show the state’s oversight of Connections still linger.\n\nState departments have broad and varying interpretations of what records are publicly accessible, said Flaherty, the open government advocate. For example, a records request Flaherty sent to seven different agencies yielded seven different responses, he said.\n\n\"Each agency interprets the law as they see fit, and in most cases they err on the side of secrecy because they don’t want embarrassing admissions to become public,\" Flaherty said of Delaware's approach to transparency and public records release. \"Just because it embarrasses state officials, doesn’t mean they can hide from public disclosure.\"\n\nThe only state oversight gleaned from the provided documents is from a late-2020 desk review conducted by the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health on a recovery services program for men.\n\nAt the time, the contract compliance officer reported Connections could not provide any documentation nor the clients or employees to confirm $71,301 in charges to the state in December 2019.\n\n“Non-compliance was determined when no documentation was submitted that supported the invoiced amount,” wrote Teena Nelson, the officer who reviewed Connections’ operations, in a Nov. 23, 2020 letter to then-CEO Bill Northey. “Connections was unable to provide documentation that services were rendered to clients.”\n\nNelson recommended a unique corrective action plan that would address the billing discrepancies, according to the letter acquired through a FOIA request.\n\nAnother desk review of the adult withdrawal management services in Kent and Sussex counties conducted by Nelson in February 2021 found no issues with those charges.\n\nWhen asked why there were no desk reviews conducted prior to 2020, DHSS reiterated its previous response that it was working to improve oversight of its contracts. The department has never indicated desk reviews were performed prior to then.\n\nDelaware lawmakers recognize the need to strengthen the state’s oversight of outside vendors’ stewardship of tax dollars but have made few moves to tackle the issue legislatively.\n\n“We believe strongly in the need for the state of Delaware to constantly and vigorously re-examine whether tax dollars are being spent appropriately and efficiently, particularly when those resources are being directed to third-party vendors for services so many of our neighbors depend on,” state senators Sarah McBride and Kyle Evans Gay wrote in a joint, emailed statement in response to News Journal requests for interviews with the lawmakers.\n\nThey said they are “confident – based on our ongoing conversations – that the executive branch is engaging in a thoughtful and thorough review to determine where those oversight responsibilities fell short.”\n\nGov. John Carney's office declined to comment for this story, redirecting reporters to the emailed statement from the health department, which answered hardly any of the News Journal's questions.\n\nIt's unclear what, if anything, Carney's administration has done to strengthen oversight of third-party contracts.\n\nFlaherty said recent moves in Delaware government suggest the state continues to shift further away from transparency.\n\nHe pointed to a public-private entity created to develop recommendations for increasing efficiency and effectiveness of state government, called the Government Efficiency and Accountability Review Board as well as the Delaware Prosperity Partnership as examples of quasigovernment entities that lack transparency.\n\n\"It seems like both of them were formed to shield the public from prying into the activities of how these groups work,\" Flaherty said. \"That is not a good sign. We need to have more disclosure, not less.\"\n\nConnections’ responsibilities\n\nStates and the federal government have a mutual responsibility to ensure the proper distribution of Medicaid and Medicare payments, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut since state Medicaid programs contract and approve the providers, the states have a closer relationship with them and can ensure accountability far better than federal entities. Federal Medicaid dollars flow through the state to its contracted providers.\n\n“This means the responsibility for making proper payments in Medicaid primarily lies with the states since they receive claims from their approved providers to be reimbursed for the cost of Medicaid-approved treatment and services,” said a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nFederal attorneys involved in the case against Connections said providers go through an extensive certification process and the requirements to ensure compliance are well known, but at the end of the day, it’s up to the provider to follow the rules.\n\n“At a minimum, we expect organizations and their staff to comply with the requirements under the False Claims and Controlled Substances Acts,” U.S. Attorney David Weiss said.\n\nAnd the contracts Connections had with the state spelled out the nonprofit’s obligations and responsibilities, including providing access to financial and patient records to state representatives to review contract compliance; submitting timely invoices to the state for reimbursement; and ensuring adequate and appropriate staffing, among others.\n\n“The services performed by vendor under this agreement shall be subject to review for compliance with the terms of this agreement by Delaware’s designated representatives,” one Connections contract stated, adding: “It is understood that Delaware’s representatives’ review comments do not relieve vendor from the responsibility for the professional and technical accuracy of all work delivered under this agreement.”\n\nBut Connections didn’t provide internal oversight and quality assurance. Instead, the nonprofit relied on the state alerting them to any issues.\n\nA patient care ombudsman appointed to review Connections operations during the bankruptcy proceeding discovered it “relied on the state to provide feedback as to whether the debtor was in compliance.” The ombudsman concluded the nonprofit’s reliance on the state to ensure compliance was a “significant and material deficiency in the overall operations” of Connections.\n\nThe contracts allowed Delaware to withhold funding if Connections failed in its obligations or neglected to provide required records.\n\nInstead of using that authority, health department officials said they work with the vendors if there are financial or operational issues.\n\n“DHSS and other state agencies work with those organizations to ensure that quality of care and services to clients do not suffer,” department spokesperson Fredel said. “If a provider must cease delivery of services for whatever reason, our agency works with the provider to make sure the transition of services does not negatively affect our clients.”\n\nGot a tip?

Shame for his daughter, who grew up without her dad. And shame for himself, for changing his life for the worse before being granted the opportunity to change his life for the better.\n\nAs holidays approach, Delaware inmates' families distraught about out-of-state moves\n\nThe road ahead\n\nForeman's battle isn't over yet.\n\nDelaware's recidivism rate for those returning to society after incarceration is extremely high.\n\nA state report published last year shows that 45 percent of inmates released in 2013 were back in prison within a year, and almost two-thirds were back behind bars after three years. That rate has increased to 76 percent in recent years, said Priscilla Turgon. She is executive director of Project New Start – the re-entry program Foreman, along with six others, completed the week before Christmas.\n\nNow, Foreman's got to find housing, which can be difficult for a wheelchair-bound man convicted of a felony. He needs a job, one that will allow him to make an honest wage.\n\nBut unlike many men and women coming out of Delaware and federal prisons, Foreman is armed with the skills he gained through Project New Start, a small but successful program slowing chipping away at Delaware's battle with recidivism.\n\n\"The program shares things with you that you don't normally see growing up in the inner city,\" Foreman said. \"It gives you structure that no one has ever shared with you. It gives you a foundation and an approach that you've never experienced before.\"\n\nWhat is Project New Start?\n\nThe program, championed by Turgon and Assistant Director Brian Alleyne, is extremely selective: More than 40 people interviewed to join. Of those, 12 were selected. Seven graduated last week.\n\nParticipants spend 375 hours together over 10 weeks learning cognitive behavioral change, parenting, financial literacy, conflict resolution and technology training. They also receive certifications in forklift operating safety, OSHA and ServSafe, making them immediately employable to many job opportunities in the state.\n\n\"This here is a solution to that problem\" of mass incarceration, said New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer.\n\nIn prosecution over fatal prison riot at Vaughn, defense costs exceed $680,000\n\n\"All of us here, we're here because we're behind you and we support you,\" he added. \"We're in an incredible time where there are over seven million unfilled jobs across the country ... and what you're doing is not just about getting that job. You can get a job, but it's about finding a career.\"\n\nTo ensure that participants gain those skills, Project New Start relies heavily on partnerships with local employers, as well as the Delaware Law School, Alternatives to Violence Project and many others.\n\nMost provide their services free of charge to the program, which relies on grant funding and private fundraising to operate its classes, Turgon said.\n\nSo, does it work?\n\nThe results are good.\n\nThough selective and small in its numbers, 61 of the 66 graduates of Project New Start through September have secured employment and 78 percent of participants have not been reconvicted or recommitted.\n\nThis is important given the efforts Gov. John Carney recently announced to focus closely on re-entry for those coming out of Delaware prisons.\n\nIn an executive order signed earlier this month, Carney created a commission to study how to help state prisoners successfully re-enter back into society. Turgon, who has operated Project New Start since 2013, was not invited to the table for this initiative, she said.\n\nCarney's executive order aims at coordinating services more effectively, strengthening data sharing between agencies and ensuring inmates have access to programs before they're already out of prison.\n\nDelaware officials eye re-entry help for prison inmates before their release\n\n\"We need to be successful\" in Delaware prisons, Carney said at the signing. \"And we're not doing a very good job.\"\n\nInmates are often released with little information about where to go and often with nothing more than the clothes on their backs, despite the time of year or weather.\n\nThis uncertainty often leaves offenders with few options, said Anthony Miller, another participant who spoke at the program's graduation ceremony last week.\n\n\"Before I was released ... I felt kind of scared and hopeless about making the transition back to society,\" Miller said. \"And each day that I came through these doors and saw somebody coming in and educating us ... it gave me hope that I could make it, succeed and the more powerful desire to be a better person.\"\n\nDefining their futures\n\nSeven people – six men and one woman – graduated from the most recent class of Project New Start.\n\nAmong them sat aspiring writers, construction workers, peer specialists and most of all, men and women determined to be productive members of society.\n\nUntil they find that job, they'll keep the support of Project New Start and its staff. Twice a week, participants will check in for their intensive individualized job searches, which they'll navigate with the help of the program.\n\nAnd once employed, they'll have the structured support of Project New Start for at least 12 months – and if they want it, they'll keep it forever, Turgon said.\n\nTheir success helps define the future of Project New Start, too, as the program relies on its statistics to garner dollars, partnerships and support from local, county and state officials.\n\n\"There is a lot riding on your success,\" Attorney General Matt Denn said. \"You are really standing on the shoulders of people who have gone before you ... and the reason so many people got involved is because they saw the success of it.\"\n\nForeman already has a certification from the state to be a peer specialist. Others have job prospects waiting in the wings.\n\n\"I want to give back to my community and give back to people because people are crying,\" Foreman said. \"People are in need out in the streets.\"\n\nNow though, these men and women of Project New Start have hope.\n\n\"For people like me, where I came from, like she said, the recidivism rate, usually you go back in within the next three years,\" Miller said. \"So a lot of us, we don't have no hope. It seems like nobody gonna help us and we turn back into who we used to be.\n\nBut through this program and through these supporters, I feel like this time, I'll be all right.\"\n\nDELAWARE'S PRISON SYSTEM\n\nHad it not been for this attorney, Elmer Daniels might still be in jail.

All were reversed due to a \"robust interprofessional team-based effort,\" the report said.\n\nBACKGROUND:Inmate's fatal overdose shows how easy it is to get drugs into prison\n\nBut there is no comprehensive data among the prisons that documents the doses of naloxone administered to inmates at each facility, the trends of how this medication is being administered, or an assessment of how other interventions aimed at stopping overdoses are working, according to the report.\n\n\"Knowing process or outcome related data, along with some other basic analytics, are fundamental requirements to understand the extent of any potential opportunity and to begin to create effective solutions,\" the report said.\n\nImproving the prison healthcare system is exactly why DeMatteis requested that ChristianaCare come into the state prison facilities and independently review the medical and behavioral healthcare systems.\n\nWhile the report highlights areas where there DOC is doing well, DeMatteis said it also provides a roadmap on how to improve healthcare services to the more than 5,000 people in custody.\n\nDeMatteis listed eight ares that the department will prioritize, including:\n\nRestructuring the DOC healthcare bureau to focus on such things as compliance, quality and medical staff proficiency.\n\nDeveloping, tracking and analyzing how offenders are being treated and how effective their treatment is.\n\nFixing the electronic health record system.\n\nRecruiting, retraining and rewarding staff that embrace a culture of safety, quality and performance.\n\n\"We now will be focused on acting to making the necessary improvements that it highlights over the coming months,\" DeMatteis said. \"This is a manageable challenge and the improvements will benefit offenders, our medical and behavioral health teams, counselors and correctional officers alike.\"\n\nThe team from Christiana, however, “was not reviewing compliance with industry/regulatory standards, disease specific treatment protocols/guidelines used within the facility, or patient specific treatment.”\n\nChristianaCare has no prior experience with prison healthcare, which is why the review was focused more on practice rather than industry standards, according to the report.\n\nThe report's inception raised eyebrows statewide as the contracted healthcare provider Connections has come under increased scrutiny this year.\n\nIn May, the state Department of Justice said it was investigating Connections Community Support Programs, which provides physical and mental health care to all inmates in Delaware’s state-run prison system.\n\nBACKGROUND:After reports of record falsification, Department of Justice investigating Connections prison services\n\nNews of that probe came after The News Journal published an investigation into reports that the contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment at Crest South, a taxpayer-funded substance abuse program for drug offenders in Georgetown.\n\nNo further information on that investigation has been released.\n\nThe ChristianaCare report did note that more money is needed to address some of the physical and technological barriers to care.\n\nBut it also stressed that money alone won't solve the problems currently inhibiting access to care in the state-run prisons.\n\nFor Dover attorney Stephen Hampton, a vocal critic of the Delaware prisons who also has multiple lawsuits against the DOC, it's going to take a lot more than money and recommendations to make a change in the prison system.\n\n\"This is written like an academic report identifying problems, but it tells you in general terms aspirational goals,\" he said. \"That's all well and good but there is no specific concrete plan on how to fix anything.\"\n\nGot information on what's going on in Delaware's prison system?

Like the rest of the neighborhood, this area is populated by genteel homes that exhibit some of the area’s finest architecture. New to the market, this residence at 917 Stuart Road is a prime example.\n\nThe three-story home has all the meticulous details that were so prized at the time it was built. With the opening of Colonial Williamsburg in the 1930s, builders were fascinated by Colonial Revival style. In Wilmington, designs usually showcased stone facades instead of brick. In the 1930s and 1940s, owners also wanted exquisite woodwork and entertaining spaces. This home has all of the above.\n\nBut it also has the features that are so favored by today’s homebuyers. Masterful renovations have transformed many bathrooms. The kitchen has undergone renovations. There have been carefully considered additions over the years, as well as new systems.\n\nThe seven-bedroom home rests on just over an acre, making it one of the largest parcels in Westover Hills. The home is perfectly situated on the sweeping grounds for maximum curb appeal. A neat stacked-stone fence and tidy shrubbery accent the front yard. The attention to detail and the well-kept appointments set the tone for the rest of the home.\n\nAs with any classic Colonial Revival residence, you’ll find symmetrically placed windows with white paneled shutters on the bottom and black louvered shutters on top. The seller replaced 22 shutters last fall.\n\nA glass vestibule is both pretty and practical, and the glossy front door opens to a true center hall – you can see straight through to the entrance of the conservatory, which has an exposed stone wall and a glass roof with retractable shades. Like the front glass enclosure, the conservatory, which has a tiled stone floor, is elegant and utilitarian. It leads to the courtyard in the back and the three-car garage.\n\nThere’s an easy flow to the floor plan on both sides of the entrance hall. The formal living room, which has a gas fireplace, has a stunning antique lighting fixture. There are more antique fixtures in the dining room, and the seller has replaced all of the fixtures in the home.\n\nThe living room leads to the sunroom that spans nearly the width of the house. In addition to the windows, which overlook the heated pool and manicured lawn, there are sunlights for an abundance of natural light.\n\nThe sunroom has a wood-burning fireplace in the exposed stone wall and wet bar with marble countertop, sink and beverage fridge. It’s ideal for casual entertaining – indoors or out. Doors open to the slate patio, which receives shade from a retractable awning. (The sunroom’s roof was new in 2012.)\n\nThe office adjoining the sunroom also has a door to the backyard for quick dips in the pool or to receive guests. Because the office is next to a full bathroom with a heated marble floor and Rohl Perrin & Rowe fixtures, the room could also be a beautiful first-floor suite.\n\nA half-bathroom is convenient to the family room, which has a walk-in closet with shelves for games, toys and DVDs. Although designed for family time, the space is equally as refined as the rest of the home.\n\nLinked by the entrance hall and conservatory, the other side of the home is just as magnificent. The formal dining room, which has French doors to the conservatory and smooth Venetian plaster walls, is steps from a climate-controlled wine cellar, which is cleverly tucked under the staircase.\n\nThere is also a door from the dining room to the generously sized butler’s pantry, which is equipped with a sink, a built-in desk for household tasks or homework, a beverage fridge and an icemaker. A built-in china cabinet faces the opening to the main kitchen area, which is flanked by corner cabinet built-ins for dishes.\n\nThere’s ample storage in the kitchen, including drawers and cabinets in the island. This light-filled space also includes two ovens and a gas cooktop. A handy granite-topped ledge over the stainless-steel sink can hold potted herbs and plants. There’s also an informal dining area.\n\nTake the back staircase or the formal staircase to the second story, where two secondary bedrooms share a Jack-and-Jill bathroom with luxurious marble appointments, from the floor to the vanity to the shower walls. A princess suite has an en-suite bathroom, outfitted with an onyx vanity and marble floor.\n\nThe owner’s suite boasts a dressing area with custom closets, which opens to a luxurious bathroom with a custom two-basin marble vanity, a marble-surround soaking tub, radiant heat and a large shower. Like all the renovated bathrooms, this private retreat has Rohl Perrin & Rowe fixtures.\n\nA door in the dressing section leads to a spiral staircase to the pool and patio area for morning swims. This floor also has a gym, located next to another full bathroom and laundry area. Use it as a bedroom, if you wish.\n\nOn the third floor, there are two rooms for use as bedrooms, an artist’s loft, a gym or a yoga studio – it’s your choice. Because there’s a full bathroom on this level, the floor offers a myriad of possibilities.\n\nThroughout most of the home, you’ll find hardwood floors – they’re new in the gym, back bedroom and laundry area.

Tigani agreed in the spring of 2007 to buy the property, then began making extensive renovations on the Tudor-style house, including demolition of an extension, according to court documents. A year later, Tigani \"renounced the deal,\" leaving the 1920 house \"in a state of disarray,\" the documents say.\n\nHynansky first filed a lawsuit against Tigani and N.K.S. – a Tigani family beer distributorship that Chris once headed – in Superior Court in 2008.\n\nIn February, Hynansky separately sued N.K.S. in Delaware Court of Chancery over the same transaction, alleging Tigani and N.K.S. are \"alter egos\" in the transaction. N.K.S., near New Castle, is the long-time exclusive distributor of Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. products in Delaware.\n\nHynansky's suit alleged Tigani used N.K.S. and its assets \"in a sophisticated shell game to convince the world that Tigani had the wherewithal to support his lifestyle.\"\n\n\"Tigani's use of NKS assets as his own worked as a fraud on Hynansky and inflicted an injustice,\" Hynansky said in his February lawsuit.\n\nTigani vigorously denied the allegations. But in the last two weeks, they settled both cases.\n\nJeffrey Weiner, a Wilmington attorney representing Hynansky, said \"the parties have amicably resolved the dispute(s) and the claims have been dismissed.\"\n\n\"It's been a long time, but it's finally done,\" Hynansky, 72, said Wednesday from Kiev, Ukraine. \"I have ton of companies in the Ukraine and I have other things to do.\"\n\nFor Tigani, the case settlements mark the end of a long legal saga that resulted in revelations about his lifestyle and business dealings.\n\nTigani pleaded guilty in 2011 to campaign finance fraud and tax evasion, was sentenced to two years in federal prison and served his time.\n\nHe now heads World Class Wholesale, a liquor distributorship near New Castle.\n\n\"I am happy this chapter is over and we can all move forward,\" Tigani said Friday.\n\nLawyers for N.K.S. said the company does not comment on lawsuits.\n\nDu Pont estate\n\nThe saga of a lawsuit over a Chateau Country estate once owned by du Pont family members exposed how Delaware's insulated world of big money sometimes did business.\n\nIn the years leading up to the house deal, Hynansky and Tigani were friendly. Both were big names in the Delaware business community and ran prominent family businesses.\n\n\"Among other things, the two men explored numerous joint investment opportunities,\" the more-recent lawsuit says.\n\nAt one point, the two co-owned a corporate jet.\n\nThey owned homes near each other in the exclusive Greenville area. Hynansky had been living in a nearly 12,000-square-foot house on Kennett Pike that he and his wife Deanna bought in 1983 for $569,875. But with their 2005 divorce, the plan was to sell the house as part of the property distribution, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"When Tigani learned the home might be for sale, he begged Hynansky to sell it to him, describing it as 'the best property in Delaware,' \" the same lawsuit alleged.\n\nBy spring 2007, Hynansky and Tigani agreed for Tigani to take immediate possession of the six-bedroom, six-bathroom house, with its sale to close in two years, court papers say.\n\nIn the meantime, Tigani would pay monthly rent plus three lump-sum payments of $500,000 toward the purchase price, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe first lump sum would be paid through elimination of a $440,000 debt Hynansky owed on his purchase of N.K.S.'s interest in the jet, court papers say.\n\nIn addition, the deal called for N.K.S. to lease part of 240,000-square-foot warehouse in Dover owned by Sunstar Ventures LLC, a Hynansky-owned entity. The rent for both properties was set to approximate interest on the $5 million home.\n\nThe deal also called for one of Hynansky's dealerships to transfer a Porsche for Tigani to use, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOnce the leases expired on the home and warehouse, Tigani would take legal title to the home and pay the remaining $3.5 million balance, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"Tigani celebrated the agreement by causing N.K.S. to bestow a gift of expensive wine on Hynansky ...,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nDeal falls apart\n\nOnce the deal was struck, Hynansky gave Tigani keys to the Kennett Pike home.\n\n\"Tigani promptly brought in designers and began extensive renovations of the home,\" the lawsuit says. \"He tore down an extension in the rear of the home, ripped out landscaping, began changing the configuration of the large built-in pool and made modifications to virtually every element and room of the home.\"\n\nCourt documents allege Tigani \"caused N.K.S. to pay over $100,000 to third-party contractors\" for the renovations.\n\nTen months later, Tigani renounced the deal, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"He terminated the uncompleted work on the home, leaving the premises in a state of disarray,\" according to the suit.\n\nRent on the home never was paid, nor were any lump sum payments, according to the lawsuit. N.K.S. did not pay rent on the Dover warehouse, Hynansky's suit alleged.\n\n\"Tigani went so far as to demand that Hynansky reimburse the costs of the unfinished renovations,\" his suit says.\n\nTigani denied all of Hynansky's allegations.\n\nIn 2008, Tigani's lawyer called them \"baseless\" and an \"undignified attempt to exact revenge.\"\n\nTigani countered at the time that the renovations were being directed by an employee of Hynansky and his construction company, with Hynansky's oversight.\n\nHome goes back\n\nTigani ended up buying a Westover Hills mansion, formerly owned by MBNA America founder Charles Cawley, in June 2008.\n\nIn a nasty 2010 court battle with his father, Robert Tigani, over control of the family's liquor business, Chris Tigani testified that the fight with his father erupted when he bought the 24,000-square-foot Cawley mansion.\n\nThat, Tigani testified, sent his father \"over the edge.\"\n\nHis father fired him from the third-generation liquor distributorship in 2009. The Westover Hills mansion went into foreclosure days after Tigani's one-year mortgage loan came due in 2009, according to court documents.\n\nChris Tigani filed for bankruptcy in 2010, just hours before a sheriff's sale of the Westover Hills house was to take place. After a bankruptcy court judge ruled that Wilmington Trust could proceed with the sheriff's sale, the former Cawley house went to Wilmington Trust for $2.1 million the next year.\n\nThe house today\n\nHynansky alleged in his most-recent lawsuit that he was \"forced to reacquire\" his Kennett Pike home in the middle of major, uncompleted renovations.\n\n\"At a time when the market for high-end residences was in a sustained downturn,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nToday, the Kennett Pike home is owned by Hynansky's son, Michael, and Michael's wife, Ericka, according to New Castle County property records. The house is in excellent condition, the records say.\n\nIn 2010, Hynansky told The News Journal he spent about $700,000 renovating the house.\n\nHis son now runs the Winner automobile business, he said, and he runs the Ukrainian real estate, automobile and construction businesses.\n\nHynansky said he pursued the litigation for seven years for one simple reason: \"I have my own principles.\"\n\nContact Maureen Milford at (302) 324-2881 or mmilford@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/real-estate/2024/07/02/see-inside-top-wilmington-delaware-homes-for-sale-including-one-over-3-million-dollars/74266698007/", "title": "See inside top Wilmington homes for sale, one over $3 million", "text": "Historic mansions updated with modern conveniences and newer suburban retreats are among the most expensive homes for sale in the Wilmington area.\n\nWhat attracts prospective buyers to the largest city in the First State?\n\nA major lure is the opportunity for employment with some of the largest businesses in the world.

{"question_id": "20241227_5", "search_time": "2024/12/28/00:04", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/joe-biden/2024/07/21/president-joe-biden-suspends-bid-for-re-election/74292559007/", "title": "Delaware's own Joe Biden drops out of presidential race, citing 'best ...", "text": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., the 46th president of the United States and highest U.S. political office holder in Delaware history, announced Sunday that he will withdraw his bid for reelection.\n\nThe announcement comes after a growing chorus of calls for the president to step down as he otherwise remained resolute about staying in the race, as well as three weeks after a debate that left allies, donors and Americans unsure about the president's fitness for another term.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a written statement. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nHe quickly threw his endorsement behind Vice President Kamala Harris in a separate announcement shortly after the publication of his full letter on X.\n\nThe winding political ascent of Delaware’s best-known and adopted political son to the Oval Office started with a New Castle County Council win in 1970, a rare Democrat win that year, which took only 10,573 votes to secure.\n\nIn 2020, he earned more than 76 million votes nationwide to defeat Donald Trump to win the presidency, the most ever in American history. He is also the oldest president in the nation's history.\n\nAn influential U.S. senator for 36 years before serving two terms as vice president beside Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, he twice ran for president and failed before he finally found success against Trump.\n\nIt was fitting that the 2020 election, reshaped by COVID-19, forced the Biden campaign to headquarter in Delaware, nearly making the state an unofficial running mate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's official unveiling was at A.I. du Pont High School in Greenville, Biden met with community and religious leaders in the wake of George Floyd's killing at Wilmington's Bethel AME Church, and the Democratic National Convention abandoned Milwaukee for the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. In between were Wilmington campaign events at The Queen, Delaware Museum of Natural History, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center and the Hotel du Pont.\n\nTen years earlier, Wilmington was also where then-President-elect Obama picked up Biden on a whistle-stop train tour in 2009, en route to the inauguration in Washington.\n\nIt was as vice president alongside Obama when Biden and his oversized personality first found widespread fame outside of the world of politics.\n\nPart of Biden's charm is his Everyman demeanor and not just because of his glad-handing or gift of gab.\n\nIt is also for decisions like having the U.S. Secret Service hang back when he made his rounds at hometown spots like a Capriotti’s sandwich shop, Happy Harry’s pharmacy, Brew HaHa! coffeehouse or University of Delaware football games as vice president, so as not to make them an “embarrassing” event.\n\nBiden (finally) wins the White House\n\nWhen Biden lifted his right hand for the oath of office and said, \"I do solemnly swear,\" he was also marking his sixth decade in politics.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person ever to be sworn in and arguably the most prepared, given his experience.\n\nAfter eight years as Obama’s No. 2 and “the last guy in the room” for every major decision Obama made, he finally shook Obama's long shadow when he became the man to beat Trump.\n\nIt started with him beating out nearly 30 fellow Democratic candidates in the primary, the largest field in decades, after jumping into the race late, declaring in March 2019. In the end, Biden became the presumptive nominee when Sen. Bernie Sanders, the last candidate in the race, suspended his campaign in April 2020.\n\nThe key to Biden's win came in South Carolina where he won nearly 50% of the vote, buoyed by the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn. Even though Biden had won the Iowa caucus, his South Carolina win came after Sanders won both New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nBy June, Biden passed the threshold of 1,991 delegates to win his party's nomination and made Delaware history as the first Delawarean to be nominated for president.\n\nIn the general election, Biden never trailed Trump, breaking open a double-digit lead nationally down the stretch after Trump's heckling performance in the first debate.\n\nWhile the election was not called on election night due to tight races, Biden passed 270 electoral votes four days later, setting off celebrations nationwide and across Delaware. Backyard fireworks were blasting in the city at the same time as fireworks and a drone-assisted light show lit up the Riverfront as Biden, Harris and their families basked in victory.\n\nBiden's busy term\n\nWhen Biden was sworn in at the U.S. Capitol, it was 14 days after the Jan. 6 insurrection when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the seat of the nation's legislative branch, assaulted police officers and caused lawmakers to flee. While the attack delayed the joint session of Congress to officially certify the election, legislators reconvened that night to finish the job.\n\nBiden's time in office began with a flurry of executive orders, many of which reversed Trump-era orders with the United States rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization.\n\nHe marked the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 by signing his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, the economic stimulus relief package that included direct payments to Americans, as well as an extension of increased unemployment benefits.\n\nFive months later, the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill became law with his signature, and in August 2022, the $750 billion Inflation Reduction Act did the same – a smaller version of Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act.\n\nEarly in his term, Biden's popularity hit a high of nearly 55%, but the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 hastened his already-slow decline in popularity. Televised scenes showed Afghans running alongside American planes transporting some of the more than 120,000 Americans and Afghans from the Kabul airport to safety as the country quickly fell into Taliban hands.\n\nA suicide bombing at the airport during the \"messy\" withdrawal, as Biden himself called it, killed 13 American service members and about 170 Afghans, sparking criticism from nearly all quarters.\n\nThat's when his approval numbers went underwater, hitting a low of 57% disapproval by July 2022 as the country struggled with high inflation and fuel prices as global supply chain problems due to the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine both hindered U.S. economic recovery.\n\nAmong the highlights of his first term so far was uniting NATO and other nations against Russia's war, the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson following Stephen Breyer's retirement and the successful targeting and killing of Al-Qaida leader and Sept. 11 attack planner Ayman al-Zawahir and ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi in separate strikes.\n\nControversies, dissent\n\nThe final year of Biden's term has been rife with growing dissent across the country, with protests surging in reaction to the president's responses – and nonresponses – to wars overseas.\n\nMany have criticized his support of Israel in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, sparking a wave of protests at college campuses across the country in the spring. Biden announced a cease-fire proposal supported by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June, calling for a truce between Israel and Hamas after nine months of fighting.\n\nThe conflict in Palestine was not the only war to characterize Biden's presidency. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the president and his administration have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, approving billions of dollars in aid. The continued support has drawn criticism from some, who argue that the U.S. should not be investing as much in an outside war.\n\nCritical attention has also come to Biden and his family closer to their home in Delaware, as the president's son Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president tried for a crime. A jury of Delawareans determined on June 11 that Hunter Biden committed three felonies when he purchased a gun while actively using drugs. He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n\nWhile the president himself was not involved in the crimes or the trial, many of those opposed to him linked the guilty verdict to him and his administration. Biden said he supported his son in his recovery, but said following the verdict that he would not pardon or commute any sentence given to Hunter Biden.\n\nThroughout his time in the White House, Biden has never been far from home after famously riding Amtrak home from Washington nightly as a U.S. senator. He often vacations at his Henlopen Acres summer house near Rehoboth Beach and comes home often to Greenville where he has been seen taking in a grandchild's game at Sanford School, grabbing a cup of coffee at Brew HaHa! or attending church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine. And whether in Greenville or at the beaches, the Bidens are often seen enjoying their favorite restaurants.\n\nThe temporary traffic backups caused by his motorcade during home state visits have earned a shorthand nickname from many Delawareans, \"Joe jams.\"\n\nHeartbreak in '72\n\nBiden's adult life has been book-ended by family tragedy, starting with the unthinkable in 1972 when his wife of six years, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash that also injured sons Hunter and Beau.\n\nThe accident came a little more than a month after Biden, then 29, scored a major upset against Republican incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs, a statewide officeholder for 26 years. Biden had become the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history.\n\nIt was Dec. 18, 1972 – seven days before Christmas – when the family’s Chevrolet station wagon collided with a tractor-trailer loaded with corncobs at Limestone and Valley roads in Hockessin, not far from where the Hockessin Athletic Club now stands.\n\nHeartbreaking photos by News Journal photographer Fred Comegys from the accident scene showed the devastation.\n\nBiden was interviewing possible staffers in Washington when the crash occurred. Neilia was supposed to join him in the nation’s capital the next day to finalize the purchase of a home there. He immediately flew home on a rented plane and went straight to the hospital.\n\nShe was 30. Biden had celebrated his own 30th birthday a month prior.\n\nWith his sons hospitalized, Biden wasn’t expected at the memorial service for Neilia and little Naomi. But he attended, staring down unspeakable grief as he stood beside the colorful stained-glass windows of St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church on Concord Pike in Talleyville.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 650, he spoke candidly about his “two girls.”\n\nOnly 18 days after the accident, Biden became a U.S. senator.\n\nInstead of the hallowed halls of the U.S. Capitol, Biden placed his left hand on a Bible held by Neilia’s father, Robert Hunter, and raised his right in the chapel of Wilmington Hospital, then called Delaware Division.\n\nIt was after that devastation that Biden decided to remain home in Wilmington and commute daily to Washington on Amtrak, which he continued to do until he joined Obama in D.C. in 2009. That’s when he moved into the official vice-presidential residence at Number One Observatory Circle, still visiting his home state regularly as vice president.\n\nIn his 2008 book, “Promises to Keep,” he detailed the harrowing time, saying he could understand how deep despair could lead some to “just cash it in” and how “suicide wasn’t just an option, but a rational option.”\n\nHe remarried in 1977 to Jill Jacobs, and the couple had one child, Ashley, in 1981.\n\nAnother familial heartbreak\n\nForty-two years after the death of Neilia and Naomi, Delaware would once again grieve alongside Biden when Beau, then 46, succumbed to an aggressive brain tumor.\n\nThe May 2015 death of the Delaware Army National Guard major and former state attorney general who had announced he was going to run to be Delaware’s 74th governor dealt Biden another tragedy to overcome with the world watching.\n\nBiden himself had a pair of cranial aneurysms in 1988, the first of which was near-fatal. He underwent a pair of surgeries that year to repair the damage.\n\nBeau was 46 when he died. And when Biden's win made him the 46th president, noting the coincidence was unavoidable.\n\nBiden rises in the Senate, joins Obama\n\nIn the years between his twin family tragedies, Biden rose to become one of the most influential senators on Capitol Hill, chairing a pair of powerful committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (2001–2003 and 2007–2009) and the Senate Judiciary Committee (1987–1995).\n\nDuring that time, he pushed for NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in the mid-1990s, which was marked by ethnic cleansing and genocide. The intervention led to a 1995 peace agreement and the prosecution of war crimes.\n\nIn 1994, he also pushed the passage of both the largest crime bill in U.S. history and the $1.6 billion Violence Against Women Act, which he had drafted. In 1997, he helped negotiate a chemical weapons ban.\n\nThose years left Biden on a first-name basis with every American politician of note, along with nearly every world leader, eventually placing the self-described “workhorse, not a show horse” in prime position to be picked by the much more inexperienced Obama.\n\nHe was a foreign policy wonk.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2008, Biden was announced officially as Obama’s running mate as national media camped outside his Greenville home on Barley Mill Road. It was a momentous moment of redemption for the two-time presidential election loser, but also a gleaming moment of pride for Delaware with both state Democrats and Republicans cheering his pick.\n\nBiden’s years of watching Washington from the inside, combined with his blue-collar appeal and sturdy campaign skills, helped Obama make history with Biden’s \"white hair waving like a flag of experience,\" The News Journal wrote at the time.\n\nThe workhorse was in full stride during the campaign against Sen. John McCain and Alaskan Gov. Sarah Palin in the 74 days between his selection and Election Day.\n\nHe led about 90 rallies and fundraisers as he crisscrossed the country stumping everywhere from ice cream stands and burger joints to college gymnasiums and retirement villages, visiting more than 20 states and doing more than 200 media interviews.\n\nDuring his time representing the First State, he never faced a serious threat of being voted out. Not in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002 or 2008. He garnered between 58% to 63% of the vote in each reelection race, a testament to his durable statewide support.\n\nAs Biden campaigned with Obama in 2008, Carol E. Hoffecker, a Delaware historian and author of “Democracy in Delaware,” placed Biden’s position in state history thusly: “No one else except Caesar Rodney, who was there at the founding of the nation, is historically more significant than Joe Biden.”\n\nWith his election as president of the United States, Biden's place atop Delaware history was unofficially enshrined.\n\nVice President Biden as 'last one in the room'\n\nAfter the pair defeated McCain and Palin on Nov. 5, 2008, Obama’s East Coast whistle-stop tour in a 1930 Pullman car en route to the inauguration in Washington pulled into Wilmington Train Station. Two years later, it would be renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station.\n\nThousands swarmed the train on that 19-degree day to send off the state’s most favored son, along with the president-elect.\n\nBiden repeated his well-known line, “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,” to the cheering crowd.\n\nThree days later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens was swearing in Biden as 1.8 million people, the largest inauguration crowd in American history, looked on in freezing temperatures.\n\nBiden reveled in his active role in the administration. He oversaw the 2009 economic stimulus and the draw-down of troops in Iraq in 2010 while also negotiating down-to-the-wire fiscal agreements.\n\nSome historians rank Biden among the most active American vice presidents. In 2012, The Atlantic magazine published a story headlined: \"Joe Biden: The Most Influential Vice President in History?\"\n\nBiden’s policy choices have subjected him to criticism. In particular, some hawkish foreign policy leaders criticized what they saw as Biden’s lack of faith in the military. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote Biden had been wrong about “nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”\n\nBiden argued against the now-legendary raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He opposed the military’s call for a surge of new troops in Iraq in 2007, as well as a similar surge in Afghanistan in 2012.\n\nIn Biden’s final days as vice president, Obama shocked the 36-year public servant in the White House’s State Dining Room with the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\"For your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I'd like to ask the military aide to join us on stage,\" Obama said, revealing the surprise honor.\n\nWith swollen eyes, Biden accepted, turning his back to the crowd to regain his composure while wiping away tears: “I don't deserve this, but I know it came from the president's heart.”\n\nA month prior, Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate paid tribute to him on the Senate floor as an emotional Biden looked on from the presiding officer's chair. The tributes were scheduled to last an hour, but it went on for more than two.\n\n\"There's a reason 'Get Joe on the phone' is shorthand for 'time to get serious' in my office,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said.\n\nBiden's stumbles\n\nFor all his accomplishments and honors, Biden has not been without faults and missteps.\n\nHis failed 1988 presidential campaign was torpedoed by plagiarism accusations after he failed to credit a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock at an August Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair. (He had cited Kinnock in previous speeches.)\n\nThree years later, when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, he presided over Anita Hill’s testimony detailing her accusations of sexual harassment against the judge.\n\nCritics, especially in later years and even more so in the wake of the #MeToo movement, blamed him for the accusatory and suspicious tone of Hill’s questioning by the panel of 14 male senators. Biden has since said he owed Hill an apology, adding that he believed her.\n\nNearly 30 years later, Hill would support Biden's candidacy against Trump \"notwithstanding all of his limitations in the past, and the mistakes that he made in the past.\"\n\nThat same famously loose mouth, which political opponents used to paint him as a buffoon, also could be used to his advantage.\n\nLike in 2007, at a Democratic debate, when he said Republican presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani only mentions three things in a sentence: “a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"\n\nLike in 1988, he lost the 2008 presidential primary as well. It was won by his future boss, Obama.\n\nAfter 2½ months of campaigning in Iowa to meet a presumably attainable goal of a third or fourth-place finish against a field of six, he was trounced.\n\nBiden finished fifth with less than 1% of the vote behind Obama, former vice presidential candidate John Edwards, Clinton and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.\n\nIt was a devastating blow, and it was written on the faces of his family who stood behind him teary-eyed as he announced the end of his campaign that night.\n\nSeveral months later, at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver after Obama selected him as running mate, he said, \"Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.\"\n\nFrom Scranton to Claymont\n\nBiden was born in 1942 in the industrial Scranton, the first of four children for Jean and Joe Biden, a car dealership manager. Biden was 11 when the family moved 135 miles south to Claymont, another blue-collar town just over the state line.\n\nAfter living in an apartment in the Brookview neighborhood off Philadelphia Pike, the family moved to a spilt-level home in Brandywine Hundred. It was there that he overcame the stutter that earned him the callous nickname of “Joe Impedimenta,” as he wrote in “Promises to Keep.”\n\n“I was going to beat the stutter. And I went at it the only way I knew how: I worked like hell. Practice, practice, practice. I would memorize long passages of Yeats and Emerson, then stand in front of the mirror in my room on Wilson Road and talk, talk, talk,” wrote Biden, whose encouraging father called him “Champ.”\n\nAfter graduating from Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden became a true Blue Hen, earning a bachelor’s degree at the University of Delaware, double majoring in history and political science.\n\nAfter meeting Neilia while on spring break in the Bahamas in 1964, the two began dating. She attended Syracuse University and that is where he would go to get his law degree, graduating in 1968, two years after they married in upstate New York.\n\nThe Bidens returned to Delaware, where he worked as a law clerk and public defender before starting his own firm, originally called Biden and Walsh.\n\nBiden the underdog\n\nBut law was not for the 6-foot former UD football halfback.\n\nBy 1969, he was running as a Democrat for a seat on New Castle County Council, winning the seat in a Republican-leaning district. He served for two years before taking on Boggs and the political machine the incumbent had built up over the years as a U.S. representative and two-term Delaware governor.\n\nThe underdog campaign lacked the funds and experience to win, most thought. Managed by Biden’s sister, Valerie, who would later manage more campaigns and grow into a political confidant, he overcame poor early polls and upended Boggs by 3,000 votes.\n\nA month later, the station wagon holding his family was struck and his Senate career officially began in that Wilmington hospital chapel cramped with media with Senate Secretary Frank Valeo traveling to Delaware from Washington for the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nPale, but smiling, he became the first U.S. senator in decades to take the oath of office away from the Senate chamber. But he made clear that his surviving family was his priority – a priority that led him to forgo a presidential run in 2016.\n\n“I make this one promise,” he said to the media after the sterile swearing-in. “If in six months or so, there’s a conflict between me being a good father and a good senator … I promise you I will contact [the governor] … and tell him to get another senator.\n\n“[The boys] can’t get another father.”\n\nIn the end, he pushed onward, using the advice his own father regularly gave him as a child: “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up.”\n\nBiden captured and recaptured the soul of Delaware every time he got back up, especially when he did it five years after Beau's death to finally win the presidency.\n\nThis story includes information and reports from The News Journal archives.

(Opinion)", "text": "Herbie Smith\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOne of the most poignant moments of my time in Afghanistan was attending a special ceremony, Operation Proper Exit. U.S. soldiers who had been evacuated directly from the Afghan battlefield to the United States for treatment of grave injuries returned to find closure and help put their role and personal sacrifice into the broader context of the war.\n\nI had the honor of meeting many of these wounded heroes — including a Medal of Honor recipient — who had lost limbs and suffered serious physical and mental trauma. Over 2,400 U.S. service members have paid the ultimate sacrifice, leaving their families to deal with the question: Was their sacrifice worth it?\n\nI recently read that only a little over half of Americans are even aware the U.S. is, after 17 years, still fighting a war in Afghanistan. Since the beginning of the war, the U.S. has spent more than $900 billion dollars in military and civilian support. This does not include the human toll of those killed and the tens of thousands wounded.\n\nUnfortunately, there is little to show for all this expense.\n\nAmerica spent lives, time and treasure\n\nYes, Afghanistan has an army, but without U.S. forces they would quickly succumb to the Taliban, who today control more than half of the country. On the civilian side, the Afghan government, despite proven reserves of valuable minerals including lithium and rare earth (estimates are over a trillion dollars worth) remains dependent upon a constant stream of donor dollars.\n\nThe illicit economy, the criminal extraction of minerals and the production and smuggling of opium dwarfs the legal economy, fuels the insurgency and corrupts the entire society. Afghanistan produces 90 percent of the global supply of opium, with an estimated street value of over $60 billion dollars annually.\n\nAfghanistan remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world.\n\nYes, there have been advances; women’s rights, more children in school (including girls) and expanded access to health care. But it remains one of the poorest countries on the planet. It also is one of the most dangerous places on earth to be a woman or give birth.\n\nBoth the U.S. military and civilians have worked earnestly to bring Afghanistan out of the dark ages, but, in all honesty, we have failed to realize our goal of forging a modern, sustainable, democratic society. Bluntly, things are getting more uncertain — if not outright worse.\n\nThe Trump administration has been aggressively trying to accelerate a peace deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban. This month, planned peace talks hit a new snag as the Afghan government and the Taliban failed to agree upon the list of delegates to attend the meeting.\n\nThere was hope this meeting would begin a process to finally bring the long war to an end. Sadly, this effort will likely be fruitless.\n\nAnd yes, the negotiation is with the Taliban, the same group that hosted Al-Qaeda and provided sanctuary for the 9-11 perpetrators. Ironically, what has been the most enduring goal of our continued involvement in Afghanistan was to ensure terrorists were never able to use the country again as a base to attack our homeland. So, pardon my lack of enthusiasm for the aspect of striking peace with the Taliban, whose religious fundamentalism and authoritarian tendencies remain core tenets of the group.\n\nA deal to lose all our gains\n\nIf the Taliban do agree to a peace deal and enter the Afghan government, advances in women’s rights will be reversed, as we witnessed during a brief cease-fire last June when Taliban fighters entered cities and towns. Their mere presence terrorized women.\n\nOne could argue that protecting the advancement of women may be sufficient to justify our continued engagement in Afghanistan, but there is scant evidence Afghanistan’s leaders pay much more than lip-service to women’s equality issues. It plays well for international consumption, but the reality is little has changed.\n\nThis can also be said about the use of tons of development dollars, nearly $150 billion spent by the U.S. alone, to spur the country at least into the 20th Century.\n\nSince U.S. forces liberated Afghanistan from the Taliban in 2002, we have worked to rebuild a devastated the country into a modern, self-sustaining, democratic state. Noble intentions certainly, but in hindsight, we failed to understand the country’s cultural constraints, its deep sectarian divides, the corruption of its elites and the pernicious influence of its neighbors.\n\nThe Afghan government, its society and the economy, is locked in a circle of corruption orchestrated by legacy strong men and tribal leaders who seek to retain power and wealth.\n\nThere is no easy solution — three U.S. administrations have tried unsuccessfully to find one. The constant policy refrain is that we must remain to prevent a collapse of the country.\n\nWhy?\n\nA U.S. departure will likely be a tumultuous event. But it’s time to leave.\n\nThis is no longer our fight, and it is evident that we want peace and progress more than the Afghans. Do they continue to be a corrupt and opportunistic society that exploits the good intentions, sacrifice and generosity of donor countries? Will they choose to fight their own fight?\n\nThe Afghan people need to take responsibility for their own destiny.\n\nHerbie Smith recently retired from the United States Agency for International Development at the Department of State.

Another crashed in western Pennsylvania. Of 3,000 victims, more than 700 were from New Jersey.\n\nHe joined to serve his country\n\n\"Those events of 9/11 were devastating for everyone, but I didn’t realize how the impact of that would eventually have an impact personally on my family and ultimately would change the trajectory of my son’s life and mine,\" explained Melinda Kane, a Gold Star mother.\n\n\"Was the war in Afghanistan a failure? Absolutely not, What has happened most recently does not diminish what our service members accomplished,\" said Kane of Cherry Hill, who eventually left teaching to work in veterans programs and agencies and hold elected office for local township council and now as a Camden County Commissioner following the 2010 death of her son Jeremy Kane.\n\n\"They helped keep us safe and had an impact on Afghan citizens, providing stability and promoting change and growth of the country so women could go to work and young girls could be educated. Now all of that is in jeopardy with the Taliban takeover and most painful for those who survive there.\"\n\nLance Cpl. Kane was a 22-year-old Marine reservist scout on patrol in 2010 when a suicide bomber attacked the Marines’ 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Today a playground park is named for him across from the elementary school he attended in his hometown of Cherry Hill.\n\nKane was one of many who joined the military because of 9/11, signing up as a Marine reservist during college and transferring to Rutgers University-Camden because it was more military friendly and had an office for student veterans.\n\n\"He absolutely joined because of 9/11,\" his mother explained.\n\nShe recalled how teenager Jeremy was transfixed — as both she and her ex-Army major husband were — to daily TV coverage of the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"I saw a 14-year-old change in his personality and discipline. He started exercising and physically became fit and that was also intentional because of his goal of joining the Marines,\" she remembered.\n\n\"By the time he was 16 he expressed that interest in joining the military to protect the country.\n\nShe said she and her husband weren't in favor of him joining the military, wanting to keep him from harm.\n\n\"But it's what he really wanted to do. And when he died he saved others in his platoon.\"\n\nAfter his death and just 18 months after her husband died, Kane wanted to honor his service and sacrifice to the nation.\n\n\"So I decided to give back to the community, which gave me support and compassion after his death and helped me cope with it knowing I was not alone in my grief.\"\n\nVeterans' views\n\nThough the war in Afghanistan is over, veterans Dash and Stenton and others also fear future terror attacks but are more concerned about those at home than abroad.\n\n\"We are safer from foreign terrorists now, but I see domestic terrorists as more of a threat now,\" Stenton theorized.\n\nDash fought in the First Marine Division in the Vietnam War, was wounded there in 1968 and has connections to both 9/11 and the Afghanistan war.\n\nOn 9/11 he lost his cousin, a New York Port Authority police officer from Brooklyn, in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. Nine years later Dash’s son, Anthony, who had joined the Marines like his dad, suffered a traumatic brain injury from an improvised explosive device (IED) attack while serving in Afghanistan and now lives at home with his father.\n\nThe elder Dash said he agrees with how President Joe Biden handled the withdrawal and argues the administration rightfully stuck to the Aug. 31 date because \"every day was a risk there.\"\n\n“Our soldiers did not lose any war, but this one had a tragic end when service members and Afghans trying to get into the international airport in Kabul to leave were killed and wounded outside it by ISIS-K terrorists,\" said the disabled veteran, who lives in Willingboro. \"I can’t figure out why we stayed there 20 years and tried to build their nation after we killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, or why the former president would agree to the release of war prisoners we captured.\"\n\nArmy veteran Klaudi, junior vice commander of an American Legion post and a VFW member in Millville, was in Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the Gulf War, also known as, Desert Storm, He fought to free Kuwait from the Iraqi invasion by Saddam Hussein in 1991 and survived.\n\nAnd he often thinks to how lucky he was again in 2001 when he decided to visit New York City on a random day with a family guest and walked between the two trade towers as they toured the city. He went on Sept. 10, 2001 — the day before the 9/11 attack.\n\nKlaudi called the Afghanistan withdrawal “poorly planned.” He disagrees with leaving behind American military equipment and weapons as well as 100 Americans and thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military and its allies.\n\n“The U.S. should have taken control of those prisoners and sent them to Guantanamo Bay after we spent 20 years capturing them and lost lives to do it,\" he said, adding he thinks world leaders see Biden as weak.\n\n”We knew when we left there it was going to fall apart. Our whole effort over there was (poorly executed) and cost people their lives.\"\n\nAir Force veteran Tom Hastings was a radiology technologist in the Delaware Air National Guard on 9/11 but had served in active duty military back in the Vietnam era. He was assigned to work in the Dover Air Force Base morgue, where the bodies of nearly 200 victims of the 9/11 attack from the Pentagon were brought for identification of remains and as part of the investigation of the attack.\n\n“It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years since those attacks. We were all in shock and not a day goes by that I don’t think of the people who died on that horrific day and those killed since,” said Hastings, a retired master sergeant who lives in Gloucester Township and is now a part-time National Park Service ranger at Independence National Park in Philadelphia.\n\nFour years after 9/11 and at age 56 he was deployed to work in an Air Force trauma hospital at Balad Air Base, treating military, Iraqi civilians and insurgents alike.\n\n“We overstayed in Iraq and Afghanistan and the blame starts with George Bush and then Barack Obama, Donald Trump. And now Biden has given in and we’ve left weapons and equipment and people,” he observed, “but the Trump withdrawal negotiation with the Taliban completely left the country (government) out of the agreement.\n\n“You can’t negotiate with terrorists and it was ludicrous to think the Taliban could or would provide security around the air base (Kabul),” he said, alluding to lax security that resulted in the deadly explosions outside the airport gate late last month.\n\nAnother Air Force veteran, Sally Stenton, has walked through those Kabul airport gates many times as a military lawyer once assigned there to advise the Afghan Air Force.\n\nShe was there April 27, 2011, and heard the gunfire when an Afghan Air Force pilot killed eight U.S. Air Force air advisers and a South Jersey civilian contractor at Afghan Air Force headquarters. She was in a NATO office across the airport that day, losing five friends.\n\nStenton also has represented the military at detention hearings for terrorist prisoners formerly jailed at Bagram air base, some who've since been released.\n\n“Those 13 troops that were killed in action before we withdrew were performing their mission and died heroes in service to their country. It was as tragic as the other 2,400 of our military who died there, but they all were killed by the enemy,” said Stenton, who was raised in Cherry Hill, lives in nearby Winslow Township.\n\n“We are all sad we did not get out all the Americans and the Afghans that helped us. I believe the President when he says we are not going to leave them there. We may have Blackhawk (helicopter) operations perhaps and work through diplomatic channels.”\n\nCarol Comegno loves telling stories about South Jersey life, history and military veterans for the Courier Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal.

Turab Adil knows that Afghans can put up a good fight.\n\nHe recalls how in the 1980s the mujahedin, as they were known, slipped through the hills and valleys to drive out the Communist superpower and its attack helicopters, tanks and fully armed troops.\n\nToday's Afghan army will fight just as ferociously against Taliban fighters, but Adil and others say it can't defeat them under the current U.S. military strategy that calls for the withdrawal of all combat forces by the end of 2014.\n\n\"When the coalition forces leave, there will be a lot of problems for us,\" Adil says in the halting English he learned at an Afghan university.\n\nThe U.S. military's exit strategy in Afghanistan is to maintain security now established in southern Afghanistan while shifting enough combat troops to the east to dismantle the Taliban there. A trained force of Afghans will be expected to keep the peace. But weeks of interviews with Afghan soldiers and U.S. troops on the battle lines in eastern Afghanistan cast doubts on that strategy. Recent Taliban attacks -- the latest on a major U.S. air base -- and insider \"green-on-blue\" shootings against coalition forces only amplify these doubts.\n\nAfter almost 11 years of war and nearly 2,000 Americans dead, Ahmed Majidyar, an Afghanistan expert at the American Enterprise Institute, says Afghan security forces will not be self-sufficient, as the Pentagon hopes under the current scenario.\n\n\"Over the last few years there has been tremendous progress in the Afghan National Security Forces,\" he says. \"But when it comes to logistics (supplies and support for Afghan troops), intelligence gathering and decision-making, they still need help.\"\n\nEven so, the help will be diminishing at a critical moment in the counterinsurgency strategy as the coalition moves to dislodge Taliban strongholds in eastern Afghanistan. A withdrawal of 30,000 troops ordered by President Obama will be complete in October, reducing troop strength from a peak of nearly 103,000 last year to 68,000.\n\nThe military challenge presents just one of many problems in a country plagued by corruption and with a long history of frustrating foreign forces. Indeed, some experts suggest the job -- winning, however defined -- cannot be completed given the myriad hurdles and other issues, such as neighboring Pakistan's support for the insurgency.\n\nThe United States should \"recognize the limits of its power,\" says George Friedman, who heads the private intelligence firm Stratfor and author of The Next Decade, a book that lays out where conflicts might occur.\n\n\"U.S. strategic interest in Afghanistan has been achieved. It's disrupted al-Qaeda in that country, and it needs to withdraw.\"\n\nTwo very different forces\n\nCombat Outpost Kalagush is in Nuristan province in eastern Afghanistan on the border with Pakistan's Northwest Frontier, the one permanent U.S. base in the province.\n\nLife here is not easy. To escape the scorching summer sun, Afghan soldiers often rest in the shade under barracks propped up on cinder blocks. Fresh water for drinking, cooking and bathing is sometimes scarce.\n\n\"We are Afghan. We can deal with all kinds of difficulties,\" says Col. Sher Khan, the new commander at Kalagush.\n\nThe Taliban bulked up its presence in the mountains here after U.S. troops withdrew years ago amid deadly attacks on two outposts that drew constant fire. The outpost is divided: U.S. forces are on one side and Afghans on the other. American soldiers have hot showers, good food and air-conditioned barracks. Afghan soldiers are cramped into metal storage containers turned into sleeping quarters.\n\nOn this day, U.S. adviser teams are training Afghan soldiers to take the lead in military operations. Capt. Marcus Morgan, an American adviser at Kalagush, sees progress. He says Afghan commanders have shown initiative and leadership in planning and executing missions, noting that Afghan forces sometimes patrol without U.S. backing.\n\n\"They are completely in the lead outside the wire,\" Morgan says.\n\nBut Afghans going it alone? That's another issue. \"If they get into a firefight and can't handle it on their own, they can call on us.\"\n\nIn three months, no one will be there to answer. All U.S. troops at Kalagush are to leave the base by the end of the year.\n\nKhan says what his men really will miss is U.S. firepower and aircraft, which he says may not be forthcoming under current withdrawal plans. They can handle the ground fighting, Khan says, but need the U.S. military to come to their aid when things get out of hand. If not, he says, they will likely be overwhelmed by attackers.\n\n\"Our soldiers are very well-trained, but we need the right weapons to defend this area,\" he says. \"There are times we'll need to drop troops behind enemy lines, and we'll need air support.\"\n\nSome in the international coalition suggest that an accommodation must be made eventually for the Taliban to share power with the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai. But many Afghan soldiers do not see it that way.\n\nThe Taliban is a clerical movement that rose up during Afghan civil wars in the 1990s, and many current Afghan military officers remember life under its rule. A harsh brand of Islam was imposed on Afghans. Its adherents demanded men wear beards and denied schooling for women. Girls could be married off at age 9. Homosexuals faced the death penalty.\n\nThe Taliban banned music, alcohol and even kite flying. Those who disobeyed were subject to summary execution. Amnesty International and others condemned the Taliban's reign, but the regime was in little danger until it refused to turn over Osama bin Laden to the United States.\n\n‘You can't whitewash it'\n\nThe Pentagon says its counterinsurgency strategy will succeed, and that the withdrawal of allied forces will not allow Afghanistan to once again become a base for the export of Islamic terrorism that it was under the Taliban.\n\n\"The stakes are very high,\" U.S. Gen. John Allen, the top commander in Afghanistan, said recently. \"The fact that we were attacked on the 11th of September (2001) is a direct line relationship between what happened on that day and what could happen again if we don't get this right.\"\n\nRecent Taliban attacks have provided fodder for critics of the Obama administration's position that the country has been sufficiently pacified to pave the way for an exit:\n\n\n\n-- In the Afghan capital of Kabul on Tuesday, an Islamist group allied with the Taliban claimed credit for a suicide attack that killed 12 people, mostly foreign workers.\n\n\n\n-- NATO troops were ordered this week to halt some joint operations with their counterparts in the Afghan police and army after several attacks by Afghans in uniform.\n\n\n\n-- At least 51 International Security Assistance Force troops have been killed in such incidents this year, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n-- The pause in joint operations follows a coordinated missile attack last week on Camp Leatherneck in Helmand province that destroyed six U.S. Marine jets and three fueling stations.\n\n\n\n-- Two weeks ago, U.S. Special Operations Command suspended training of local Afghan police, a force that is supposed to keep the Taliban out of villages from which U.S. troops are withdrawing.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., complains that Obama is pulling out for political reasons and jeopardizing eventual victory against a potent enemy. Obama's Republican rival for the presidency, Mitt Romney, says the president was \"misguided\" for announcing a withdrawal date to the enemy.\n\nThe president defends today's strategy, arguing repeatedly that he is winding down the war \"responsibly\" and believes the Afghans can handle security themselves.\n\nSecretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the green-on-blue attacks represent the \"last gasp\" of the Taliban. But Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the attacks spell trouble for U.S. aims.\n\n\"You can't whitewash it. We can't convince ourselves that we just have to work harder to get through it. Something has to change,\" Dempsey told Armed Forces Press Service on Sunday.\n\nAnthony Cordesman, an Afghanistan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, does not see a \"clear transition plan\" to the Afghans that will work. He says the current strategy could give the Taliban an opening to take over and resume the kinds of terror activities that prompted the U.S.-led invasion.\n\n\"I think what you may see is a whole bunch of localized power struggles,\" Cordesman says. \"Where it gets to be dangerous is when you have rival warlords with enough power to take over larger areas.\"\n\nDefining ‘a good day'\n\nThe eastern province of Khost is a haven of the Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based Muslim terror group that along with other militant groups aligned with the Taliban have been building forces here for years and in Paktika, Ghazni, Kunar and Wardak provinces.\n\nAdil, the Afghan army colonel, insists his men can hold off the Taliban in Nangalam. But the narrow road connecting Nangalam to points of supply is riddled with buried mines and often controlled by Taliban checkpoints. He says he needs U.S. air support to safely deliver supplies such as food and ammunition.\n\n\"A lot of people in this area are helping them (militant groups),\" Adil says.\n\nAdil says he will be at a great disadvantage if U.S. helicopters are no longer circling during firefights. And removal of U.S. high-tech capacity means they can't keep up scans of the night landscape to spot impending assaults on their remote base here.\n\n\"One day we might get hit with 10 mortars, the next day only two or three, which for us would be a good day,\" he says.\n\nThe U.S. military recognizes the strain on the Afghan army as it make the transition from working with the U.S. forces to replacing them.\n\nThe strategy, according to Lt. Col. Jay Bullock, who leads the U.S. security adviser team at Nangalam, is to \"try to find simple Afghan solutions\" to the challenges they'll face once U.S. forces leave so they \"can learn and grow on them.\"\n\nThe U.S. advisers are training Afghan soldiers to fire heavy artillery left behind by the Soviets, who invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s and lost thousands of troops in a nearly decade-long conflict. So far, the training is progressing slowly but steadily, the advisers say.\n\nSgt. Zaren, who like many Afghans here goes by one name, studies maps of the area around the base to calculate distances for effective fire.\n\n\"I just want to be able to fire the artillery to keep the Taliban away,\" Zaren says.\n\nMaj. Christopher Thomas, spokesman for the 4th Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division, says that the shortcomings of the Afghan forces in the east is a real concern. But, \"there have been real improvements\" in the Afghans' ability to be a self-sustaining fighting force.\n\n\"Right now the focus is putting the Afghans in the lead,\" Thomas says. \"Let them get a bloody nose, but don't let them get a broken nose.\"\n\nCapt. Hugh Miller, who fought along the Pech River during a 2009 deployment, says that if Afghan forces here can control the supply lines and provide effective firepower, they should be able to keep the enemy under control.\n\n\"Those are the two things that if they can get good at, we don't need to be here,\" Miller says.\n\nMajidyar agrees with Miller's assessment but says there is something more that the Afghans must do that they have yet to do alone: root out and destroy militant havens.\n\n\"They (Afghan forces) aren't trained to do that, not equipped to do that and don't have the ability to do that,\" Majidyar says.\n\nUncertainty ahead\n\nMountain ranges here are full of caves and small villages where the Taliban and other groups stage ambushes on coalition forces. U.S. helicopters fly in and destroy militant havens.\n\nThe possibility of losing American backing worries some Afghan villagers.\n\nHaji Noor Ullah, an elder from the village of Nangalam in the Pech River Valley, says facing the Taliban unassisted is a daunting prospect. He acknowledges that many Afghans here support the Taliban, but the many who do not might have to fall in line or risk violence. After all, that's been the model in years past.\n\n\"We will face a lot of troubles in the future,\" he said of the Taliban. \"This is a very dangerous region.\"\n\nThere have been few serious attacks on Kalagush since the current unit of Americans arrived here in the spring, says the company commander, Capt. Adam Marsh. He agrees that the lull is \"unusual\" given the area's reputation for a heavy presence of militants.\n\n\"It's possible that they are just waiting for us to leave,\" he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/08/01/bidens-afghanistan-withdrawal-ends-our-longest-war-heres-what-know/5419418001/", "title": "Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal ends our longest war.

I'm Claire Thornton, and this is Five Things. It's Sunday, August 1st. These Sunday episodes are special. We're bringing you more from in-depth stories you may have already heard.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nAmerica's longest war is about to come to an end. Earlier this year, President Biden said all U.S. troops will withdraw from Afghanistan by September. We've been deployed to Afghanistan for nearly 20 years. The Biden administration also announced we're going to stop combat missions in Iraq by the end of this year. Shifting focus away from Afghanistan and Iraq is shaping up to be a signature aspect of the Biden administration's foreign policy. We've been through a lot as a country because of our involvement in these wars for the past two decades.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nOver 7,000 U.S. service members have been killed in post 9/11 war operations. Far more civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq, hundreds of thousands, have died during that time because of military actions. Ending these wars is a long time coming. Still, similar threats remain in parts of Afghanistan and Iraq all these years later. Here to discuss is Courtney Subramanian USA Today White House Correspondent and our Pentagon reporter Tom Vanden Brook and foreign policy reporter Deirdre Shesgreen. Thank you all so much for being here.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nGood to be here.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nHappy to be here.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nHere's a quote from Biden I like from this April. He said, \"I'm now the fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility onto a fifth president.\" Courtney, could you walk us through Biden's initial support for these wars and how his support has waned over the past years?\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nYeah. Well, I'll start with Afghanistan. Biden has never hid the fact that he thought we should pull out of Afghanistan. He's long argued the U.S. mission should squarely be focused on dismantling Al-Qaeda and getting Osama bin Laden two objectives he said when he announced the full withdrawal that he said the U.S. had achieved. As vice president, he was one of the most vocal critics of further escalation in Afghanistan. He opposed Obama's decision to surge troops there in 2009.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nI think at one point he was referred to as Obama's in-house pessimist on Afghanistan. Other presidents have agreed with his thinking, but have never been able to fully pull out. Trump also talked about bringing an end to America's endless wars. He struck a deal with the Taliban to pull all U.S. troops. In February 2020, he struck that deal, and that's a deal the Biden administration has said they're honoring. Trump had set a May 1st, 2021 deadline, which Biden missed.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nBut that decision by the Trump administration sort of gave Biden some political cover and ease some of that political pressure that other presidents faced with the decision to withdraw. But the public is with him on this. Polls show a strong majority of Americans support withdrawing troops. But I think the decision obviously has some implications that we've seen some Republicans and some of his critics call out politically, if the Taliban do topple the Afghan government, that sort of leaves the fate of Afghan women and children in peril.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nHe understands that. He understands that this decision comes with obvious risks, but it's something that for a long time he has truly believed it was time to leave. The environment that we're in now, both at home and abroad, has given him the right conditions to finally make this decision. He has a long history with Iraq. As a Senator and later as a vice president, he developed relationships with the country's political leaders. He studied their tribal politics and rivalries.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nWhen he was vice president, he was assigned the Iraq portfolio and his son Bo was serving there at the time with the Delaware National Guard. So that gave him sort of the vantage point of military families that not every politician has. By the time he visited there in November 2011, he had been there seven times as vice president, and I think it was like his 16th across his career, but he hasn't always opposed intervention there.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nHe did vote to authorize military force there in 2002 he was critical of the Bush administration, but he did support the decision to invade. I think it's important to remember that his announcement this week is less of a dramatic shift and more of a reflection of what's actually happening on the ground there, and that's that U.S. forces are no longer fighting on behalf of Iraqi forces. They'll continue to play a supporting role, and that's what Biden said they'll do.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nHe hasn't said whether he'll draw down the 2,500 troops that will remain there, but reassign them to help with training and advising and intelligence sharing. It's important to remember with Iraq, I think he is probably haunted by the Obama administration's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, only they had to send troops back in 2014 in response to ISIS. I think part of that decision probably reflects that era of foreign policy and the consequences of that decision.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nYou said that in Afghanistan, women and children are going to be at more risk once we pull troops from that country. The Taliban is the strongest it's been since 2001. For listeners, the Taliban is a political and Islamist movement in Afghanistan, and they're also a military organization. They've been causing conflict within the country, and the Taliban government also harbored Al-Qaeda militants involved in planning the 9/11 attacks.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nTom, how worried are you that the Taliban could regain control in Afghanistan after this year? From everything I've learned, it seems really procure.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nYeah, Claire. I think it's a given that they're going to have some great measure of power in Afghanistan once... Well, they're working on some sort of peace deal and power sharing agreement, but they're going to take as much influence and power as they can, and they probably will be able to. They've already regained control of more than half of the districts in Afghanistan. They've overrun key strategic border crossings with Pakistan.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nIt's a given that they're going to have some measure, perhaps the majority of the power in the Afghan government in the coming months. Is that a concern? It would certainly be a concern if you're an educated person in Afghanistan. Women, children before they were toppled in 2001, they had a very repressive regime that didn't allow women and girls to go to school. I think the thought now is there... Well, the hope, I think, is that they're going to be a little less repressive than they had been, but there's no guarantee of that.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nI mean, they will have the high hand when it comes to ruling the country in a very short time. It looks like the Afghan security forces are folding. They don't fight. I've talked to senior defense officials who say whatever resistance they put up is usually by their elite forces, their special forces, which are a smaller number. But the rest of the 300,000 plus Afghan soldiers that we've spent billions training are not putting up a fight. It looks fairly grim right there right now.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nIn terms of how far we've come there in Afghanistan, or how far we haven't come, what's been the result of our engagement there? How far have we come since that war started? What sacrifices have we made?\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nWell, lots of sacrifices obviously, and the sacrifices are certainly great on the U.S. side, but much more so for Afghan civilians. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of died. Certainly at least hundreds of thousands have been maimed or affected in some way. Civilian casualties are way up again. Now this year. The Taliban is not a particularly kind force. They don't pay attention to Geneva Rules of Convention when it comes to warfare. We're now conducting airstrikes again in support of the Afghan forces that are besieged.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nBut when you do that, you end up killing a lot of people who are civilians and bystanders. There's been a lot of sacrifice. There have been gains though. I mean, their life expectancy is up considerably since in the 20 years that we've been there. Literacy rate is up. Women and children have benefited greatly. It's not as though it's been a total failure on our part to help the Afghan people.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nBut at this point, we've decided that the military mission no longer furthers U.S. national security interests to the extent that we need to have a large force there on the ground. After you've spent literally tens of billions of dollars training and equipping the Afghan forces, Biden feels it's time for them to give it a shot. As Courtney pointed out, this was a deal that was negotiated by former President Trump. We'll see what happens, but all signs right now are not very good.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nAnyone else want to weigh in?\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nI would just say that all the gains that Tom mentioned are at risk if the Taliban do gain control of the country again. There is a question also of whether there will be a resurgence. I mean, that's the big criticism of both Trump's original deal with the Taliban and Biden's following through on it. If the Taliban allows Al-Qaeda to regain strength, then will the U.S. have to go back in?\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nBiden has said that the U.S. will continue to provide over the horizon support for the Afghan security forces, which essentially means helping Afghan security forces from U.S. bases outside the country, but there's a real question about whether that's logistically feasible and how U.S. would really be able to do that.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nYeah. Where would those bases be outside Afghanistan?\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nWell, they used Al Udeid and Qatar to fly missions with B-1 bombers, and they're doing airstrikes right now presumably from Al Udeid, but also from carriers in the Arabian Gulf. We can still perform some missions that way, but you don't have the intelligence on the ground to tell you who you're hitting precisely, or you're banking on the Afghan security forces to tell you you're hitting the right people in the right targets. And that's a very dicey proposition. And often what ends up happening is you end up killing civilians. It's a bad solution to an even worse problem.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nOur invasion of Iraq had no connection to the 9/11 attacks. Deirdre, what sacrifices have Iraqis made since we invaded there in 2003?\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nThe U.S. war in Iraq has been devastating in terms of the death toll and the chaos and the instability. Researchers at Brown University who specialize in trying to tally the costs of war say that it's very difficult to know for sure how many Iraqis were killed, but they say that between 180,000 and 200,000 civilians have died in direct war-related violence as a result of the U.S. invasion. And then several times more have died from indirect causes, for example, damage to the food system, the healthcare system, clean drinking, water illness, mountain malnutrition.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nAll these tangential, but severe consequences of the war. The U.S. occupation also led to instability in Iraq that included a rise in corruption and a very weak government that exists still today. I will pause and say, of course, no one would argue that Saddam Hussein, the deposed and now dead former leader of Iraq, was a good person. He led a very repressive regime. I just want to make that clear, but the U.S. occupation of Iraq had really far-reaching consequences.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nAnd we also know that it eventually led to the rise of sectarian politics and the rise of the Islamic State, which controlled large parts of Iraq starting in 2014 and remains a problem today, much less of a problem, but still a concern for Iraq and for the U.S. and other countries.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nAnyone else want to weigh in? Maybe we could talk about how with ISIS's rise, millions of people were displaced from Syria.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nSure. I'll talk about that a little bit. I was actually in Baghdad in 2011 when they wrapped up the combat mission for the last time. And the thought was that we'd spent, as we had in Afghanistan, a lot of money to support security forces there, and that they would be capable of handling internal security, but that turned out to be a bad miscalculation. And it wasn't long before ISIS, which basically had been Al-Qaeda in Iraq before that, resurged across that region.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nAnd then we had to put together a coalition quickly in order to keep Baghdad from falling, because ISIS rolled through Ramadi and other provincial capitals in Iraq very quickly and threatened Baghdad. We put together a coalition that started airstrikes in 2014 after a sect of Iraqis in Northern Iraq, the Yazidis, were threatened with genocide by ISIS. That's what spurred us to go back in there. Spent a lot of money on that again and a lot of civilians were killed again in airstrikes.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nThese things have definite costs, both for us and for the people on the ground, when the wrong decisions are made.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nYeah. Biden's shift away from Afghanistan and Iraq. It's going to become a pillar of his foreign policy. Experts say he is definitely going to focus on China instead going forward. How do you think he might do that, shift our military focus toward China?\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nI'll take a quick whack at it and let you guys go forward too. Well, you've already seen it. I mean, we've already started to strike targets more frequently in Africa and militant groups like Al-Shabaab. That's what they talk about when they're talking about the shift away from Afghanistan and Iraq, that the threat from extremists has metastasized, as they would say, and shown up in other countries around the globe. You see them in Africa. There are some in Southeast Asia as well.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nThe reason for leaving Afghanistan primarily is that the threat is still there to an extent, but not as much as it is elsewhere. And then you see the idea that we would also shift focus to China because China is continuing to exercise its muscles around the globe actually. You've got them in Africa, in Djibouti. You have them throughout Asia. The idea that they want to turn the South China Sea a key shipping area for the entire world into their sphere of influence. We continue to sail ships through there and run into provocations with the Chinese Navy.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nThat's where the principal effort and concern for the Pentagon is, is the rise of China's military and confronting them around the globe.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nI'll just wheel in to say that there's two forces driving Biden's desire to get out of these so-called endless wars. One is domestic politics. The American public is tired of this, and they feel like the costs have been exorbitant in terms of U.S. taxpayer dollars and U.S. lives, and they want investment at home. Then the second thing is what you've mentioned in terms of this desire to pivot to China. That is not just a military question.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nIn fact, I would say that, of course, while there is concern of a military confrontation with China, the dominant concern among Biden's foreign policy advisors is that China poses more of an economic threat and a political threat with its anti-democratic sort of authoritarian moves in Hong Kong, for example, and its desire to sort of spread its authoritarian form of government. Biden argues that there's this sort of looming conflict between democracy and authoritarianism and that China is driving it.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nIt's a much more complex discussion than just a military debate or a matter of redeploying American forces to a new theater, because that's not actually what's happening. It's a matter of confronting China economically, politically, and also preparing for different kinds of warfare like cyber. We've seen both China and Russia mount these cyber attacks that are devastating and could become or already have become this new front. It's a very different conversation I think.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nJust to kind of build on what Deirdre saying, actually Biden made his first visit to the ODNI, spoke to the intelligence community, and during his remarks said something to the effect of the next shooting war that we'll be involved in will be a result of cyber warfare.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nWow!\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nBecause he really does believe that that is one of the biggest threats facing the country aside from the military focus, but also like an economic focus. I think it really reflects a worldview that his national security advisor Jake Sullivan has really pushed, and that is national security and foreign policy should play a proactive role in the domestic economic policy debate. Because his thought is that the two should be linked because foreign policy should focus on what it will take to enhance U.S. competitiveness, both at home and abroad.\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nWe've seen that throughout Biden's agenda. It really reflects that when he met with foreign leaders in Europe in his first trip, urging them to take a tough line on China. He's launched a government wide initiative, this buy American initiative, which is like federal procurement to support American manufacturing. This focus on China, he's really trying to thread the needle throughout his entire agenda, and I think this is a reflection of that.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nThank you. Any closing thoughts from you all?\n\nCourtney Subramanian:\n\nI mean, I'll just say that I think that this is a deliberate to move the U.S. beyond the post 9/11 scope, and I think these decisions really reflect Biden's worldview that we've achieved the missions that we set out to accomplish with these wars. Specifically with this country being very war wary and with an economic crisis at home coming out of a pandemic, this was very much a deliberate move to move beyond the shadow of 9/11, which has dictated our foreign policy for so long.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nI'll just say, I agree with everything Courtney and Deirdre have said. The problem, of course, is that events often dictate what we have to do. Obama famously said he was pivoting to Asia and he was never able to really do it. Whenever problems arise in the Middle East, there's typically only one country that gets deeply, deeply involved, and it's us. If something else happens there in a catastrophic way, we'll almost inexorably be drawn back in.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nYeah, I think so too.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nWe've seen that already with the war between Israel and Hamas. The Biden administration made it pretty clear. They did not want to prioritize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and then events forced them to dive in. Like Tom said, as much as they might want to move on, they may not be able to.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nWell, let's leave it at that. Tom, Courtney, Deirdre, thank you all so much for being here.\n\nTom Vanden Brrook:\n\nThanks.\n\nDeirdre Shesgreen:\n\nThank you.\n\nClaire Thornton:\n\nYou can get more from Courtney, Tom, and Deirdre at usatoday.com.

Located in east Montgomery, the theater is upgrading an entrance lobby and enclosing an outdoor area. It also is adding restrooms, constructing a new gift shop and making other additions. While the theater received $1.18 million in federal pandemic aid as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, spokeswoman Layne Holley said the renovations will not use that money, and officials have yet to decide how to use the funding. Indoor shows are scheduled to resume Nov. 27 with a production of “Cinderella.” Executive director Todd Schmidt said the theater has survived the pandemic and made plans for a return in part because of strong community backing. “We had to reduce our staff and our overhead,” Schmidt said. “It’s been a tough time, but luckily we’ve had great support.” Initially staged at Anniston High School, the company relocated to Montgomery and is housed in a theater constructed in 1985.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives has postponed its annual convention because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state, officials said in a statement. The convention has traditionally been the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the state. It had been scheduled for Oct. 21-23 but is now delayed until mid-December in Anchorage, the organization said in a statement. Organizers said they will continue planning for an in-person convention at the Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage with a virtual option. However, the statement said the board will make a decision by mid-October on whether to maintain the in-person part. Organizers encouraged Alaskans to get vaccinated and wear masks so the convention can be held. One notable celebration this year will be the observation of the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act was the largest land settlement in the nation’s history when President Richard Nixon signed it into law Dec. 18, 1971, and settled Indigenous land claims in Alaska. “Postponing until December provides us an opportunity to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of ANCSA, but it all hinges on everyone’s willingness and ability to get vaccinated,” said Sealaska chairman and Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Joe Nelson.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A tribe that didn’t sign a revised gambling compact with the state earlier this year has filed a lawsuit alleging that a new law is unconstitutional and left some rural tribes in the cold by excluding them from negotiations hamming out the legislation. The suit filed by the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe on Thursday asks the court to prevent the Department of Gaming from issuing sportsbook licenses and allowing sports betting. The lawsuit said the state presented the tribe with an amended compact “as a non-negotiable, ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ proposition.” The lawmaker who sponsored the gambling legislation defended it as fair and equitable. The legislation signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last spring expands the types of gambling allowed at tribal casinos, lets tribes and pro sports teams take bets on sport evenings, and licenses six operators to sign up players for betting on fantasy virtual games. A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for next Friday on the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has scheduled the retrial of a former state senator on bribery and fraud charges for the first week of October. Court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, show U.S. District Judge Judge Price Marshall on Friday scheduled the trial for Gilbert Baker, a Republican former senator and one-time state GOP chairman, to begin Oct. 4. A federal jury earlier this month acquitted Baker of conspiracy in the case in which he allegedly conspired to bribe an ex-judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The jury, however, deadlocked on charges of bribery and wire fraud against Baker, and prosecutors on Thursday filed notice of their intent to retry those counts. Baker was accused of conspiring with former state Judge Michael Maggio, who admitted to accepting campaign donations from a nursing home operator, then reducing a judgment against that company by $4.2 million. Michael Morton, the nursing home operator, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Maggio was sentenced in 2015 to 10 years in prison.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBlythe: California farmers near the Arizona border with the oldest rights to Colorado River water will reap $38million over three years to not plant some of their fields and leave extra water in the rapidly declining Lake Mead reservoir. Located roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, growers near the city of Blythe in Riverside County have first priority to the river water. They hold rights that stretch back to 1877, superseding 40 million customers in eight states who also depend on it. But with continued drought and overuse, a first-ever shortage in the river system was declared in recent weeks by federal authorities, triggering cuts to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico’s supplies next year. In response, farmers who control the Palo Verde Irrigation District voted unanimously this month to agree to cancel planting some of their crops for three years. They will be paid about $925 per acre this year via federal drought response funds and water ratepayers in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, with 2% increases each year after that. Bart Fisher, a PVID trustee whose family owns the 11,500-acre Fisher Ranch, said he and others were acting not because they want the money but because they want to help others and try to guarantee continued water supply for all.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s secretary of state filed a lawsuit Monday to remove a rural county’s election clerk who is accused of allowing a security breach of the county’s voting equipment that is currently being investigated by the FBI. The lawsuit filed in Mesa County district court by Secretary of State Jena Griswold seeks to formally remove Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters as the designated election official. The suit also calls for the appointment of former Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace Peters and Sheila Reiner, former Mesa county clerk and recorder, to serve as the elections supervisor for the county’s upcoming November elections. The Board of County Commissioners praised the changes in a statement Monday, saying Mesa County will have “arguably the most secure and transparent election system in the United States.” Peters has claimed that the investigation led by Griswold – who is a Democrat – is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado. Griswold said initial investigation findings show images of election management software used by the county’s elections equipment were obtained by conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs. Griswold’s office also said it believes one of the images was taken from a secure room.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools around the state looking to upgrade aging ventilation systems to improve air quality and help fight the airborne spread of the coronavirus may find themselves short on funds, even with federal pandemic aid. The Connecticut Mirror reports a state policy restricts aid for heating, air conditioning and air quality control projects. The policy could be reviewed again by legislators, but likely not before the 2022 General Assembly session in February. “There are some districts that haven’t touched their schools in 40 years,” said Kostantinos Diamantis, the state’s budget director who also has overseen the state’s school construction program for the past six years. “The local level needs to belly up to the bar. The cities have an obligation to maintain those buildings.” Connecticut reimburses communities for between 10% and 71% of new construction and large renovation projects designed to last 20 years or longer, the Mirror reports. But the cost of smaller projects such as replacing or upgrading a heating and ventilation system must be absorbed by the town. For the town of Coventry, which wants to replace ventilators in its middle and high schools and make roof repairs, that would mean a bill of more than $2 million even after unused federal pandemic aid is applied.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Preliminary necropsy results show that a young fin whale that beached itself and died at Cape Henlopen State Park last week was riddled with parasites. “There was a lot going on,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. Measured by MERR to be 57 feet long, the whale first showed up in Lewes on Thursday, stuck on a sandbar in the Harbor of Refuge. It was able to free itself when the tide came in, but a short time later it beached itself again on the oceanside of The Point. Around noon Aug. 27, after many onlookers had come to catch a glimpse of its tail flapping in the surf, and just moments after Virginia Aquarium representatives had arrived to provide palliative care and possible euthanasia, the whale stopped breathing, according to a MERR Facebook post. The whale had to be cut into several pieces to move it out of the water for necropsy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dozens of people marched to the White House on Sunday calling for support of Afghan women. Organized by the nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership, the group is calling on President Joe Biden and other U.S. leaders to prioritize the evacuation of women out of Afghanistan and to help permanently protect women’s rights inside the country following the crisis inside the country and the Taliban takeover, WUSA-TV reports. Protesters wore shirts and held signs emblazoned with “I stand with Afghan women” as they marched from the Vital Voices headquarters on 16th Street through Black Lives Matter Plaza and to Lafayette Square, eventually gathering in front of the White House. The deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens from Afghanistan is Tuesday. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that for those U.S. citizens seeking immediately to leave Afghanistan by the looming deadline, “we have the capacity to have 300 Americans, which is roughly the number we think are remaining, come to the airport and get on planes in the time that is remaining.”\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Sugar growers are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over proposed reservoir water levels they say will be far too low. The federal lawsuits filed last week by Florida Crystals’ Okeelanta Corp., U.S. Sugar and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative say the current Corps plan won’t supply enough water for their fields. “Farmers need a secure supply of water, and all farmers need certainty as we plan and manage our planting schedules and crop rotation,” said Jaime Vega, vice president of agriculture at Florida Crystals. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps’ work, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. The project in question is the Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir intended to cleanse tainted water so more can flow south as crucially needed toward Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. In the lawsuits, Sugar Growers say the still-under-construction reservoir should be kept at higher water levels than what is currently envisioned in a Corps of Engineers plan. Everglades restoration advocates say the growers are simply putting their priorities ahead of others.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta Black Pride organizers say the annual celebration will happen Labor Day weekend as planned with some precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. The larger Atlanta Pride festival and parade planned for October were canceled Wednesday because of concerns about the pandemic. But leaders of Atlanta Black Pride, which celebrates the African American LGBTQ community, say they plan to go forward, with fewer indoor gatherings, while encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Amber Moore, COO and vice president of Atlanta Black Pride, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus testing will be offered. The celebration, marking its 25th anniversary this year, is to feature events around the city. In addition to parties, that includes a fashion show, a session on empowering women, an awards ceremony for the transgender community, a virtual film festival and a health expo. Vaughn Alvarez, who is helping to promote some of the events at Piedmont Park, told the newspaper that Atlanta rapper and radio host Da Brat and fiancee Jesseca “Judy” Dupart, CEO of Kaleidoscope Hair Products, will be honored for “bravery and courage with their love story.” The two star in “Brat loves Judy” on WE-TV.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A county affordable housing committee has voted to recommend approval of a rental project on Lanai, where no new affordable homes have been built in 30 years. The Hokuao 201H Housing Project, proposed by billionaire Larry Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai, includes the development of 150 two-bedroom rental homes on former pineapple fields. About half of the units will be market-rate priced. The project will be developed under the state’s fast-track approval process for affordable housing. The Maui County Council’s Affordable Housing Committee voted 8-0 to recommend giving the project the green light after multiple meetings packed with public testimony and hours of discussion over concern about the project’s number of market-rate homes, The Maui News reports. Council Chairwoman Alice Lee said the project is “desperately needed.” Pulama Lanai had sought an exemption for sidewalks in the future subdivision, saying including them would cost about $2 million. Sharon Thom, senior vice president of development and construction for Pulama Lanai, said the sidewalks would change the “look and feel” of Lanai City. But Committee Chairman Gabe Johnson argued to include sidewalks, saying the county needs to advocate for pedestrian safety and accessibility.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: The hot, dry, smoky growing season has left some potato farmers bracing for a poor crop. Randy Hardy, of Oakley, told the Idaho State Journal that his harvest will likely be the worst of his career. Statewide, spud farmers conducting test digs or early harvests are uprooting plants supporting no tubers. Where there are potatoes, there are fewer than normal, and most of the tubers are undersized and misshapen. “I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve got an agronomist who works with me on potatoes, and he’s been doing it for over 20 years, and he said he’s never seen a worse crop than this,” said Hardy, who raises spuds for the fresh market and is chairman of the board of Sun Valley Potatoes. Hardy isn’t scheduled to harvest until Sept. 20, and he’s hoping the extra time will allow his tubers to add a bit more bulk. United Potato Growers of Idaho asked growers to submit results from Aug. 1 test digs and will gather follow-up data in person during harvest. Hardy said the average number of tubers in the test digs was down 30% from last year. Weight was also down substantially, he said. Many fields lacked deep soil moisture when the potatoes were planted. Then the state was hit with record-high heat in June, contributing to fewer potatoes growing beneath each plant, and smoke-filled air from Western wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: From a waterpark resort to a public school, seven finalists have been named in a design competition to repurpose a much-maligned state government building downtown. State officials are trying to sell the James R. Thompson Center, which was designed by famed architect Helmet Jahn. They say the 17-story curved-glass structure that opened in 1985 is inefficient and requires hundreds of millions of dollars worth of repairs and updates to keep it running. The building houses offices for the governor and employees of state agencies, who are scheduled to move next year to another building on the city’s Near West Side. Illinois officials are seeking bids for a developer and have not committed to any preservation ideas. Officials have said they want to sell the building by February 2022. Architecture buffs have pushed for preservation, an effort that’s been renewed in the wake of Jahn’s death in May. The finalists were named last week. A group of design and preservation experts picked the finalists from 59 entries. A winner will be chosen Sept. 14.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A coalition of voting rights groups is sponsoring a contest for Hoosiers to draw new maps for congressional and legislative election districts. The group All IN for Democracy said the contest is aimed at finding “fair” proposed election maps to present to legislators before they vote in late September on the once-a-decade redistricting based on population shifts from the U.S. census. Voting rights activists have complained that the GOP-dominated Legislature isn’t involving the public enough in the redistricting work and that partisan gerrymandering has helped Indiana Republicans gain outsized power in state government. The organization is providing an online site where residents can compile maps based on the 2020 census data. Proposals submitted by Sept. 13 will be judged, with the winning map for Indiana’s nine congressional districts getting $1,000, with $2,000 for the best districts for the 50 Indiana Senate seats and $3,000 for the fairest map of the 100 Indiana House districts. The group said its judging will be based on how well the maps keep communities of interest together, maintain whole cities and counties in the same district, and maximize the number of politically competitive districts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Black applicants are 2.6 times more likely to be denied a conventional home loan than similarly qualified white applicants in the Des Moines/West Des Moines metro, according to an analysis of 2019 data by The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom. Des Moines has the fifth-greatest likelihood of denial for Black applicants out of 71 U.S. metro areas that The Markup found had statistically significant disparities in home loan approvals. The newsroom found that nationally, mortgage lenders are 80% more likely to reject Black applicants; 70% more likely to deny Native American applicants; 50% more likely to turn down Asian/Pacific Islander applicants; and 40% more likely to reject Latino applicants. For its analysis, The Markup examined more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications, accounting for 17 independent variables, including debt-to-income ratio and combined loan-to-value ratio. It did not take into account credit scores, which are not publicly available through Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. John Sorensen, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, said in a statement that while the organization “firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market,” the data used by The Markup doesn’t give a full picture as to why these disparities exist.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of the biggest gun dealers in south-central Kansas is the city of Wichita, but it actually received less than half the proceeds from the sales because it works with several online companies to auction off the firearms. Since a new state law allowing the gun sales was passed in 2015, Wichita has sold 2,082 guns that were seized during crimes for which the criminal cases were complete. The city generated $196,000 on the gun sales that went into a fund that pays for miscellaneous police equipment. But The Wichita Eagle learned the city received less than half of the $425,000 in total sales generated because the companies that handle the sales take a significant chunk of the proceeds. The city contracts with Propertyroom.com, which sells the guns through a partnership with a major gun retailer that operates an online auction site. The city finance director said officials last took proposals for the gun contract two years ago and got no better offer. Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who wrote the law, said it’s no different from police departments selling off other seized property, and any gun purchases require background checks. Former Rep. Jim Ward, who also used to work as a city prosecutor, said he knows it’s impossible to keep all the guns off the street, but he never wanted the government in the gun business.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An instructional assistant at an eastern Kentucky elementary school died from COVID-19 as the fast-spreading delta variant has sparked coronavirus outbreaks in several school districts. Heather Antle, an aide at Lee County Elementary, died Sunday. Antle was an involved member of the school community who “brought great joy to the students and staff that she worked with,” Lee County Superintendent Sarah Wasson said in a statement posted to social media. The Lee County district canceled in-person classes until Sept. 7 in response to coronavirus cases among students and teachers. Virus outbreaks have caused disruptions since the school year began. Several other districts have shut down classes for multiple days due to outbreaks. Gov. Andy Beshear, while expressing condolences to Antle’s family, urged Kentuckians to get vaccinated and wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread in schools. “There was a time when some argued COVID did not spread in schools,” the governor said on social media. “That time should be over. ... We must do everything in our power to prevent the spread of this virus in our schools, and vaccinations and masks are our greatest tools. Let’s do what’s right for our teachers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A couple who met in a gross anatomy class as Tulane University undergraduates have given Tulane Medical School $5 million for an endowed professorship. Drs. Philip and Cheryl Leone, of Naples, Florida, are now retired pathologists and current members of the School of Medicine Board of Governors, a university news release said Wednesday. Their endowment will support a medical school professor who will also hold a joint appointment in another school or unit and will focus on areas such as public health, immunology, parasitology or anthropology, the university said. The Leones have worked in both academia and private practice. “Tulane University has played a major role in our lives and the lives of our family members,” Phil Leone said. “Our son graduated from Tulane, and Cheryl’s siblings earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university.” “Endowing a Presidential Chair with an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic study allows us to contribute to the university in these challenging times,” Cheryl Leone said. “We hope our gift will strengthen the medical school and help train future physicians who can significantly advance the field of medicine.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: More than 125 boats participated in a weekend protest against plans for an aquaculture operation in waters near Acadia National Park. Commercial and recreational vessels comprised the “Save the Bay” flotilla that motored around Frenchman Bay on Sunday. Some people on land also participated by holding signs stating their opposition. American Aquafarms has proposed raising 66 million pounds of Atlantic salmon annually at a pair of 15-pen sites off the coast of Gouldsboro in Frenchman Bay. The company didn’t immediately return a telephone message. Ted O’Meara of Frenchman’s Bay United likened the scope of the project to ”some huge hog farm from the Midwest and plucking it right in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts of Maine.” He said that “our first goal is to stop this project, and our second goal is to look at changing some of the rules that allow people like this to think they can just come here and plug something like this down in our waters.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The first new Catholic school built in the city in roughly 60 years opened its doors Monday to hundreds of youngsters, who entered the gleaming new building with a mix of enthusiasm and first-day-back jitters. The state-of-the-art Mother Mary Lange Catholic School was built on the site where a notoriously rough public housing high-rise once stood. In a U.S. city steeped in Catholicism like few others, the new 65,000-square-foot building near downtown Baltimore is somewhat of an anomaly in the national education landscape as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the shuttering of many Catholic schools. It’s named after Mother Mary Elizabeth Lange, a Haitian American who started a Catholic school for Black children in 1828 – the first U.S. Catholic school for African American youth. She co-founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore in 1829. The Vatican is reviewing Lange for possible canonization. Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori said the new school, which goes from preschool to eighth grade, is not only a benefit to the students and their families but also an asset to the surrounding neighborhood. The school’s playing fields and gym will be accessible, as appropriate, to the city community. “They say a rising tide lifts all boats. And I think the opening of this school has put a spring in the step of all of our Catholic educators,” Lori said in a phone interview.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A public marker to remember the enslaved Africans forced to journey across the ocean to toil in the Americas was formally dedicated Sunday on the downtown waterfront. The Middle Passage Port Marker was installed last October at the end of Long Wharf looking out onto Boston Harbor. It is meant to acknowledge Boston’s history of slavery and honor the Africans who were forced into the the trans-Atlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. The Sunday ceremony included remarks from Michael Creasey, superintendent of the National Parks of Boston, and officials from the downtown Museum of African American History. Names of enslaved members of Boston’s oldest churches were read aloud, and there was a traditional balafon performance by Balla Kouyate as well as a land acknowledgement statement delivered by Elizabeth Solomon, a member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag. Millions of Africans were sold in the Caribbean and in American cities such as Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, from 1619 to 1865, according to event organizers. Native Americans from local tribes, including the Massachusett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc, were also enslaved after being taken as prisoners of war, the organizations said.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A monument dedicated to Tuskegee Airmen who died in Michigan during World War II training was unveiled Saturday near the international Blue Water Bridge. Michigan served as an advanced training ground for many graduates of the Tuskegee University pilot training program in Alabama. Surviving Tuskegee airmen and their descendants attended the event in Port Huron, part of a three-day celebration that recognized the accomplishments of America’s first Black military pilots. Fifteen Tuskegee airmen were killed while training in Michigan, including five pilots lost in Lake Huron and one in the St. Clair River, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Wreckages from two planes have been found in the river and the lake. In 2014, the remains of a P-39 aircraft were found in Lake Huron, 70 years after it crashed. The body of 2nd Lt. Frank Moody washed ashore a few months after the April 1944 crash. A dive team spent a week in Lake Huron in 2015 surveying the wreckage. The plane’s wing, landing gear, engine block, tail, propeller, cockpit door, instrument panel, .50-caliber machine guns and ammunition are being restored and will become an exhibit sponsored by the National Tuskegee Airmen Museum in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A write-in campaign for a prehistoric giant beaver that weighed more than 200 pounds has secured it a spot on a list of possible candidates for state fossil. The write-in campaign has been so successful that the beaver, or Castoroides ohioensis, is now in the lead among possible state-fossil candidates proposed by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The fossil, found in St. Paul, dates back to the Pleistocene epoch and is estimated to be anywhere from 2.58 million years to 10,150 years old, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. Minnesota is one of just seven states without a state fossil, said Alex Hastings, the Phillip W. Fitzpatrick Chair of Paleontology at the Science Museum of Minnesota, who is leading an effort to designate one. Hastings put together a list of eight candidates – representing different creatures, different parts of the state and different geologic times – for consideration. As of last Tuesday, more than 2,100 people had voted, he said. The entry for Castoroides ohioensis notes that it had “buck teeth and aquatic lifestyle” and “was the size of a small bear,” according to officials with the St. Paul museum. It almost became Minnesota’s state fossil back in 1988, but the measure failed in the Legislature. Voting ends Oct. 1, after which legislators will get involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nYazoo City: A white father and son have each been sentenced to four years in prison for convictions related to chasing and shooting at two Black teenagers who were riding all-terrain vehicles on a country road. Some of the charges were prosecuted as hate crimes, which strengthened the punishment. Wade Oscar Twiner, 49, of Yazoo City, and his son, Lane Irvine Twiner, 23, of Jackson, were sentenced Friday in Yazoo County. Jurors on Wednesday convicted each man of two counts of simple assault and one count of malicious mischief. The district attorney’s office said the penalty for each simple assault conviction was increased because the men’s actions were deemed hate crimes under Mississippi law, which allows stronger penalties for crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin or gender. The men were arrested after the Sept. 27 chase in rural Yazoo County. The two teenagers were not injured, but they told investigators they were frightened for their lives. The teenagers were riding ATVs on a country road close to Wade Twiner’s home, said Chief Deputy Joseph Head of the Yazoo County Sheriff’s Office. The father and son got in a pickup and chased the teens, firing several shots and bumping into one of the ATVs with the truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officials face a tall order to get all the state’s nursing home workers vaccinated because fewer than half of them have received the shots. By that metric, Missouri’s 48% ranks third-lowest in the nation, trailed only by Florida and Louisiana, both at 47%. Yet some 82% of Missouri’s nursing home residents have been vaccinated, which is just behind the national average of 83%. That worries residents like Michael Williams, who has diabetes and is on kidney dialysis at the Crestwood Health Care Center in St. Louis. “It’s fine if they (staff) don’t want to take it, but then don’t work around us. We all have underlying conditions here,” Williams told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They are out in the casino, and they are rolling the dice, but the sad thing about it is it’s other people’s lives they are playing with.” Some workers have already quit rather than face a mandate. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said it would require nursing home staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments – revenue on which nearly all skilled nursing facilities depend. But details of that plan still haven’t been released. Data analyzed by the Post-Dispatch shows 20 facilities statewide had staff vaccination rates of 20% or less as of Aug. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University has announced a $101 million donation to its College of Nursing, believed to be the largest donation ever given to a college of nursing in the United States, school officials said. The donation, announced Monday, comes from Mark and Robyn Jones, founders of Goosehead Insurance, based in Westlake, Texas. “It is hard to put into words how moved and excited all of us are at Montana State University by the generosity of the Joneses, who are helping to address some of the most critical health care disparity issues in Montana, particularly in the state’s rural areas,” MSU President Waded Cruzado said in a statement. The money will be used to fund new facilities and state-of-the-art simulation labs at MSU College of Nursing campuses in Bozeman, Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell and Missoula. The donation will also create five faculty professorships, helping MSU attract top faculty talent as the nation faces a nursing faculty shortage. MSU’s College of Nursing will also create an endowed scholarship fund and a nurse midwifery program for doctoral-level nurses to provide maternal health in rural and remote communities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The bones of the city’s next outdoor performance space have risen in the Gene Leahy Mall downtown. Metal arches that will one day form a performance pavilion have gone up in the mall in recent weeks, part of a $400 million public-private renovation of the mall, Heartland of America Park and Lewis & Clark Landing. When the pavilion is finished – likely sometime next spring – three white arches cascading in size will cover a stage. The Omaha World-Herald reports the space will be used for all manner of performances, from concerts, symphony performances and music festivals to movie nights and dance competitions. “It’s exciting seeing it start to come out of the ground,” said Katie Bassett, vice president of parks for the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, which is managing the park renovations for the city. Stretching out from the pavilion to the west will be a 42,000-square-foot green lawn that will be able to host thousands of people for shows and offer a recreation space the rest of the time. Officials say the venue will be reminiscent of the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which has a similar arch-shaped covering over the stage. At night, the pavilion will be lit from underneath to create a glow effect, which Bassett said will offer “an iconic” addition to Omaha’s downtown.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The nation’s fifth-largest school system has begun using ultraviolet light as a classroom germ-killer in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19. “This doesn’t have any chemicals. It’s just light,” said Grant Morgan, chief executive and co-founder of Utah biosafety startup R-Zero, during a demonstration of the disinfection system at an elementary school in suburban Henderson. The blue-light-emitting tower can disinfect a 1,000-square-foot indoor space in seven minutes, destroying more than 99.99% of surface and airborne pathogens, Morgan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It is designed to be used while a space is unoccupied but has no lingering effects when people enter a room after treatment, he said. The Clark County School District bought one Arc unit for each of its 372 campuses using $7.4 million in federal coronavirus relief money to cover the $20,000 per-unit cost, the Review-Journal said. The district has more than 310,000 students. Classes began Aug. 9.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is asking employees who have not yet returned to campus to keep working remotely until Oct. 4. The previous plan was for workers to return at the start of September, but the college is adjusting its plans as COVID-19 cases increase regionally and nationally, said Scott Bemis, chief human resources officer. Many of those who have already returned “can continue to work on-site,” Bemis said in an email to the community Friday. He said the date is being pushed back a month “to help slow the increase in the density of people on campus, with the goal of interrupting COVID-19 transmission wherever possible.” Bemis also said that weekly coronavirus surveillance testing will be conducted for vaccinated employees, instead of every 30 days. Unvaccinated employees who are coming to campus are still required to test twice a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: About half a million residents stand to lose a $300 federal unemployment benefit when it expires Saturday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday during a COVID-19 news conference that it would cost the state more than $1 billion a month to pick up the unemployment insurance tab from the federal government. “The proper way to extend federal UI benefits is through federal action, not a patchwork of state ones,” he said. “The reality is that continuing the $300-per-week benefit through state resources would be cost-prohibitive.” The expiration will affect about 500,000 people, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. Federal jobless aid was first approved in 2020 when COVID-19 outbreak hit, sending jobless to record highs amid pandemic-related shutdowns. The state has administered $33.7 billion directly to 1.6 million residents since the start of the pandemic, the governor said. The lion’s share – $25 billion – has come from the federal government. To those unemployed residents affected by the expiration of the federal benefit, Murphy pointed to the state’s minimum wage, which will rise to $13 an hour in the new year from $12. He also pointed to the state’s paid sick and family leave programs, along with other social safety net aids.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, on Saturday night in her home state. Haaland wore a dress designed and sewn by her sister, said Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. The ceremony incorporated elements honoring her Native American ancestry. The former New Mexico congresswoman is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. According to Schwartz, guests had to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend and wear masks per U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New Mexico guidelines. But pictures on social media that show some people, including Haaland, not wearing masks indoors the whole time have drawn criticism. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A “sequence of failures” in the city’s subway system following a brief power outage disrupted half of the system for several hours and stranded hundreds of passengers, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hochul said in a statement that a Metropolitan Transportation Authority review of Sunday night’s subway breakdown “uncovered a sequence of failures that resulted in some backup systems not providing power as designed last night, including an additional failure to quickly diagnose the underlying cause.” The unprecedented breakdown affected more than 80 trains on the subway system’s numbered lines plus the L train from shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday to about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Hochul said at an earlier news conference. The restoration of service was delayed because passengers on two of the stuck trains walked out onto the tracks by themselves rather than waiting for rescuers from agencies including the police and fire departments to help them, Hochul said. “We never, ever want riders to do that,” she said. “It is dangerous, and it caused a delay in the restoration of power.” Speaking outside a lower Manhattan subway system, Hochul promised a thorough investigation. “Let me be very clear,” she said. “Last night was unacceptable.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: State environmental regulators say a plant that for years discharged so-called forever chemicals into the air and water is not currently in compliance with its air permit. In its letter to Chemours, the Department of Environmental Quality warned that it is preparing an enforcement action against the company’s Fayetteville Works plant in Bladen County, which has been exceeding its GenX air pollution limits for much of 2021. Officials said the company could be facing up to a $25,000 fine per day. In a statement, Chemours said the site experienced a temporary increase in air emissions this year from one of its carbon adsorption units. “The issue was quickly resolved when the carbon was replaced in this unit, and emissions returned to their usual low levels,” the statement said. “However, the data results from that one emissions sampling caused an exceedance of the site’s calculated 12-month rolling air emission allowance.” Chemours, a spinoff of DuPont Co., plans to take corrective action to fix the issue in the long term, according to its statement. GenX, a type of PFAS, has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new quarterly report from North Dakota State University says the state’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has slowed a bit. The outlook predicts declines in the gross state product, which is the measurement of the state’s output, labor force participation, and total wages and salaries. “The overall economic outlook for the state had been improving amidst the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the most recent data shows a state economy that is at risk of declining economic growth and a shrinking labor force,” said NDSU economics professor Jeremy Jackson, director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise. Total wages and salaries are expected to hold steady with a slight decline in the third quarter of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The labor force is predicted to decline in the third quarter, with that trend continuing into next year. The unemployment rate is projected to have a slight increase in the third quarter and then return to its declining trend. North Dakota’s gross state product grew 1.8% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, but gross state product is forecast to decline heading into 2022. Despite the forecast decline, the model predicts relative stability in total tax collections.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Supporters of a proposal to legalize marijuana got the green light Monday to collect signatures to place the measure before state lawmakers. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol’s proposed statute was approved as a single issue by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The group will soon begin collecting the 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters needed to submit the proposed law to the Legislature. If the Legislature doesn’t pass or passes an amended version of the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to put the proposal before voters, likely in November 2022. The proposal would allow adults age 21 and older to buy, grow, possess and consume marijuana. Proceeds of a 10% tax on marijuana would go to education, addiction treatment and municipalities with marijuana businesses. Municipalities could limit or ban marijuana businesses within their borders. Ohio’s medical marijuana businesses, several of which are backing the plan, could automatically get licenses for the recreational side. The bill establishes 40 new cultivation licenses and 50 additional dispensary licenses for economically and socially disadvantaged “social equity” applicants. Additional licenses could be granted two years later.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Hospitals are again overwhelmed as the spread of COVID-19 is surging through the state, but this time, they’re facing the wave with even further strain on health care workers. The state has dealt with a nursing shortage for at least two decades, Oklahoma nursing leaders said. But the pandemic has worsened it, with the stresses driving some burned-out nurses out of the industry or to other states, amid greater demands on the health care system. “The pandemic has brought on some extra stresses that we had no way of predicting, and that has impacted our retention rates enormously,” said Shelly Wells, president of the Oklahoma Nurses Association. “For example, I don’t think that humans were meant to see as much death as our nurses have seen, personally, in the last 16 months.” A nurse working in a hospital in normal times might expect to care for a dying patient once a week, Wells said. “These patients are dying much more frequently,” she said. “There’s no family support, so the nurses are having to double as family and offer that support” on top of caring for the patients themselves. And it can be especially troubling to care for someone your age or younger “that you know is probably not going to live,” said Elain Richardson, regional chief nursing officer with SSM Health St. Anthony.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Record-low numbers of steelhead are returning to the Columbia River this year, prompting conservationists and anglers alike to call for a halt to recreational fishing for the sea-run fish. As of last week, just 29,000 steelhead passed the Bonneville Dam since July 1 – the fewest ever recorded, less than half the average of the past five years, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups sent a letter to the Oregon, Washington and Idaho agencies that manage fish and wildlife requesting an immediate closure of recreational steelhead fisheries on the Columbia River, the Lower Snake River and their tributaries. “This is a really, really dire year for steelhead – especially wild steelhead – in the Columbia River Basin,” said Rob Kirschner, legal and policy director for The Conservation Angler, which advocates for protection and restoration of wild fish in the Pacific Northwest and Kamchatka, Russia. “We are trying to protect every eligible spawner,” he said. “Every one of these fish counts.” Steelhead on the Columbia and Snake rivers are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Their population has been devastated by habitat destruction, including construction of hydroelectric dams, as well as overfishing and climate change. High water temperatures have also been detrimental.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hundreds of thousands of residents will lose federal pandemic unemployment benefits after this week, including an extra $300 per week, an extra 13 weeks of benefits and coverage for the self-employed. Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that there are sources of help for people who need it once their jobless aid runs out, including federal rental assistance through counties, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary cash-assistance for low-income families. In the first week of August, roughly 640,000 people were receiving the extra $300, according to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry. About 388,000 of them were in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for freelancers or the self-employed, and almost 175,000 were receiving an extra 13 weeks of assistance through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. About 78,000 people were receiving benefits through the state’s regular 26-week unemployment compensation program, which will continue running, but without the extra $300 federal benefit on top. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by President Joe Biden in March, extended those federal benefits and set them to expire after this week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee’s chief of staff, who is under scrutiny for whether he used his political clout to push through a development approval on some wetlands owned by his family, has stepped down, the governor’s office announced Monday. Anthony Silva maintains he did nothing wrong in the approval process, but the issue had become a distraction, the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Tony and I reached a mutual agreement that it is in the best interest of the administration for him to retire from state government effective immediately,” the statement said. “Right now, his situation is a distraction from the critical work we have ahead. I appreciate that Tony understands the need to remove the distraction to ensure we can continue serving Rhode Islanders effectively.” Silva once had an agreement to purchase the property in Cumberland – where McKee was once mayor and Silva was police chief. After the state Department of Environmental Management issued the necessary approvals, the property was purchased by Silva’s son, Ross. Town officials as well as neighbors oppose building on the land, saying developing it would exacerbate flooding problems in the area, and were concerned that Silva and his family got preferential treatment from the state environmental agency.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state has the Department of Motor Vehicles changing how it gives road tests for driver’s licenses. The agency started requiring masks for both new drivers and examiners Wednesday. As of Monday, it is again requiring appointments for driving tests, and on Sept. 7 the department will go back to how it handled testing at the start of the pandemic, with the examiner outside the car, the DMV said in a statement. The modified skills test evaluates the same abilities as the regular test, with the examiner scoring the test from outside, the DMV said. The agency is encouraging but not requiring masks inside its branches. Officials also said many basic services, like driver’s license renewal, can be done online.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s political boundaries set a framework Monday that will allow them to speed through the once-in-a-decade process on a tight schedule this year. The two committees responsible for drawing the new legislative districts began their work in earnest Monday after the U.S. Census Bureau released detailed data earlier this month. Lawmakers only have about 10 weeks to propose districts before a special session of the Legislature convenes Nov. 8. The Census Bureau’s data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re in for a very compact and a very intense schedule over the next two months to get all this accomplished,” Republican Sen. Jim Bolin told the committees, which met jointly Monday. Republican lawmakers cited the shortened process in setting two parameters that will guide their work: keeping new legislative districts between a lower threshold of 24,066 residents and an upper threshold of 26,600 people, and restricting access to the Legislature’s map-drawing software to committee members only. Legislative research staff said they were worried their work would get bogged down if the general public were allowed to propose maps through its software and said people could create their own proposals with other open-source applications.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Cummins Falls State Park has been named state park of the year. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures, the department said in a news release Thursday. The 306-acre park in middle Tennessee used social media to inform people of river conditions, scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs, held day camps for children and school programs, and hosted a weekly home-school group, officials said. Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants, planted native species, built two greenhouses, and grown and processed sorghum, officials said. Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee. It is one of several state parks honored with a 2021 Award of Excellence at a recent park management conference at Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Black arts community is pushing to create a cultural center at the music venue Kenny Dorham’s Backyard, amid broader work for equity in the city’s cultural arts programs and historic preservation in East Austin. “Everybody says the words equity, sustainability. But it turns out, if there’s no intention, no action behind it, it means nothing,” City Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison told a diverse crowd of arts supporters in July as they gathered to celebrate the return of Black contemporary dance company Ballet Afrique to East Austin. “We have so much work to do to make this a truly equitable and truly inclusive city that lives up to our progressive reputation.” In 2019, the city contracted with an outside consultant, MJR Partners, to conduct a review of city-allocated cultural arts and heritage funding. An interim report released in June outlines strategies to achieve greater equity, as well as some of the challenges the city will face. The report notes that “traditional and white-led institutions struggle to accept that historic inequities exist in the city.” “I think the city is really trying,” said Carl Settles, director of the nonprofit E4 Youth, which aims to build bridges between underprivileged area youths and Austin’s creative and tech industries.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Two recently married Utah women were found dead from gunshot wounds after reports of a “weirdo camping near them” and a four-day search in Moab, about an hour away from Arches National Park. On Wednesday, 38-year-old Crystal Turner and 24-year-old Kylen Schulte were found by a family friend in the South Mesa area of La Sal Loop Road, where they had been camping. Schulte and Turner went missing Aug. 14, four days before they were found dead from gunshot wounds, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Schulte’s father had posted on Facebook that they hadn’t been to work, hadn’t called, were not in the hospital and were not in jail. “Kylen and Crystal told close friends that there was a weirdo camping near them that was freaking them out !!! And that they should move campsites. Now they have been missing for over 4 days and nights!” Sean-Paul Schulte posted. The couple’s bodies were transported to the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds, the Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The city is planning to erect a monument to the state’s first known black sheriff and chief of police. The city of Vergennes is planning to unveil and dedicate the monument to former Sheriff Stephen Bates on Oct. 3. Bates was first elected sheriff and chief of police in Vergennes in 1879. Bates had been formerly enslaved in Virginia. He gained his freedom and served Union soldiers during the Civil War. He first came to Vergennes in 1866 with Vermont U.S. Rep. Frederick E. Woodbridge. Bates served as sheriff of Vergennes for 25 years. He raised a family in the city before his death in 1907, and some of his descendants will be attending the event. A local team of historians and others spent the past year researching Bates’ life and rediscovering his story in Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Virginia Republicans that seeks to remove him from the ballot in this year’s closely watched race for governor over an alleged paperwork error. In a filing Friday evening, attorneys for the former governor now running for a second term against GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin said the suit was based on a “legal lie” and would effectively invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes cast in the Democratic primary. The complaint filed last week by the Republican Party of Virginia against state election officials argued that McAuliffe should be disqualified from running in the November general election because of the omission of his signature on an official form declaring his candidacy. McAuliffe argued in his filing that nothing in Virginia code requires a candidate to sign the declaration of candidacy. Further, the filing said: “Even if there were a technical defect with the declaration of candidacy – and there is not – it would provide no basis for removing McAuliffe’s name from the general election ballot and preventing Virginia’s voters from choosing him as their next Governor. The declaration of candidacy is a prerequisite for placement on the ballot in the primary election, not the general election, and the primary election has already concluded.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Hundreds of people gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccine mandate. Announced in early August, Inslee’s order requires most state workers, health care workers and school employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or face losing their jobs. Inslee has said getting people vaccinated is essential for getting Washington past the pandemic. Organizers of the rally Saturday warned that a large segment of state workers, including many firefighters, sanitation workers and bus drivers, won’t get the vaccine – as much as 30% to 40% statewide, they said. It wasn’t clear what that estimate was based on. “If the Governor refuses to rescind his mandate, it will mean that multiple areas of the state will be severely reduced or shut down completely,” Tyler Miller, of the group Liberty, At All Hazards, said in a news release. “The Governor is unnecessarily threatening the genuine safety and well-being of the citizens of Washington if he forces his mandate to stand.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk defended the need for the mandate. “Employees are losing their lives to COVID. Hospitals are filling up. Communities are stressed by the pandemic’s impacts. The safest and most effective way to get beyond these tragic circumstances is vaccination,” Faulk said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who landscape for wildlife use can have their land designated a “wild yard.” The program already has 300 members around the state and is operated through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to create more natural habitat for wildlife around the state. “It’s such a wonderful program to get involved in,” Rebecca Linger, who owns a certified wild yard, said in a news release from the agency. “And you get the added benefit of creating an environment around your house where you can enjoy seeing wildlife coming and going. It really is delightful.” Jim Fregonara, a wildlife biologist with the division, said landowners who apply, provide a habitat plan and demonstrate that their property meets the needs of native wildlife will be added to a register of wild yards. They also receive a certificate for participating in the program and a sign post to display in the yard. “We want to encourage private citizens, whether they have a little bit of property or own a lot of land, to help wildlife thrive by providing them with food, water, shelter and space,” Fregonara said.

Tony Evers said Monday. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have criticized the vetting process and warned about terrorists being allowed into the country. After a tour of the Wisconsin base last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned whether the refugees at Fort McCoy had been fully vetted and called White House assurances about the process “lipstick on a pig.” Evers also toured the base last week and met with refugees. He said Republicans criticizing the vetting of those refugees are “vastly uninformed.” “Or they like to raise that specter of maybe some of those little kids I saw at Fort McCoy are terrorists, or maybe those adults that I saw at Fort McCoy who were working hand in hand with our soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan, somehow they are terrorists even though they’ve been vetted four or five or six times even before they left Afghanistan,” Evers said. “To me, it’s dog whistle crap, and we don’t need any of that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Donations are pouring in for the widow and unborn child of a U.S. Marine killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. Rylee McCollum, 20, was among 13 service members killed by a suicide bomb attack Thursday at the Kabul airport. The troops were providing security as the airport was overwhelmed with people trying to leave the country amid the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover. McCollum was from Bondurant and expecting his first child in three weeks, according to his family. Almost $687,000 had been raised through two online fundraising campaigns, one for the child’s future education costs and one for McCollum’s widow, as of Tuesday morning. McCollum was on his first deployment and manning a checkpoint at the airport when the attack happened, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. McCollum attended Jackson Hole High School and competed as a wrestler. He graduated in 2019 from Summit Innovations School in Jackson.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/01/state-of-the-union-live-updates/6884795001/", "title": "State of the Union: Biden slams Russia for 'unprovoked' invasion", "text": "President Joe Biden fulfilled a constitutional request when he delivered a State of the Union address – his first – to Congress on Tuesday.\n\nThe president kicked off his speech strongly condemning Russia for its \"unprovoked\" invasion of Ukraine, including closing off U.S. airspace to Russia planes.\n\nDomestically, he hailed a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, urging Americans to see the virus, and not each other, as the enemy.\n\nAnd he also addressed inflation, with price jumps hitting 40-year highs recently pressuring American families and making it harder to afford everything from rent to food to schooling.\n\nHere's what else you need to know, along with some history on the speech.\n\nLive updates:660K people have fled Ukraine as Russia resumes attacks on crowded cities\n\nHistoric moment:For first time in history, two women sat behind president at State of the Union\n\nWhat does the progressive response to the State of the Union mean?\n\nRep.

Even as Biden climbed to the dais in the House of Representatives, Kyiv was bracing for an all-out Russian assault that could lead to the occupation of the capital and the overthrow of the nation's democratically elected government.\n\nRead the whole story here:A world of change: Biden seeks his footing as his agenda and the landscape are transformed\n\nWho heckled Biden?\n\nA notable moment in the State of the Union came when Biden talked about talked about the flag-draped coffins of fallen service members, including his son, Beau, who died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\nAs Biden spoke about Beau, people inside the House chambers reported someone shouting, “You put them in there, 13 of them.\" After the comment was made, attendees in the chambers began to boo and groan at the comment, as Biden paused for a brief moment and continued his address.\n\nBoebert later confirmed on Twitter she in fact made the comment, in reference to the 13 U.S. soldiers who were killed in a suicide bombing attack at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport in August as the Taliban took over Afghanistan and Afghans attempted to flee the country.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden touts Justice Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nIn one of the more touching moments of Biden’s remarks Tuesday, the president briefly recognized Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced he will step down from the Supreme Court after nearly three decades.\n\nBreyer, holding his hands over his heart and, at one point, his face, appeared to be embarrassed by the attention. Breyer, who will retire in June, approached Biden after the address and the two spoke for several minutes and shared a laugh.\n\n“Thank you for your service,” Biden said to Breyer during the speech. “Thank you. Thank you.”\n\nBiden nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for Breyer’s seat on Friday, and the Miami native, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit since June, has started to meet with members of the Senate who will vote on her confirmation later spring.\n\nThe president described Jackson as a “consensus builder” but made no mention, as he has in other venues, of what makes Jackson a historic candidate: She would be the first Black woman ever to serve on the nation’s highest court.\n\nAt 51, Jackson could serve on the Supreme Court for decades.

Here's more about the 13-year-old who stole the show at State of the Union\n\nOf all the guests invited to President Joe Biden's first State of the Union address, one of the few mentioned was 13-year-old Joshua Davis. Davis, who is from Midlothian, Virginia, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was just 11 months old, according to the White House.\n\nAt the age of four, Davis began advocating for the Virginia General Assembly to make \"school safer for kids with Type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the seventh-grader at Swift Creek Middle School introduced President Biden at an event on prescription drug costs at a community college in Virginia.\n\n--Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden's report on the State of the Union: Strong\n\nThe president struck an optimistic tone in his concluding remarks, praising American values and calling the moment a \"test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\"\n\n\"It is in this moment that our character is formed.

Many soldiers who breathe smoke from them develop headaches, numbness, dizziness and even cancer, Biden said.\n\n“I know,” he said. “One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.”\n\nBeau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer at age 46.\n\n“We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer or the diseases of so many of our troops,” Biden said. “But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.”\n\n-– Michael Collins\n\nBiden: ‘Let's end cancer as we know it’\n\nBiden highlighted his announcement last month to relaunch the Cancer Moonshot, an issue close to the president’s heart after his son, Beau, died of brain cancer.\n\n“Let's end cancer as we know it,” he said.\n\nBiden noted that the fight to end cancer is personal for him and First Lady Jill Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother died of colon cancer.\n\n“So many of you lost someone you love: Husband wife, son, daughter, mom, dad,” Biden added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nLawmakers react in the chamber following speech\n\nFollowing the speech, Sen.

But Biden noted how this is a pivotal moment for Americans to stay focused in the face of the contagion’s possible resurgence.\n\n“Let’s use this moment to reset,” he said. “Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.”\n\nBiden noted how many lives have been lost, and that Americans cannot let the contagion divide them further.\n\n“We can’t change how divided we’ve been,” he said. “But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.”\n\n— Phillip M.

Our kids need to be in school.\"\n\nBiden also noted that with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their mask as they return to classrooms and offices.\n\nHe told the mostly maskless crowd that continuing his administration COVID-19 response efforts would cost more money and he intended to send Congress a request for more funds.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden outlines plans to lower deficit\n\nThe president urged lawmakers to confirm his nominees to head the Federal Reserve, calling it crucial to his plan to fight inflation.\n\nBiden said his plan is designed to “monitor and lower costs” and “give families a fair shot” while also lowering the deficit.\n\n“The previous administration not only ballooned the deficit, it undermined the watchdogs of those pandemic relief funds,” Biden said, and added that his administration reprioritized going after criminals who commit pandemic relief-related fraud.\n\nBiden also stated that he is the only president to have cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion dollars in a single year and vowed to even the economic playing field for Americans.\n\n“Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation,” Biden said.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden on COVID: ‘We’re moving forward’\n\nBiden said the United States has made progress to move past COVID-19, noting the updated mask guidelines issued by the CDC last week.\n\n“Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines,” he said. “We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19.\"\n\n“COVID-19 need no longer control our lives,” he added.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden vows to crack down on price gouging\n\nBiden announced a crackdown on companies that practice price gouging.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits, he said.\n\n\"I’m a capitalist,” he said. “But capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation – and it drives up prices.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n‘Secret ballot’ on taxes?\n\nBiden challenged Congress to adopt his plan at reforming the tax code, promising that under his plan no one earning less than $400,000 a year would “pay an additional penny in new taxes.”\n\n“I may be wrong but my guess is if we took a secret ballot on this floor that we’d all agree that the president tax system ain’t fair,” Biden said. “We have to fix it.”\n\nThe president’s remarks received a more lukewarm response, especially from congressional Republicans, who have resisted his idea.\n\nBut Biden’s pitch to the American people argued that his tax plan would grow the economy and doesn’t “punish anyone” but rather seeks to even the playing field by ensuring U.S. companies and its wealthiest individuals to “start paying their fair share.”\n\n“Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax,” Biden said. “That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.”\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSome Republicans take notes, joke to colleagues during Biden's speech\n\nSome Republican Senators appear to be taking notes on Biden's remarks, including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., turned to Scott and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., and moved his hand up and down, appearing to point out Democrats standing up and down in applause, garnering laughter from his colleagues.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nBiden calls for reviving plan for child care and universal pre-kindergarten\n\nThe president reiterated his longstanding call to cut the cost of child care for parents, pointing out that most American families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. A recent report by Child Care Aware of America found the price of child care has exceeded the annual inflation rate by 4 percent in 2020.\n\n\"Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children,\" he said.\n\nBiden's child care plan is part of his Build Back Better bill that was effectively killed after Sen. Joe Manchin announced late last year he wouldn't vote to pass it. The president also called for reviving plans to cut the cost of home and long-term care and creating a plan for universal pre-kindergarten for every 3- and 4-year-old.\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden pushes for climate investments as part of his inflation pitch\n\nBiden called for several climate investments that he said will save families money as part of his efforts aimed at tackling rising inflation.\n\nThat included investment tax credits for Americans to weatherize their homes, doubling clean energy production and lowering the price of electric vehicles.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nMore:UN panel's grim climate change report: 'Parts of the planet will become uninhabitable'\n\nBiden touts ‘revitalization’ of American manufacturing\n\nBiden praised what he said is the revitalization of the American manufacturing and said he agreed with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown that it’s time to bury the “Rust Belt” label.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories in the United States when just a few years ago they would have built them overseas, he said.\n\nFord is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country, he said. GM is making the largest investment in its history – $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nBiden said the revitalization is being driven by people like Joseph “JoJo” Burgess, a Pennsylvania steelworker who was seated in the first lady’s viewing box.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden called on lowering the cost of drug prices, such as insulin.\n\nThe president shouted out Joshua Davis, a 13-year-old with diabetes, who attended the address.\n\n“For Joshua & the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it,” Biden said.\n\nHe added that he spoke with Joshua’s mom about how hard it's been to afford the drug.\n\n“Imagine what it's like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God's name you're going to be able to pay for it,” Biden said.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\n'It is legal extortion':Diabetics pay steep price for insulin as rebates drive up costs\n\nBiden aims for investment in Intel, competitiveness with China\n\nIntel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, recently unveiled plans to build a $20 billion complex outside of Columbus, Ohio, a move Biden hailed as a major sign of progress in his administration's work to boost U.S. production of the critical microchips at a time of rising competition with China.\n\n“That's why it's so important to pass the bipartisan (Innovation and Competition Act) in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing,” Biden said. The president also acknowledged Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was invited to the speech.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden: We can cut inflation by making more things in the U.S.\n\nBiden said one way to reduce inflation – one of his biggest political problems – is to make more products in the United States, reducing rely on blocked supply chains.\n\n\"Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America,\": he said.\n\nThe president was not very specific about how to do that; Republicans say his proposed environment regulations will choke industry.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden touts ‘infrastructure decade’\n\nShifting from Ukraine, Biden touted his American Rescue Plan legislation and infrastructure law, the latter of which he got support from Republicans to pass in the evenly divided Senate.\n\n“I want to thank members of both parties who helped make it happen,” Biden said. “We’re done talking about infrastructure week. We’re talking about the infrastructure decade.”\n\nHe pointed to broadband expansion, roadway and bridge repairs and lead pipe replacement among the projects that will be funded.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says Putin ‘will never gain the hearts’ of Ukrainians\n\nBiden said that Democracies are “rising to the moment” as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin may be able to circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people,” he said. \"He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\"\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden: U.S. to release 30 million barrels from Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nBiden said the U.S. is working with 30 countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around world to ease the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy markets.\n\nThe U.S. is leading the effort by releasing 30 million barrels from its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he said.\n\n“These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home,” he said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nStanding ovation for Biden’s vow to defend NATO countries\n\nDespite Russia’s devastating attack on Ukraine, President Biden reiterated support in the form of economic sanctions, not the deployment of U.S. troops, to the vulnerable area.\n\n“We have mobilized American ground forces, air squadron, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. And as I’ve made crystal clear, the United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power,” Biden said.\n\nHis remarks received a standing ovation from lawmakers in the chamber.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nWhat is NATO?:Military alliance in spotlight as Russia tries to forbid Ukraine membership\n\nBiden: Sanctions are strangling Putin's Russia\n\nBiden outlined a strict set of sanctions meant to choke the Russian economy in retribution for Putin’s invasion.\n\n“Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more,” he said.\n\nThe president, who praised Ukraine’s resolve on the battlefield, said the Justice Department is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian’s wealthiest people. He pledged that the U.S., along with European allies, will look seize Russian yachts, luxury apartments and private jets.\n\n“We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” Biden said.\n\nAmerica has seen immediate dividends with its economic sanctions and $1 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to the president, who said that along with closing U.S. air space to all Russian flights the Ruble has lost 30% of its value; its stock has dipped by 40% and trading with the foreign country has been halted.\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMore:Biden threatens devastating sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Here's what that might look like.\n\nBiden says 'no more' to Russian oligarchs, announces closure of US airspace to Russian aircraft\n\nBiden said the U.S. and western allies are enforcing \"powerful economic sanctions,\" including cutting off Russia's largest banks from international financial systems, preventing Russia's central bank from shoring up the Russian ruble and \"making Putin's $260 billion war fund worthless.\"\n\nHe announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights, joining a growing number of countries around the world that have made similar moves in recent days.\n\nThe president also said coordinated sanctions are \"choking off Russia's access to technology\" that will weaken its military and undermine its economic strength.\n\nU.S. and European sanctions also target Putin and his inner circle as well as Russian oligarchs.\n\n\"Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: no more,\" he said. \"We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\"\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nZelenskyy government:What happens if Kyiv falls? What would a government in exile look like?\n\nPutin more ‘isolated from the world’ than ever, Biden says\n\nBiden hailed the united response of the U.S. and western allies against Russia President Vladimir Putin as Russia continues its war in Ukraine.\n\nBiden called the attack “premeditated and totally unprovoked,” adding that Putin thought he could divide the world.\n\n“But Putin was wrong. We are ready.

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, a former member of the House, blew kisses as she walked down the aisle, before taking her place next to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Fudge is sitting across the aisle from Supreme Court Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n-- Dylan Wells\n\nSome lawmakers noticeably absent from State of the Union\n\nAs President Biden addressed lawmakers and the nation Tuesday, the absence of some who were invited to the speech did not go unnoticed.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio said during a February appearance on conservative news network Newsmax that he would not attend due to the COVID-19 testing mandate and that he would watch replays of the speech on television.\n\n\"I'm just tired of all that COVID theater crap,” Rubio said.\n\n“Same,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy tweeted Monday in response to a post about Rubio’s absence. “I will not attend.”\n\nFour other Republican members of Congress, Mary Miller, R-Ill., Bob Good, R-Va., Matt Rosendale, R-MT and Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., told Newsmax Tuesday they would also skip the speech due to health safety precautions.\n\nAt least five Democratic lawmakers, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., Suzan DelBene, D-Wash. And Ted Deutch, D-Fla., tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of the address.\n\n-- Chelsey Cox\n\nFive Supreme Court justices show for speech\n\nBiden is getting something for his State of the Union address that’s been hard to come by for much of his presidency: a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, joined by four associate justices, filed into the House chamber before the president's remarks Tuesday, the first time five members of the nine-member court have appeared for a presidential address to Congress since President Donald Trump’s remarks in 2017.\n\nIn addition to Roberts, Associate Justices Stephen Breyer -- set to retire in June -- Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are attending the address, taking their traditional front-row seats.\n\nBiden has had a series of setbacks at the nation's highest court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 advantage. A majority of the justices sided against the administration’s COVID-19 eviction moratorium in August. Last month, the court blocked a requirement that large companies implement vaccine-or-testing mandates to fight the virus.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nMore:Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer to step down, giving Biden a chance to make his mark\n\nMembers sporting Ukraine flags and colors\n\nThere are signs of support for Ukraine in the House chamber.\n\nUkraine-born Rep.

He’s also expected to urge Congress to pass his $300 million budget request to more than double the size of the Department of Justice’s COPS community policing grant program.\n\nRepublicans have sought to tie Biden and other Democrats to the “defund the police” mantra on the left, even though Biden has repeatedly rejected that phrase.\n\n“He'll make clear that the answer is not to defund the police, it’s to put more police – with better training and more accountability – out to take back our streets and make our neighborhoods safer,” a White House official said.\n\nAlthough Republicans in the Senate have refused to pass sweeping gun reform measures, Biden will point to his administration's unilateral efforts. That includes creating five new Justice Department gun trafficking strike forces to target the illegal; an executive order aimed at “ghost guns,” and new ATF rules.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nU.S. to close airspace to Russian planes\n\nBiden will announce in his State of the Union address that the U.S. is closing its airspace to Russian planes in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, three sources told USA TODAY.\n\nThe U.S. joins a growing list of countries that have announced plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the invasion.\n\nThe E.U. banned all Russian aircraft from its airspace after several European countries including France, Italy and Denmark as well as Canada announced the move Sunday.

Brett Guthrie, of Kentucky, showed off how dozens of members from both parties had gathered on the Capitol steps before the address with a flag merging the U.S. and Ukrainian colors.\n\n“Today I joined my colleagues to show solidarity for the Ukrainian people,” Guthrie, a Republican, said. “Their bravery in the fight against Putin's unlawful and unprovoked invasion is inspiring.

Bailey\n\nSOTU comes as inflation soars\n\nBiden delivers his State of the Union address at a time when inflation has soared to its highest level in four decades.\n\nConsumer prices jumped 7.5% last month compared with 12 months earlier, the steepest year-over-year increase since February 1982, the Labor Department reported last month. The increase was driven by shortages of supplies and workers, heavy doses of federal aid, low interest rates and robust consumer spending, the department said.\n\nThe steady surge in prices has left many Americans less able to afford food, gas, rent, child care and other necessities.\n\n-- Michael Collins, Associated Press\n\nExplained:What is inflation and how does it affect you?

Troops appeared to run out of gas and food, but it's also possible the Russians are pausing to regroup and reassess their attack, a senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Tuesday.\n\nUkrainians are bracing for continued attacks after at least 11 people were killed and 35 others wounded in an apparent rocket strike in Kharkiv. Earlier, Russian strikes hit Kyiv's main broadcasting tower and the nearby Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial site, where Nazis killed thousands of Jews during World War II. Ukraine's foreign minister confirmed the attack.\n\nAhead of his remarks, Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more than 30 minutes.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will cast a long shadow over Biden’s State of the Union address. Biden will seek to reassure the country that it's entering a new phase in the fight against COVID-19.

They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising,” he is expected to say.\n\n“That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\n\n“It matters. American diplomacy matters.\n\n“Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at diplomacy.

And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains – let’s make it in America.\n\n“Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” I call it building a better America,” he will say.\n\n“My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit,” he is expected to say.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden speech focus: The U.S. and Europe must be united against Russia\n\nPreviewing his State of the Union speech to a group of journalists, President Joe Biden said he will stress the importance of unity between the United States and Europe in confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a lunch with television anchors and others, Biden said he would re-emphasize \"my determination to see to it that the EU, NATO, all of our allies are on the same exact page in terms of sanctions against Russia and how we deal with the invasion – and it is an invasion – of Ukraine.\"\n\nThis from a tweet by CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who also reported that Biden declared global unity \"the one thing that gives us power to impose severe consequences on Putin for what he’s done.\"\n\nPresidents host these kinds of lunches with television anchors before every State of the Union address. The sessions are off the record, but White Houses often put a few comments on the record.\n\nIn this case, Biden wanted to make clear his message on Ukraine.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nMore:Americans are at higher risk of Russian cyberattacks after Ukraine invasion: What you should do right now\n\nBiden will roll out mental health crisis strategies\n\nBiden will outline his plan for tackling the mental health crisis during his first State of the Union.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Biden will call on Congress to pass legislation to support those policies that increase the capacity of the mental health system to provide care, make it easier for those who need care to get it and address the determinants of health.\n\nAmong the policies he will pitch, according to the White House:\n\nA plan to spend $700 million on training, scholarship and loan repayment for those who pursue careers in mental health and substance abuse treatment in rural communities and other underserved areas.\n\nA proposal that health plans cover \"robust behavioral health services with an adequate network of providers, including three behavioral health visits each year without cost-sharing.\"\n\nTo address concerns about digital technology and social media damage to the mental health of young people, Biden wants to ban targeted advertising for children online and stop online algorithms from returning results that damage their mental well-being.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nPelosi won’t be wearing a mask during State of the Union\n\nAs she sits behind President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be mask-less.\n\n“I’m not going to be wearing a mask tonight,” Pelosi told MSNBC Tuesday. “If I had little children, or if I were around little grandchildren I would because some of them would not be vaccinated.”\n\nDemocratic House leadership lifted its mask mandate in the House in time for the president’s first State of the Union. It comes as the rate of positive COVID-19 test results dropped to 2.7% at the Capitol’s testing site, according to Politico, and as the District of Columbia dropped its indoor mask mandate as COVID-19 cases have plummeted in Washington.\n\nThe White House on Tuesday ended its mask requirement for vaccinated staff members. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said she hadn’t spoken to Biden on whether he will wear a mask when he walks into the House Chamber.\n\n“He will certainly not be wearing a mask when he's speaking,” Psaki said.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat was the shortest State of the Union? the longest?\n\nWhich presidents delivered the longest and the shortest State of the Unions? It depends on your measuring stick.\n\nBased on word count, President George Washington’s delivered the shortest speech on record in 1790, before the annual message was even dubbed the State of the Union. Washington’s speech to a joint session of Congress measured in at 1,089 words, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nNot every president has delivered an oral message, however. After President Thomas Jefferson eschewed a speech in favor of a written message to Congress in 1801, it took more than a century before President Woodrow Wilson revived the tradition of an in-person speech in 1913.\n\nDating back to 1964, the shortest oral delivery of a State of the Union was President Ronald Reagan’s 31-minute speech in 1986, according to The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Congressional Research Service noted that speech still had a word count about three times as long as Washington’s inaugural annual message.\n\nThe longest written message to date belongs to President Jimmy Carter, who delivered a 33,667-word written State of the Union in 1981. In his final State of the Union in 2000, President Bill Clinton set the high watermark for an in-person speech at just under 90 minutes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s 80-minute average is the longest of all presidents dating to 1964, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nWhy is this Biden’s first State of the Union?\n\nThe concept of an annual update from the president to members of Congress has existed as long as the presidency. President George Washington delivered the first of what was then called the “Annual Message” in 1790.\n\nThat is rooted in the constitutional requirement to provide an update “from time to time.” The speech was not formally named the State of the Union until 1947, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nBut recent tradition has been for presidents to not deliver a formal State of the Union in the year they were inaugurated but instead to simply speak before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did that in 2021, as the six presidents before him had done in their inauguration years. That means Biden’s 2022 address will be his first formal State of the Union.\n\n– Rick Rouan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/30/menorahs-aglow-toaster-bullets-wright-brothers-news-around-states/49457057/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Doyle Lee Hamm, an inmate whose lethal injection was halted because medical staff couldn’t find a suitable vein for the execution, has died of natural causes almost four years later, his attorney said. Hamm, who was convicted in the slaying of a motel clerk in 1987, died of natural causes on death row, said his longtime attorney, Bernard Harcourt. He was 64. Officials postponed Hamm’s execution in February 2018 because workers couldn’t find a suitable vein to connect the intravenous line used to send lethal chemicals into his body. Hamm and the state reached an agreement the following month that prevented further execution attempts, but he remained on death row at Holman Prison because of his capital conviction, Harcourt said. Hamm suffered from an aggressive lymphatic cancer for years, Harcourt said. The Holman warden called Hamm’s brother to inform him of the prisoner’s death Sunday morning, Harcourt said.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A popular Kenai Peninsula recreation spot near Cooper Landing will be closed for nearly a year to partially rebuild a road and reinforce parts of the hillside along the Kenai River, U.S. Forest Service officials said. The Russian River Campground Road and campground will be closed to the public from Aug. 1, 2022, to June 1, 2023, the Peninsula Clarion reported. Among the scheduled work will be rebuilding the campground road to make it safer for cars, recreational vehicles and pedestrians, the forest service said in a statement. The shoulder will also be widened, and a new guardrail will be installed. Work to reinforce the hillside along the riverbank will make the area less prone to landslides and surface erosion, and officials said the work is scheduled to be done before the sockeye salmon sport fishing season opens. “Reducing the long-term threat of erosion and landslides is essential to preserving the water quality for healthy salmon spawning and rearing in the Russian and Kenai rivers,” the statement said. The service also said residents and visitors should be mindful of the upcoming closure when making recreation plans for the area.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The city is pausing the construction of buildings in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey because of soaring costs. The Arizona Daily Sun reported officials made the decision earlier this month after determining the project would cost an additional $10 million. The collaboration encompasses demolishing buildings on the USGS campus near Buffalo Park and erecting a new warehouse and lab offices. The city owns the land and buildings but leases it to the USGS. City Capital Improvements manager David Peterson said the Flagstaff City Council approved going through with the project in September but it has been in the planning stages for a decade. In 2016, the projected cost was $20.8 million. Now, it is $32.8 million. Rick Tadder, city management services director, said the project was approved by voters in 2004. He is optimistic that the city and federal officials can step back and find an alternative solution.\n\nArkansas\n\nGreenwood:A Greenwood organization is holding its annual Christmas light display to raise money for community members. Focus on Greenwood’s light display is free to visit, but the group is encouraging people to donate money to the organization, said Richard McKinney, the chairman of Focus on Greenwood. The light display usually generates a few thousand dollars for the organization. That and a fall 5K run are the group’s two largest fundraisers. The Trail of Lights has approximately 50 displays and will open Friday and last through the first week of the new year. It is located at Bell Park. On Thursday and Dec. 18, Focus on Greenwood will hold hayrides on the Trail of Lights. Hot chocolate and s’mores will be available on those dates. The Trail of Lights will also offer a live nativity scene Dec. 13, Dec. 14, Dec. 16 and Dec. 17. The nonprofit formed after members of several chapters of national organizations came together to create a group that is more Greenwood-centric. As a local organization, the members have more control over where the group’s money goes. It allows them to pour money back into the community.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOxnard: Officials are using a California naval base to help alleviate congestion at Los Angeles County ports in time for holiday shopping. The Ventura County Star reported Sunday the Port of Hueneme has an agreement with Naval Base Ventura County to use a wharf, two buildings and land inside the base. Base spokesman Drew Verbis said the wharf is typically used by the Navy to tie up war ships. He said the joint-use agreement dates to 2002, but this is the first time in more than a decade that it has been activated. It was activated earlier this month. The goal is to help alleviate port congestion to the south. Ships have been waiting offshore to unload their goods at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver Xcel Energy has proposed a tentative agreement to close Colorado’s largest coal-fired power plant by 2035, well ahead of its original retirement date of 2070, as regulators consider how the largest utility operating in the state can reduce its carbon emissions. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy filed the agreement with the state Nov. 24 affecting its Comanche 3 coal-fired unit at the Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo, Colorado Public Radio reported. Comanche 3 has faced operational, equipment and financial problems that led to more than 700 days of unplanned shutdowns since 2010 and higher-than-anticipated electricity costs, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said in a report earlier this year. If approved, Xcel’s plan to close it could reduce the utility’s carbon dioxide emissions in Colorado by close to 90% this decade, CPR reported. The $1.3 billion unit went into service in 2010 but has been hampered by poor maintenance and oversight, with electricity costs up to 45% higher than projected, according to the state report. Comanche 3 also was Colorado’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. The plan calls for Comanche 3 to run at half-capacity by 2025 and a third of capacity by 2029.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A dozen nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in Connecticut over a recent two-week period, which is the largest number since mid-August, new data released Friday showed. There were 125 positive cases of COVID-19 among residents between Nov. 10 and Nov. 23, with 12 deaths, according to state Department of Health data. Sixty-seven staff also tested positive during the same period. Five of those deaths occurred at Candlewood Valley Health and Rehabilitation Center in New Milford, which reported 36 positive cases among its 105 residents and eight positive cases among its staff. A message was left seeking comment with the facility’s administrator. The last time there were more than a dozen nursing deaths reported during a two-week period was between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31. At that time, there were 16 deaths from COVID-19 among nursing home residents, 111 positive cases among residents and 94 cases among staff.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:The Capital Holiday Celebration in downtown Dover will feature a month of events including a tree lighting, caroling, visits from Santa, crafts for children, performances by musicians and programs at parks and museums. Organizing the events takes months, with cooperation from city officials, the Dover Public Library, the Central Delaware Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Dover Partnership/Main Street Dover. “Since we were prohibited from encouraging gatherings last year due to COVID, the traditional holiday parade became a fun, lighted vehicular parade,” said Diane Laird, executive director of the Downtown Dover Partnership. The electric light parade, known as “Dashing Through Dover,” will trake place on Loockerman Street at 6 p.m. Dec. 11. The tree lighting takes place at 5:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Festival of Lights kicked off in D.C. with a clear view of the White House on a chilly Sunday night as the National Menorah was lit, brightly celebrating the first night of Hanukkah, WUSA-TV reported. Doug Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, spoke at the ceremony, which had thousands in attendance and a record number of people watching virtually, National Menorah Media stated via a press release. “May this festival of lights bring blessings upon you and your loved ones over these next eight nights. From our family to yours, have a Happy Hanukkah!” Emhoff tweeted the afternoon of the ceremony. He is the first Jewish spouse of an American president or vice president.\n\nFlorida\n\nLauderhill: The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration has begun a process to revoke a South Florida assisted living home’s license after a 69-year-old woman who went missing ended up dead in a car in the parking lot. Yvanne Moise left Victoria’s Retirement home in Lauderhill on Sept. 18 and never returned, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported. The state health care agency’s recent inspection said the facility lacked a plan required by state law to address Moise’s “severe or persistent mental condition.” And it did not have updated versions of those plans for seven of its 18 other residents who were also considered “limited mental health residents,” the newspaper reported. Moise didn’t sign out when she left the home on Sept. 18. The report said she repeatedly told a staff member she was going to leave, and by 8:30 a.m., she was nowhere to be found. The report said an employee watched her walk out the front gate and into the parking lot. Moise didn’t listen to the employee’s multiple attempts to get her to stay. The employee then went inside to to call the facility’s administrator to report that Moise wouldn’t come back inside.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: More than half of absentee ballot applications rejected in Georgia in advance of the Nov. 2 election were turned down because they came in after a deadline created in Georgia’s new voting law. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported 52% of applications were rejected because voters asked for an absentee ballot within the last 11 days before the election, too late to meet the requirements of a voting law passed in March. The deadline was created in Senate Bill 202, which also limited absentee voting by restricting drop boxes and requiring voters to prove they had a driver’s license or other state identification when applying. The top reason Georgia election officials rejected absentee ballot applications this fall was that they were submitted too close to Election Day, missing a deadline imposed by the state’s new voting law. Republicans in the General Assembly pushed through the new law after a record 1.3 million Georgians mailed in or dropped off ballots in the 2020 presidential election. The newspaper reported about 26% of those who made absentee ballot requests after the deadline cast ballots in person on Election Day.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A Kauai nonprofit now owns the island’s last remaining fishpond through a private donation and the Trust for Public Land. The 102-acre Alakoko Fishpond dates at least 600 years. Its owners put the property on the market for $3 million, Hawaii Public Radio reported. The new owner is Mālama Hulēʻia, a nonprofit that has been restoring the fishpond for the last four years. The Trust for Public Land raised funds and secured a donation from Chan Zuckerberg Kauai Community Fund of the Hawaii Community Foundation. The trust then bought the property and conveyed it to Mālama Hulē’ia. The deed ensures the fishpond will be used for conservation and Native Hawaiian education, aquaculture, and stewardship. The trust didn’t say how much it paid for the property. A trust representative didn’t immediately return a phone message from the Associated Press on Friday. Sara Bowen, Mālama Hulēʻia’s leader, said the top priority is repairing fishpond’s 2,700 feet-long wall with the ultimate goal of having Alakoko again be a source of healthy local food. The fishpond is also known as the Menehune Fishpond.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho’s parole board is scheduled to hold a hearing this week on a request to reduce the death penalty sentence of an inmate with terminal cancer to a sentence of life in prison. Idaho’s Commission of Pardons and Parole is scheduled to meet Tuesday to hear the request to commute the sentence of Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr., who was convicted of a double murder in 1985, the Idaho Statesman reported. The commission agreed to the hearing in May, staying Pizzuto’s June 2 execution date. Pizzuto, 65, has been on death row for 35 years after being convicted for the July 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors at a cabin north of McCall. Pizzuto has bladder cancer, diabetes and heart disease and is confined to a wheelchair. He has been in hospice care since 2019, when doctors said he likely wouldn’t survive for another year. If the seven-member board grants Pizzuto clemency, Gov. Brad Little must approve the decision.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Grant money from the state’s pheasant wildlife program will support upland game conservation and restoration of prairies and woodlands in northern Illinois. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced this weeks grants of more than $113,000. The money comes from the State Pheasant Fund Special Wildlife Funds Grant Program. It’s replenished by proceeds from the sale of habitat stamps. The Logan County-based Quail and Upland Game Alliance will receive $83,362 to complete “wildlife-friendly management work” to pheasant ranges on public and private land. The alliance will put up about $25,300 in matching funds. Work will proceed on land that is not part of the federal Conservation Reserve Program, as well as enrolled acreage. CRP pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive land out of production and use it to grow plants that will improve the environment. A grant of $30,000 was awarded to the Natural Land Institute. The Rockford-based organization’s work at Lost Flora Fen on Raccoon Creek in Winnebago County aims to restore 120 acres of native prairie and improve 277 acres of existing prairie and woodland.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: A legal fight is emerging over the redrawing of local election districts in St. Joseph County. The Democratic-controlled County Council voted last week to hire a law firm for a possible lawsuit against the new election maps approved by the all-Republican county commissioners. Opponents of those new maps argued they wrongly shift most of the county’s Black population into one of the three commissioners districts that is confined to the South Bend city limits, the South Bend Tribune reported. Critics said it’s an example of “packing” as many racial and ethnic minorities as possible into one district to limit their influence and that the new districts favor Republicans. Commissioners President Andy Kostielney has said he’s confident the proposed maps would stand up to any legal challenge. Political tensions over the St. Joseph County redistricting grew this fall after the commissioners spent $35,000 to hire the law firm of Republican former Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma for help drawing the maps. The County Council has set aside $50,000 to pay Indianapolis law firm Ice Miller. Former state Democratic Chairman Kip Tew, who is leading the Ice Miller legal team, said he didn’t know how quickly a court challenge to the redistricting could be resolved.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandaleAn Iowa hospital said it is implementing procedures to ensure it doesn’t repeat a mistake made two weekends ago when more than 100 children were given the wrong dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. MercyOne said in a statement that the children under age 12 at a mass vaccination event Nov. 20 in Urbandale should have received the prescribed 10-microgram dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Instead, they received 20 micrograms, still less than the adult dosage of 30 micrograms. The hospital said the higher dosage could include more pronounced side effects such as a sore arm, mild fever, headache and fatigue. The hospital said it is reaching out to parents of the children, and pediatricians are available to answer questions from the families.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:State Rep. Aaron Coleman, D-Kansas City, was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence Saturday morning in Douglas County, just weeks after the embattled lawmaker was arrested and charged with domestic battery. Coleman was booked into the Douglas County jail at 1 a.m. Saturday, jail records showed, and charged with one count of misdemeanor driving under the influence. The booking report showed Coleman was stopped by the Kansas Highway Patrol at mile marker 203 of Interstate 70, heading westbound. Coleman was released on a $250 bond, jail records showed. He did not answer a phone call seeking comment Sunday night. The event came after Coleman was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery stemming from an altercation with his brother, where police records showed the 21-year-old lawmaker allegedly hit and spit on his brother and made threatening remarks to his grandfather.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Parishioners in Kentucky have accused a Roman Catholic priest of converting church funds for his personal use. Current and former parish council members at St. John Vianney Catholic Church in Louisville filed a civil lawsuit in Jefferson County against the Rev. Anthony Ngo, news outlets reported. The lawsuit accused Ngo of violating his fiduciary duties by pocketing the donations. Ngo has refused to share documents with the parish council about the church’s funds and donations and instructed a parish accountant to withhold the documents as well, it said. “Donations made by parishioners and others to the parish have been converted by (Ngo) without authority or accountability,” the lawsuit said. Ngo has declined comment, citing the ongoing lawsuit. Louisville Archdiocese spokeswoman Cecelia Price said a financial audit was conducted and “no malfeasance was found.” Ngo has been pastor for more than two decades and remains assigned to the church. Price said the audit did identify “some procedural and management issues, and financial procedures will be reinforced for good financial management going forward.” The lawsuit also said Ngo removed the plaintiffs from their volunteer roles on the parish council out of retaliation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An environmental group that makes oyster reefs from shells collected at area restaurants now has a new partner so anyone can contribute. “After enjoying oysters at home with family and friends, you can help protect our coast” by bringing shells to a public drop-off, said Kellyn LaCour-Conant, restoration programs director at the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. The organization has created four reefs with shells collected from restaurants since it began the “Restaurants to Reefs” program in 2014. The Green Project, which runs a salvage store and paint recycling project, now has purple oyster collection bins outside, the coalition said in a news release Friday. People can drop off their empty oyster shells from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday. Another environmental recycler had been doing that. But Glass Half Full had to pause that after Hurricane Ida hit in late August, the news release said. Reefs provide homes and nurseries for hundreds of kinds of marine animals and plants. Each oyster can filter up to 25 gallons of water a day. And the reefs slow down the waves that chew continually at Louisiana’s coast. The coalition’s recycling program has used more than 5 tons of shells to build 1.3 miles of living shoreline.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: A 37-year-old Maine woman has been rescued by game wardens after falling in Aroostook State Park in Presque Isle, officials said. Wardens said the Caribou woman was hiking with three relatives Saturday when she slipped on a snowy area on the trail to the south peak and slid about 40 feet downhill. The woman suffered a possible broken hip and some facial cuts, and she was unable to walk. The first warden on the scene requested a helicopter, but because of snow and wind, none could respond. A team of seven game wardens, rescue personnel from Presque Isle and volunteers carried the woman off the trail. The woman was taken to a Presque Isle hospital. Her condition was unknown.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: Researchers at three universities in Maryland will study why there are so few women and people of color in leadership roles at universities. They’re also hoping to bring more diversity to those top jobs. The Washington Post reported Saturday that the research will be conducted by faculty from the University of Maryland in College Park, the University of Maryland Baltimore County and Morgan State University. The researchers are getting the support of a $3 million grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Phillip Brian Harper, the foundation’s program director for higher learning, noted that each of the three schools has a Black president. “(T)hese institutions already manifest the type of leadership that we are trying to promote within the U.S. academy,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A woman with a loaded handgun in her carry-on bag was stopped at a security checkpoint at Logan International Airport on the day before Thanksgiving, according to the Transportation Security Administration. The handgun had five rounds in it when it was found in the bag, TSA spokesperson Dan Velez said in a tweet. State police were called and “cited the woman on a state charge,” according to the tweet. Her name was not made public. TSA officers have found 16 firearms at security checkpoints in Boston so far this year, he said. Firearms can be transported on a commercial aircraft only if they are unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and placed in checked baggage, the TSA said. Ammunition, firearm parts, and replica firearms are also prohibited in carry-on baggage and must be checked.\n\nMichigan\n\nBay City: Residents complaining about foul odors from a sugar beet processor in Bay City have a lost a key decision at the Michigan Court of Appeals. Michigan Sugar, which turns beets into sugar, is accused of depriving people from enjoying their property because of odors. But the appeals court said Mikkie Morley and Jonathan Morley, who moved into their home in 2016, haven’t exhausted the complaint process at state agencies. The court also dismissed a separate negligence claim. “The alleged noxious odors in this case amount to a transitory condition and the Morleys have not alleged that the condition has physically damaged their property,” the court said in a 3-0 opinion on Nov. 18. Laura Sheets said her law office has been contacted by hundreds of residents. “You want to sit out on your porch or mow your yard or play with your kids, and it smells unbearably horrible. … Those are real harms,” Sheets told the court on Nov. 3. Michigan Sugar’s attorney, Brion Doyle, said millions of dollars are being spent to control odors under a previous agreement with state regulators.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The Superior National Forest’s first full-time tribal liaison said he wants to work with the federal government on proposed expansion of the Lutsen Mountains Ski Area. Juan Martinez started his new role in January, but he didn’t move to Minnesota until July. He coordinates communication between the national forest and the three Ojibwe bands in northeastern Minnesota. The Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa occupied the nearly 4 million acres that now make up the Superior National Forest long before the federal government acquired it. They maintain rights to hunt, fish, gather and practice their spiritual traditions on the land as part of an 1854 treaty signed with the federal government. Lutsen officials want to expand onto 494 acres of adjacent Forest Service land to build new ski runs, chairlifts and other amenities they said are needed to compete against big ski resorts. The Grand Portage Band has argued the project compromises its treaty rights, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Martinez and Forest Service officials say all sides should be involved in the discussion.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: State officials are looking for a man who escaped from a hospital bathroom while under police guard and then was recorded on video changing into pilfered clothes. The Jackson County Sheriff’s Department told local news outlets that Aceon Ja’shun Hopkins got away after telling a deputy he had to go to the bathroom while a patient at Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula. Hopkins, 20, had been a patient there since he was shot multiple times in Moss Point in November. Police in Meridian were seeking Hopkins to question him regarding two killings in the eastern Mississippi city. Hopkins hasn’t been charged in connection with the slayings. WTOK-TV reported Hopkins and his brother were charged with shooting up a Meridian shopping center in February. It’s unknown if either was arrested. The Jackson County Sheriff’s Department said Hopkins has warrants for other criminal charges, though, including drug charges in Gulfport. Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell said his office is investigating how Hopkins escaped the deputy guarding him.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Bus service will be reduced in St. Louis along more than three dozen routes this week because of a significant worker shortage. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Metro Transit has about 150 openings it is struggling to fill, with most of those jobs being driver positions. Typically, the agency employs about 2,300 people. “Our employment crisis is at such a depth that we had to reduce service temporarily while we try to increase our employment,” said Taulby Roach, the president and CEO of Bi-State Development, the agency that oversees Metro Transit. “We had to make a hard decision about what we could reasonably sustain.” Officials are trying to find more workers by organizing job fairs, offering $2,000 hiring bonuses and trying to bring back some retired operators, but they’ve had only limited success with those efforts. Roach said that Metro is “literally begging for employees.” So starting Monday, Metro Transit will reduce service along 38 bus routes and suspend service entirely on six other lines. Roach said Metro has “never had a circumstance where we were literally begging for employees” as is now the case.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Strong winds, with occasional gusts of up to 100 mph, made travel difficult along the Rocky Mountain Front in northern Montana, and record high temperatures were seen in some areas, the National Weather Service said Sunday. Southwest winds of 40 to 70 mph were forecast along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, which is along the western edge of Glacier National Park. Motorists were warned the wind would cause difficult travel conditions on Interstate 15 from Great Falls to the Canadian border, along Montana Highway 200 from Great Falls to Simms; U.S. Highway 89 from Monarch to Babb; U.S. Highway 2 from Cut Bank to Marias Pass and U.S. Highway 87 from Great Falls to Lewistown. Isolated power outages, downed trees and property damage were possible, the weather service said. A wind gust of 102 mph was recorded at Deep Creek, an area southwest of Browning, on Sunday morning, while East Glacier recorded a gust of 85 mph, the weather service said. A high wind warning was also in effect for the rest of north-central Montana, east of the Continental Divide, where wind gusts could reach 50 to 70 mph. Temperatures Sunday and Sunday night were forecast to be about 20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, with records expected in several locations, the weather service said. Helena reached 65 at midday Sunday, eclipsing the record of 56 set in 2014. Bozeman, Dillon, Chinook and Havre also set record high temperatures on Sunday. Chinook reached 66, breaking the record of 62.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Chadron State College freshman Ashley Tolstedt became the first female Scout to earn an Eagle Rank last weekend in the Overland Trails Council, which stretches from Ogallala to Cozad and from the South Dakota to Kansas borders. “I’m proud that I am,” the 18-year-old said, “but I think (the honor) should be worth the same that it’s worth to anyone else who earns it. I don’t think me being the first girl should mean that much.” The North Platte Telegraph reported Tolstedt received her Eagle rank pin and neckerchief during a short ceremony in the St. Patrick’s school gymnasium on Nov. 21. She officially earned the honor Oct. 1. Tolstedt also received a bronze Eagle Palm pin during the ceremony for the five additional merit badges she received over the required 21. Her required community service project was refurbishing the stage in St. Patrick’s High School. Girls between the ages of 11 to 17 were allowed to join the Boy Scouts in 2019, but before that, Tolstedt would unofficially tag along when her younger brother, Billy, became a Cub Scout in 2012.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fire crews were able to repair an ammonia leak at a Las Vegas food processing plant before it turned into a more serious incident. Las Vegas Fire & Rescue officials said in a news release they received several 9-1-1 calls Saturday shortly before 10 p.m. about an odor coming from the downtown processing plant. A hazardous materials response team, along with Desert Gold Food Company technicians, responded. Although the odor was gone, they did find a source of a leak. Fire officials said there were no injuries and the leak was fixed relatively quickly. The plant was closed at the time reports started coming in. A few nearby businesses were evacuated as a precaution. Desert Gold Food Company is a local food service distributor.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Education is offering competitive grants to public schools and public charter schools to set up robotics teams and participate in contests. “Robotics is a great way to reinforce academic concepts while also fostering curiosity among children, promoting teamwork and improving critical technology skills,” said Frank Edelblut, commissioner of education. “These grants will provide more New Hampshire students with the opportunity to embrace STEM concepts and learn through imaginative play and engineering.” The estimated budget for each proposal is $2,000 to $15,000. Applications will be scored by independent peer reviewers. To be eligible, schools must have an established partnership with at least one sponsor. Proposals must include participation in at least one competitive event. The deadline for applications is Dec. 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLong Branch:Gov. Phil Murphy received his Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster shot Sunday at Monmouth Medical Center, his office posted to Twitter. Murphy urged everyone 18 and older to schedule shots if six months have passed since their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna shots, or two months after receiving one dose of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, especially as families gather and travel for the holidays. “The best way to strengthen your protection against COVID-19 is to get your booster shot – that’s why, today, I got mine,” Murphy tweeted. “I encourage everyone who’s eligible to get theirs too.” Murphy, 64, first lady Tammy Murphy and three of their children posed for a picture holding up their vaccination cards. The family joined more than 1.2 million people who work, live or study in New Jersey who received a third dose or booster of the vaccine, according to state data. Close to 6.2 million New Jersey residents are fully vaccinated, meaning they received two shots of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or one dose of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Three state watchdog offices have dismissed a nonprofit group’s complaints accusing New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas of ethics violations in connection with a proposed merger involving the state’s largest utility company. The actions were taken by the state Ethics Commission, the State Auditor’s Office and the New Mexico Supreme Court’s disciplinary board on complaints filed by New Energy Economy, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The complaints alleged a conflict of interest was created when Avangrid, the company seeking to merge with Public Service Co. of New Mexico, hired an attorney to promote the merger. The attorney, Marcus Real Jr., has previously represented Balderas in some matters and early in their careers they briefly worked together. “We were always confident that these complaints would be fairly reviewed and found to be baseless,” Balderas said. NEE Executive Director Mariel Nanasi said she had “no comment” on the complaint dismissals.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city’s health commissioner said he is “strongly recommending” that everyone wear masks in indoor public settings as scientists work to learn more about the newly identified omicron variant of the coronavirus.Dr. Dave Chokshi said he was recommending that all New Yorkers wear masks “at all times when indoors and in a public setting like at your grocery or in a building lobby, offices and retail stores.” The guidance was in line with the recommendation issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging. Much is still not known about the omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa, including whether it is more contagious than other coronavirus variants, or more able to evade the protection of vaccines. Cases of the omicron variant have been found in countries including Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, but no cases have yet been detected in the United States.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: The U.S. Geological Survey has reported another minor earthquake that took place near Winston-Salem. The Winston-Salem Journal reported that Saturday’s quake was the seventh seismic event to occur in Forsyth and Surry counties in the past six days. The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, reported that no injuries or structural damage has resulted from any of the seven earthquakes. Saturday’s 1.9 magnitude quake occurred shortly before 8 a.m. about 3.1 miles southwest of Winston-Salem. USGS said that the other minor earthquakes occurred last Wednesday and Nov. 21 near Winston-Salem and near Mount Airy. “Right now, these events are very minor,” said Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the USGS.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: North Dakota wants to extend the state’s abandoned well plugging program by tapping into $4 billion made available in the federal infrastructure bill for the purpose of cleaning up old oil and gas sites across the nation. The Bismarck Tribune reported funding could potentially come North Dakota’s way each year over the next decade to continue the work the Oil and Gas Division started in 2020 to clean up hundreds of wells. North Dakota spent tens of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus aid plugging more than 300 abandoned wells and reclaiming the sites over the past two years. The cleanup work is ongoing. State officials billed the program as a way to keep oil workers employed when the pandemic prompted a downturn in their industry, as well as a means to address the growing number of wells producers had abandoned. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said the state initially overestimated how quickly it could complete reclamation work during colder fall and winter weather. He said the additional funds available through the infrastructure bill President Joe Biden signed into law earlier this month could help North Dakota address the unfinished work.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: The Dayton Board of Zoning Appeals has approved the city’s request to demolish a 129-year-old historic building that once was the site of the Wright brothers’ first bicycle shop. The city wants to tear down the site because the building has deteriorated to a point where it can no longer be maintained and redeveloped, the Dayton Daily News has reported. Public safety concerns have also been raised by some who fear the building could collapse. Although agreeing that most of the building should be demolished, the Dayton Landmarks Commission rejected the demolition request in September. The panel instead recommended the city re-advertise the property and encourage its renovation in a way that preserves the historic facade. Preservation groups had also opposed the city’s plan. They argued that keeping the building’s facade and incorporating it into a redevelopment project would make the project eligible for historic tax credits. The city appealed the landmarks commission’s decision to the zoning appeals board, claiming it erred in its application of architectural design standards. The board voted 5-1 last week to reverse the commission’s decision and gave the city permission to raze the property. The shop was built in 1892 to serve as the Wright brothers’ first bicycle shop. Soon thereafter, Gem City Ice Cream Co. bought the property and housed it until 1975 until it was sold to another company.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater:A complaint has prompted a federal investigation of Oklahoma’s Public Health Lab in Stillwater, health officials said. Interim Health Commissioner Keith Reed said he did not have details about what the complaint entailed, saying those are considered confidential and are often made anonymously. The investigation of the lab was first reported Nov. 19 by The Frontier. After the story was published, the Health Department released a statement acknowledging that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had conducted a review of the Public Health Lab and the lab had made changes to address the agency’s findings, including modernizing lab security, reviewing and adjusting staff training protocols, ensuring proper temperature control, storage and transportation of samples and resolving reporting on COVID-19 sequencing results. Reed declined to provide more details about the changes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As Oregon prepares to take in approximately 1,200 Afghan refugees in the next 12 months, state lawmakers are asking the Legislature’s emergency board for an additional $18 million to expand services and capacity. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported a letter – issued last week by state Rep. Khanh Pham and state Sen. Kayse Jama – outlined the need for the state to invest in everything from housing assistance and case management to legal services for newly arrived Afghans. Although dozens of refugees have already arrived in Oregon, 570 more are expected by the end of February. There are five resettlement agencies operating in Portland and Salem that are working to identify long-term housing while providing culturally specific education – including language and job training, schooling for families with children and legal aid. The $18 million requested by the two Democratic lawmakers is composede of $5.3 million to support the Department of Human Services’ emergency management unit, $3.7 million to bolster case management and community outreach, $6 million for housing assistance and $2.9 million for legal services.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork:“Spruce’d Up! A Celebration of Trees“ holiday tree decoration display and winter shopping market returns to PeoplesBank Park in York this holiday season. Admission is free and the event runs from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. every weekend through Dec. 19. The event was created last year as a way to hold a safe, socially distanced outdoor event during the pandemic. Each tree is sponsored by either an area business or nonprofit and will be decorated with a theme. Event attendees can vote for their favorite trees and the top three winners will receive cash donations to a nonprofit of their choice.York Revolution has partnered with Downtown Inc. to bring some York County artisans and vendors to the event space this year a pop-up shop offering local goods. Spruce’d Up will also feature unique promotions throughout the duration of the event, including a visit from Santa Claus, a gingerbread house decorating competition, Christmas caroling and more.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s education department has awarded grants to eight districts to support homeless students. Gov. Dan McKee and Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said the department awarded more than $336,000 in McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act Education for Homeless Children and Youth sub-grants to eight school districts. The districts are: Central Falls, Middletown, Newport, North Kingstown, Providence, Warwick, West Warwick and Woonsocket. “It is critical that we support our most vulnerable students in Rhode Island’s recovery,” McKee said in a statement. “These funds are specifically geared to help students and families experiencing homelessness and will make a positive difference in many lives during a time of great need.” Infante-Green said that students experiencing homelessness were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and it is their duty to ensure these students are provided the support needed to get ahead. The latest round of sub-grants is part of the third year of a three-year award that each of the selected districts received, totaling more than $970,000. The money comes from a federal grant administered by the state. The municipalities each received between $40,000 and $44,000.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: Police responding to a fire alarm and the sound of gunshots at an assisted living facility said a resident had placed several rounds of ammunition in a toaster. The ammunition discharged on Sunday night, making employees believe a shooter was on the property, police in Greenwood said. Greenwood is about 70 miles northwest of Columbia. A small fire in the resident’s room was extinguished. The resident was found unconscious and taken to a hospital to be treated for apparent smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported, police said. Police did not say why they believe the ammunition was in the toaster.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Big cats are back on display at the Great Plains Zoo after a snow leopard died of COVID-19. The animals, including tigers and snow leopards, have tested negative for the virus and were to return to their exhibits on Wednesday, zoo officials said. On Oct. 6, the zoo reported that a tiger tested positive for the virus . Shortly after, other big cats at the zoo began exhibiting similar symptoms, zoo officials said. A day later. a snow leopard died. Necropsy results on the snow leopard confirmed she had died from pneumonia induced by the virus, zoo officials said. The Argus Leader reported the zoo’s veterinary staff has run consistent lab tests on the big cats throughout their illness. Lab tests confirm all of the zoo’s big cat collection is clear of the virus and can once again be in the exhibit space and seen by the public.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Metro Nashville Board of Education recently declined to update the district’s policy regarding student-athlete eligibility to align with a new state law banning transgender athletes from participating in girls sports. At least six board members met during a governance committee meeting earlier this month to review a variety of policy updates and recommended the entire board should vote to defer the policy. The policy has to do with who is allowed to play on which sports teams in the district, which has a policy promising athletic opportunities to students of both sexes and that “no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any athletic program of the school.” But it hasn’t been updated since Tennessee lawmakers passed a state law in the spring requiring transgender students to compete in school sports according to their sex at birth. The law bans transgender middle and high school students from participating in sports under their gender identity. Metro Nashville Public Schools’ updated policy would have added that students participating in interscholastic athletics “must meet the eligibility requirements set forth by the state and the governing body of the sport” if it had been approved.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The remains of more than 30 people who were exhumed from East Austin’s historically segregated Oakwood Cemetery were reburied this month and will be memorialized in the coming weeks. The bodies were discovered underneath the cemetery’s chapel in 2017 as employees were working on a restoration project. After the discovery, an academic partnership between the University of Connecticut and the University of Texas began to understand the lives of the people buried at Oakwood. On Nov. 15, city officials began to sort out what the best location would be to rebury the remains. The first phase of the process required archaeologists monitoring the selected area west of the chapel to confirm that the city wasn’t going to disturb any unmarked burials on the site. After that confirmation, the reburial process was completed Nov. 17. The remains, which date to the mid- to late 1800s, were originally set to be reburied in 2020, but the timeline was delayed when archaeologists at the University of Connecticut approached the city with a pro bono offer to conduct DNA analysis, said Kim McKnight, Austin Parks and Recreation Department director. The archaeologists completed the DNA extraction, allowing for the return of the bodies, but the DNA analysis is ongoing and is expected to continue for 24 to 36 months. Osteological analysis showed the people to be racially diverse – including people from Anglo American, African American, Mexican American and indigenous descent. People who believe they might be related to the people reinterred will later be able to submit saliva samples to the University of Connecticut to see if there are genetic matches.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Mayor Michele Randall spoke at the 4th annual Menorah Lighting ceremony Sunday night to help promote religious freedom in St. George. About 100 attendees showed up for the event at the city’s Town Square Park downtown, celebrating the first of eight days of Hanukkah. Locals who are part of the Jewish community joined in singing, dancing, and traditional holiday foods. The Menorah Lighting ceremony was one of 15,000 public Menorahs worldwide as part of the world’s largest Hanukah observance. Rabbi Mendy Cohen, who is part of the Chabad Jewish Center, organized this event and had visitors from as far away as New York. “It’s beautiful to see everyone come together from all walks of life all with the same message of unity, the message of light, the message of religious freedom,” Cohen said. Last year’s Menorah Lighting ceremony was virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The St. George Fire Department came to do the “chocolate drop” where firefighters threw candy from the top of the fire truck for children to collect. “I think it’s awesome that our community is so diverse, and our Jewish community is growing, which is exciting to see,” Randall said.\n\nVermont\n\nDanville: Students at Danville Middle and High School will soon be deciding on the school’s new nickname, after the school board voted in March to end the use of “Indians” following hours of testimony from students, teachers, alumni and community members. A committee of students, parents, community members and staff narrowed 34 submissions from the wider community down to the four: Trailblazers, Bears, Mountaineers or Bobcats, the Caledonian Record reported. Students will be voting on the new name Friday. Adult participation in the voting process was discussed, said Middle and High School Principal David Schilling. “There were several students on the committee and everybody really felt that it that the students are the ones who are going to be living with… and that it really should be a student decision,” he said. In response to a petition opposing the decision to change the name, the school board voted 4-1 in June reaffirming the policy to prohibit the representation of the school by any race or ethnic group as a mascot.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Department of Health will be monitoring sewage in various parts of the state to predict future outbreaks of COVID-19. The Danville Register & Bee reported Saturday that VDH is deploying up to 25 wastewater monitoring sites across the commonwealth. That’s according to a recent report from the University of Virginia’s Biocomplexity Institute, which collaborates with state health officials. The report does not state where those monitoring sites will be. But VDH has been polling utilities to assess their willingness to participate in a sampling program. Testing sewage can help health officials gauge COVID-19 infection in a community because people who are sick shed the virus in bodily waste, even if they’re not showing symptoms. Combined with other programs that monitor COVID-19 infection in communities, the goal is to provide warnings before a surge begins.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn, a Republican, said he will run for Washington’s 8th Congressional District House seat, seeking an office once held by his mother. Dunn told The Seattle Times he will challenge Democratic incumbent Rep. Kim Schrier.The announcement sets up a potential top-tier challenge for the congressional seat that had been held by Republicans since the district was created in 1983 until Schrier won it for Democrats in 2018. Dunn, 50, has been a member of the county council since 2005. Schrier, 53, is a pediatrician in her second term in Congress. Dunn’s mother, the late Jennifer Dunn, was the 8th District representative from 1993 to 2005.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Negotiations are set to resume for striking maintenance and service workers at Cabell Huntington Hospital. Representatives for the hospital and more than 900 members of the the Service Employees International Union District 1999 are scheduled to return to the bargaining table Tuesday, the hospital said. Union members went on strike in early November after their contract with the hospital expired. Hospital human resources director Molly Frick said union members are being asked to begin paying health insurance premiums. Under the hospital’s latest offer, it would have contributed more than 90% of health care costs for employees and their dependents. The offer also included 3% average annual wage increases, increased shift differentials, an enhanced uniform allowance and continued automatic annual contributions to eligible employees’ retirement accounts. A temporary restraining order against striking workers will remain in place through Dec. 10. It prohibits certain activities outside the hospital.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A survey of Midwest farm bankers found Wisconsin farmland values are up 10% from the same period in 2020. Wisconsin Public Radio reported the rise in land values is driven by strong commodity prices, and demand from nonfarm buyers. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago surveyed 151 bankers in their district, which includes Iowa and parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. The bankers reported the value of good quality farmland across the region had increased by 6% from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year. Compared to the third quarter of 2020, bankers reported that land values were up 18%. In Wisconsin, surveyed bankers reported land values were up 1% from the previous quarter and 10% from the same time last year. David Oppedahl, senior business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the value of land started increasing last fall as the agriculture industry recovered from the initial shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne:The Highlands Presbyterian Church in Cheyenne received a $40,000 gift from the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Fort Collins, Colorado. “For us, it’s an affirmation of our commitment to mission,” said the Rev. Rodger McDaniel of Highlands Presbyterian, who added that the gift gave them another reason to be thankful this year. “And then the idea that at some point, we will be in the same position that Westminster is in finding another congregation with a mission commitment to give the gift to pass along the gift ... it’s really an exciting opportunity.” More than 25 years ago, a parishioner at a church in Waterloo, Iowa, gifted his church money to be used “for nonlocal mission giving,” with the stipulation that the church share the gift with other Presbyterian churches in $40,000 increments.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/30"}]}

For parked side-by-side were two cars, one with license number “PDQ” beside “ASAP.” That made me LOL. (Older readers probably perceived that as Herb Caen’s Little Old Lady, which made us Laugh Out Loud 40 years ago while reading the Chronicle.)\n\nAlways looking for the stuff of a good column, the two adjacent personalized plates jogged the memory of a file I keep of unanswered reader questions, which includes such plates and seems to grow every week while I try to assemble them into some rhyme and reason. This morning I’m dipping into that file, employing neither rhyme nor reason, for if I await those two qualities to merge I may be writing from my ward in a rest home.\n\n“Why don’t you write about personalized plates, as Ty Cobb used to do?” My response to those queries is that Ty Cobb used to do them. Thus I don’t, as a matter of respect to Ty (Senior), the late Cobbwebs columnist and managing editor of this paper. But life has moved on since Ty passed away in 1996; a plethora of personalized plate parsing persists, so be so advised or forewarned, you will start seeing the cream of the plate crop from time to time right here, be they the clever, the incomprehensible head-scratchers, the successful efforts to slide a naughty word past the DMV’s censors, and the ill-advised like “SIERRAS” or “ARTISME” when “GRAMMARISME” wouldn’t fit with the passive pronoun. This will continue until my fraternity brothers Ty Jr. and Bill Cobb make me knock it off in homage to their dad.“Why was our mayor’s name Cashell but the street in the southwest is Cashill Boulevard?” That’s a frequent question, happy to answer that one. Bob Cashell with an “e” was in fact our mayor. Another great guy who passed away in 1960 while walking from the Prospectors Club to his office in the old FNB building on Second and Virginia at high noon was Bill Cashill, with an “i”. Bill was an immensely popular attorney in the early post-WWII years through the 1960s, a civic leader who also shaped the politics of Nevada as an Assembly speaker. His barrister son Pat’s canary enjoys this column weekly.\n\nA UNR history student sent an enumeration of downtown buildings in Reno, including the Arcade, the Hilps, the Byington, the Hughes-Porter, the Clay-Peters, but where was the “Triune” building? Glad to help: Ten State Street, later the head shed of the Pioneer Citizens Bank. There was once among us an immensely talented man named Clel Georgetta. Aside from being a prominent attorney, state legislator and later a judge, he wrote two excellent books that I’ve plugged in past columns. The books are “Wool, Beef and Gold” and “The Golden Fleece,” both about the business and roots of raising livestock, and particularly sheep, in Nevada. His roots were in eastern Nevada and his ranch, the “Triune,” was said to have spread over four counties and two states. I’ve always assumed, but never confirmed, that the ranch was named for the “Triune” region of Europe and homeland of the Basque people.\n\nFrom another UNR student: Who was Jot Travis?, (for whom the UNR student union was once named; the “Jot” until it was replaced by the “Joe”). I’ve written of him already: Jot Travis, whose real name was Ezra, was a 19th-century horseman and stagecoach operator. With the advent of motorized buses serving the rural areas of western states, he transitioned into small buses, and passed away in 1919. His son Wesley stayed in the bus business and ascended to the presidency of Greyhound Lines, and upon his death in 1952 bequeathed 300 large “for a student center at the University to be named for his father.” The State Legislature matched the funds, as Wesley’s endowment required, and the “Jot” was finished in 1958. The student’s question thus answered, I’ll get on my soapbox to reinforce my desire for the name “Travis” to stay in the fabric of the university and its student body, and not be lost even although the building was replaced.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nSide note: Why do I get manic about not having “University of Nevada” changed in print to “UNR”? Why, because some of us touchier readers are proud of the University of Nevada until 1966, when Nevada Southern University became UNLV, and the north UNR. Just a quirk, I s’pose, like not using an apostrophe in Harolds Club, as adman Tom Wilson chose not to do in 1950. And if you read “the Hill” herein, it’s the campus of the university, an old term of endearment we don’t hear too often anymore.\n\nStill cleaning out a “Pocketful of Notes,” as Herb Caen would occasionally write, from a reader: “Didn’t Stephanie and father Efrem Zimbalist Jr. once live in Reno on Skyline Drive?” Sort of; Efrem’s sister Maria Bennett lived in the “Red Barn,” now yellow, in the 800 block of Skyline, and Stephanie, later to gain recognition on TV’s detective show Remington Steele, befriended many local children, all now in their 40s.\n\nFinal note for this morning, not a leftover but fresh from last Sunday’s Elks Club first-Sunday breakfast, where Bob Ferrari, whose family’s downtown Food Shop was profiled right here a month ago, recounted a story. When Bob, an Army combat officer, was on one of his deployments in Vietnam he received from family in Reno a ravioli rolling pin with a recipe for the filling. Thus his troops enjoyed authentic ravioli on Christmas, a gift from the Food Shop in faraway Reno Nevada …\n\nThanks to so many readers, for the input about last week’s Soap Box Derby column.

Or so you told me many times when I met you socially or on assignment over my 17 years as the Detroit Free Press restaurant critic.\n\nIt was the best occupation in the world in many ways, but not solely for the reasons you think.\n\nTrue, my job was to dine in restaurants all over metro Detroit and sometimes far beyond, with the Free Press picking up the tab for me and my dining companions. And then I had the privilege of expressing my opinions about those places on the pages and website of Michigan’s largest daily newspaper.\n\nBut for me, an equally satisfying part of the job was interviewing, and eventually coming to know, many of Michigan’s best chefs and restaurateurs: men and women who made time to tell me — and thus, you — their stories; to share their vision of food and hospitality; to explain the inner workings of their industry; and sometimes to allow me behind the scenes, into the best professional kitchens, to watch and learn what it takes to create truly great food.\n\nThe 7 most-asked questions I heard as restaurant critic\n\nMy job was an education I treasure.\n\nThis is the last article I will byline as the Free Press restaurant critic.\n\nSo just as chefs invited me behind the scenes to learn more about their world, I thought I’d pull back the curtain on mine, giving you a glimpse into the sublime, ever-changing, fun, often stressful, heartburn-inducing, all-consuming job it really was.\n\nAnd then I’ll tell you why I gave it up.\n\nThe job (most) everyone wants\n\nThe job I took when I was named restaurant critic in 1999 is a galaxy away from the one I had when I left — an evolution driven by mega changes in technology, media and the public’s knowledge of and interest in food.\n\nI loved the job as it was when I started. But even more, I loved the competitive, higher-profile job it became, despite the trade-offs it required.\n\nWhen I began writing some restaurant reviews in 1998 — my title was still food writer then — critics were expected to wait three months to set foot in a new restaurant so it could smooth out. The paper ran one major review a week, and we generally followed national Association of Food Journalists’ guidelines at the time, visiting anonymously multiple times with guests before writing a review and awarding stars.\n\nOften, the review was the first word we had printed about the place (previews of upcoming restaurants were rare), and the review ran with a couple of photos shot by Free Press photographers.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems quaint.\n\nBy the time I left the Free Press, I was writing many restaurant stories each week, and the job was as much about competitive news coverage — vying for first word or new exclusive content about a place before it opened — as it was about dining somewhere and writing a thoughtful critique.\n\nThe sheer number of restaurants and food-related businesses had increased exponentially, the interest in food and dining was through the roof, and a whole crowd of websites and blogs had sprung up to focus on it. Waiting weeks or months to review a high-profile restaurant was out of the question; by then, it felt like old news.\n\nSo rather than award stars based on only one visit, I began writing un-starred First Looks, critiquing the six or seven dishes I had tried and describing the menu, decor and service. It wasn’t as thorough as the old way, but it was transparent and served readers well.\n\nDigital photography changed the job, too.\n\nThe increased interest in food demanded more, I thought, than a couple of photos with reviews, but the paper couldn’t send a photographer everywhere I went. So, still dining anonymously, I began carrying a small digital camera and shooting my plates at the table.\n\nServers and other diners sometimes shot me disapproving looks, but most probably figured I was just another blogger or Yelper and didn’t question me. Other servers, though, were pleased I found the plates so pretty that I wanted pictures of them. Occasionally, one would notice my camera and ask whether my husband and I would like to have our picture taken at the table. The only polite answer was yes, so I’d hand over the camera and we would pose, smiling.\n\nUsing social media added work, too, but Twitter and Facebook could deliver news quickly and reach wider audiences, so they became another part of the job. Last year, I added some podcasts to the list and made my video reporting debut with a marathon food-truck review from the Mo Pop music festival.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult change for me was the dropping of my anonymity in early 2015. I preferred staying in the background and letting my work speak for me, but my smart, ever-supportive editors had other ideas.\n\nThey wanted me visible, doing TV interviews, making public appearances on the paper’s behalf and meeting readers at events like last year’s Top 10 Takeover dinners at the year’s Best New Restaurants.\n\nThose turned out to be some of the most fun events of my career.\n\nScores of interesting, friendly, food-loving readers came from across metro Detroit and beyond to try restaurants I had chosen and to hear what the chefs or owners and I had to say about them. It was humbling to hear so many people say they had read me “forever” and trusted what I wrote.\n\nThe critic of 17 years ago would have had a heart attack at the thought of so many broken “rules.”\n\nBut the rules and the world had changed.\n\nThe evolution of dining\n\nAs the job evolved, so, too, did food, dining styles and our tastes.\n\nOver those 17 years, I saw and chronicled the arrival of the local-foods and farm-to-table movement, nose-to-tail cooking, food trucks, coffee culture, craft breweries and distilleries, artisan bakeries, and the most fundamental change of all — the casualization of dining. It was a period that saw the closing of many classic fine-dining restaurants, from the acclaimed Golden Mushroom in Southfield to the legendary Lark, just last month, in West Bloomfield.\n\nCocktails had a revival. Charcuterie came back from near extinction. Chefs with fine-dining backgrounds led the barbecue trend. Pop-ups arrived, first in empty warehouses and now in restaurants devoted exclusively to them. We transitioned from huge entrées to shared plates. Sushi stopped being “scary”; even Kroger sells it. And once little-known ethnic cuisines, flavors and dishes — especially Asian ones — have become mainstream.\n\nChefs now credit farmers, dairies and foragers on their chalkboards and menus. Diners expect vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free dishes everywhere they go. Issues including animal cruelty, ocean depletion and the genetic modification of ingredients affect our decisions about what to order.\n\nMy right-hand man\n\nRestaurant critics have to eat — a lot. Or at least, they have to eat many different things at many different places and at all kinds of times. The timid and picky need not apply. They need an iron stomach, unlimited curiosity and a willingness to walk into places where they clearly don’t belong to buy or order foods they may never have tried before.\n\nCritics also need flexible schedules and a willing dining partner who will go anywhere with almost no notice, in the worst possible weather, order whatever they’re told to, and let the critic freely eat off their plate. They’ll act as a decoy, asking questions on the critic’s behalf (so the critic doesn’t attract attention) to see how the server responds and even make sure the critic’s camera battery is charged before leaving home.\n\nMeet my husband, Charles Hill, without whom I couldn’t have done my job nearly as well. I was paid to spend my nights, weekends and social life racing to restaurants all over metro Detroit — but he wasn’t. Still, he was always there, even when it wasn’t fun.\n\nThere were times I had to go out four or five nights in a single week — even when I longed to stay home in my PJs and nurse a crummy cold.\n\nThere were many Saturdays when we had to hit five or six different places so I could fill the last two slots in a Freep Five roundup of “Five Great Places for... ” whatever. Whether it was mac-and-cheese, chicken potpie or Italian sub sandwiches, by the time I was done, I didn’t want to see another one for months.\n\nBut Freep Fives paled in comparison with the ambitious (or foolhardy) roundups I undertook in 2008 and 2009 of metro Detroit’s 21 Best Sandwiches, 25 Top Burgers and 25 Best Pizzas, among others. I would ask readers to send me nominations, read the scores of replies, and then spend weeks trying the ones that sounded best, along with those I already knew.\n\nThe most brutal was burgers: burger after burger — some 60 of them — served in diners, dive bars and nice restaurants from Ann Arbor to the Grosse Pointes. I’d drive to the place, go in and order, wait for the food, take numerous photos, eat several bites, ask for a box and my bill, and drive to another place, for almost a month.\n\nAnd for the pizza roundup, so many empty boxes stacked up in the garage, I was embarrassed on trash pickup days, wondering what the neighbors might think.\n\nFor the love of food\n\nBut I also had the privilege of dining regularly at the kinds of places most people visit only once or twice, if ever. They left me with memories, still vivid many years later, of eye-opening ingredients, exquisite dishes and beautiful scenes. But so did so many wonderful everyday places that I return to, time and again.\n\nWhen I flip back through my mental snapshots, I remember first tasting the imported Italian buffalo mozzarella at Bacco in Southfield; the lobster whipped cream that topped the scallops at Cuisine in Detroit; the sensation of Mangalitsa pork lardo (cured fat) melting on my tongue at Forest Grill in Birmingham, and the surprise of sea salt — then unheard-of — in the chocolate and caramel filling of The Egg dessert at the old Tribute in Farmington Hills.\n\nI remember the crispy coating on the hand-dipped cod at iconic Scotty Simpson’s Fish and Chips in Detroit; the world’s-best corned beef hash at the Beverly Hills Grill, and the addictive roasted vegetable sandwich at the Russell Street Deli in Eastern Market.\n\nI remember the taste of sweet-corn foam on a tiny dish at the now-closed Torino in Ferndale; seeing the sun dip under the horizon from the dining room of Coach Insignia atop the Renaissance Center, and watching the chef-owner of Mabel Gray in Hazel Park rocking out to the music while cooking in his open kitchen.\n\nI remember drinking wine late into the night with my husband on the evergreen-bordered patio at Assaggi in Ferndale; sitting at the chef’s counter at Selden Standard in Detroit, watching pork belly roast over flames a few feet away, and I remember, starting back in 1999, the shocked reactions of the 16 people I told that I was naming their restaurant Free Press Restaurant of the Year.\n\nSnapshots. Hundreds of snapshots. So many more than I can recount here.\n\nSo many flavors, so many faces\n\nMy job allowed me to meet and interview some of the food world’s most interesting people, including the legendary Julia Child, with whom I spent an afternoon in Ann Arbor. I asked her what three essential dishes one should learn to cook to feed themselves well. “That’s a very good question!” she trilled, and after a moment’s thought, listed a roast chicken, a nice salad and a proper omelet. It’s still a perfect list. I’ll never part with the interview tape.\n\nI sat in the kitchen at Tribute and drank wine with mesmerizing chef Eric Ripert of New York’s Le Bernardin, who told me one of his most useful skills as a chef was being able to speak Spanish to the cooks in his very French kitchen.\n\nI had breakfast with Anthony Bourdain, who admitted he had mellowed since becoming a father; I think he got over it. Iron Chef Michael Symon, the owner of Roast and a wonderfully genuine guy, showed me his pig tattoos. And Wolfgang Puck talked passionately at age 63 about the importance of always changing with the times.\n\nI came to know many excellent servers and managers and was befriended by talented sommeliers and bartenders. I learned the importance of dishwashers. And I truly loved writing about amazing Michigan farmers and growers and food producers like the three men I dubbed Detroit’s Kings of Corned Beef.\n\nBut the people I’ll remember best were the chefs and owners I came to know over many years of reviewing their restaurants, interviewing them for a wide variety of stories, and simply observing them at work.\n\nAs wildly different as their personalities are, the best of them share some important characteristics.\n\nSo rather than name anyone individually (because I can’t name them all), I’ll tell you what they seem to have in common, starting with the fierce pride they take in their work. They eschew short cuts; believe that great food starts with the best ingredients; and never stray too long or too far from their kitchens.\n\nEven under the gruffest exteriors, most are driven by a need to feed, please and take care of others. They are leaders, teachers and team-builders. They set high standards, work incredibly hard and expect others to do the same. And whether they are 25 or 55, their passion for food is worn on their sleeves.\n\nThe best party ever\n\nMetro Detroit’s restaurant scene is the best it has ever been, and it will only get better.\n\nIf the Free Press hadn’t offered senior employees a nice financial package to retire, I’d still be at my desk right now — or probably dining somewhere, taking pictures of Plate No. 16,572, or whatever.\n\nBut I’ve had a lot to eat. Life is short. And I believe in leaving the party when it’s still going strong.\n\nLast year — when I turned 65 and marked 23 years at the Freep — was the best party ever, so this feels like the right time to slip out the kitchen door and become a civilian diner.\n\nThanks, everyone, for reading.

Delaware St. restaurant.\n\n\"And then for good Thai food, Siam Square's pad Thai. And they have a good praram long song.\" Siam Square is at 936 Virginia Ave., in Fountain Square.\n\nChicken tikka masala puts tandoori oven-roasted chicken in a spicy, creamy sauce. Praram long song is a dish of meat (chicken at Siam Square) and vegetables in peanut curry sauce.\n\nBut you don't have to define exotic-sounding dishes to Luck. His taste for foreign food, he said, comes from growing up overseas and living in London. Luck's father, former Houston Oilers quarterback Oliver Luck, worked for NFL Europe.\n\nWhen I asked Luck if he had checked out some ethnic neighborhood haunts, he immediately asked for suggestions on where to go.\n\n\"My girlfriend sort of will go out and explore. She got really into southern Indian cuisine. She brought home some dosa (Indian fermented rice crepe). And some Greek food from Greek Islands (906 S. Meridian St.).\"\n\nLuck liked it all. He's adventurous. Fellow players note his taste for octopus. He has revealed a refrigerator stocked with stinky cheese and local duck prosciutto.\n\nLuck sounded excited when I suggested a Lafayette Square-area African restaurant (NairaLand at Beautiful Shades, 4718 Century Plaza Road) and Indian grocer (Om India Plaza, 4225 Lafayette Road).\n\nDo gourmet ingredients in Luck's fridge mean he cooks?\n\n\"I am trying much harder this year to cook more,\" he said. \"Breakfast is easy to cook; I've gotten good at that\" (he likes yogurt on his oatmeal).\n\n\"It's a nice respite to come home and cook dinner.\"\n\nLuck's signature dish has, as you might expect, international flair. \"My only specialty dish is one that I stole from my mom,\" he admitted.\n\nShe calls it \"Chicken Marbella,\" Luck said. From his description of its garlic, prunes, olives and Mediterranean herbs, it sounds like a recipe of the same name from the famous 1980s gourmet foodie tome \"The Silver Palate Cookbook\" (Workman). Chicken Marbella was one of the book's most popular recipes.\n\nLuck, 24, doesn't have a Twitter account. Social media, a place where many foodies share dining experiences, is not his thing. He discovers where and what to eat the old-fashioned way.\n\n\"Word of mouth, friends talking about it.

Belgian beers are the specialty, Bloody Marys are prepared seven ways and the \"bier mosa\" mixes o.j. with a wheat brew. To eat: beignets with lemon and chocolate dipping sauces, waffles topped with bourbon pecan butter, four types of toppings for toast (honey, roasted apples and brie herbal cheese is one). That's just breakfast, and just for starters. Also in Wauwatosa and Milwaukee. cafehollander.com, 608-237-3168\n\n•Tom+Chee, Appleton and Elm Grove: Tomato soup with a grilled cheese spells pure comfort, but that combo needs further clarification when ordered at this quick-service franchise. Building a sandwich goes far beyond white versus wheat and cheddar versus swiss: Try melting your favorite fromage between slices of a glazed doughnut. Or add a layer of potato chips for extra crunch. Classic, creamy and chunky versions of tomato soup are sold by the little dipper, cup or bowl. These are menu headliners for the Cincinnati business that gained bigtime exposure through \"Shark Tank\" and other nationwide TV spots. Now there are 34-and-counting locations. tomandchee.com, 920-815-3059, 414-249-5206\n\n•Bonaparte Retreat Restaurant, Bonaparte, Iowa: The community? Population 433, on the Des Moines River in southeast Iowa. The restaurant? In a restored, century-old grist mill. A flood and fire nearly destroyed the town in 1903; Iowans know the hamlet today as a rural dining delight because of hand-cut steaks and chops for dinner, lunchtime blue plate specials and breaded pork tenderloins. Save room for pie; the thick strawberry puree sells out fast in summer. The setting – exposed beans, old brick walls, antique cash register, eclectic collectibles – feels like a homey museum. bonaparteretreat.com, 319-592-3339\n\n•Bourbon and Baker, Manhattan, Kan.: Southern and Midwest influences converge in the front end of this college town business, which stocks 70 kinds of bourbon, serves whiskey punch/whiskey-ritas and presents a compact menu of sliders (kobe or oyster), tacos (duck), fries (asparagus), waffles (with chicken) and other unpredictable fare. Enter through the back door, and you'll find a bakery primping cookies, fancy cakes, buns and biscuits for both this building and neighboring Harry's, genteel dining in a historic hotel structure downtown. bbmanhattan.com, 785-320-4959\n\n•Lunchbox Laboratory, Seattle: How lucky that the nearest sit-down restaurant to our Seattle hotel (northeast of downtown) was this unusual and affordable eatery. Burgers rule, but they are made with your choice of beef, lamb, a veggie black bean combo, churken (ground chicken and turkey) or \"dork\" (pork and duck). Sides and sauces include black truffle mayo, bread and butter pickle tartar. Match the meal with a booze-spiked milk shake; other beverages arrive in beakers, test tubes. The motif is both nostalgic and edgy, thanks to a collection of oldtime lunchboxes that are treated like modern art. Other outlets are in Bellvue and Gig Harbor, Wash. lunchboxlaboratory.com, 206-621-1090\n\n•New York Wine and Culinary Center, Canandaigua, N.Y.: Every state should have a beautiful stage like this for local food and beverage products. The many fine wines of the Finger Lakes region (plus New York craft beer, spirits) are available by the sampling, serving or bottle. Also in the nonprofit enterprise is a gift shop, Upstairs Bistro restaurant and two roomy classrooms for hands-on workshops and cooking demos (these frequent sessions last one to three hours).

Not so here, where a Kalamanak from India, pink Himalayan and black Hiwa Kai from Hawai tops each table. For sale are many of the 130 salts and infusions that are carefully matched to each course of fine dining. Chef Fabrizio Aielli, a Venice native, is responsible for the emphasis and excess. Little seems modest at the St. Petersburg venue, open since autumn 2015 in the Sundial dining/shopping complex, where the raw bar is 80 feet long and a tower of wines is 20 feet tall.

Steps away, in this case, was the friendly Fish on Fire, whose name acknowledges a 2010 kitchen fire. This locals' hangout was opened by a couple of fishing buddies who are fussy about the quality of their daily catches. Cooks also will cook your catch and serve it family style.

Generations of families from Delaware and Philadelphia and all over Jersey return each summer without fail, for mood as much as seafood.\n\nBut each year, the island also renews itself. And the off-season has been particularly busy this year, with a host of new places to eat and drink.\n\nThe biggest developments in the area will be big indeed: a 180-seat hotel steak and seafood restaurant with a beat-thumping pool bar and nightclub next door, and a hulking entertainment complex with a pair of restaurants in Rio Grande. A Philly cheesesteak icon plans a new outpost in Wildwood, and so does a Brooklyn sandwich shop braiding its own fresh mootz.\n\nFamilies coming back to the Wildwood area will also find plenty of new homespun offerings, whether scratch-made crab gnocchi from an old family recipe, Mediterranean tapas in a revived century-old movie theater or the novel treat of cereal-swirled ice cream.\n\nHere’s the rundown on 10 new spots to eat and drink in and around the Wildwoods.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nItalian and seafood on the Wildwood Boardwalk at Stephen’s Restaurant\n\n401 E. Wildwood Ave., Wildwood, 609-849-9037, stephens-restaurant.com. Breakfast and dinner.\n\nStephen’s Restaurant opened just this April on the Wildwood boardwalk. But history here runs deep.\n\nThe recipe for chef Stephen Quici’s laboriously handmade gnocchi comes from his Southern Italian grandmother — slathered in blush sauce and jumbo lump crab — and so does the kitchen table he rolls out the gnocchi on.\n\nThe painting of the Last Supper on the wall? That was his grandfather’s. Paint by numbers.\n\nQuici will blend two old traditions at Stephen's: Shore seafood and family Italian, from sauteed chicken or veal in wine sauce to Shore-classic crab gravy to an Italian fishermen’s stew of mussels, clams, shrimp, lobster and scallops.\n\nThe Philly native has been coming to Wildwood since he was a child. And so decades ago, Quici also remembers eating a $10.99 lobster-filet mignon surf and turf at the old boardwalk lobster shack that used to be where Stephen’s now stands.\n\nIn honor, he offers the same dish on his own menu. “Unfortunately, I couldn’t do $10.99,” he said, laughing.\n\nBut the restaurant's history also goes back to Philly, where Quici opened another Stephen’s Restaurant two decades back. Before he was even officially open in Wildwood, some of his old customers drove hours to eat his food again.\n\n“They recognized me, and I recognized them,” Quici said. “It was a very humbling experience.”\n\nTapas in a cheer-filled movie theater: Old Movies by the Sea\n\n4005 Pacific Ave., Wildwood. oldmoviesbythesea.com.\n\nMore than a century ago, the little building at 4005 Pacific Ave. opened as a what was then called a nickelodeon: a 5-cent theater showing a new and wondrous thing called “motion pictures.”\n\nThat theater likely closed in the 1920s, and in the meantime, the building’s been a baby clothes store, a shop selling musical instruments and a performing arts theater.\n\nBut last fall, partners Glenn Kingsbury and Karen Drew restored the old place back to its original glory as a plush-walled 40-seat moviehouse showing films from the golden age. The pair has also been hosting live comedy, birthday parties and even cheerleading competitions: Kingsbury runs cheer contests under the name Spirit Brands, and the theater is now a new home to competitive enthusiasm.\n\nBut as tourist season begins, Old Movies by the Sea will be a place to get dinner with a show. The theater’s manager, Jeff Levine, once cooked at restuarants in New York. And so the movie theater's food menu is an ambitious mix of tapas and catering fare: honeyed shrimp with walnuts, bacon-wrapped dates, Thai-spiced skewers and thick-meated “pinwheels” that look a bit like stromboli.\n\nOrder when you buy your movie or comedy tickets, and the food will be yours when you arrive.\n\nCereal-ice cream swirls: Utterly Ice Cream, Cereal and Coffee Bar\n\n3411 Pacific Ave., Wildwood, 609-522-0590. Open mornings to 2 p.m. and in the evening.\n\nThe Wildwoods, like the foodies of TikTok, are undergoing a bit of a cereal frenzy.\n\nLast year, North Wildwood saw the opening of a coffee bar called McCoy’s with cereal and cereal-topped doughnuts. This year, another turn of the screw: Utterly, near the Wildwood boardwalk, offers cereal-infused ice cream.\n\nMore:6 new restaurants in Wildwood to check out this summer\n\nAfter running an ice cream shop at the nearby Yankee Clipper motel, owner Danielle Aydelotte has moved on to crunchier pastures with Utterly. Her new ice cream, cereal and coffee bar allows customers to choose a cereal among any of a dozen options ranging from Cap’n Crunch to Froot Loops to seasonal flavors like a recent Peeps cereal, then choose an ice cream flavor they want to mix it with.\n\nAydelotte can then blend the cereal and ice cream together using a machine called the Swirl Freeze. She’d first seen the notion on the internet, she said — and then she had to try it.\n\n“You get the silky smoothness of the ice cream,” Aydelotte said, “and you have a tiny bit of crunch from the cereal.”\n\nFrom there, each soft-serve cone can then be drizzled with white chocolate or fudge or other flavors.\n\nUtterly’s coffee offerings are also betting on breakfast, with cereal-infused milk customers can mix into their coffee.\n\n“This was our first week that we put out the Cinnamon Toast Crunch-infused milk,” she said. “And we pretty much sold out of that within the first day or two.\"\n\nFlapjacks and a mission: Brandon’s Pancakes and Ice Cream Parlor\n\n6200 New Jersey Ave., Wildwood Crest, 609-305-4807.In his high school yearbook at Cape May Regional, Karl Famiano declared he would one day own a pancake house. And in Wildwood Crest’s former Doo-Wop Drive-Thru, Famiano finally made good on that pledge.\n\nBrandon’s Pancakes and Ice Cream Parlor opened this April with pancakes and biscuits and gravy in the morning, hoagies and ribeye cheesesteaks at lunch.\n\nBut the pancake house picked up a new mission along the way. Brandon’s is a place designed to be welcoming and inclusive to people with autism — and indeed to all people.\n\nAimee Famiano, Karl’s wife and partner in the restaurant, is a longtime special needs educator. Upon moving to the Shore from Pennsylvania, she noted that there were relatively few resources for people like her 25-year-old son, Brandon, nonverbal and living with autism.\n\nAnd so the pancake house that bears his name is also a place where Brandon can work and call his own.\n\n“He contributes, and he’s kind of like the little mayor,” Aimee Famiano said. “He walks around and shakes people’s hands.”.\n\nBrandon’s also provides employment for other people in Cape May County with special needs, and the Famianos have teamed with local schools to offer both work training and a destination for field trips.\n\nAnd if the food sometimes comes out a little slower than at some short-order kitchens, so be it. Famiano asks folks to be a little patient.\n\n“We're not only here to make money,” she said. “We're here to be warm and kind and employ people who need it, and show them kindness and compassion.”\n\nVietnamese soups and banh mi at Cape May Pho and Boba\n\n709 Route 9 South, Cape May Court House, 609-536-2545. Lunch and dinner.\n\nThough the towns surrounding Atlantic City have long been home to a bustling Vietnamese dining scene, a steaming bowl of pho has not been an easy find on the Cape.\n\nAs of last fall, owners Thao “Tracey” Le, and husband Tai Pham, changed all that with a pho and boba shop in Cape May Courthouse serving bubble teas and scratch-made pho prepared for as long as 48 hours — not to mention a broad menu of Vietnamese classics. Le’s extended family helps out with preparation, she told the Cape May County Herald in January.\n\nIn addition to pho, the menu includes banh mi sandwiches, vermicelli noodle (bun) plates, and rice dishes from pork chop to bo luc lac shaking beef. Among beverages, the familiar condensed-milk Vietnamese coffee is joined by modern innovations such as coffee with sea salt whipped cream, and a host of milk teas.\n\nGreek-American favorites at George’s Place West\n\n1050 NJ-47 South, Rio Grande, 609-435-5010, kararestaurantgroup.com/georges-west. Breakfast, lunch, dinner.\n\nIf you’ve eaten brunch in Cape May County, chances are you’ve eaten at George’s — a nearly 50-year-old tradition of Greek-American dining on the Shore, more recently expanded into an empire by brothers Yianni and Peter Karapanagiotis.\n\nJust as new freeway lanes bring traffic seemingly from nowhere, each new George’s location brings new crowds to fill it. New brunch lines for tiramisu waffles and Greek omelets. New lunch lines for gyro and falafel. And plenty of dinner reservations for braised lamb shank or branzino.\n\nA fifth location, George's West, just opened in Rio Grande, west of Wildwood. And if the past is any judge, this too will inspire lines for brunch. But maybe, just maybe, you can get there first.\n\nComing soon:\n\nSteak and seafood next to a pool bar and nightclub: Fairview Social in the Seaport Suites\n\n3601 Pacific Ave., Wildwood. bgcap.co. Openng projected by Memorial Day 2023.\n\nAmong the biggest projects to hit Wildwood this year, the 64-room Seaport Suites hotel will open as soon as Memorial Day at the former site of the once-legendary Fairview club and music venue.\n\nOn the bottom floor will be an eventual trio of ambitious projects from BG Capital, the developers behind nearby Seaport Pier: This will include a pool \"day club\" with two outdoor bars called Fourcast, an indoor bar and venue called Vice, and a 189-seat restaurant and bar called Fairview Social helmed by a former chef at multiple former Trump properties.\n\nHead chef Stephen Johnson's menu is under development, but needless to say, there will be steak. And there will be seafood.\n\nThe restaurant will offer an \"elevated\" dining experience and decor, but with none of the stuffiness of fine dining, said operating manager Jason Weiss, a longtime DJ and event promoter. Think old-school high banquettes and high-top tables, he said, and a bar through the center of the space, TVs tuned to every sporting event that exists.\n\nIn part, the restaurant is meant to pay homage to the classic nightclub that gave Fairview Social its name, Weiss said.\n\n\"We're trying to really keep the decor and the vibe and the feelings of that old space intact here,\" he said. \"We actually want people to feel like they're revisiting things from their childhood and from growing up.\"\n\nFresh moozadell and Brooklyn-style subs: Charlie’s Sandwich Shop\n\n5400 Pacific Ave., Wildwood, charliessandwichshopsi.com. Planned by end of May.\n\nBrooklyn-style Italian subs are coming to Wildwood.\n\nFor years, co-owners Calogero Bellomo and Charles Tornabene have made glistening braids of fresh mozzarella cheese and old-school Italian sandwiches in Brooklyn and Staten Island, whether a chicken-cutle \"Malaka\" or a salami and fresh-moozadell “Gonzo.”\n\nFor a lot longer, Tornabene has been coming down with his family to Wildwood. Finally, he figured, maybe he “oughta bring a little piece of Brooklyn in here.”\n\nTornabene promises fresh bread each day from New York. They’ll make the mozzarella. They’ll cook up their own roast beef on special. They’ll do everything they do in Brooklyn, Tornabene said: antipasto platters and caprese salads, a “Papa Sal” chicken parm with fried eggplant, a mortadella-and-pepper number called the “Humidor.”\n\nCharlie's hopes to be open by Memorial Day.\n\n“We grew up goin’ to Wildwood every summer as kids,” Tornabene said. “So why not just plant a seed there? You know what I mean?”\n\nThick-slab cheesesteaks from Philly: Steve’s Prince of Steaks\n\n2701 New Jersey Ave., Wildwood. stevesprinceofsteaks.com. Planned for July.\n\nSteve’s Prince of Steaks is coming to Wildwood.\n\nSteve’s, if you don’t know, is a 40-year classic in the world of Philadelphia cheesesteaks: a Northeast Philly stalwart founded by namesake Steven Iliescu. The shop is well known for its slab-style thick-cut beef, with devout loyalty among those who want cheesesteak that looks like steak.\n\nThe shop already has two locations in Northeast Philly, and a third in the Northeast suburb of Langhorne, all run by the Iliescu family. The Wildwood location, opening as soon as July in the space formerly home to Classic Sandwiches, will be the first Steve’s franchise.\n\nBowling, food, drink, arcades and more: Cape Square Entertainment Center\n\n3801 US-9, Rio Grande. squaretheatres.com. Projected for end of May.\n\nSleepy Rio Grande will get a little less sleepy and a lot more filled with bowling balls.\n\nAfter years in gestation, a former Kmart shopping center and vacant movie theater is set to become a massive entertainment complex. Cape Square Entertainment Center has long been in the works from developer Town Square Entertainment, which has brought multiple movie theaters to life along the South Jersey shore.\n\nTown Square and the operators at the site have been a bit mum about the details and didn’t respond to requests for comment. But plans floated over the years have included two restaurants — one upscale, one casual — nine movie theater screens, a virtual golf course, an arcade and a 12-lane bowling alley.\n\nThe restaurants, whose details have not been announced, will come from some of the same people behind Jersey Shore spots like Capt'n Jacks Island Grill, Harbor Burger Bar and the new Nucky's Speakeasy in Ventnor, according to people familiar with the project.\n\nThe center is set to be open as soon as Memorial Day, according to a March article by The Press of Atlantic City, citing Cape May County counsel Jeff Lindsay.\n\nSo whatever’s coming … it may be coming quite soon.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is a Philadelphia-based writer for USA Today Network.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/10/table-talk-food-downton-abbey/78573744/", "title": "Table Talk: The food of 'Downton Abbey'", "text": "DEBBIE SALOMON\n\nWith the curtain falling on “Downton Abbey,” the best soap opera ever to cross the pond, I must revisit the food element which — although less-pronounced than in “The Sopranos” — extrapolated a lifestyle. If you haven’t watched, for shame. Find someone who owns the entire series, or chip in with friends and order the DVDs from Amazon. I watch mine often enough to know the script by heart, yet every time I notice something new. Costumes are astounding, relationships complicated, societal strictures hilarious when not irritating. The plot line covers contemporary themes from an early 20th century perspective: single parenthood, breast cancer, rape, war, homosexuality, women’s rights, premarital sex, abortion, anti-Semitism, class distinction … and food.\n\nNearly half the action takes place in the kitchen/servants’ quarters. Shakespeare couldn’t have written Mrs. Patmore, the rotund, wispy-haired cook, any better. Ditto Daisy, the kitchen maid and, especially, Mr. Moseley — the eternal loser.\n\nMuch interaction among members of the titled Crawley family happens around the dining room table. Notice these:\n\n•The family dresses formally for dinner, every night, guests or not. Meals are multi-course, including soup, meat and fish entrees, a “savory” (appetizer), fresh vegetables and a dessert called “pudding,” no matter how fancy. Remember the Charlotte Russe Ethel made for lunch (called “luncheon”) after Sybil’s death in childbirth? Yet all the women stay skinny as worms.\n\n•Tea in the library includes several cakes; servants’ tea is always bread and butter. But the bread is homemade, looks delicious, better than the cakes. Similarly, servants eat mostly “stew and semolina” for their late supper – probably 10 p.m. – although wine is sometimes present. Breakfast? Forever porridge.\n\n•Few specific dishes are mentioned except when Isabel’s new cook burns a kidney soufflé. Yuck. She redeems herself with salmon mousse. And every proper lady’s maid is expected to make a “restorative broth,” no doubt a precursor to “Chicken Soup for the Soul.” Mrs. Patmore’s training is never specified, yet she produces a wedding brunch for Edith which includes calvados-glazed duckling, lobster rissoles, asparagus salad with saffron vinaigrette. These elaborations, all adapted from a menu served on the Titanic, end up on the servants’ table after Edith is jilted at the altar. Footman Alfred calls them “pickty bits” and asks for cheese.\n\nYet new kitchen helper Ivy’s first solo dish is a feuillete — asparagus wrapped in puff pastry.\n\nEventually, Alfred leaves to apprentice in the Ritz kitchen – a most unlikely occupation for a country lad.\n\n•Married women have breakfast in bed; American-born Lady Grantham (Cora) notices fresh-squeezed OJ on her tray, the result of research on American customs done by a fawning new maid. Mrs. Patmore is pleasantly surprised when Cora’s Yankee mom, played dead-pan by Shirley MacLaine, doesn’t balk at offal – the organ meats (liver, kidney, tripe, sweetbreads) popular in England.\n\n•Newfangled appliances arrive with negative fanfare; housekeeper Mrs. Hughes “treats herself” to an electric toaster which smokes up the downstairs. Mrs. Patmore breaks the bowl of an electric stand mixer (on purpose?) and rants against a refrigerator. So how did they manage ice cream, which Lady Mary remembers eating as a child, in the 1890s?\n\n•Food becomes a weapon of revenge when then-chauffeur Tom Branson stirs up a potage of soap, vinegar and cow dung with which he plans to douse a high-ranking military official dining at the abbey. Who can forget Daisy using salt instead of sugar in a “pudding” for guests, so the Crawleys would not prefer the cooking of a substitute while Mrs. Patmore was indisposed?\n\nThen, it is Mrs. P’s cooking that attracts a suitor more interested in her pate than her personality. Luckily, she sees through him before he chains her to yet another stove.\n\n•In Season Four, Cora’s monkey-business brother, played by Paul Giametti, comes to visit, bemoaning British food. Yet he is impressed by Daisy’s kedgeree. Never heard of it, so I googled the mishmash composed of hard boiled eggs, rice, smoked fish and Indian seasonings, served at weekend brunch.\n\n•Edibles provided a few laughs, as when the barn cat tries to run away with a whole roast chicken and Lord Grantham’s dog Isis catches a crepe Mrs. Patmore tossed into the air; also when footman Alfred accidentally dumps a platter of shellfish on the Dowager Countess’s (Maggie Smith) lap.\n\n•There are tender moments: Carson, the butler, patiently teaches Alfred uses for seven different spoons, including bouillon. Upstairs and downstairs women unite to mount a soup kitchen for destitute World War I veterans. Star-crossed lovers Anna and Bates take a picnic into the Scottish Highlands. Lady Mary, after auditioning Tony Gillingham as a lover, orders room service in their hotel hideaway. The flaming Christmas pudding, the cake culinary neophyte Lady Sybil bakes to surprise her mother, the “egg for Miss Sibbie’s tea” ordered by a wicked nanny …those, and much more.\n\nDid I whet your appetite? “Downton Abbey” will satisfy … in so many ways.\n\nContact Debbie Salomon at debsalomon@nc.rr.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/03/22/bazaars-tasty-traditions-root-jewish-community/81983152/", "title": "Bazaar's tasty traditions root Jewish community", "text": "Sherry Lucas\n\nThe Clarion-Ledger\n\nNow in its 49th year, the Beth Israel Sisterhood Bazaar's annual spread of hearty ethnic foods and sweet treats can hardly still qualify as exotic. At least not to the nearly 1,000 people who annual drop by for take-out or pull up a chair inside.\n\nChicken soup with matzo balls, noodle kugel, carrot tzimmes, brisket, potato knishes histories that stretch back centuries and echo from an ocean away.\n\nThe bazaar, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. March 30, includes traditional Jewish food, deli sandwiches, casseroles, gourmet desserts, a silent auction, white elephant sale and a raffle. Work starts each January with group cooks to supply the freeze-well dishes that'll supply the hot plate line and frozen casserole stash. The Sisterhood's largest fundraiser of the year, it supports service programs and groups such as Stewpot, Henry S. Jacobs camp, Meals on Wheels, Salvation Army and more. And it's a temple-wide effort; the Men's Club rallies to the occasion, frying up the popular blintzes on bazaar day.\n\nLunch time typically sees the biggest rush, with eat-in and carry-out orders snapping up many Jewish cultural staples.\n\nDifferent families have different traditions as far as the meals go, said Cheryl Katz, co-president with Mindy Humphrey of the Beth Israel Sisterhood. \"Everybody's stuffed cabbage is different.\" And so, recipes for the bazaar foods that feed the masses may change a bit, too, as committee chairmanships pass from one person to the next. 'Sometimes they tweak it to what their family is eating.\"\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThe menu touches on foods from traditions ranging from Eastern Europe to Israel (hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouli, chopped liver) to New York delis (reuben, corned beef), to satisfy a wide range of preferences.\n\nBut the taster plate on the hot food line may be a greatest hits collection. Here's the back story on its cultural staples:\n\nKugel, rooted in Eastern Europe's Ashkenazi Jews, may have a history stretching back more than eight centuries and can be a dessert or savory side depending on the style. Early on, before sugar sweetened the landscape and for the vast majority of regular folk, kugel was a baked pudding. Noodles, eggs, cheese and/or milk joined the dish via German Jews, rendering a creamy casserole. Potatoes or matzo flour might form the base rather than noodles, with vegetables and onions added for extra flavor. But no meat (mixing meat with milk wasn't kosher).\n\nSugar sweetened it up it up in the 1600s, and fruit such as raisins became common in sweet kugel, which has outdistanced its savory older cousin in popularity. The sweet noodle kugel — rich with dairy, sweetened with raisins, its crunchy top a pleasant contrast to the yielding custardy pasta — is a specialty at the bazaar.\n\nStuffed cabbage — cooked cabbage leaves wrapped around fillings, usually beef and rice — stretch back about 2,000 years in Jewish cooking, with recipes and preferences among European Jews varying by region.\n\nPotato knishes trace roots, too, back to Eastern European Jewish heritage, immigrants in the early 20th century popularized this staple/snack food in New York City. Simple, fast and filling, the pastry-covered knishes could be spicy or sweet. At a deli, the pastry-covered knish can be about the size of a bagel; at the bazaar, petite-sized potato knishes fit on the taster plate or qualify as appetizers.\n\nTzimmes, a traditional sweet stew of simmered carrots and dried fruits such as raisins and/or prunes (and often with other root vegetables), hails from Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, with honey or sugar, orange juice and occasionally cinnamon or other spices adding even more flavor. Because of all the prep work hat goes into slicing and stirring, the name may claim parentage in Yiddish tzim (for) and esn (eating); the expression \"make a big tzimmes over something,\" means making a big fuss, according to unitedwithisrael.org.\n\nBrisket, the flavorful cut of beef from the cow's chest, is best braised to bypass its tough and stringy tendencies. The ease, time involved and better-the-next-day qualities made it a reliable and traditional staple for big meals, from Rosh Hashana to Passover.\n\nChicken soup with matzo balls — sometimes referred to as \"Jewish penicillin\" for its curative powers — includes a dumpling made of matzo meal with eggs, water and oil or chicken fat (schmaltz).\n\nBlintzes hark back to Hungarian origin, and the creamy cheese filling of the crepes is sometimes augmented with jam or sour cream for an even sweeter, richer treat.\n\nThe Beth Isreal Bazaar \"is probably one of the oldest, in relative terms, and beloved Jewish food festivals in the South,\" said Marcie Cohen Ferris, author of \"Matzoh Ball Gumbo: Culinary Tales of the Jewish South.\" \"Beth Israel has really made a name for themselves, particularly because it's in Mississippi.\" Ask American Jews to name the most surprising place Jews live, \"it's Alaska and Mississippi,\" she said.\n\n\"To have a really vibrant, well-established Jewish food festival/bazaar that's meant so much for so long ... is really significant. It has really strong meaning particularly in Jackson because it was a way for that Jewish community to say we are here. We are committed to this state. We are Mississippians, but we have these cherished religious and ethnic food traditions. And it's important to us, like other church folks, to share this with you.\n\n\"That's what people do in the South and at churches and synagogues,\" with bazaars, festivals and cake sales.\n\n\"It's exotic, but it's familiar because people know those Jewish community members.\"\n\nKatz said, \"It's a Jackson tradition now.\"\n\nContact Sherry Lucas at slucas@gannett.com or (601) 961-7283.

Opening in December, the new Park City ski area is a merger of what were formerly the Park City Mountain Resort and Canyons, interconnected with new lifts and trails. The behemoth will feature 38 lifts and 300-plus runs, including a chair and trail right down to the town’s historic Main Street — just a few blocks from the No Name Saloon.\n\nThe former silver mining town has long been a ski travel hot spot, but the seismic change will make already popular Main Street eateries like the No Name Saloon even harder to get into. But you need not wait until winter, as Park City has increasingly become a year-round destination, with plenty of great hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and other mountain town activities. A brand-new 18-hole public golf course just opened at the Canyons base area a month ago. Plus, it’s a lot easier to go out to eat, and when you do, you can eat outside.\n\nPark City is an upscale town, home to many luxury hotels, boutiques, art galleries and the Sundance Film Festival. It does not really have any dive bars, but the No Name Saloon is about as close as it gets. Entering it feels a bit like stepping back in time to the Old West, with a Victorian-style saloon featuring worn wooden floors, an ornate bar with multi-level shelves and mirrors, and old-school ceiling fans all driven by a single linked belt. Imagine a cowboy bar, with stools at the bar and a jumble of high-top tables jammed in as close together as possible for dining. Now imagine taking anything and everything the owners could find and hanging it on walls and from the ceiling — including Christmas lights, a tricycle, toy cars, a moose head, sports trophies and a full-size old motorcycle and a very old snowmobile. Bathrooms are marked with pictures of Popeye and Betty Boop. A flat-screen TV is jammed in among the miscellany, silently playing sports while loud music cranks — every second or third song is Led Zeppelin.\n\nThat’s the front bar cum dining room. The place is a bit of a maze that continues backwards past the narrow kitchen with more tables hidden in back, even more upstairs, and in summer, more outside. Everywhere you turn is interesting stuff, from well-used bar shuffleboard to old license plates to an antique high wheel bicycle. Just as there is little order to the layout and design, there is no order to the seating, and when busy it’s every guest for themselves, with hovering/stalking rewarded while less aggressive diners may never get seated. In peak ski season, it is easiest to come for lunch or après, while for dinner, expect a (potentially fruitless) wait.\n\nReason to visit: Buffalo burgers.\n\nThe food: The No Name Saloon is a bar, and it is all about bar food, served fast and on red-and-white checked paper in red plastic baskets. But it is very good bar food with several unique twists. Still, it would be somewhat unremarkable save for a confluence of highlights: its great location in arguably the nation’s hottest ski town, its century-plus of history and undeniably colorful atmosphere, and its focus on bison.\n\nBuffalo is increasingly common and for good reason: It tastes great, it’s likely better for you than beef and it is definitely more natural. While the vast majority of beef cattle in this country are raised on a steady diet of antibiotics, hormones and food they don’t consume naturally, bison receive no drugs and eat grass. It also happens to make a great-tasting burger, and I often use it at home. It shows up more and more on menus, but has been the signature here forever — so much so that the No Name Saloon offers no “regular” burgers. There are turkey and veggie alternatives, along with bar food staples like tacos, hot wings, quesadillas and fish and chips.\n\nThe burgers are served in several distinct styles, always with “buffalo chips and salsa,” which are actually very good house-made kettle-style potato chips, an unusual pairing. The potato chips and salsa are also offered as a starter and as a side can be upgraded to fries or onion rings, both of which are well above average. The fries are fresh and crunchy and really taste like potato, while the rings are the widely varied size that comes from cutting up actual onions rather than using a frozen bag, tasty and crispy.\n\nThe burger patties are an extremely generous 1/2-pound of bison, and since it has less fat to begin with, it shrinks less than a beef burger, making it seem even bigger. While they have the basic burger offerings, the house signature No Name Burger is unusual, topped with a mound of cream cheese studded with sliced jalapenos, plus lettuce, tomato and mayo spread underneath. I was hesitant to eat it, as I wouldn’t usually put cream cheese on a burger in lieu of say cheddar, but I tried it and it was excellent. The buffalo patty itself is really good, while the aioli, cream cheese and jalapeño worked well together. I also got to taste test a range of styles with the clever buffalo slider trio, and the barbecue bacon cheeseburger was my favorite.\n\nThere is something both homey and cheesy about the place. Service is frenetic but friendly, and given all that is going on and how dense the crowds they push through, I have to commend the wait staff on their non-stop smiles and attitude. It can be a bit of a chore to eat at No Name, especially for dinner on a busy night, but the food makes it worthwhile, better than it looks and better than you might expect. All this, plus lots of local craft beers on tap and a good happy hour make it what it wants to be: a great ski town bar.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but if you are in Park City and want a great burger — or have never tried buffalo.\n\nRating: Mmmm (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: 447 Main Street, Park City, Utah; 435-649-6667; nonamesaloon.net\n\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

How many loose-meat sandwich restaurants ...", "text": "Just curious: This occasional feature in the Des Moines Register aims to answer your questions about Iowa. Is there some place, event, lore, history or cultural quirk you're just curious about? Email your question to the Des Moines Register's Bill Steiden at wsteiden@registermedia.com.\n\nHave you ever had a Maid-Rite?\n\nIowa's loose-meat sandwich — perhaps second only to the pork tenderloin as the state's most famous culinary concoction between two buns — is known as a Maid-Rite after the brand of franchise restaurants that sell the sandwich.\n\nOne of the oldest fast-food restaurants in the United States, the Maid-Rite has nearly a century of history, and hungry Iowans are still filling up on the sandwiches alongside fries and a shake.\n\nWhat is a Maid-Rite loose-meat sandwich?\n\nIf you've ever seen the classic sitcom \"Roseanne,\" you might remember references to the loose-meat sandwich.\n\nThe classic sandwich has crumbly, finely-ground and seasoned beef on a bun. Diners can add condiments like ketchup, mustard, onions or pickles. Cheese is an option for a Cheese-Rite or bacon for a bacon Cheese-Rite.\n\nImagine a burger just with crumbled beef instead of a pressed patty. A Maid-Rite is distinct, in that sense, from a sloppy Joe, which is doused in a tomato sauce.\n\nOther possible varieties includes a Maid-Rite with chili; a Maid-Rite bowl; a Jalapeño-Rite; a mega version with a larger pile of meat; a Maid-Rite with barbecue sauce; or rarebit version, served open-faced with melted cheese.\n\nMaid-Rite restaurants might serve fries, shakes, tenderloins and other diner-style food for a full meal. Local Maid-Rite franchises might also offer breakfast, homemade pies or unique ice cream flavors.\n\nWhere did the Maid-Rite come from?\n\nAs the Des Moines Register has previously reported, Fred Angell was running a butcher shop in Muscatine in 1926 and was experimenting with a new way to cook hamburger.\n\nA salesman who later came by and took a sample then exclaimed, as the story goes, \"this sandwich is made right.\"\n\nAngell opened up a restaurant in Muscatine to sell his invention, and the brand grew to an early example of a fast-food franchise with drive-in service.\n\nAn early franchise was Taylor's Maid-Rite in Marshalltown, which opened in 1928 under Cliff Taylor and remains open and family-owned to this day.\n\nWhere can I get a Maid-Rite?\n\nThe Maid-Rite website lists about 25 Maid-Rite franchises in the Midwest, though a few on the list appear to now be closed.\n\nIn Iowa, there are 15 franchise locations, according to Google business listings. They're anywhere from a suburban strip mall, a small town downtown or even a highway welcome center with an Amish country store.\n\nThere's just one in Des Moines proper: at the food court in Merle Hay Mall, 3800 Merle Hay Road. Other locations in the Des Moines metro include Ankeny, 802 S.E. Oralabor Road, and Norwalk, 1031 Sunset Drive.\n\nThe historic Taylor's Maid-Rite in downtown Marshalltown is at 106 S. Third Ave. and Oskaloosa's Maid-Rite at 902 A Ave. W.\n\nOther Iowa Maid-Rite locations include Davenport, Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, Durant, Lamoni, Muscatine, Waterloo, and West Burlington.\n\nThe Newton Maid-Rite, with almost 100 years of history in town, recently added donuts back to the menu after a three-year hiatus, the Newton Daily News reported. Dan Holtkamp previously owned the restaurant for 51 years through 2021, according to the Daily News.\n\nThere are also restaurants in Iowa that serve their own spin on a loose-meat sandwich under a different name, such as Paula's Cafe in West Des Moines, Ottumwa's institution Canteen Lunch in the Alley or Awe'z Sandwich Shop in Mason City.\n\nMaid-Rite locations also remain open in Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri.\n\nChris Higgins covers the northern and eastern suburbs for the Register.

Not only is Phish bringing their new Mondegreen festival to The Woodlands on Thursday, Aug. 15, to Sunday, Aug. 18 — the band also has had a major influence on Firefly, which is slated to return this year.\n\nHere's the lowdown on how Phish inspired Firefly, and what Phish fans need to know before coming to The Woodlands for Mondegreen.\n\nPhish blazed trail for Firefly Music Festival\n\nThe first Phish festival was the three-day Clifford Ball in Plattsburgh, New York, in 1996. That event helped to set the template for the band's future festivals.\n\nMondegreen continues the band's tradition and is slated to be Phish's 11th self-produced festival.\n\nClifford Ball revolutionized the festival scene and is responsible for inspiring other major events like Bonnaroo, which launched in 2002 in Tennessee. The band played the festival in 2009, 2012 and 2019.\n\n“There's no underplaying the significance that Phish had, as a band and as an organization, in the direct development of Bonnaroo,” said Bonnaroo festival co-founder Rick Farman in a 2019 report by The Tennessean, a sister publication to Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nTrey Anastasio of Phish on when 'There were no festivals'\n\nPhish also helped to influence Firefly, a festival born in 2012 in The Woodlands that shares a similar DNA as Bonnaroo. Both festivals are four days and each features about 100 acts, some of which have headlined both events.\n\n(Firefly promised to return in 2024 after taking the year off to recalibrate in 2023. But festival organizers haven’t announced a lineup or dates for this year's event.)\n\nBelieve it or not, there was once a time when music festivals were few in the United States. Major concert promoters chose to build amphitheaters instead.\n\nBut in the ‘90s, Phish broke the mold by holding epic, ambitious and fiercely independent gatherings in remote corners of the country, and brought up to 85,000 fans along with them.\n\nPhish also was the only act on their festival lineup, a theme they'll continue at Mondegreen.\n\n“There were no festivals,” recalled Phish frontman Trey Anastasio in the 2019 report by The Tennessean. “And I mean none. It was not something that had a blueprint. The only festival that we could have conjured up in America would be Woodstock — the real one — which was logistically, an unmitigated disaster. So when we started planning our first festival, the first thing on our minds was to make it really comfortable for our friends, which were our fans.”\n\nWhere are The Woodlands Dover?\n\nThe Woodlands in Dover, Delaware, home to the festival, is a rural area off the main Route 1 highway. Civilization is only about a 15-minute drive. Within that driving radius festivalgoers will find lots of businesses like Walmart, Target, gas stations (Wawa), grocery stores (Safeway, Redner's), restaurants (Chipotle, Grotto Pizza, McDonald's, etc.) and the Dover Mall.\n\nWhere is the closest airport or train to The Woodlands Dover?\n\nThe closest train station is upstate in Wilmington (roughly 51 minutes). Amtrak's Acela offers routes between Wilmington; Philadelphia; New York; Boston; New Haven, Connecticut; and Washington, D.C.\n\nFestivalgoers will find the nearest airport is Wilmington Airport (38 minutes). This Wilmington location offers budget prices, but the only caveat is they serve only select cities. For a complete listing, visit flyilg.com.\n\nOther nearby airports are Philadelphia International Airport (1 hour and 15 minutes) and Baltimore's BWI Airport (1 hour and 45 minutes).\n\nWhat's it like in The Woodlands?\n\nThe festival grounds are massive, which means you might want to wear some comfy shoes. The Woodlands also includes areas where folks can set up hammocks.\n\nOne of the downsides to The Woodlands is it doesn't offer a lot of shade from the sun. It's likely The Woodlands will shrink significantly for the Phish festival, which would help revelers cut down on walking.\n\nDover Motor Speedway is near The Woodlands\n\nEach year NASCAR fans camp out in The Woodlands to see their favorite drivers race at the nearby Dover Motor Speedway, formerly Dover International Speedway, and nicknamed the Monster Mile. The Woodlands are on the outskirts of the iconic racetrack.\n\nHow is Wi-Fi in The Woodlands?\n\nInternet access was hit-or-miss at Firefly. Some people used their phone as a hotspot to access the Web.\n\nWhat does Mondegreen mean?\n\nMondegreen is defined as \"a word or phrase that results from a mishearing, especially of something recited or sung,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nWhen are Mondegreen tickets on sale?\n\nTravel packages went on sale Thursday, Jan. 18, at 11 a.m. EST. Weekend and camping passes go on sale Friday, Jan. 19. at 11 a.m. EST.\n\nGeneral admission starts at $450 and covers access for all four days. If you're bringing a vehicle, you must also buy a camping or parking vehicle pass (1 per car or RV). Parking passes (day or overnight) start at $40.\n\nMondegreen is in The Woodlands near Dover Motor Speedway (1131 N. Dupont Highway, Dover) from Thursday, Aug. 15, to Sunday, Aug. 18.

Phish fans discovered this when the band handed them boxes of macaroni to be used for percussion tools when they played Slade Hall at the University of Vermont on Sept. 27, 1985, according to Phish.net, the popular Phish forum where fans leaked the band's Woodlands festival a month before Phish officially went public.\n\nPhish plays vacuum cleaner in concert\n\nDrummer Jon Fishman is skilled at playing melodies on a vacuum cleaner. There are multiple videos of him on YouTube holding a vacuum hose to his mouth and creating quirky sounds with it during his vacuum solo. One YouTube video is titled “Phish 11-30-19 Vacuum Solo.”\n\nLead singer Trey Anastasio can play drums\n\nWhen Fishman is doing his vacuum solo, who's on the drums? Lead singer Trey Anastasio has filled in for his bandmate behind a drum set. Anastasio joins a unique list of singers who also play drums like Dave Grohl (who has vacationed in Rehoboth Beach), Ringo Starr, Teddy Pendergrass and Phil Collins. You can watch Anastasio in action in the above vacuum solo video.\n\nPhish's hot dog is in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, not the band\n\nFor years there's been a debate whether Phish will ever be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. There honestly isn't a clear answer. The irony is the band has a famous hot-dog prop that's featured at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Ohio. The band first rode the iconic hot dog at their Boston Garden concert on Dec 31, 1994.\n\nPage McConnell's dad developed Tylenol\n\nBorn in nearby Philadelphia and raised in New Jersey, keyboardist Page McConnell was destined to make musical medicine that would heal the masses. His dad, Jack, worked for the McNeil Pharmaceutical Co. (later Johnson & Johnson) and helped develop Tylenol, according to a 2007 report by ABC.\n\nPhish co-founder becomes a politician\n\nNot all Phish members can be branded as one-dimensional musicians, especially percussionist Jon Fishman (who inspired the band's name, according to encyclopedia.com). Fishman's résumé also includes becoming a politician as he drummed up excitement in his hometown of Lincolnville, Maine, after becoming the newest selectman to win an election to the five-member select board in 2017.\n\nDress-wearing Phish member does movie with Bernie Sanders\n\nFishman has had a knack for wearing doughnut dresses in concert over the years. That might explain why he's credited as playing Ginger the \"transvestite\" drummer\" in the 1999 film \"My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception,\" per IMDB. Another Vermont legend in the film is Fishman's friend Sen. Bernie Sanders, who plays a rabbi in the flick. Fishman is a longtime supporter of Sanders and endorsed him when he was on the campaign trail in 2016.\n\nWho is the fifth member of Phish?\n\nIt's common for bands to embrace members who aren't one of the group's founding musicians. But it's unusual when that adopted member is the lighting guy. Chris Kuroda, the band's lighting director, is the fifth official star Phish in the group. (It even says so on the band's website.)\n\nPhish college thesis is on improvisation\n\nThe ability to ad-lib in concert is a cornerstone for Phish. McConnell takes it seriously, so much so that he based his senior thesis around it when he attended Goddard College in Vermont. His thesis, which was published in 1987, was titled \"The Art of Improvisation,\" per McConnell's bio.\n\nPhish has a 'Triple Nipple'\n\nThe jam band references nipples getting sliced in three songs, a theme nicknamed the \"Triple Nipple.\" In the song \"Fee,\" the band sings: \"Floyd is dead; he's nothing but a ripple/Cause Milly took that paper/And sliced him on the nipple.\"\n\nThere's also the tune \"Sloth\":\n\n“I'm So bad. He's so nasty Ain't got no friends. Real out-casty Stay out of my way. End up a cripple I'll take this piece of paper. [Cross?] your nipple.”\n\nThe third song about nipples is \"Punch You in The Eye\":\n\n\"Well it seems you didn't like my face I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place They tied me to a chair with a giant clip And held a piece of paper to my tender nip.\"\n\nAre you coming to the Mondegreen festival and have a cool Phish story to tell?

Keep on dancing, fam.\"\n\nFirefly fans: 'They are trying to break up with us'\n\nIn late 2022, after its 10th Firefly event, festival producers AEG Presents promised Firefly would come back to The Woodlands of Dover in 2024, before the festival went on hiatus last summer to \"recharge our lights.\"\n\nUntil this Thursday afternoon, the organizers hadn't made any announcements on its Facebook or Instagram page, which led fans to assume the festival wasn't coming back in 2024, or possibly ever again.\n\nFirefly fans expressed a mix of heartbreak and fond memories under the festival's Facebook page following the post.\n\n\"Please please please I cannot beg any more, please just figure stuff out and make damn sure to be back again sometime soon then!!!\" a passionate fan demanded.\n\n\"Thank you for the memories, and the closure,\" another person said.\n\n\"I feel like they are trying to break up with us but still leaving a shred of hope. Not cool lol,\" one fan claimed.\n\nWhy was Firefly canceled in 2023 & 2024?\n\nFirefly organizers never elaborated on why the festival went dark this year or in 2023. But last week we reported that it was reasonable to assume the festival's struggling attendance played a key role in that.\n\nOrganizers likely needed time to figure out a good strategy to rejuvenate interest in their event, a theory that appears to be validated by their latest Facebook post.\n\nAttendance at Firefly has dipped\n\nAt its height in 2015, Firefly attracted 90,000 fans. That was the same year Paul McCartney headlined. But since then, the festival has shrunk.\n\nIn 2019, Firefly reduced from four to three days (Friday through Sunday), which trimmed the crowd down to maybe about 60,000 fans. Firefly organizers have been shy about releasing attendance stats for their festival since their 2015 event.\n\nFirefly would return back to four days for its 2021 and 2022 events. Organizers announced they were capping the 2021 festival at about 50,000 people, which helped them meet the state's COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nDespite the capped attendance, the fan excitement at the 2021 event was still strong, with plenty of first-timers.\n\nBut hosting the festival in late September of 2021 and 2022 made it more difficult for its high school and college-age crowd to attend.\n\nFirefly competes against more festivals like Oceans Calling\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Firefly has dimmed over the years. One reason is the festival landscape is more competitive now than when Firefly launched in 2012.\n\nNew festivals have popped up like Oceans Calling in Ocean City, Maryland, which debuted last year. That event catered to old-school Firefly fans who wanted to see more rock bands and '90s/2000s acts, and it featured Firefly alum.\n\nThis week Oceans Calling dropped its lineup for their fall event, which has doubled down on those types of acts and features headliners The Dave Matthews Band, Blink-182 and The Killers, the former of which both played Firefly.\n\nThe festival's lineup has received rave reviews from concert lovers. Some commenters even mentioned Oceans Calling under Firefly's latest Facebook post.\n\n\"Yeah that Oceans Calling Festival is taking you alls mojo,\" one person said.\n\nFirefly got younger; older fans left\n\nAnother reason some Firefly fans abandoned the festival is because it began to attract a high school crowd. Firefly started out as an indie/alternative rock festival.\n\nIn 2022, News Journal reporter Ryan Cormier pointed out: \"Over the years, pop, hip-hop and electronic music overtook rock as the dominant sound of the festival, which eventually lost much of its older fan base and saw more teenage and college-aged music fans coming to the 300-acre site.\"\n\nIs Firefly dead?Fans share some of their issues with the festival\n\nPhish festival Mondegreen comes to The Woodlands Dover\n\nIt's no secret AEG has a working history with Phish and has partnered with the jam band to help them with their Mondegreen festival, coming to The Woodlands this summer from Aug. 15 to 18.\n\nAEG's efforts are more focused on making that a success, an event that's buzzing, than shifting its attention to Firefly this year. That festival is a surefire way to bring in lots of attendance because the Phish community is very loyal and has a reputation for traveling the country to see the band.\n\nWhat's next for Firefly Music Festival?\n\nAs the Firefly promoters mentioned in their update on Thursday, fans shouldn't be surprised to see them hosting more festivals in The Woodlands.\n\nThe reality is there's not that much pressure for a new Firefly to bounce back tomorrow because AEG's lease for exclusive festival rights to the Firefly site for music festivals extends to 2032.\n\nSo it sounds like the promoters plan to bring big events to Delaware for years to come.\n\nDelaware Online reporter Ryan Cormier contributed to this report.\n\nAre you a Firefly fan with an interesting story?

The brewers quickly scrapped its original name, Double Delaware IPA, and renamed it Delabear Beer.\n\nThey even had T-shirts made, which sold out in less than a week.\n\nWilmington Brew Works’ Chief Operating Officer Keith Hughes says people initially tried the beer due to its buzzed-about inspiration. But then they started coming back to buy crowlers and growlers of the hard stuff to bring home.\n\nNow, the beer fills these fun cans, which are sure to be commemorative for some.\n\nSo how can you get your paws on a can of Delabear Beer?\n\nThe brewery will release the cans to the general public on Wednesday, Feb. 12, at 5 p.m. Four-packs cost $22 and a single can is $6.50.\n\nBut if you want to get yours before everyone else, they will be available the night before at the brewery's ticketed Flights of Discovery event series at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nThe themed event, dubbed \"Ugly Side of Valentines,\" costs $25 and features a flight of four beers, including Delabear Beer. Participants will also be able to purchase the cans at the event before heading home.\n\nGo to wilmingtonbrewworks.com for tickets and more information.\n\nSince Wilmington Brew Works doesn't have its own canning line (like the majority of craft breweries), it contracted New Hampshire-based canning company Iron Heart Canning to do the job. And like other canning companies, Iron Heart went to the brewery with all the equipment needed.\n\nThe brewery, which first opened at 3129 Miller Road in 2018, is the city's first production brewery since Diamond State Brewery closed in 1954 on Fifth Street.\n\nMORE:Wilma's, a new recreation hall with arcade & duckpin bowling, is coming to downtown Wilmington\n\nAnd Wilmington Brew Works wasn't alone when it came to jumping on the Delabear bandwagon.\n\nBrew Ha Ha!'s roasting operation, Trolley Square-based Brandywine Coffee Roasters, offered a Delabear bag of their Burundi Kayanza Honey and Colombia Santa Barbara Estate coffee beans with a cute hand-drawn bear on the front of the packaging.\n\nIt's the same shop that was put on lockdown the morning of the bear's visit, with customers trapped in the coffee shop until police said it was safe to go back outside.\n\nIn addition, University of Delaware's UDairy ice cream shops offered Delabear ice cream: banana ice cream with honey, peanut butter chips and Teddy Grahams.\n\nEven though the bear left us a couple of months ago, Wilmington Brew Works thinks demand is till there.

The Delaware Authority for Regional Transit's Beach Bus is seeing ridership above pre-COVID numbers this year, Chief Customer Experience Officer Julie Theyerl said.\n\nYet, people still hesitate to take the bus.

Trump ...", "text": "While Republican Donald Trump has secured a return to the White House, the popular vote is still being tallied as ballots are counted across the country.\n\nBut as things stand late Wednesday morning, the president-elect maintains a firm lead of nearly 5 million votes over Vice President Kamala Harris. If Trump ultimately wins the national popular vote – a moral victory that won't ultimately sway the election outcome – he'd be the first Republican presidential candidate to do so in two decades.\n\nHere's what to know about the popular vote and Trump's path to winning it for the first time in his three presidential campaigns.\n\nElection 2024 live updates:ACLU, others prepping plans to oppose Trump policies\n\nElectoral College map:Follow results\n\nWhat is the national popular vote?\n\nAfter all the votes have been tallied, the candidate with the most individual ballots cast in their favor has won the popular vote.\n\nHowever, the Electoral College, not the national popular vote, is what determines the winners of presidential elections in the United States. Statewide popular votes are used to determine which presidential candidate receives that state's batch of electoral votes, with the exception of Nebraska and Maine, both of which allow the splitting of electors in a form of “proportional representation.”\n\nBut while the popular vote does not always align with the eventual winner, it does offer a look at who individual voters prefer in the White House and can be seen as a moral victory for a candidate.\n\nCould Trump win the popular vote?\n\nLate Wednesday morning, Trump had garnered 71.7 million votes, leading Democrat Harris, who had 66.8 million.\n\nLive results:Follow here to get the latest popular vote counts\n\nIf Trump were to win the popular vote in the 2024 presidential election, it would be the first time he has accomplished the feat in any of his three general election campaigns.\n\nEven though he won enough electoral votes for a victory in 2016, he lost the popular vote to Clinton by nearly 2.9 million votes, becoming one of five presidents who lost the popular vote but won the presidency.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also won the popular vote by a 4-point margin over Trump in 2020 on his way to unseating the then-incumbent.\n\nBiden received more than 81 million votes in the 2020 presidential election, according to the Federal Election Commission. That's just over 51% of the popular vote. Biden holds the record for most votes ever won by a U.S. presidential candidate.\n\nWhen is the last time a Republican won the popular vote?\n\nThe last Republican to win a popular vote in the United States was George W. Bush during his reelection campaign in 2004.\n\nBush defeated Democratic Sen. John Kerry that year after accruing 50.7% of the popular vote and 286 electoral votes, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nBush, however, lost the popular vote in 2000 to Al Gore, who received just 48.4%, of the votes, the American Presidency Project states. Votes for minor party candidates prevented the two major parties from receiving a majority of the popular vote.\n\nBefore Biden and Clinton claimed the lionshare of popular votes in their respective elections against Trump, Barack Obama won it twice when he was elected in 2008 and reelected in 2012, defeating late U.S. Sen. John McCain and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, respectively, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nWhat do the election results mean for you?Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nContributing: Anna Kaufman, Jonathan Limehouse, Clare Mulroy, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

For the latest news and results from the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live updates on former President Donald Trump's victory.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump won a second term in office on Tuesday, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nIt was a decisive win after polls showed Trump and Harris competing in a razor-close election. But enough Americans in pivotal states were won over by Trump's focus on inflation and immigration to propel him back to the White House. Trump's victory also comes after he faced two shocking assassination attempts over the summer.\n\nEarly in election night, the nominees picked up their respective strongholds, with Harris winning much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinching victories in the South. But Trump picked up North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, giving him enough momentum as they fought over swing states.\n\nIt was also a good night for other Republicans. GOP candidates picked up several pivotal Senate seats across the country, including in West Virginia and Ohio, reclaiming the upper chamber.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the presidential election and downballot fights.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDonald Trump wins Wisconsin, pushing him over 270 threshold\n\nDonald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in Wisconsin flipping a key Midwestern “blue wall” state back to red after President Joe Biden picked it up in 2020. Trump is awarded 10 electoral votes, and the state pushes him over the 270 threshold needed to win a presidential election.\n\nTrump won the state in 2016, a stunning upset after he became the first Republican to win the state since 1984.\n\nThe state has leaned further to the right in recent years, despite Biden winning the state in the last election. Harris for months has tried to appeal to Republican voters in Wisconsin, while Trump also tried to cut into Harris’ support among Black and Latino voters in the state.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump: 'God spared my life for a reason'\n\nTrump's victory speech lasted about 25 minutes, praising his aides and supporters, and marveling at a wild campaign that included two assassination attempts.\n\n\"Many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason,\" Trump said at one point. \"And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness. And now we are going to fulfill that mission together.\"\n\nTrump gave shout-outs to campaign aides and his some of his most prominent supporters, including billionaire businessman Elon Musk, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who previously ran as an independent presidential candidate but dropped out and backed Trump.\n\nOften echoing parts of his campaign stump speech, Trump said his campaign put together diverse coalitions with similar views on immigration and the economy, forming what he called \"a common core of common sense.\"\n\n\"This campaign has been so historic in so many ways,\" Trump said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHarris wins Minnesota\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris has won the state of Minnesota. She is awarded 10 electoral votes.\n\nTim Walz, Harris’ vice presidential running mate, serves as governor of the state. The North Star State has been a reliable Democratic stronghold. However in 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton barely eked out a win in the state over Republican Donald Trump by 1.5 percentage points.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump on Vance: 'I took a little heat at the beginning'\n\nDonald Trump praised his vice presidential candidate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\n\"I took a little heat at the beginning but I knew the brain was a good one,\" he joked about the senator, who stirred controversy early in the campaign by calling Democratic women \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nPolitical analysts raised concerns that Trump has made a mistake in picking the young up-and-coming Republican.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump: 'We made history'\n\nTrump sounded as surprised as anybody in declaring victory, citing the many obstacles he faced during a volatile campaign.\n\n\"Look what happened – is this crazy?\" Trump told a screaming crowd at the Palm Beach County Convention Center, also telling supporters that his campaign \"made history.\"\n\nEchoing comments he made on the campaign trail, Trump credited his political movement for winning a second term in office. Trump also praised Vice President-elect JD Vance and members of the Trump family, including first-lady-to-be (once again) Melania Trump.\n\nAddressing the crowd, Vance said Trump pulled off \"the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America.\"\n\nWith some states still out, the president-elect predicted he would wind up with at least 315 electoral votes. He also noted that Republicans would win the U.S. Senate and likely the House.\n\nTrump also pledged to \"help our country heal\" after a divisive election.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump praises Senate wins, Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nDonald Trump praised Senate Republicans for retaking the upper chamber Tuesday night, and expressed his support for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who plans to run to retain his leadership role during an internal election next week.\n\nJohnson is expected to face leadership challenges if Republicans lose the House, and it is unclear if challengers will emerge if Republicans keep the House. But Trump has been supportive of the speaker in public.\n\n\"I think he's done a terrific job,\" Trump said of Johnson early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump wins Pennsylvania, flipping must-win swing state\n\nDonald Trump has won the coveted state of Pennsylvania – flipping a state seen as a must win in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nTrump is awarded 19 electoral votes. Trump eked out a win in the state in 2016 by less than a percentage point. But he lost the state to President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump and Democrat Kamala Harris were locked in a close race in the critical battleground state. Pennsylvania was one of three critical “blue wall” states – which includes Michigan and Wisconsin – that helped catapult both Trump to the White House in 2016 and Biden to the White House in 2020.\n\nTrump campaigned heavily in the state, zeroing in on the Western part of the state while also appealing to voters in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump notches critical Maine district\n\nDonald Trump has won Maine’s 2nd congressional district. He is awarded one electoral vote.\n\nMaine’s results are different than other states because it awards its electoral votes via statewide tally, in addition to congressional districts. Trump in both 2016 and 2020 won the state’s 2nd congressional district, which is largely more conservative and rural than other parts of the state.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump to address supporters\n\nTrump is expected to address supporters soon at the Palm Beach Convention Center.\n\nNo one knows if he will explicitly declare victory – he still doesn't have the required 270 votes to earn another term in the White House – but he will at least come close.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHarris picks up New Hampshire\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris has won the state of New Hampshire. She will be awarded 4 electoral votes.\n\nThe state has voted for Democrats in the presidential race since 1992, with the exception of former President George W. Bush in 2000. New Hampshire keeps a lower profile in general elections, but during primary seasons it often plays a key role in determining the presidential nominee for both parties.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris won’t speak at watch party\n\nKamala Harris will not address supporters gathered at Howard University in Washington for her election night party and plans to instead speak later Wednesday morning.\n\nCedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris campaign, delivered that news around 12:45 am ET at the watch party as Harris’ prospects to defeat Trump appeared grimmer.\n\n“We still have votes to count,” Richmond said. “We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to fight to make sure every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken. You won’t hear from the vice president tonight but you will hear from here tomorrow.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump has won Georgia\n\nDonald Trump has won the state of Georgia flipping it back for Republicans after it went blue in 2020.\n\nTrump is awarded 16 electoral votes. He carried Georgia in 2016, when the Peach State had backed Republicans since 1996. However, President Joe Biden during the 2020 election narrowly won the state by a margin of roughly 12,000 votes.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear which slice of Georgia's voters helped propel the former president to victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Trump in recent months has focused on rural voters in the state in hopes of offsetting Democrats’ gains in Atlanta and its suburbs.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nUtah governor who was once a vocal critic of Trump wins reelection\n\nRepublican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox won a second term after reversing his anti-Donald Trump stance and saying he would vote for the former president.\n\nA week after telling CNN he did not cast a ballot for Trump in 2016 or 2020 and that he didn’t plan to support him in 2024, Trump’s first assassination attempt changed his mind. After winning his party’s primary, Cox faced a crowded field of opponents in the general election including Democrat Brian King. Cox emerged victorious.\n\nUtah voters also elected Cox governor in 2020. This victory came after he served two terms as lieutenant governor under GOP Gov. Gary Herbert. Cox also briefly represented District 58 in the state’s House of Representatives in 2013 before Herbert appointed him lieutenant governor.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHarris wins Nebraska ‘blue dot’\n\nKamala Harris has won Nebraska’s 2nd congressional district. She is awarded 1 electoral vote.\n\nNebraska awards its electoral votes via statewide tally, in addition to congressional districts, making it different from other states that award only one pot of electoral votes. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, was born in Nebraska and grew up in the state. He campaigned several times in the Cornhusker State, hoping to appeal to voters.\n\nDemocrats have won Nebraska’s 2nd congressional district, which is in the Omaha area, both in the 2008 and 2020 presidential elections.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nWashington elects Democrat Bob Ferguson as governor\n\nWashington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, defeated Republican former U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert and will become the state’s next governor.\n\nEvergreen State voters first elected Ferguson attorney general in 2012. He won reelection in 2016 and 2020. His gubernatorial campaign centered on issues including the opioid epidemic, civil rights, and the environment.\n\nThe race pitted Ferguson against Reichert, an Air Force Reserve veteran and longtime police officer.\n\nIn the state’s crowded nonpartisan primary earlier this year, Ferguson received 44.9% of the vote and Reichert placed second with 27.5%.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan Harris still win? Harris campaigns says it remains hopeful about ‘blue wall’ as path narrows\n\nThe Harris campaign late Tuesday insisted it remains hopeful about the vice president’s ability to sweep the three so-called “blue wall” states – a sign they acknowledge winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan might be Harris’ only remaining path to win the election.\n\n“We have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in an email to campaign staff. “And we feel good about what we’re seeing.”\n\nHarris, however, is underperforming among Black and Latino voters, two core Democratic constituencies, which has the potential to doom her chances in all three “blue wall” states, according to exit polls. Trump is the projected winner in North Carolina and is ahead in votes tallied in Georgia. If Harris loses both, she would need to win the trifecta of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan to beat Trump.\n\nAs signs of hope for Harris, O’Malley Dillon said turnout in Philadelphia and Bucks County have exceeded the campaign’s expectations. In Michigan, the campaign said it has seen high turnout in Detroit. And in Wisconsin, O’Malley Dillon pointed to uncounted votes in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHarris picks up New Mexico\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris has won the state of New Mexico. She is awarded 5 electoral votes.\n\nDemocrats have carried the state in presidential elections since 1992, except for 2004 when then-President George W. Bush was seeking reelection.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nDonald Trump wins North Carolina\n\nDonald Trump has won the battleground state of North Carolina, the first swing state to be called on Election Day.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump wins Iowa\n\nRepublican Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa. He is awarded 6 electoral votes.\n\nOnce considered a battleground state, Iowa opted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. The state has leaned more Republican in recent years, and it now has an all-Republican congressional delegation. Still, Iowa holds a special title during primary season: It traditionally holds a first-in-the-nation caucus in presidential primaries.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris clinches Colorado\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris has won the state of Colorado. She is awarded 10 electoral votes.\n\nDemocrats have carried Colorado since 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama won. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the state by a double-digit margin.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nUnion members split for Harris, Fox reports\n\nVoters belonging to a labor union or who live in households with labor union members broke in favor for Harris over Trump, according to a Fox News analysis, in partnership with the Associated Press.\n\nUnion members themselves favored Harris 57% to 39% for Trump, while those living with union members went for the vice president 50% compared to 46% for the former president.\n\nThis slice of the electorate was seen as potentially make-or-break for the campaigns heading into Election Day, with a particularly heavy union presence in the swing states. Traditionally Democratic supporters, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters caused uproar by deciding earlier this year to endorse neither candidate.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Sara Chernikoff\n\nIs Oregon a swing state?\n\nOregon is not typically an area where presidential candidates will battle it out. The Beaver State's eight electoral votes are reliably blue, having voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 1988 by increasingly large margins.\n\nIn 2020, the state voted for President Joe Biden by over a 16 point margin and in 2016 for Hillary Clinton by 11 points.\n\nThe polls close in Oregon at 11 p.m. ET and could start to be released as early as 10 p.m.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nMore:Americans take their children to the polls as voters decide the next US president\n\nMike Kehoe is Missouri’s next governor\n\nMissouri voters elected Republican Lieutenant Gov. Mike Kehoe their next governor.\n\nKehoe emerged from his party’s crowded field as the Republican nominee to succeed his boss, Gov. Mike Parson. He won in the general election against Democratic nominee Crystal Quade.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kehoe made news for refusing to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election after he previously said people need to “accept the results.”\n\nHe was first appointed lieutenant governor in 2018 after serving in the Missouri State Senate since 2011.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nGOP Gov. Greg Gianforte wins second term in Montana\n\nMontana voters reelected Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte to serve a second term.\n\nGianforte first assumed Montana’s highest office in 2021 with a decisive victory. This year, he handily defeated his Republican challenger, Tanner Smith, in the primary.\n\nBefore serving as governor, Gianforte worked as a businessman and founded five companies. He was elected to represent Montana’s at-large congressional district in 2017 and shortly after pled guilty to assaulting a reporter. A USA TODAY analysis from 2019 labeled Gianforte the richest member of the 116th Congress.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRepublican Kelly Ayotte is New Hampshire’s next governor\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who earned the current GOP governor’s endorsement, will assume New Hampshire highest office after her opponent conceded Tuesday night.\n\nAyotte represented The Granite State in the U.S. Senate from 2011 to 2017. A former prosecutor, she served New Hampshire as its first female attorney general from 2004 to 2009 before her election to Congress.\n\nAfter easily winning her party’s primary, Ayotte faced off against Democrat Joyce Craig in the general election. The race became one of the country’s most competitive gubernatorial matchups.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nFlorida abortion rights ballot measure, Amendment 4, fails\n\nThe ballot measure that would have enshrined abortion in the state constitution failed to meet the 60% threshold to pass. The amendment received approximately 57% approval, according to the Florida Department of State election results page.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted about the amendment's failure in a post on X on Sunday night.\n\n\"With polls now closed in Florida — Amendment 3 has failed. Amendment 4 has failed,\" DeSantis wrote on X a little after 8 p.m.\n\n– Ana Goñi-Lessan\n\nNorth Dakota elects Republican Kelly Armstrong governor\n\nRepublican Kelly Armstrong will be North Dakota’s next governor.\n\nThe race to fill the state’s highest office began when Gov. Doug Burgum announced he would not seek reelection after ending his bid for the White House. Armstrong has represented North Dakota’s at-large congressional district in the House of Representatives since 2019.\n\nHe launched his campaign for governor the day after Burgum’s announcement and won the Republican primary comfortably in June. He faced Democrat Merrill Piepkorn in the general election.\n\nWhen he won his congressional seat in 2018, Armstrong’s federal financial disclosure form detailed income from hundreds of North Dakota oil wells and a financial relationship with two state oil producers, ProPublica reported. Those ties may matter. As governor, he is set to chair two state bodies that regulate the energy industry.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDemocrat Matt Meyer is Delaware’s next governor\n\nDemocrat Matt Meyer has defeated Republican Mike Ramone and will become Delaware’s next governor.\n\nA lawyer, businessman, and former teacher, Meyer has served as New Castle County Executive since 2017. Despite opposition from the state Democratic party’s leadership, including Gov. John Carney, Meyer won the party primary earlier this year.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nState-by-state election results\n\nFind all your state-by-state live results here:\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | District of Columbia | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming\n\nExit polls: Gender gap persists, economy and democracy top issues\n\nA gender gap between voters who support Kamala Harris and former Donald Trump remains among voters who hit the polls on Tuesday, according to exit polls.\n\nMore than half (54%) of Harris’ supporters are women, with 44% men, according to national exit polls from CNN. Among Trump, 54% of his supporters are men while 43% are women.\n\nThe former president was also able to cut into Democrats’ support among Latino voters – especially among Latino men.\n\nExit polls show that 53% of Latino voters support Harris while 45% support Trump. In 2020, President Joe Biden had the support of 65% of Latino voters compared to Trump at 32%, according to a CNN exit poll from 2020. More than half (54%) of Latino men support Trump but only 45% support Harris. But 59% of Latino men supported Biden in 2020, while 36% of Latino men supported Trump, according to 2020 exit polls.\n\nThe state of democracy and the economy were the biggest concerns on the minds of voters as they headed to the polls on Tuesday, according to a series of exit polls. More than one-third of voters in a CNN exit poll said democracy was their top issue, while about three in 10 cited the economy. Abortion and immigration were next on voters’ list of concerns.

Kramer also provided legal assistance to state legislators developing Georgia’s controversial 2021 election law, which led the Major League Baseball Association to relocate its All-Star Game that year.\n\nWillis leapt to national fame for her office's investigation and indictment of Trump, who is facing felony state charges for allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia and participating in a “criminal enterprise.” Trump has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris supporters await results at Howard University election night party in 'the Yard'\n\nAs the polls closed on the East Coast, a hip hop and Gospel party was underway at “the Yard” at Howard University in Washington, D.C., the historically Black university where Kamala Harris went to undergrad.\n\nThe Howard University Gospel Choir gave a rendition of “Oh Happy Day.” A DJ played Kirk Franklin’s “Stomp.” A large screen showed sweeping images of the crowd that awaits Harris, the first Black and Asian woman to lead a major party’s presidential ticket. If elected, Harris would be the first graduate of an HBCU to become president.\n\nHoward University president Ben Vinson III told students and alumni who gathered to support her at the event, “Here, we know our history, we know our importance, we know the contributions we can make to the world. And we know that completing the work of America, and completing the work of democracy, entails the knowledge born in institutions like these, pillars for higher education, that mold citizens of the world.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocrats gather at historic Manuel's Tavern in Atlanta to await election results\n\nTucked away in Atlanta, Georgia sits Manuel's Tavern, an unassuming bar that has long been a fixture for Democrats. Former President Jimmy Carter first announced his gubernatorial campaign at the bar; Barack Obama is another one of its famous patrons.\n\nDemocrats gathered again at Manuel's Tavern on Election Night. The crowd spilled out into the parking lot, where hundreds of people anxiously awaited results. Gene Webster, 84, was among the crowd outside the tavern. She cast her first ballot in 1960 during the race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. But it was her vote for Kamala Harris, cast on the first day of early voting, that she said meant the most.\n\n\"I love Kamala Harris,\" Webster said, \"I love her positions and what she plans on doing as president.\" It also helped that Harris is a fellow sister of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest Black sorority, Webster laughed. But it was Harris' focus on the economy that most appealed to Webster, like the Democrat's proposed loans for small businesses and new home owners.\n\n\"My son is a small business owner. My grandson is about to buy his first home,\" she said. \"Harris' economic policies would really touch my life all the way around.\"\n\n– Melissa Cruz\n\nTrump clinches Ohio\n\nRepublican Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. He is awarded 17 electoral votes.\n\nJD Vance, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, serves as senator for the state. Trump won Ohio both in 2016 and 2020. Ohio is often considered a bellwether that typically votes for the winner of the presidential election, with 2020 being the first time in the last 14 elections that it didn’t vote for the president.\n\nThe state was also at the center of a debate on immigration in recent months after both Trump and Vance promoted false rumors that Haitian migrants were eating the pets of their neighbors in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump claims Texas\n\nRepublican Donald Trump has won the state of Texas, according to CNN and Fox News.

Along with the 417,000 Fulton County residents who voted early and 26,000 who cast absentee ballots, the 2024 turnout reached over half a million voters in Fulton County alone.\n\n“These numbers surpass the total turnout for the 2020 election,” Williams said.\n\nShe also thanked the elections workers who operated polls, as well as phone lines and other services, to ensure that the election process went smoothly at all 177 precincts.\n\n“Despite a few attempted disruptions, our staff and poll workers remained steadfast in their commitment to ensure a smooth process,” Williams said.\n\nFulton County Police Chief W. Wade Yates said that 32 precincts were targeted with bomb threats on Election Day. Some of the threats were called into 911 centers, some were called in to the precincts themselves and others were emailed in. Only five of those threats were deemed credible and resulted in evacuations. The hours at those five locations were extended by an emergency court order to ensure that voters were able to cast their ballots.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nJosh Stein defeats Mark Robinson in North Carolina governor’s race, networks report\n\nDemocrat Josh Stein defeated Republican Mark Robinson in North Carolina, the country’s most high-profile governor’s race, according to Fox News and NBC News.\n\nThe battle between Stein, the state attorney general, and Robinson, the lieutenant governor, was one of the most expensive in the 2024 cycle and a defining matchup between a Southern Democrat and a red-meat Republican popular with the “Make America Great Again” crowd.\n\nIt was expected to be the country’s most competitive governor’s race before major scandal plagued the Robinson campaign.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nAll eyes on Georgia election results, North Carolina election votes\n\nWhile a few Southern states have opted for Donald Trump, all eyes are waiting to see tallies from the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina.

James said he had to cast a provisional ballot because he registered in north Georgia before moving to the Atlanta area.\n\nJames said he voted for Harris, although he was concerned that Harris hasn't put enough effort into issues related to Palestine. He also had concerns about her track record as a former prosecutor, saying he read that she put people behind bars who didn't need to be there, for example for a \"small drug charge for weed and simple things like that.\"\n\n\"But I think her policies on abortion and cutting taxes and getting – helping middle class families is also very important as well,\" James said. He didn't have a prediction of what will happen.\n\n\"Everyone wants a slice of the cake, if that makes any sense,\" he said. \"Depending on the president and their policies and who they back, it really just will shift, I guess, the paradigm of the country for the next three to four years.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRepublican Phil Scott reelected governor in Vermont\n\nVermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott will serve a fifth term in the state’s highest office.\n\nVoters in The Green Mountain State first elected Scott their governor in 2016. He won reelection in 2018, 2020, and 2022. This year, he ran unopposed in the Republican primary. He defeated his Democratic challenger, Esther Charlestin, in the general election. A moderate Republican, Scott has focused on issues of affordability and economic growth.\n\nIn a rare bipartisan partnership, Scott previously served three terms as the state’s lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2017 alongside Democratic Gov.

The campaign said it is sending surrogates – and working to extend voting hours – to college areas like Lehigh University in Lehigh, Pennsylvania, where college students have reported standing in seven-hour lines to vote.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nCan U.S. territories vote in presidential elections?\n\nWell, it's complicated. The United States' five territories -- American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico -- may be able to participate in the presidential primaries, but that's the extent of their involvement in the election cycle.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution awards it's president based on the Electoral College which allots votes to states to then give to the candidate who wins their state. Despite allowing these five territories to vote in presidential primaries and sending delegates to both party conventions, they are not granted Electoral College votes and therefore cannot have a say in who is president on the final ballots.\n\nWhether residents of these territories can cast a ballot for Election Day is dependent on if they hold formal residency in one of the 50 states or Washington, D.C.\n\nNotably, over two-thirds of Puerto Ricans live in the states and D.C., over half a million of them being concentrated in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The voting bloc has been in the spotlight since Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally two weeks ago has been criticized as racist for a comment made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, calling Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage.\"\n\n– Anna Kaufman and Sam Woodward\n\nLegal fights and long, long lines:Live updates on Election Day snags\n\nWill lawmakers and congressional candidates commit to upholding the 2024 results? We asked\n\nWith nearly half of the country's Republicans and a quarter of Democrats questioning whether next month's presidential election will be fair, USA TODAY wanted to know where members of the next Congress stand on the issue.\n\nSo, we surveyed all 382 members of the House and 91 Senators who are either running for re-election or would still be in office in January, asking whether they would uphold the 2024 presidential election results, regardless of the winner. We also polled 747 candidates running for the House and Senate whose names are on the ballot this year. Those who agreed to uphold the results without conditions include:\n\n117 sitting House members, 14 of whom are Republicans and 103 are Democrats;\n\n27 sitting Senate members, 2 of whom are Republicans and 25 Democrats;\n\n236 candidates for House and Senate, including 130 Democrats, 45 Republicans and 61 third-party candidates.\n\nHere’s a full breakdown of how lawmakers responded.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAbout 10 Georgia precincts to stay open late after Russia bomb threat: Raffensperger\n\nApproximately 10 Georgia voting precincts will be staying open late, each for about 20-40 minutes, as a result of a bomb threat that came from Russia in the morning, according to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\n\nThe precincts are in various counties, including Atlanta's Fulton County and Atlanta-adjacent Gwinnett County, Raffensperger said. The normal time for polling locations to close across the Peach State is 7 p.m. EDT.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the FBI announced that bomb threats appearing to come from Russian email domains targeted polling sites in several states. None of them were determined to be credible.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAllan Lichtman reaffirms prediction, calls out Nate Silver\n\nHistorian Allan Lichtman, who has accurately predicted nine of the last 10 presidential elections, reaffirmed his prediction that Harris will narrowly defeat Trump. Lichtman also called out fellow predictor Nate Silver, despite him sharing the same projected result.\n\n“Nate Silver’s compilation of polls is so unreliable that he now says that who will win the presidency is down to luck,” Lichtman wrote in a post on X Monday.\n\nSilver's final 2024 presidential election forecast had Harris as the winner by a razor-thin margin after she won 40,012 of the total 80,000 simulations.\n\nLichtman on the other hand uses his \"13 Keys to the White House\" system to determine who will win the election. He voiced his confidence in his system in a separate X post on Monday writing, \"Mark my words… The Keys will be right again!\"\n\n-- Jonathan Limehouse and Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhere is Biden on Election Day?\n\nThe president will be in the White House this evening to watch election results start rolling in.\n\nOnce the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Biden has no public events scheduled for the remainder of Election Day.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump backers prepare to party in West Palm Beach\n\nTrump aides are putting the finishing touches on an election watch party in a cavern-like ballroom at the Palm Beach Convention Center.\n\nAmerican flags, pro-Trump signs, and bunting are in place; so are theater-size screens with boxes featuring different news networks.\n\nThe sound system is being tested with Trump's playlist.\n\nA few dozen Trump supporters started trickling in shortly after 4 p.m,. staking out the front row at the railing in front of the stage. \"The gang's all here?\" someone shouted.\n\nNow all we need is some results.\n\nTrump himself is at Mar-a-Lago, about three-and-a-half miles away, hoping to appear at the watch party late tonight or early tomorrow morning.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nHarris visits DNC headquarters and thanks supporters on Election Day\n\nVice President Kamala Harris made a surprise visit to a phone bank organized by the Democratic National Committee in Washington D.C., and thanked volunteers there.\n\nAccording to pool reports, she walked in with a box of Doritos.\n\n\"This is just the best, best, best and I thank you all very much,\" she said. Then picked up a phone and spoke to the person on the other end: “I am well,\" she said. \"Have you voted already? You did? Thank you!\"\n\nShe spoke to another person, who appeared to be a kid, and said: “It's Kamala Harris. Waiting for you to grow 10 years more.\" Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nClosest elections in US history\n\nThe contest between Harris and Trump is remarkably close, with polls showing razor-thin margins in key swing states. A nail-biter of a race is hardly new, though.\n\nIn 2000, when Al Gore faced off against George W. Bush, the race was eventually decided by just 537 votes after the Supreme Court ended a legal battle lasting over 30 days.\n\nOther close elections include 1876, in which Rutherford B. Hayes won by just one electoral vote, the smallest margin in American history, and 1916 in which Woodrow Wilson bested Charles Evans Hughes in a contest that came down to California.\n\n-Anna Kaufman\n\nTrump pays brief visit to his campaign headquarters\n\nWhile waiting for actual election returns, Trump paid a brief visit to his national campaign headquarters, talking up turnout and predicting victory.\n\n\"It should be good,\" Trump told members of his staff.\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump accompanied the former president and also lauded the staff. \"Thank you so much for all of your support,\" she said.\n\nAs he did after voting earlier in the day, Trump said it's \"crazy\" to realize that it could be days before a winner is determined. He again called for all \"paper ballots,\" although those take longer to tabulate.\n\nIn an event, Trump told aides and volunteers that he is looking forward to what he hopes will be a victory party.\n\n\"I'll be seeing you tonight,\" Trump said.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nA trip down memory lane:What a year! 12 months of the craziest election campaign in memory.\n\n700,000 more Georgians have voted by 2:30pm EDT on Election Day\n\nGeorgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a press conference that 700,000 Georgians had voted on Tuesday by about 2:30 p.m. EDT. If the rate of voting holds for the rest of the day, about 1.1 million Georgians will have voted on Tuesday, he said.\n\nAlready, more than 4 million voters in the state during the early voting period that closed Friday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDoes Puerto Rico vote for president?\n\nWhile Puerto Rico conducts primary elections and sends delegates to both the RNC and DNC, the U.S. territory has no electoral college votes so does not weigh in during the general election. However, residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens, so those who have moved from the territory to one of the 50 states or Washington D.C., can cast a ballot for president.\n\nA large number of Puerto Ricans live in the states, roughly 5.8 million, according to the Pew Research Center. They represent the second-largest population of Hispanic origin living in America and a sizeable voting bloc.\n\nThe other U.S. territories -- Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa -- also do not have any electoral votes.\n\n-- Anna Kauffman\n\nTrump votes in Florida: 'I feel very confident'\n\nTrump, voting Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida, said he was feeling \"very confident.\" The Republican candidate, accompanied by former first lady Melania Trump, said he believed “Republicans have shown up in force.”\n\nTrump devoted part of his post-voting comments to two media institutions: Fox News and Oprah Winfrey.Trump said Winfrey “should be ashamed of herself” for supporting Harris, while Fox should be ashamed of itself for broadcasting Winfrey’s comments in support of his opponent. People used to think that Fox was pro-Trump, the television-watching candidate said.\n\n“They’re not pro-Trump at all,” he said. “They’ve put Oprah on all morning long. That’s all I see is Oprah.”\n\n− David Jackson\n\nCongressional election 2024 live updatesWho will have control of the House, Senate?\n\nOn Election Day, Harris stops by a radio show\n\nHarris participated Tuesday in “The Big Tigger Morning Show on V-103,” a radio show based out of Atlanta, and talked about her “lived experience” with Black men.\n\n“This is not something I just figured out − that we still have a lot to do to recognize the disparities in what Black men receive and what they are due in terms of access to opportunity,” she said.\n\nWhile about 90% of Black men voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, a New York Times/Siena College poll in October showed 78% were planning to vote for Harris now. About 15% of Black likely voters said they planned to vote for Trump.\n\nShe talked about her “opportunity economy agenda that for Black men,” which includes a $20,000 forgivable loan for entrepreneurs for start-up expenses. She also said she wants to increase access to health screening for colon and prostate cancer.\n\n“Our men have a higher rate of those cancers,” she said. “So my focus for Black men ranges from access to capital to what we need to do for health care.”\n\nWho is more likely to turn out?Analyzing the gender gap\n\nWhat happens if there’s an Electoral College tie?\n\nIn the unlikely event that there is a 269 to 269 tie in the Electoral College, a complicated process will begin to churn. First, the newly elected members of the House of Representatives would gather to vote for the new president. Here, each state’s delegation would get one vote. For example, California’s 52 House of Representatives members would have one vote the same as Wyoming’s single member.\n\nThen, the Senate would gather to vote for the new vice president, so theoretically, a Harris-Vance or a Trump-Walz administration could be possible. In the Senate, every senator would have their own vote with a simple majority needed to choose a winner.\n\n− Fernando Cervantes Jr.\n\nAn American election, with international implications\n\nAmericans aren't the only ones watching the U.S. presidential election closely. The next occupant of the White House will have an impact on global trade, security partnerships, diplomatic ties and could, for example, bring in more protectionist trade policies, shift global security dynamics and accelerate (or not) outcomes for wars from Gaza to Ukraine.\n\nOne country that's always watching: Russia. Moscow, in the form of Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, had this message for the next U.S. president: \"It would be logical for the White House host, whoever he or she may be, to focus on solving his or her country's problems instead of seeking adventures tens of thousands of miles from American shores.\"\n\nSeparately, the Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on allegations made by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Tuesday that a bomb threat made against a polling place in his state was of Russian origin.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat states are considered swing states?\n\nThe battleground states where some of the closest races are expected include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those states have consistently shown polling within the margin of error, which describes how accurately the survey results are representative of the entire population. When a candidate's lead is \"inside\" the margin of error, it is considered a \"statistical tie,\" according to Pew Research Center.\n\nPew has found the majority of pollsters have changed their methods since the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, where Trump's performance was significantly underestimated.\n\nYou can see the results of recent polling in swing states here.\n\n− Kinsey Crowley and James Powel\n\nAmericans won't miss those campaign ads\n\nThere was one thing many American voters could agree to celebrate on Tuesday: the end of political advertising.\n\n“I’m just ready to stop seeing these ads 24/7,” said Jacob Kossler, a 24-year-old software engineer who voted at the Cobb County Civic Center in Georgia. “I’m just trying to watch a football game without having to see two back-to-back ads … hearing about how someone is the devil.”\n\nThe 2024 federal election is on track to be the costliest ever, with spending near $16 billion, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit organization that tracks money in U.S. politics.\n\nPranav Patel, 42, of Warrington Township, Pa., said he’s put off by the onslaught of outreach from both campaigns. Patel showed USA TODAY more than a dozen missed calls he received from campaigns during the two hours before he went to vote.\n\n“That's not going to have me change my mind who I'm going to vote for,” he said.\n\n− Deb Barfield Berry and Sarah Wire\n\n'E-Day’ may not be the end of this election\n\nAmericans eager for the 2024 presidential race to end may not get their wish Tuesday as both camps are prepared for a prolonged election battle. The Harris campaign told reporters Monday the country might not know the election result \"for several days,\" given the different count rules in the critical swing states. In North Carolina, where Trump defeated then-candidate Joe Biden by 73,697 votes, or 1.3%, four years ago, the count could drag on.\n\n\"No one here actually expects full resolution on E-Day,\" Todd Zimmer, co-founder of Down Home Carolina, a progressive-leaning nonprofit group, told USA TODAY. In a memo provided to USA TODAY, the group, which focuses on organizing in rural areas, advised its canvassers to be ready to help fix voter’s provisional ballots in case of a recount scenario where those votes could be challenged.\n\nZimmer said many activists, whether liberal or conservative, anticipate days or possibly weeks of administrative jockeying and legal maneuvering over election rules.\n\n\"It almost seems the foregone conclusion is we expect a recount or some kind of post-election activity to secure the popular vote,\" Zimmer said.\n\nIn Nevada, a first-time voter is first in line\n\nIn Nevada, waiting voters in Reno applauded after workers gave first-time voter Tyler Hilliard, 18, a certificate to mark the occasion. Hilliard, accompanied by his dad, was first in line and first to finish casting a ballot on the Washoe County electronic voting machine, finishing minutes after the polls opened at 7 a.m.\n\n“It’s kind of heavy, to be honest,” Hilliard said. “I feel pride. I’m feel like I’m lucky I have the right to vote.”\n\nHilliard said he’s still struggling with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and voted for candidates he felt would best support mental health. Watching with teary eyes, dad Tim Hilliard, 47, said he was proud of his son for getting up early to vote. Tim Hilliard said he voted by mail earlier, was confident his ballot had been properly tracked and counted and that it was important to trust the system.\n\n“I do think we need to accept the results either way,\" he said. \"I do wish legislators would learn how to compromise. Until we can get off this red-blue mess, we aren’t doing to learn what compromise is.”\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nJoe Rogan, Harrison Ford, other celebs offer endorsements\n\nCelebrity endorsements have been steadily coming in throughout the campaign trail, and a few well-known names made their choices knowns this week. Among them were actor Harrison Ford, who said he backs Harris, and podcaster Joe Rogan, who favors Trump.\n\nMedia personality Megyn Kelly endorsed Trump during one of his Pennsylvania rallies on Monday, saying the former president \"will be a protector of women.\" William Dwight McKissic Sr., the Texas mega-church pastor, endorsed Harris on social media, saying he wants a president who \"would not instigate, finance, participate in, or even attend, a gathering such as the Jan 6 insurrection.\"\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nIn crucial Pennsylvania, this voter wants nation to unite\n\nAt the Grace Lutheran Church in Pottsdown, Pa., campaign signs lead straight to the door of the church. A line of voters wound around the corner. Lee Ann Barkasi, 67, of Pottsdown said she voted for Harris and said she is ready to see the country come together.\n\n“There's so much hatred,\" she said. \"I was standing in line in front of someone today, and the things they were saying, they were cursing, and it's not necessary. We're supposed to love one another.\"\n\nShe doesn’t know how the country will come back together though. But she said people need to accept the election results regardless of who wins.\n\n“My neighbor across the street is Trump'.'\" she said. \"I'm Kamala, but she's allowed to believe or vote for who she wants to. ... Everybody's entitled to their opinion.”\n\n− Sarah Wire\n\nTrump-Harris polling remains close\n\nSome of the last polls reflected what they have shown for months − a very close race.\n\n∎ Harris is leading former Trump by 2 percentage points in the latest Ipsos Core Political poll released Monday.\n\n∎ The race is even tighter in the final TIPP Tracking Poll released Tuesday, which showed Trump with just a .3-point lead on Harris.\n\n∎ Harris has a four-point lead over Trump in the final national poll released by Marist on Monday.\n\n∎ Harris and Trump are in a statistical tie in the latest Forbes/HarrisX national poll released late Monday, with Harris holding a razor-thin 49%-48% lead.\n\n− Eric Lagatta and James Powel\n\nDixville Notch voting reflects US division\n\nPolling in the New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch opened at midnight Monday with the National Anthem played on an accordion. All six of its residents voted immediately, and Trump and Harris each won three votes. Four years ago Biden swept all five votes in the unincorporated township 10 miles east of Vermont. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton claimed four votes to two for Trump and one for Libertarian Gary Johnson.\n\nNo need to leave the polls open all day in this town, they close when \"all have voted.\"\n\nWhere is Ivanka Trump?\n\nAfter campaigning vigorously for her father, former President Donald Trump, during his two previous bids for the White House, Ivanka Trump has been absent from the campaign trail this time around. Although the Trump daughter did make an appearance during the Republican National Convention in July, she had announced her intention to stay away from the race after her father announced his candidacy in 2022.\n\n“This time around I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family,” she said in a statement.\n\nFirst gentleman hopeful Doug Emhoff closes campaign with Lady Gaga\n\nDoug Emhoff closed out his campaign for wife Kamala Harris on Monday night with a celebrity-studded rally in Pennsylvania. After a brief performance and speech, Lady Gaga introduced Emhoff as the soon-to-be first gentlemen. Emhoff echoed what has been his main campaign riff: Harris was the right person to trust with his family when they married, and is the right person for America right now.\n\n“My wife cares about what you’re going through, she understands what’s in your way,” Emhoff told the crowd.\n\nHarris’ husband has been an energetic campaign companion for the candidate. Alongside VP-hopeful Tim Walz, Emhoff has sparked a larger conversation around masculinity in a race increasingly defined by gender.\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nVance calls Harris 'trash,' derides her for Biden's garbage gaffe\n\nIn an election eve rally, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance referred to Harris, as \"trash\" that needs to be taken out. During an appearance in Atlanta, Ohio's junior senator first criticized a statement by President Joe Biden last week in which he appeared to label supporters of Trump as \"garbage.\" Biden said he was condemning comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who had derided Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage\" at a Trump rally a few days earlier.\n\nVance returned to the moment on Monday, using it to knock Harris, rather than Biden.\n\n“In two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C.,” Vance said, “and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris.”\n\n− Josh Meyer and Savannah Kuchar\n\nGeorgia official says 'smooth sailing' at the polls\n\n\"So far, it's just been smooth sailing, by and large,\" Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said of voting on Election Day in the Peach State at a Tuesday morning press conference.\n\nThe average line time in Georgia is currently two minutes and the average check-in on electronic poll pads is taking just 49 seconds, he said.\n\nGeorgia already saw huge turnout during its early voting period, which closed Friday, with more than 4 million people casting votes. In 2020, about 2.7 million voters cast ballots during the early voting period.\n\nRaffensperger suggested short wait times in the state were boosting voters' willingness to make their voices heard. \"It's just solid, steady, and it's more than you would think because the lines are moving so quickly – people in and out in less than 10 minutes,\" he said Tuesday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nA little Election Day humor\n\nIn the midst of one of the most divisive and polarizing elections in recent memory, some Americans want to make their neighbors laugh again. In Goffstown, New Hampshire, Andy Brown decided to plant his own politcial lawn sign: “Andy Brown: Not running for anything. Just wanted a sign.”\n\nSoon a friend of a friend surprised Brown by adding another sign \"paid for by friends of Andy Brown.\" So, Brown doubled down on the joke and put up a 3-foot-by-5-foot custom banner with a new campaign slogan. “I like big signs, I cannot lie” − a creative riff on Sir Mix-A-Lot lyrics.\n\nIn Arvada, Colorado, Mollie, a Labrador, is running for president against her next-door neighbor Chloe, a terrier.

A lawsuit by North Carolina Republicans, for example, blocked University of North Carolina Chapel Hill students from using their mobile digital IDs to vote after the State Board of Elections approved the use.\n\nAll voters are still allowed to vote with or without a photo ID, according to the board, but any voter who cannot show identification must fill out a form explaining why before casting a provisional ballot that is susceptible to being challenged before the final tally is certified.\n\nMatt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina GOP, said the state’s record 4.2 million in-person early voting ballots undercuts “radical” Democrat’s criticisms about the law’s impact.\n\n“We trust the voters of North Carolina and their common sense belief that identification should be required,” he said.\n\nHow long after Election Day will we know who's president? Legal fights, long delays likely\n\nBoth major parties expect court battles over voter rolls, mail-in ballots and overseas ballots as polls show an incredibly tight contest between Harris and Trump. Election officials are on guard for equipment failures and software issues that snarled some local vote counts in prior elections – as well as violent threats that have infected the democratic process.\n\nTrump has refused to commit to accepting Tuesday’s results, and he and many of his supporters assert that only rampant fraud by non-citizen voters could explain a possible loss.

If elected, she will be the first U.S. president to graduate from a historically Black college and university (HBCU).\n\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign will host an election watch party in his home county on Nov. 5, but the event will not be at Mar-a-Lago. Instead, the festivities will take place at the Palm Beach County Convention Center. The venue swap suggests the campaign is expecting a crush of national and international media, donors and supporters for what his backers expect will be a victory celebration.\n\n− Antonio Fins and Terry Moseley\n\nAre banks, post offices open?Here's what we know\n\nBanks, schools, offices: What is open, closed on Election Day?\n\nWhile voters head to the polls, their children may be enjoying their day off as many schools nationwide are not open Tuesday because of safety concerns, because they are polling sites or because they recognize Election Day as a public holiday. Fourteen states have deemed Election Day a public holiday, according to the Monument Advancement Movement. Here is an overview of how states will handle school on Election Day.\n\nMany people will be trying to knock out regular day-to-day errands, such as picking up dry cleaning or going to the bank. Good news: Most banks are open. And the Postal Service will deliver mail.\n\nWhile Election Day is not a federal holiday, many state offices are closed and 24 states offices, plus the District of Columbia, offer paid time off to vote. Other states offer time off for voting but with no pay.\n\nAre schools closed?Here's what to know before polls open\n\nWhere do Harris, Trump stand in the polls?\n\nElection Day 2024 is here, and Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in the polls. In Real Clear Politics' average of national surveys, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage point, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican nominees are also close in the swing states. For example, Harris leads Trump 0.4 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.\n\nGot election questions? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for breaking news and exclusive analysis.\n\nWhere do Harris and Trump stand on key issues?\n\nAlthough Harris and Trump's visions for solving Americans’ largest problems differ, both have pledged to address inflation, lower taxes and support Israel in its war against Hamas. They have also both committed to ending federal taxes on tips.\n\nStill, Harris and Trump have seriously different pitches for the nation. They diverge most on climate change, reproductive rights and gun control. If you're still undecided between the Democratic and Republican nominees, check out USA TODAY's voter guide to see what Trump and Harris have said about major issues, in their own words.\n\nWhat time do the polls open and close?\n\nAcross the country, polling hours on Nov. 5 will vary by location.\n\nMost states will allow voters to cast their ballots from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. However, in some areas of Vermont, polls opened as early as 5 a.m., and in New York, polls will close as late as 9 p.m. Check with your state or local election office or its website to find the correct window when you can vote in your area.\n\nUSA TODAY’s Voter Guide details everything you need to know about making sure your voice is heard in this year’s general election.\n\nNation's capital increases security measures\n\nAt noon on the eve of Election Day, the familiar mix of tourists, locals, and government workers seeking fresh air on lunch hour milled as usual in Lafayette Square, next to the White House in downtown Washington, D.C. They were met with an unusual sight – a heavy, metal fence around 10 feet high surrounded the White House, the street in front and a bronze statue of former President Andrew Jackson astride his horse at the center of the park.\n\nThe Secret Service's decision to erect the fence ahead of Election Day left tourists frustrated and Americans on edge at the prospect of violence or unrest in the nation's capital amid an extraordinarily tight election.\n\nTo some, the fences were a bad omen ahead of an election that's been marked by threats of violence. \"You see all the fences around here, and you wonder,\" said Mike Longmeyer, 64, visiting the capital from Redlands, California.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nHow we got here\n\nIt's been a presidential campaign marked by shocking, historic moments. Trump faced two assassination attempts, including a devastating shooting at a rally over the summer where one attendee, Corey Comperatore, was killed.\n\nPresident Joe Biden became the first incumbent president in decades to not to seek a second term in office after a disastrous debate performance, clearing the way for Harris.\n\nWhat is the Electoral College?\n\nMillions of Americans will cast a vote for the next president of the United States but votes from the Electoral College are what send a candidate into office. The system grants electoral votes to the 50 states and the District of Columbia based on their population.\n\nThere are 538 electors nationwide and a candidate needs 270 of them to win the White House. Many states give all of their electoral votes to one candidate, in a winner-take-all system, but Maine and Nebraska can split their votes up.\n\nBecause of this voting structure, a candidate can win the election despite losing the popular vote, like Trump did in 2016.\n\n− Sarah Gleason\n\nHow long does it take to count votes?\n\nIt depends where you live. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting periods to strict voter ID laws.\n\nFor example, key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\nIf you’re looking for a comparison, in 2020, it took four days for all of the votes to be counted, resulting in Biden's victory on Nov. 7.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nWhen does the next president take office?\n\nThe next presidential inauguration day is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nEvery four years the ceremony takes place at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC.

Will it matter?", "text": "WASHINGTON - In his third race for the presidency, Republican nominee Donald Trump has never been in as good of a poll position as he is now - but he'll have to wait at least a week to find out whether it means anything.\n\nAs of Monday, Trump leads Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by as close a margin as possible - 0.1% - in the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. He trailed in the same survey by 7.5% four years ago against Joe Biden and 4.6% in 2016, the year he won the presidency against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe way Trump and his allies see it, the closer the polls in the popular vote, the better his chances to win enough states to capture the Electoral College and the presidency - and he outperformed the polls in both of his previous races.\n\nDemocrats say there is reason to doubt that will happen this time around. They said pollsters are compensating for what they call the \"hidden Trump voters\" of the previous two elections, and, if anything, they are oversampling Republicans and inflating Trump's numbers.\n\nRepublican candidates underperformed the polls in the 2022 congressional elections, Democrats said. And Trump consistently underperformed polls in a string of Republican primaries earlier this year.\n\n\"It's much more likely that - if there's a polling miss - it's going to favor us,\" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and polling analyst.\n\nThe apparent closeness of the race - and the uncertainty of the polls - is the reason both campaigns are urging their people to get themselves and others to the polls.\n\n\"Pretend you're one point down,\" Trump told supporters Sunday at his Madison Square Garden rally.\n\nHarris and allies have delivered similar messages to their voters, and the vice president has expressed confidence in the outcome.\n\n\"My internal polling is my instinct,” Harris told reporters while campaigning in Philadelphia. “I let the campaign people deal with all that other stuff, and I am responding to what I’m seeing.”\n\nShe added: “It’s very exciting, and the momentum is with us.\"\n\nThe battleground states that will decide the election - including the trio of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - are also quite close, and Trump backers believe that their \"hidden vote\" is still a big factor.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Real Clear Politics average gives Trump a lead of 0.5% - at this time eight years ago, he trailed Clinton in the Keystone State by 5 percentage points but nonetheless carried it, barely, on Election Day.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has an 0.1 point lead in the RCP average. Four years ago, Biden led the survey by 8.6 percentage points, while eight years ago, Clinton held a seven-point lead. Trump narrowly lost Michigan in 2020, and narrowly won it in 2016.\n\nAnd what about Wisconsin? Trump has a lead of 0.3 percentage points in the RCP average. Biden led the state by 6.4 points in the poll averaging four years ago, and barely won the state. Clinton led by 6 percentage points in 2016, and Trump barely won the state.\n\nTrump promotes - and exaggerates - his poll numbers, while Democrats project a different story when the voting is complete.\n\n\"Here is a prediction,\" said pro-Harris political commentator Matthew Dowd, speaking on the X social media site. \"Watch every one of poll aggregators/election predictors shift their models this week to favor Harris ...

When accounting for undecided voters, Harris’ overall support in New Hampshire increases to 51%, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll showed Harris with a lead with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points. The poll was conducted from Monday to Wednesday.\n\nThe new poll showed that 34% of those surveyed saw the economy as the top issue in the upcoming presidential election. Another 26% of those survey said housing affordability as the top issue, while 10% said threats to democracy.\n\nDemocrats have dominated New Hampshire in recent presidential elections, but Harris' support among voters is falling from what President Joe Biden had in 2020 when he won the state with 52.8% of the vote.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton just narrowly won the state over Trump, with 46.8% of the vote to his 46.5%, according to RealClear Polling.\n\nEmerson's new poll found that a majority of New Hampshire voters (53%) have a favorable view of Harris, while 47% have an unfavorable view of the vice president. Trump was found to have a 47% favorability rating in the state, with 53% of those surveyed having an unfavorable view of him.\n\n“Harris’ margin among women is similar to that of Biden in 2020 – however, male voters have shifted about two points toward Trump,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. “In addition, Harris is underperforming Biden’s 2020 support among independent voters, who break for Harris by 13 points, but broke for Biden by about double that amount.”\n\nHarris 50%, Trump 47% in ongoing poll coverage from Tipp\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Harris leads Republican presidential candidate Trump by three percentage points in Tipp's Tracking Poll as of Friday morning.\n\nThe poll of 1,260 likely voters conducted between Oct. 21 and Oct. 23 shows Harris leading 50% to 47% with a 2.8% margin of error.\n\nAccording to Tipp, both candidates have fluctuated in a range of three points over the last 10 days.\n\n\"This steady yet small margin suggests a volatile electorate, where every percentage point matters,\" Tipp noted.\n\nBloomberg swing state polling shows candidates in a tie\n\nThe candidates are statistically tied among likely voters in seven swing states, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll out Wednesday night.\n\nHarris barely leads Trump 49.1% to 48.5% across all swing states, within the one percentage point margin of error. The data was taken from a poll that surveyed 5,308 registered voters from Oct. 16 to Oct. 20 in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.\n\n\"Harris outperforms her rival in the poll on some personal attributes that may help her with those disaffected Republicans. When asked which candidate is best described as mentally fit, honest and compassionate, swing-state likely voters chose Harris by wide margins,\" Bloomberg reported, countered by findings that more voters find Trump experienced, patriotic and a strong leader.\n\nHistoric gap between men and women defines Harris v. Trump\n\nThe gender gap is getting wider and deeper, recent polling has continued to show.\n\nIn the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll, women decisively backed Harris, 53% to 36%. That's a mirror image of men's overwhelming support for Trump, 53% to 37%. If those margins hold until Election Day, it would be the biggest disparity since a gender gap emerged more than four decades ago, in 1980.\n\nMen and women alike volunteer that the economy and inflation are the most important issues this year, though men rank it higher, at 34% compared with 26% for women.\n\nAfter that, women rate abortion and women's rights a strong second, at 17%. Men rank abortion and women's rights at a distant seventh, cited by only 2%.\n\nThings to keep in mind about polling\n\nThe margin of error describes how accurately we can count on the survey results being representative of the entire population.\n\nWhen a candidate's lead is \"inside\" the margin of error, it is considered a \"statistical tie,\" according to Pew Research Center.\n\nPew has also found the majority of pollsters have changed their methods since the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, where Trump's performance was significantly underestimated.\n\nThis article has been updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Susan Page, Maya Marchel Hoff, Sudiksha Kochi, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/05/what-happened-2020-election-results-michigan/76081678007/", "title": "Who won Michigan in 2020 election?

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight lead over former president Donald Trump, as endorsements for Harris stack up ahead of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIf past election results are any indication, a majority of Livingston County voters will back Trump, and by a wide margin.\n\nOver the last century, voters in Livingston County — which historically has been a Republican stronghold — have backed a Democrat in presidential elections only twice.\n\n100 years of presidential votes in Livingston County\n\nBelow are the percentage of votes given to the Democratic and Republican nominees in Livingston County since 1924, according to the Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections:\n\n1924 — Calvin Coolidge, Republican: 67.3%; John Davis, Democrat: 28%\n\n1928 — Herbert Hoover, Republican: 72.8%; Alfred Smith, Democrat: 26.8%\n\n1932 — Franklin Roosevelt, Democrat: 50%; Herbert Hoover, Republican: 48.4%\n\nThe first Democrat in the last 100 years to win over Livingston County was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1932, the then-governor of New York and former state senator squeaked by with about 1.6% more votes in Livingston County than incumbent Republican President Herbert Hoover.

Eisenhower was a World War II hero and five-star general when he bested Democrat Adlai Stevenson, an ambassador to the United Nations, in a landslide victory in 1952. Stevenson had support from former President Harry Truman, who decided not to run again, but failed to embrace the emerging power of television like Eisenhower, who won 55% of the popular vote across the country and saw similar returns in Michigan.\n\nThe landslide was much larger in Livingston County.

Johnson, who served as vice president until the assassination of John F.

What our ...", "text": "Election Day is Tuesday and Michiganders are set to select a new U.S. senator and help determine who the next president is. With that in mind, here's what the Free Press' polls − as well as others − are telling us about who is expected to win.\n\nIn a nutshell, it looks to be close.\n\nUS presidential race: Harris vs. Trump poll in Michigan\n\nOur most recent poll, published Friday and done by EPIC-MRA of Lansing for the Free Press and its media partners, showed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris leading Republican former President Donald Trump in Michigan 48%-45% on the strength of growing support among Black voters and women.\n\nGiven that the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, it could mean that the race is a dead heat. But it also suggests a swing toward Harris and was the first time the Democratic candidate in the race for president led Trump in Michigan in EPIC-MRA's polls since last November.\n\nMichigan's 15 Electoral College votes, which will be awarded to whoever wins the popular vote for president in the state, could be crucial in determining the winner. Michigan is one of a handful of swing states that will determine the race, along with Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nOur poll was a bit better for Harris than some others. Websites that average out poll results suggest that Harris is ahead in Michigan anywhere from 1-percentage-point to about about 2 percentage points.\n\nAnd the race really looks to be tight across all the swing states. Michigan and Wisconsin look the most favorable for Harris; most of the others look more favorable for Trump. Pennsylvania and Nevada look like the closest right now. As to what that means, if Harris wins Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, she has her best chance of becoming president; if Trump wins all the other swing states and picks up one of those three, he has the best chance of winning.\n\nNationally, by the way, most of the averages have Harris ahead slightly.\n\nU.S. Senate race: Elissa Slotkin vs. Mike Rogers\n\nIn the race for Michigan's open U.S. Senate race, the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Holly, led Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake by 5 percentage points, 47%-42% in the Free Press' most recent poll.\n\nThat's just outside the poll's 4-percentage-point margin of error.\n\nSlotkin has generally led in most polls in the race to succeed Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who announced early last year she wouldn't run for a fifth six-year term. But the polls are close enough that even a minor polling error − or a surge of supporters at the ballot booth − could make it either an upset or a blowout for either candidate.\n\nOther election poll information\n\nBy the way, the Free Press has reported on a good deal of other polling data over recent weeks and months of this election season. Here's a handful of links to those stories:\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

But the all-important caveat is that he's down against the incumbent vice president by smaller margins than he faced in his first two general elections - both of which saw him score higher with actual voters than the ones who responded to pollsters.\n\nCertainly, Republicans are counting on what some pollsters have called the \"hidden Trump vote,\" although pollsters also say there's no certainty that group still exists. During a rally Wednesday in Reading, Pennsylvania, Trump claimed to have a poll showing him up 3 percentage points in the Keystone State, \"which probably means 10.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign, which lost the 2016 popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by a little more than 2 percentage points but won enough states to prevail in the Electoral College, also follows the theory that the closer the national polls in 2024, the better his chances to win more electoral votes.\n\nThat's not a given, the pollsters said.\n\nDuring this cycle, pollsters have changed their methodologies, in part to account for the “ hidden” Trump voters; including people who plan to vote for him but don’t want to say it publicly, or other supporters who are hard to find via traditional polling methods like telephone calls. Also, different groups of voters are showing more signs of increased participation in the election because of new issues, from anti-abortion laws to the rising cost of living.\n\n\"There are fundamentals in question that no one can answer until Election Day,\" said pollster Frank Luntz.\n\nAlso, the national polls are less important than individual state polls, and they're pretty much tied as well. Most polls are well within the margin of error in the seven key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and North Carolina.\n\n\"The only thing you can say for sure is that the seven swing states are all really close,\" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres. \"They're all effectively tied.\"\n\nAs of Friday, the Real Clear Politics average of recent national polls give Harris a 1.8% lead over Trump.\n\nAt this time four years ago, Democratic nominee Joe Biden had a lead of 10.3 percentage points over then-President Trump in the RCP national average; Biden won the popular and electoral votes by much smaller margins. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton led the RCP national average by 6%.\n\nBoth of those elections were much closer.\n\nBack in 2016, Clinton won the popular vote over Trump by 48.2% to 46.1% (the rest of the votes were scattered among third-party candidates, notably Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein). Trump, however, won the Electoral College by a margin of 304-227 (plus seven \"faithless electors\" who voted for other candidates).\n\nFour years later, Biden won the popular vote over Trump by a bigger margin, 51.3% to 46.9%. He also took the Electoral College by 306-232.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist who studies data, said pollsters have corrected previous methodology errors. He also noted that Republican candidates for the U.S. House and Senate underperformed polls in the 2022 midterm elections, and that Trump himself underperformed polling in this year's Republican presidential primaries.\n\nHarris and the Democrats are just as likely to have the hidden vote this time around, he said.\n\n\"The election is really close,\" Rosenberg said. \"Everything is in the margin of error ... But because we have meaningful financial and ground advantages, we are still more likely to pull it out.\"\n\nUltimately, no one really knows if this election will be more like 2016 or more like 2020 - or even something altogether different.\n\n\"I think it's somewhere in between,\" Luntz said. \"And that's why it's too close to call.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2024/10/28/michigan-electoral-college-national-popular-vote-clinton-trump/75700098007/", "title": "Opinion: Electoral College vs National Popular vote? Choose option C", "text": "James Alan Fox\n\nOp-ed contributor\n\nWith Election Day approaching, the race for the presidency is remarkably close, often characterized as a toss-up. General election polls, regardless of whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump is shown to be leading, that advantage is well within the margin of error.\n\nDespite the virtual tie, the Harris campaign characterizes her as the underdog — and that indeed is the case, because of the unusual method by which U.S. presidential elections are decided.\n\nIn an appearance on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, veteran Democratic strategist James Carville pointed out the recurring truth that in the existing landscape, the Electoral College is stacked against Democratic presidential nominees. “We have to win by three in the popular vote to win the Electoral College,” Carville said.\n\nThe bias exists in the method by which Electoral College votes are awarded to states — that is, according to size of their Congressional delegations. Votes for the number of Congressional districts (i.e., members of the House of Representatives) are apportioned appropriately based on population. But then two additional Electoral College votes given to each state (for each state's two senators) unfairly benefit smaller states.\n\nMichigan, for example, is 10 times more populous than South Dakota but has only five times as many Electoral College votes. A correction of two fewer votes per state (and Washington D.C.), making electoral vote counts (like House member counts) proportional to population, would have put Al Gore ahead of George W. Bush in the 2000 contest 225 v. 211), consistent with the popular vote.\n\nOpinion:Trump takes a shot at Detroit, in Detroit. The joke's on him.\n\nA complicated mechanism, a flawed approach\n\nEquating Electoral College votes to Congressional districts might seem, on the surface, to suggest that all states could just award their Electoral College votes district by district — as do Nebraska and Maine. However, that would only further incentivize gerrymandering in drawing district boundaries.\n\nThe two vote state-by-state reduction would not have altered the outcome of the 2016 election, in which Donald Trump received 77 more Electoral College votes than Hillary Clinton, even though her popular vote total exceeded his by a 2.9 million margin. Under a modified Electoral College system, Clinton would still have lost, taking 191 votes to Donald Trump’s 245.\n\nBut there is another problem. The “winner take all” approach to awarding Electoral College votes is flawed, as it treats a wide margin in one state the same as a narrow victory in another. Were the modified Electoral College votes for each state awarded to each candidate proportionate to state voting results (and rounding for the sake of simplicity), Clinton would have prevailed over Trump by 12 electoral votes, 224 v. 212.\n\nOne might respond, as many contend, that we should scrap the Electoral College altogether in favor of the popular vote total. And, in fact, a 224 to 212 doubly modified Electoral College victory for Clinton, in which she'd accrue 51.3% of these votes, is virtually identical to her 51.1% edge over Trump in the national popular vote.\n\nThese modifications should not be seen as an automatic advantage for the Democratic nominee, but instead for the candidate with the greatest support among voters. In 2004, the last time a Republican won the popular vote, George W. Bush beat John Kerry in the Electoral College by a 35-vote margin. Under the modified Electoral College system proposed here, Bush would still have prevailed, 225 to 211.\n\nEndorsements:Free Press picks for Michigan US House, Senate and House in Nov. 5 election\n\nPopular vs. population\n\nA 2023 Pew Research Center survey of 8,480 adults found nearly two-thirds of respondents believed that the Electoral College system should be replaced by the national popular vote, a level of unhappiness with current process that is as high as any time since at least 2000, when the divergent results of the Electoral College and the popular vote was a major topic of discussion.\n\nDespite its appeal in the minds of many, switching to the national popular vote would carry significant potential problems related to turnout.\n\nFor example, even with expanded absentee and early voting options, a significant number of Michiganders still cast ballots on Election Day. A blizzard in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula or even a soaking rainstorm in Detroit would suppress turnout, causing the state to be underrepresented in the national vote total. Conversely, a hotly contested referendum question in Florida or a gubernatorial down-ballot contest in New Hampshire would tend to boost voter turnout, causing state overrepresentation in the national popular vote.\n\nFor sake of fairness, states should be represented proportionately to their populations — and arguably not just their voter turnout. After all, those who cannot vote based on youth, infirmity or even institutionalization have a stake in the outcome. Population, not the popular vote, should rule.\n\nIn sum, modifying the Electoral College votes to be proportionate to state populations and allocating the votes for each state proportional to the voting results is the best way to ensure a fair voting process. Rather than eliminating the Electoral College, I say we just change its \"curriculum.\"\n\nJames Alan Fox is a Research Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University.

They're focusing on key swing states that flipped parties from 2016 to 2020, including Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. The candidates' campaigns are also keeping an eye on Nevada and North Carolina, which are considered battlegrounds this year.\n\nBecause the U.S. presidential race is determined by the Electoral College, not the popular vote, razor-thin margins in these states could decide the outcome of this year's election.

The poll of 794 registered Pennsylvania voters showed Trump leading 50% to Harris' 49%, which is within the poll's +/- 4.3 percentage point sample error.\n\nTrump is also leading Harris by one percentage point in a new poll by Emerson College released on Thursday. The poll of 860 likely voters in Pennsylvania found Trump leading 49% to Harris' 48% in the Keystone state. The poll showed Trump in the lead within the margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTrump is leading Harris by one percentage point in a separate poll by Emerson College also released on Thursday. The poll of 800 likely voters in Wisconsin showed Trump leading 49% to Harris' 48%, which is within its +/- 3.4 percentage point margin of error.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTrump is leading Harris by two percentage points in a third poll by Emerson College released Thursday. The poll of 950 likely voters in North Carolina found Trump leading 50% to Harris' 48%, which is also within its +/- 3.1 percentage point margin of error.\n\nAnother poll tells the same story. Trump is leading Harris by two percentage points in a poll by Marist College released Thursday. The survey of 1,226 likely voters in North Carolina showed Trump leading 50% to Harris' 48%. The poll showed Trump with a lead within the margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points.\n\nArizona\n\nTrump is leading Harris by one percentage point in a separate poll by Marist College released Thursday. The survey of 1,193 likely voters in Arizona found Trump leading 50% to Harris' 49%, which is within its margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTrump and Harris are neck-and-neck in a third poll by Marist College released Thursday. The poll of 1,193 likely voters in Georgia found the two candidates are tied 49% to 49%. The results are within the poll's margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points.\n\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/24"}]}

Blackmun said San Diego and Tijuana have also approached the USOC about a joint bid.\n\nBlackmun declined to identify the other cities considered as potential candidates, saying they preferred to keep it confidential for now. He said three cities, including Chicago, have formally said they are not interested in bidding.\n\nBlackmun said he would be surprised if any other cities came forward at this point.\n\n\"We don't want to submit a bid we don't think we can win,\" Blackmun told the APSE gathering. \"We have to assess our chances. ... We want this bid to be a national bid, an American, bid, not just a city bid. We want to make sure we have been as inclusive as possible.\"\n\nThe United States hasn't hosted a Summer Olympics since the 1996 Atlanta Games. New York mounted a failed bid for the 2012 Games, which went to London, and Chicago suffered a stinging first-round defeat in the IOC vote for the 2016 Olympics, which were awarded to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe USOC has since reached a revenue-sharing agreement with the IOC, ending a long-running dispute that contributed to the failed bids. With relations back on track and the USOC working to increase its international presence, the chances for a successful U.S. bid in 2024 are considered vastly improved.\n\n\"We've got plenty of time,\" Blackmun told the AP. \"There are no specific deadlines on this process.\"\n\nThe USOC official said a joint bid can work in some geographical areas, citing the Bay Area and the cities of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose as a \"natural\" possibility.\n\nAs for San Diego and Tijuana, he said, \"That would have its challenges. We haven't looked at it carefully. We just learned about it.\"\n\nBlackmun said he understood why Chicago is not interested in bidding again. The city spent about $90 million on the 2016 bid and not even the presence of President Barack Obama at the IOC session in Copenhagen, Denmark, was enough to prevent the humbling defeat.\n\nNew York, meanwhile, could be a strong contender in 2024, Blackmun said.\n\n\"New York is a global iconic city with a very diverse population and could do a fantastic job of hosting the games,\" Blackmun said, adding a bid will likely depend on the result of the Big Apple's mayoral election in November.\n\nThe USOC has said it plans to decide by the end of 2014 whether to submit a bid. The International Olympic Committee will select the 2024 host city in 2017. Other potential 2024 contenders include Paris and a city in South Africa.\n\n\"The games should definitely go to Africa someday,\" Blackmun said. \"If we bid for 2024, I hope they don't go to Africa in 2024.\"\n\nOn other issues, Blackmun said he supports keeping wrestling in the Olympics after the sport was removed from the program of the 2020 Games by the IOC executive board in February. Wrestling is now competing against seven other sports for an opening on the 2020 program.\n\nBlackmun said he also supports the inclusion of women's softball. Baseball and softball, which have been out of the Olympics since the 2008 Beijing Games, have merged to mount a joint bid for 2020 reinstatement. The IOC board will decide next month which sport or sports to recommend for inclusion, with a final vote by the IOC assembly in September.\n\n\"Softball needs the Olympics,\" Blackmun said. \"I feel strongly that both wrestling and women's softball should be in the games. You can't get both. It's not a perfect world.\"\n\nBlackmun said he's confident NHL players will take part in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. NHL players have participated in the past four Winter Games, shutting down the league for two weeks.\n\nNegotiations between the league and international ice hockey officials have yet to produce an agreement for Sochi, though the signs are positive.\n\n\"I know the players want it — both the players who would go to Sochi and those that would get two weeks off,\" Blackmun said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/07/summer-olympics-2028-riversport-okc-venue-canoe-slalom-los-angeles/70297615007/", "title": "Riversport OKC may play host to 2028 Summer Olympics paddlesports", "text": "Oklahoma City's Riversport facility could host an event in the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe home to paddlesports in Oklahoma City is being considered as the venue for the canoe slalom events during the games hosted by Los Angeles, according to an International Canoe Federation report and board meeting minutes from 2022.\n\n\"Discussions are continuing with Oklahoma regarding possibly hosting slalom events at LA28,\" ICF board meeting minutes from September 2022 read. \"Oklahoma City has given a positive response to the financial requirements in being a host Olympic venue.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/salt-lake-city-host-2034-winter-olympics/74239222007/", "title": "2034 Winter Olympics will be back in Salt Lake City.

Though it did come with a bit of unexpected controversy − a strange scene in which committee members used the moment to rip the United States for its recent political actions around the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the controversial doping case involving 23 Chinese swimmers.\n\n\"I'm sorry for you, and for us, that this issue arose now,\" IOC president Thomas Bach told Salt Lake's bid committee.\n\nUltimately, though, the last-minute concerns were never going to be enough to derail Wednesday's vote, which passed 83-6. The news prompted celebration in the early morning hours back in Utah, where the committee 's vote coincided with a state holiday, Pioneer Day.\n\nMembers also signed off on the French Alps as host of the 2030 Winter Games earlier in the day.\n\nIOC airs concerns over U.S. stance on anti-doping\n\nIn the hour before the vote to award the Winter Games to Salt Lake City, they took an uncommon detour to express concerns about how a doping scandal involving Chinese swimmers has been handled in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and its chief executive officer, Travis Tygart, have been extremely critical of WADA's handling of the Chinese swimmers case, in which 23 athletes tested positive for a banned heart medication ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Games. WADA accepted the results of a Chinese government investigation that attributed the positive tests to contamination at a hotel and neither publicly disclosed the tests at the time.\n\nUSADA's criticism has been followed by a congressional hearing and a reported investigation by U.S. law enforcement, apparently under the auspices of the Rodchenkov Act, which allows U.S. authorities to pursue criminal charges in doping cases that affect U.S. athletes.\n\nIt is the Rodchenkov Act, in particular, that seemed to prompt the ire of IOC members ahead of Wednesday's vote. And John Coates, one of Bach's top lieutenants, said the committee went so far as to amend Salt Lake's host city contract to address the matter. According to Coates, the IOC can terminate the host contract if \"the supreme authority of (WADA) in the fight against doping is not fully respected.\"\n\nGene Sykes, who chairs the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, responded to the members' concerns by praising WADA and renewing the United States' commitment to clean sport.\n\n\"We certainly accept the obligations and responsibility inherent in the amendment to the Olympic host contract,\" Sykes said. \"So from our perspective, we take very seriously to heart all of your comments, and we pledge to you that we will be good partners and we will support, with you, this very, very important institution.\"\n\nSalt Lake's road to becoming 2034 Olympic host\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has supported Salt Lake City as a host candidate since 2018, and it has been clear for several years now that the IOC would award Utah another version of the Games at some point.\n\nFor a time, the only realistic question was whether Salt Lake would host the Winter Games in 2030 or 2034.\n\nBid leaders said they would be open to either but preferred 2034 to allow for more of a cushion after the United States' hosting of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThe city is uniquely positioned as a host in part because it has meticulously maintained the venues that were used in 2002 through the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit created after those Games. Olympic officials also value Salt Lake City's reliable winter climate. Because of climate change, fewer cities can be counted upon to have the ideal weather for hosting the Winter Games during their usual scheduling slot in early to mid-February.\n\nWhat are the proposed venues for Salt Lake 2034?\n\nThe Salt Lake Games will use 12 existing venues, only four of which will require additional and permanent upgrades before 2034, according a report released in June by the IOC's future host commission. The only temporary venue that will need to be built is for snowboard big air.\n\nAs for the big-ticket items, the University of Utah's campus is expected to double as the Olympic village during the Games, and the Delta Center − home to the NBA's Utah Jazz − will host one of the Winter Olympics' marquee sports, figure skating. Skiing events will be held at Snowbasin Resort, about 35 minutes northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, and snowboarding events will be in Park City.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nHow much will Salt Lake City Olympics cost?\n\nKarl Stoss, chair of the future host commission for the Winter Games, has praised Salt Lake's plan for the Games as \"very compact\" and said it would require no capital investment.\n\nThe Salt Lake Games have an official budget of about $4 billion, and organizers claim they will be 100% privately funded − pulling money from ticket revenue, domestic sponsorships and an IOC contribution. The Olympics, however, have a habit of stretching beyond initial estimates. And they tend to put additional strain on public works and utilities in the host city, which is sometimes underestimated in budgets.\n\nWhich other bids did the U.S. beat out?\n\nFor decades, the IOC welcomed bids from multiple countries for one edition of the Games and essentially let them duke it out for votes. But that's not how it works anymore. The IOC's host selection process is far more amorphous, with potential hosts progressing through several loose stages of \"dialogue\" so that by the time they are put up for a vote, like Salt Lake City was Wednesday, the decision has essentially already been made.\n\nThat's all to say that it's not super-clear which bids, if any, Salt Lake City beat out. It was in the mix with the French Alps, Sweden and Switzerland for potential hosting duties, while Canada and Japan also expressed some level of interest. Ultimately, the IOC appears to have picked the French Alps and Salt Lake City from the bunch and then just figured out the timing of who would host when.\n\nWhere are the next Olympic Games?\n\nHere's a quick rundown of future Olympic hosts.\n\n2026 : Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy\n\n: Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy 2028: Summer Olympics in Los Angeles\n\nSummer Olympics in Los Angeles 2030: Winter Olympics in the French Alps\n\nWinter Olympics in the French Alps 2032: Summer Olympics in Brisbane, Australia\n\nSummer Olympics in Brisbane, Australia 2034: Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/07/24/where-are-the-next-olympics-2028-summer-games/74528188007/", "title": "Where are the next Olympics? 2028 Summer Games coming to the US", "text": "The 2024 Paris Olympics soft launched on-field action Wednesday ahead of Friday's history-making opening ceremony.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee also named Salt Lake City as the host for the 2034 Winter Games on Wednesday, as well as the French Alps for the 2030 Winter Games.\n\nThe announcement ended a lengthy process that will see Utah's capital city back on the world stage three decades after it last hosted the Games.\n\nSalt Lake City was the only city under consideration by the IOC, as concerns about the high costs of putting on a three-week showcase and other factors caused other cities not to bid.

The first time was in 1932 and the second was in 1984 when Los Angeles saved the day by hosting when no other city or nation wanted to, turning a huge profit that funneled millions into youth sports in the city and kicking off an era of tremendous Olympic success that has lasted 40 years.\n\nSo a city and a region with such a remarkable Olympic resume is hardly daunted by following the majestic visual feast that Paris presented to the world over the past 17 days.\n\n“Our job is to be the most authentically spectacular Games for LA, not to try and out-Paris Paris in LA,” Casey Wasserman, president of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, said in an interview here this week. “One of the reasons Paris has been so successful is they’ve been authentically French in every regard and that’s why it works. LA is a different city and so we have to be what you would expect and what you see and what people are used to seeing from big events in LA.”\n\nIn other words: Hollywood, the beaches, the ocean, the mountains, sunshine, celebrities, the works.\n\nThis conversation of “can you top this” has happened once before, with a sublime result for the subsequent Olympics. As soon as the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing ended, talk turned to London in 2012, and it went something like this: Poor London, how could it possibly follow the technical opulence and grandeur of a country like China that could put on the biggest show on earth with no concern for the guardrails of tight budgets, media scrutiny and, well, democracy.\n\n“In the Beijing opening ceremony, there were, whatever, 10,000 people banging drums,” Wasserman said. “Then London does a great thing because it was authentically British, it had humor and fun and music and all this stuff and the Queen and Daniel Craig.\n\n“Our job is not to compare but to be the best for LA. I think it’s important not to get caught up in that, the same way London frankly didn’t get caught up in that.”\n\nOne big change from Paris to LA will be a return to a stadium for the opening ceremony, which means the athletes of the world will receive the kind of raucous ovation in 2028 that was just not possible as they cruised the Seine River here.\n\nWasserman praised Paris’ incredible opening ceremony. “It was so spectacular,” he said. “I give them a ton of credit. … Beautiful idea.”\n\nBut it was missing something.\n\n“The way I describe it is the one thing it missed was shared experiences,” Wasserman said. “So not just for the athletes, for the fans, you have the moment of, oh, Paul McCartney playing in London, everyone shared that moment at the same time, and here when it was coming down the river, you had your experience, but it was a very isolated experience for both the athletes and the fans. If you were on the river you saw what you saw but that’s all you saw.”\n\nIn that sense, for spectators gathered along the Seine that night, it was like watching a parade. The greatest parade ever, but still a parade.\n\n“The energy that comes from a shared experience – Super Bowl halftime is the ultimate example, Super Bowl halftime being in the venue, everyone experiences it together,” he said. “I think that’s a really important thing to create that energy and I think it’s a really great opportunity for the athletes to feel that energy because it is the first night and that energy and that shared experience is pretty powerful.”\n\nOlympic gold medalist Donna de Varona, a member of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee board of directors who also was on the LA Olympic bid committee, said it is vital to put the athletes first.\n\n“We will put the athletes center stage,” she said in an interview here the other day. “We need to do that. I commend the French for going all out. It was a nice idea to use the Seine but the athletes were separate.\n\n“I’m sure because all these stars came here it was really helpful on social media and it helps elevate the Games, but we still have to remember that the athletes are the stars of the show,” she said. “The athletes have to be the centerpiece and that’s the challenge of the countries marching in. There are all kinds of ways we can make that happen.\n\n“Here, I think the only disappointment was that the athletes were not center stage in the opening ceremony. In LA, Hollywood will step up, but we don’t want Hollywood to overshadow the athletes. The athletes are the stars of the show.”\n\nOne athlete who was a star of the show here spoke enthusiastically about looking forward to a home game in LA in what would be her fifth Olympic Games. Katie Ledecky, the most decorated U.S. female Olympian ever, in any sport, was one of many athletes who appreciated the boisterous and delightful ovations every French athlete received here, win, lose, or draw.\n\n“Seeing the kind of support that the French athletes are getting here, I think all of the U.S. athletes are thinking about how cool that could be in Los Angeles having the home crowd,” she said. “So that would be amazing to be able to compete there.”\n\nWhen one Olympics ends, the promise of the next begins.

To see the full list, visit this page.\n\nIt’s time for a radical change in the way the Olympic world picks its host cities.\n\nIt’s time for the sports world to tell the International Olympic Committee that it can no longer bankrupt cities in the name of hosting the Olympics.\n\nIt’s time for a rotation of cities that have already successfully put on the Olympics and have venues already in place to host the Winter and Summer Games, with a new site thrown in every fourth Olympiad.\n\nAn Olympic Games begins in celebration and often ends in frustration, disorganization and red ink. Cities, even countries, are plunged into debt. White elephants dot the landscape as once-glistening venues fall into weed-infested disrepair.\n\nFor more than a century, cities have competed for the honor of hosting the greatest sports event on earth. For decades, the decision was decidedly low key. Then things changed. Bidding for the Games became a decade-long ordeal.\n\nYOUR DAILY DOSE: Top sports headlines, delivered daily\n\nFor several years, cities wine and dine IOC members in hopes of winning the vote for a particular Winter or Summer Olympics more than a half dozen years into the future. Millions of dollars are spent not on construction, not on youth sport development, not on municipal infrastructure — but on shrimp bowls and chocolate fountains and worldwide travel and jaw-dropping fawning over the faux royalty that is the IOC.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nHow would this work? Los Angeles is hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics, so let’s begin the rotation there. Sydney gets the 2032 Games, London 2036 and then a wild card — most likely a nation in Africa, a continent that has never hosted the Olympics — in 2040. Then the Games go back to L.A. in 2044, and on it goes.\n\nExchanging successful Olympic cities within a continent or global region is certainly an option, so perhaps the 2044 Games go to Toronto rather than L.A., the 2048 Games go to Tokyo rather than Sydney, and the 2052 Games to Paris rather than London. But the key to this rotation is that the infrastructure will already be in place so extravagant Olympic spending will not be necessary.\n\nThe same kind of rotation would take place for the Winter Olympics: Vancouver or another Canadian city; a city or cluster of cities or towns in Norway or the Alps; and an Asian city, perhaps in Japan or South Korea. Again, in the fourth Winter Olympiad, a new city or region would host the Games. And Salt Lake City or Denver or another U.S. city could switch out with Canada to host another Winter Olympic Games sometime in the future.\n\nIt’s understandable that some cities would feel slighted by being left out of the rotation while leaders in some of the chosen cities might not be so keen to keep hosting the Games every 16 years. That’s why there’s wiggle room built in.\n\nMost importantly, the overwhelming financial burden of hosting the Olympics would be lessened. And the money that’s saved by those cities that are not starting anew every four years — Summer Olympic behemoths L.A., Sydney and London for instance?\n\nPlace it in a fund to help a new Olympic site build its venues when it gets its chance, making it a win-win for all.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/10"}]}

For the latest news on the collapse, view our live updates file for Wednesday, March 27.\n\nBALTIMORE − The U.S. Coast Guard said Tuesday evening it was calling off the search-and-rescue mission for the six construction workers that went missing when a cargo ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore early in the morning, sending it collapsing into the frigid Patapsco River and shutting down a critical artery for East Coast shipping.\n\nOfficials said water temperatures around 46 to 48 degrees, poor visibility and changing currents played a role in the decision after a dogged attempt to find the workers.\n\n“Based on the length of time that we’ve gone on this search, the extensive search efforts that we’ve put into it, the water temperature, at this point we do not believe that we’re going to find any of these individuals still alive,'' Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon N. Gilreath said in a news conference. \"So this evening at about 7:30 we are going to suspend the active search-and-rescue efforts.’’\n\nThe focus of the operation would switch to recovery and restart at 6 a.m. Wednesday, officials said.\n\nAround 1:30 a.m. Tuesday a Singapore-flagged vessel named Dali struck the Key Bridge as it was leaving the Port of Baltimore, causing the span to collapse in seconds. Officials said the crew warned of a power issue and sent out a \"mayday\" before the collision. Footage of the incident shows the cargo ship smash into one of the columns before the bridge snapped, hit the water and partially fell on the ship, where a burst of flames and smoke could be seen rising into the night sky.\n\nSeveral vehicles were on the bridge at the time of impact and plunged into the river, which was cold enough to cause hypothermia. There were multiple contractors on the bridge who were repairing potholes, Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said. So far two people have been rescued. One was unharmed and the other remains in \"very serious condition,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at an afternoon news conference the agency will lead the investigation, but she would not provide information on fatalities or injuries from the incident, leaving that to local authorities.\n\nA senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY the ship apparently lost power a few minutes before striking the bridge. A federal report has confirmed that version of events, saying the crew lost its ability to control the vessel.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Brawner Builders, the employer of the six missing workers, told media outlets including the Baltimore Sun that they're presumed dead.\n\n∎ The University of Maryland Medical Center's trauma center treated one patient from the collapse who has been discharged, Michael Schwartzberg, the medical center's spokesperson, said in an email. Schwartzberg declined to say more about the person's injuries, citing patient privacy concerns.\n\n∎ Dr. David Efron, the center’s chief of trauma, said falling from the bridge − with clearance of more 185 feet − into 48-degree water would present life-threatening risks. Being submerged for more than an hour in water at that temperature is “almost invariably going to not be survivable.”\n\n∎ The National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to hold a news conference about its investigation into the incident Tuesday afternoon.\n\n∎ Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott issued a state of emergency to better mobilize resources and work quickly to \"address this crisis,\" he said in a post on X. The governor of Maryland issued a state of emergency earlier Tuesday.\n\nCrew lost control as propulsion deserted ship, report says\n\nThe Dali lost propulsion leaving port and its crew lost control of the ship, prompting the crew to alert Maryland officials of a possible collision, an unclassified Department of Homeland Security report revealed Tuesday.\n\nAn official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to USA TODAY that the DHS cybersecurity agency is working with federal, state and local officials \"to understand the potential impacts of this morning’s collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\"\n\nThis was not the Dali's first harsh encounter with a pier, and that time its leadership was determined to be at fault. It's too early to know what caused Tuesday's accident.\n\nThe cargo ship that struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge collided with a shipping dock in Belgium in 2016. That incident occurred as the Dali was leaving port in Antwerp and hit a loading pier made of stone, causing damage to the ship’s stern, according to the VesselFinder.com website, which tracks ships across the world. An investigation determined a mistake made by the ship’s master and pilot was to blame.\n\nNo one was injured in that crash, although the ship required repair and a full inspection before being returned to service. The pier – or berth – was also seriously damaged and had to be closed.\n\n− Josh Meyer, Emily Le Coz and Claire Thornton\n\nTwo Guatemalan workers among six missing\n\nTwo Guatemalan nationals are among the six workers who were on the bridge when it was struck early Tuesday, the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said. Their ages are 26 and 35, respectively, and their families have been notified, the ministry said in a statement, which also noted the other missing workers are from Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\n\"We will continue requesting information from the authorities and information about search and rescue efforts to find the missing Guatemalans,\" the statement said.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat did the most recent inspection report say about the bridge?\n\nBaltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge was listed in overall fair condition in 2021, the most recent inspection report in the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inventory at the time of its collapse early Tuesday morning.\n\nHowever, the database noted that, “Bank protection is in need of minor repairs. River control devices and embankment protection have a little minor damage. Banks and/or channel have minor amounts of drift.”\n\nOther structural elements showed “some minor deterioration” but were otherwise listed in satisfactory condition.\n\n− Cecilia Garzella and Yoonserk Pyun\n\n'We're with you': Biden says federal government will rebuild bridge\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he intends for the federal government to cover the entire cost to rebuild the Key Bridge, and he committed not to leave “until this job gets done.”\n\n“We're with you. We're going to stay with you as long as it takes,” Biden said Tuesday afternoon from the White House Roosevelt Room.\n\nBiden said he spoke with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and other local and state officials about the bridge’s collapse, and said he would visit the site in the future. “I told them we're going to send all the federal resources they need as we respond to this emergency − I mean all the federal resources. And we're going to rebuild that port together.”\n\nBiden said eight people remain unaccounted for, but the figure might change. Two people were rescued. \"Everything so far indicates that his was a terrible accident,” Biden said, adding there’s no reason to believe it was intentional.\n\n“Our prayers are with everyone involved in this terrible accident and all the families, especially those waiting for news of their loved ones right now,” Biden said. “I know every minute in that circumstance feels like a lifetime.”\n\nBiden said the ongoing rescue operation remains the top priority but relayed that he told Moore he has directed his team to “move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nCrewman reports all on board Dali are safe\n\nThis past weekend, Andrew Middleton took the ship's captain and a crewman shopping at a nearby Walmart. Since 9/11, international crews have to be escorted by a vetted person through most port areas, and Middleton said it's fairly common for crews like the Dali's to request assistance from the Apostleship of the Sea Baltimore Stella Maris International Seafarers' Center, where he is the director. The group is part of the Catholic Church's Archdiocese of Baltimore.\n\n\"They were by all appearances in good spirits,\" Middleton said, and they chatted in his van about the ship's planned 28-day voyage around the Horn of Africa to Sri Lanka. Middleton said crews usually buy personal toiletries and snacks before long trips.\n\nMiddleton woke up Tuesday morning to the shocking news the ship hit the bridge, and he immediately messaged one of the crewmen via WhatsApp. \"My question to him was, 'Is everyone OK?' And the answer was, 'Yes sir, everyone is safe,'\" Middleton told USA TODAY.\n\nThe crew is still aboard the ship while authorities assess the situation. Middleton said he's prepared to send them any supplies they need if they're stuck aboard for an extended period. And he said he's making plans to help them once they're freed and returned to shore. He said he expects the Dali will be towed back into the harbor and docked for a damage assessment. Middleton added that he worries both about the missing workers from the bridge and also the port workers who may be temporarily unemployed if the harbor gets shut down.\n\n\"Obviously, this incident has a large impact on the port community,'' he said. \"If this extends a long period of time, we're going to have longshoreman and stevedores who are not working, tugboat crews who are not working. It has the potential, if it becomes a drawn-out event, to affect many lives.\"\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nCommuter finds sight of damaged bridge 'devastating to watch'\n\nCharlotte Robinson's commute from her home in Delaware to her accounting job in Washington, D.C., took a detour Tuesday morning, when driving over the Francis Scott Key Bridge wasn't an option. In the past she figured that route was safe, but the bridge's collapse sparked difficult discussions with her colleagues who commute.\n\n\"It was devastating to watch,'' Robinson said of the crumpled bridge after it was hit by a 985-foot-long cargo ship. \"And you have to ask yourself, if that was me, what would my plan be? How would I try to survive this, if I was trapped, if my car went into the water?”\n\nRobinson said she often sees ships passing under the bridge during her morning commute; in the evenings, when she’s on her way home, there are usually fewer boats. Tuesday, she said, “You could see all these boats, just lined up because they had no place to go.”\n\nAnother common sight during her commute was construction workers both on the bridge and below it, sometimes hanging over the water in harnesses. Her thoughts turned to those workers as she watched the news Tuesday in her office. \"I almost couldn't breathe watching the news,\" she said.\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\n'It's devastating to the city'\n\nGreg Trenchard, 43, awoke Tuesday to a flurry of text messages and missed calls from his out of state relatives checking in on him after hearing about the Key Bridge collapse.\n\n“I’ve driven over it 100 times and now to see that it’s gone is pretty crazy,” he said Tuesday.\n\nTrenchard, an auditor, said he then tried to make his way to Fort Armistead Park, where he’d come many times before to take photos of the bridge at sunrise and sunset. But the normally quick drive took nearly 40 minutes due to the traffic detours, and a police roadblock next to Royal Farms, a convenience store, about a mile and half from the park stopped him from getting any closer to the scene.\n\n“It’s a blow,” he said of the collapse. “It’s devastating to the city, it’s devastating to port traffic and everything they’re trying to do to revitalize the shipping industry in Maryland and keep that going.”\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nAir, land and water search underway\n\nMultiple local, state and federal agencies are coordinating the massive search, which spans a vast section of the river – both above and below the surface of the water – and the ship itself, Wallace said. Divers, helicopters and sonar technology were being used and had located several vehicles submerged in the river, which is about 50-feet-deep where the bridge collapsed.\n\n\"This water is current influenced, so right now we think the tide is coming back in,\" he said.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency and said he is working with an interagency team to \"quickly deploy federal resources from the Biden Administration.\"\n\n\"This is an unthinkable tragedy,\" Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said at a news conference.\n\nExpert says river current makes search more difficult\n\nJim Bellingham, the executive director for the Johns Hopkins Institute for Assured Autonomy and expert in marine robotics lives in nearby Fells Point, and talked to USA TODAY about some of the challenges faced by rescuers.\n\n“Nothing is staying put in the ocean,” he said. “Everything is moving” in the Patapsco River, a tidal estuary, which presents just one difficulty for rescue efforts. Rescuers would have to determine the speed and direction of the current to figure out where to search – toward Baltimore Harbor, or out toward the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBellingham said it’s likely any workers who may have been on the bridge would have been wearing reflective vests and even flotation devices that would improve visibility in the dark river. They might also have flares, and are more easily spotted by rescue helicopters.\n\nRescuers are using sonar, lights, cameras and robotic machinery as well as human divers, but Bellingham said divers would face their own risks, as the wreckage might not be stable.\n\nThe longer the search goes on, the less likely rescuers are to find survivors, given the temperature of the water, and the likelihood of people being trapped with little to no air. But Baltimore, with many Navy and Coast Guard facilities and military contractors nearby, might be as well prepared to deal with the disaster as any place.\n\n“Their job is to rescue people,” Bellingham said. “They want to believe they can do that, and there’s a tendency not to want to give up.”\n\n– Phaedra Trethan\n\nCargo ship was headed for Sri Lanka\n\nThe container vessel was chartered by the major shipping company Maersk and was carrying its cargo, according to a statement from the company. When it crashed into the bridge, no Maersk crew and personnel were onboard the vessel, which is operated by charter vessel company Synergy Group and owned by Singapore-based Grace Ocean Pte.\n\nThe Dali was slated to arrive April 22 in Sri Lanka, according to MarineTraffic, a global ship tracking service.\n\n\"We are horrified by what has happened in Baltimore, and our thoughts are with all of those affected,\" Maersk said in a statement. \"We are closely following the investigations conducted by authorities and Synergy, and we will do our utmost to keep our customers informed.\"\n\nSynergy Marine Corp said the Dali collided with one of the pillars of the bridge and that all its crew members, including two pilots, have been accounted for and there were no reports of any injuries.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Erin Palmer said at a news conference Tuesday that the agencies remain focused on search-and-rescue. She did not comment on the crew of the ship or provide additional details about the collision.\n\nAll vessel traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore was suspended until further notice, but the port is still open for truck transports, Wiedefeld said. Traffic, meanwhile, is being diverted from the area around the Key Bridge.\n\nBaltimore port closed to ships 'until further notice'\n\nShortly after the bridge collapse, the Port of Baltimore suspended vessel traffic “until further notice,” according to its website.\n\n“This does not mean the Port of Baltimore is shut down. We are still processing trucks inside of our terminals,” the statement said.\n\nBut Bloomberg reported that the port “looks to be out of commission indefinitely.”\n\nAt least 40 ships are now more or less trapped inside the port, according to Reuters. At least 30 other ships planned to arrive there.\n\n“They will likely have to reroute shipping to other ports on the East Coast,” said Kevin Linderman, a professor and supply chain expert at Pennsylvania State University. “However, this will put additional demand on these ports, and shippers may not be able to access US markets” as efficiently, he said.\n\n“One critical question is, can the other ports handle the products that were destined to Baltimore?”\n\n– Daniel de Visé\n\n'A lot of tears' for families\n\nBaltimore residents turned out to support those affected by the tragedy. Dozens of people gathered at the Mt. Olive Baptist Church of Turner Station during an emotional prayer vigil Tuesday evening.Faith leaders and city officials including Mayor Brandon Scott prayed for the families of those missing after the bridge collapse and the first responders working at the scene.“We can only imagine what is going through their minds and through their hearts and through their bodies. None of us want to experience that,” Scott said Tuesday. “We have to lift them up, support them not just today, not just tomorrow but for the foreseeable future.”Father Ako Walker, priest at Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, said a prayer in Spanish to show solidarity with the six people who are still missing after the collapse. Following the vigil, Walker told reporters he has been providing support to family members whose loved ones are missing.“It’s difficult for them,” he said. “You know, you can see the pain etched on their faces. There’s a lot of tears.”\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWill the Baltimore bridge collapse impact cruises?\n\nBaltimore is a destination for several major cruise lines. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, the industry’s leading trade group, published itineraries in the 2024 calendar year include a dozen ships making 115 stops in Baltimore.\n\nRoyal Caribbean and Carnival have April sailings that could be impacted by the bridge collapse, according to their websites.\n\nCarnival told USA TODAY it was premature to comment on impacts to future sailings.\n\nAmerican Cruise Lines has roundtrip sailings from Baltimore scheduled in May, according to its website. The cruise line told USA TODAY their schedules remain unaffected but will make adjustments if needed to future cruises.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line doesn’t appear to have any Baltimore sailings until September.\n\n– Eve Chen and Nathan Diller\n\nWill the port shutdown affect consumer goods, prices?\n\nSeveral big firms have distribution warehouses near the port, including Amazon and FedEx, one analyst noted in a tweet on X.\n\nEven so, some analysts predict only a minimal impact on the movement of goods up and down the East Coast from the bridge collapse.\n\nBaltimore’s port holds just 4% of all East Coast trade volume, according to S&P Global. New York’s port, by contrast, does 38% of that business.\n\nYet, the port offers the deepest harbor in Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay, is closer to the Midwest than any other East Coast port, and is within an overnight drive of one-third of the US population, according to the port website.\n\nThe port boasts five public and 12 private terminals. In 2023, it ranked first in the nation in handling automobiles and light trucks.\n\n“For the American consumer, the biggest impact will be felt in terms of imported motor vehicles,” said Jason Miller, a business professor at Michigan State University. If sales remain strong, he said, “we could see inventories drop on the lots of dealers that sell imported vehicles until alternative arrangements can be made. This could increase motor vehicle prices for some makes and models.”\n\n– Daniel de Visé\n\nAlternate routes around collapsed Baltimore bridge\n\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority was suggesting drivers take Interstate 95 or Interstate 895 as alternatives to the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge along Interstate 695.\n\n“I-695 Outer Loop closed at MD 10 (exit 2) and Inner Loop closed at MD 157/Peninsula Exp (exit 43),” MDTA said in a post on X.\n\nDrivers could take several other, longer routes around Baltimore, but I-95 (Fort McHenry Tunnel) and I-895 (Baltimore Harbor Tunnel) are the most direct alternatives across the water.\n\nThere are few exceptions.\n\nMDTA notes, vehicles carrying hazardous materials, including more than 10 pounds of propane, are not allowed in the tunnels. Additionally, vehicles more than 13-feet and 6-inches high or 8-feet wide may not use the 1-895 Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. Vehicles more than 14-feet and 6-inches high or 11-feet wide may not use the I-95 Fort McHenry Tunnel.\n\nThose vehicles should use the western portion of I-695 instead.\n\n– Eve Chen\n\nHow cold is the Patapsco River?\n\nThe Patapsco River is about 50 feet deep where the ship hit the bridge, officials said during a press conference Tuesday morning. Part of the 39-mile river helps form the Baltimore Harbor, just northwest of the bridge collapse, and it flows out to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nA buoy in the Patapsco River indicated the water temperature Tuesday morning was currently about 47 degrees, while the air is around 41 degrees, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Whereas hypothermia is thought to occur at very cold temperatures, it can occur in waters below 70 degrees, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nKey Bridge collapse draws comparisons to Florida's Sunshine Skyway Bridge collapse\n\nIn 1980, a Florida bridge also collapsed after a ship collided with it, leading to the deaths of 35 motorists and bus passengers.\n\nA 1,200-foot chunk of the Sunshine Skyway bridge – which connects St. Petersburg and Bradenton – collapsed after the massive Summit Venture freighter slammed into one of its central support piers.\n\nWhen the section of the bridge fell into Tampa Bay, it took a truck, seven cars and a Greyhound bus with it.\n\nThe Herald-Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported the crash happened during an intense thunderstorm, with winds reaching 80 mph and heavy rain. At the time, visibility was near-zero, according to local historians who made a documentary film about the collapse.\n\nAfter the collapse, the freighter remained stuck beneath the bridge, with part of the roadway on top of its bow. Photos from the time also show how one motorist was able to skip his car to a stop just inches away from where the bridge fell into the water.\n\n-Claire Thornton\n\nHow vital is the Francis Scott Key Bridge?\n\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge, named for the author of the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" is a 1.6-mile, 4-lane bridge that crosses over the Patapsco River, according to the MDTA. It opened in 1977.\n\nThe port’s private and public terminals handled 847,158 autos and light trucks in 2023, the most of any U.S. port. The port also handles farm and construction machinery, sugar, gypsum and coal, according to a Maryland government website.\n\nThe span is the outermost of three major Patapsco River crossings at Baltimore Harbor, according to the American Civil Engineering Society. The steel-arched bridge, with a total length of 8,636 feet, was the second-longest continuous-truss bridge span in the world when it was built and remains the second longest in the United States and third in the world, according to the society.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Tom Vanden Brook, Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/15/fbi-boards-cargo-ship-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse/73325798007/", "title": "Baltimore bridge collapse: FBI boards cargo ship that collapsed bridge", "text": "Agents with the FBI on Monday boarded the Dali, the cargo ship that struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and triggered its collapse last month, amid reports that the agency has opened a criminal probe into the events leading up to the collapse.\n\nThe FBI has opened a criminal investigation into the bridge's collapse that will focus on whether the crew of the ship knew that its systems had issues when it left port, the Washington Post first reported.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the agency said, \"The FBI is present aboard the cargo ship Dali conducting court authorized law enforcement activity. There is no other public information available and we will have no further comment.\"\n\nThe FBI’s involvement in the Baltimore bridge collapse was expected as the bureau has the lead for terrorism investigations, according to a senior government official. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, characterized the FBI’s work on the Dali as standard operating procedure.\n\nIn the hours after the crash, terrorism was quickly deemed unlikely by government officials who focused on the loss of power aboard the ship as the likely cause for the accident. However, the FBI is the agency that makes the final determination on terrorism and will thoroughly investigate the possibility, the official said.\n\nAccidents involving ships generally are conducted by the Coast Guard, and, at times, the National Transportation Safety Board, the official said. Both agencies have been involved since the early days of the investigation. Given the overlapping concerns in Baltimore about possible criminal negligence, a foreign-flagged vessel in U.S. territorial waters, and at least the possibility of terrorism, several agencies will be involved in a joint investigation.\n\nSome agencies will likely drop out when investigation of their concern is completed, the official said.\n\nThe investigation will also focus on the events leading up to the collapse and whether federal laws and regulations were followed, an anonymous source told the Associated Press.\n\nA different source not authorized to comment publicly told the AP that the Dali experienced apparent electrical problems hours before ever leaving port. Video of the collision with the bridge shows the ship's lights cutting out in the moments before, but the source told AP that alarms had also gone off with some of its refrigerated containers while at the dock, signaling issues with the power supply.\n\nErek L. Barron, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY, “My office generally will not confirm the existence of or otherwise comment about investigations. However, the public should know, whether it’s gun violence, civil rights abuse, financial fraud, or any other threat to public safety or property, we will seek accountability for anyone who may be responsible.”\n\nOn the same day the FBI personnel boarded the ship, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced the city's plans to take legal action against the owner, charterer, manager and the manufacturer of the Dali, \"as well as any other potentially liable third parties,\" according to a press release.\n\nThe announcement comes after Grace Ocean Private Limited, the ship's owner, and Synergy Marine Private Limited, its manager, filed a petition in Maryland District Court earlier this month in a preemptive attempt to exonerate the two companies from any claims or damage costs they incur above $43 million as a result of the disaster.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything in our power to support everyone impacted here and will continue to recognize the human impact this event has had,\" Scott said. \"Part of that work needs to be seeking recourse from those who may potentially be responsible, and with the ship’s owner filing a petition to limit its liability mere days after the incident, we need to act equally as quickly to protect the City’s interests.”\n\nAdam Levitt, the co-founder of DiCello Levitt, a trial firm representing the city, said the city's attorneys would bring \"significant economic and environmental loss claims\" against the owner, manager and others \"to hold them accountable for causing one of the largest inner-city maritime disasters in U.S. history.\"\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, told USA TODAY in an email, \"We again extend our deepest sympathy to all those impacted by this incident. Due to the magnitude of the incident, there are various government agencies conducting investigations, in which we are fully participating. Out of respect for these investigations and any future legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board told Congress that it interviewed personnel on the cargo ship as part of its own investigation into the crash.\n\nThe 984-foot-long ship collided with a support column of the bridge just after 1:20 a.m. on March 26, plunging the structure into the depths of the Patapsco River, along with eight workers who were repairing potholes on the roadway. Two workers were rescued, but six were pronounced dead.\n\nOfficials working on the collapse site recovered the body of Maynor Yasir Suazo-Sandoval, 38, on April 5. The bodies of two other victims, Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, 26, and Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, were discovered in a red pickup truck submerged 25 feet deep in the channel.\n\nAuthorities have not recovered the bodies of the three remaining victims, Miguel Luna, Jose Lopez and Carlos Hernández.\n\nMoore told reporters after the incident that the ship was traveling at a \"very rapid speed\" when it issued a \"Mayday\" distress signal shortly before it collided with the bridge.\n\nA pilot and special navigator, along with a crew of 21 people, were on board the ship at the time of the disaster.\n\nAn unclassified Department of Homeland Security report stated that the ship's crew notified officials at the Maryland Department of Transportation that they had lost control of the vessel and that a collision with the bridge was \"possible.\"\n\nThe ship's pilot also sent a VHF radio call requesting the assistance of nearby tugboats when the ship's power began to falter.\n\nMore:Pittsburgh barges break loose in Ohio River, damage marina\n\nCleanup continues\n\nThe Dali's crews remain about the vessel as cleanup is underway on the ship. As of last week, Maryland reported 136 other foreign nationals are aboard seven other ships in the port of Baltimore.\n\nMaryland officials put the estimated weight of the collapsed steel and road debris at an estimated 27,000 tons, or 54 million pounds. In addition to the bridge debris, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland Butler Jr. has said there’s at least one larger sized vehicle “completely encapsulated” by the bridge’s superstructure underwater.\n\nPartners in a joint response team being steered by the Coast Guard have stated they are monitoring and testing for any potential spills or contamination from the Dali and its cargo, but have detected no threat to the public.\n\nCrews are still working to unload cargo containers from the Dali, which still sits in the water where it collided with the bridge.\n\nOf the 4,700 cargo containers on board the ship when it crashed, 56 carry 764 tons of material classified as \"hazardous,\" including soaps, perfumes, mineral oil, corrosives and lithium ion batteries, according to the Coast Guard and NTSB. The bridge's collapse already damaged 14 of the containers carrying hazardous material, posing the risk of a fuel leak or other hazardous material during the removal efforts.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, a total of 39 cargo containers have been moved from the Dali to a barge to create a safety zone aboard the ship as workers continue to remove the bridge wreckage and debris on the bow, Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Himes said.\n\nThe Coast Guard and others established a 2,400-foot containment boom around the Dali in the days immediately after the bridge collapse, in an effort to prevent any pollution from the ship or its cargo from spreading into the surrounding waterway.\n\nA sheen initially reported in the water around the Dali may be from a bow thruster on the front of the ship that “normally allows it to turn to port or starboard” as it’s approaching the dock, according to Coast Guard Rear Adm. Shannon Gilreath. “We think there were roughly 80 liters of oil in that area,” Gilreath said, but it’s “too dangerous” to reach, given the cargos and bridge structure hanging off the front and sides of the ship.\n\nIn addition to the risks of a leak of fuel or other hazardous material, workers are also grappling with concerns about gas escaping from soybeans fermenting on the ship.\n\nThe Maryland Department of Emergency Management reported in a press briefing last week that crews bagging fermented soybeans from containers on board to remove them had about 50 tons to unload.\n\n“The previous concerns of hazardous gasses from fermenting soybeans cargo is nearly addressed,” the department reported.\n\nOn Sunday, Himes, responding on behalf of the joint information center for the Dali response, confirmed that the workers' efforts to remove the soybeans were nearly complete.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

For the latest news, view our live updates file on the bridge collapse for Friday, March 29.\n\nBALTIMORE – Authorities on Thursday forged ahead with a salvage operation to remove the mangled bridge from the Patapsco River and clear the waterway so the Port of Baltimore, a critical East Coast shipping artery, can resume operations.\n\nExperts say the operation will be vital to reopening the busy port and that it may take weeks to clear away tons of twisted wreckage, much of which lies underwater. The damage inflicted on the port is likely to lead to a multibillion-dollar insurance loss, the chairperson of commercial insurance market Lloyd's of London said Thursday.\n\nA crew repairing potholes on the bridge Tuesday morning were on break when a massive shipping vessel traveling at 8 mph lost power and smashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse in seconds. Eight workers were plunged into the frigid water. Two survived, and officials have said the others are presumed dead. Four remain missing.\n\nOn Wednesday, rescuers found the bodies of two men trapped in a red pickup around the bridge's middle span, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland L. Butler Jr. said at a news conference. The workers were from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, Butler said.\n\nThe piles of wreckage in the water, and the presence of the 984-foot-long cargo ship known as the Dali, forced authorities to shut down the Port of Baltimore, which handles more cars and farm equipment than any other port in the nation. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, speaking about the facility where $80 billion in foreign cargo transited last year, called it \"a global crisis.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Moore said the White House approved in a matter of hours the initial $60 million he requested Thursday morning to begin the recovery from the bridge's collapse. He also said the search for the missing workers has been hampered by murky water and dense debris that limit divers to no more than a foot or two of visibility.\n\n∎ José López, of Guatemala, is one of the four missing workers in the bridge collapse, multiple news outlets reported. The Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said two Guatemalans are among the missing. On Wednesday, Maryland officials said they found the bodies of Guatemalan national Dorian Castillo Cabrera, 26, alongside Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, of Mexico, trapped inside a red truck about 25 feet underwater.\n\n∎ Moore offered condolences to the families of the bridge collapse victims Thursday and addressed the close collaboration between local, state and federal officials to clear the wreckage and open the port. \"The best minds in the world are coming together to collect the information that we need to move forward with speed and safety,\" he said. \"We have a very long road ahead of us.\"\n\n∎ New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Thursday that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey can take on additional cargo that's being diverted from the Port of Baltimore. Hochul said she and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy have asked port authority officials to \"evaluate all resources to minimize disruptions.\" She added: \"The tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge has touched every corner of the nation, including our supply chains. We are ready to help.\"\n\n∎ Storms moving over the mid-Atlantic region and much of the Northeast could dump rain over Baltimore throughout Thursday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAlarms, calls for assistance from ship could not prevent tragedy\n\nDetails gathered from the Dali's voyage data recorder present a picture of the last moments before the ship crashed into the bridge as the pilot tried to alert authorities to the disaster that was about to ensue.\n\nThe VDR was recovered by the Coast Guard on Tuesday morning and provided to National Transportation Safety Board officials when they arrived later that day, NTSB investigator Marcel Muise said in a news conference Wednesday night. The agency also said there were two pilots and 21 crew members on the ship, where they remain during the investigation.\n\nMuise said several alarms were heard on the recording at just before 1:25 a.m., followed about a minute later by steering commands and rudder orders.\n\nAt 1:26:39 a.m., the pilot on duty made a radio call for assistance to tug boats in the area, and 45 seconds later ordered the port anchor dropped.\n\nAt 1:27:25 a.m., the pilot said on a radio call the Dali had lost power and was nearing the bridge. Around that same time the officer on duty for the Maryland Transportation Authority told officers who were at both ends of the bridge for the road repairs to close traffic, which likely saved lives.\n\nAt 1:29:33 a.m., as the powerless Dali was drifting at 8 mph, the VDR recorded \"sounds consistent with the collision of the bridge,'' Muise said. Six seconds later, the pilot reported to the Coast Guard that the bridge was down.\n\n'No immediate threat' from leaked hazardous material, official says\n\nAccording to a revised news release from Unified Command, 14 of the 56 containers with hazardous materials aboard the Dali were destroyed when the part of the bridge collapsed onto the cargo ship's bow Tuesday morning.\n\nBut there’s “no immediate threat to the environment” from the materials in the containers, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Kimberly Reaves told USA TODAY on Thursday. “There is no known fuel leaking.”\n\nThe 56 containers held 764 tons of materials classified as hazardous, according to Jennifer Homendy, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Although some of those materials entered the water, testing showed no threat, Reaves said. Testing by an industrial hygienist showed the contents in the water were perfume, soaps and an unspecified resin-like material, she said. “We’ve been doing air monitoring, which shows no organic volatile compounds have entered the water,” Reaves said.\n\nCrews placed 2,400 feet of containment boom around the vessel to stop a \"sheen\" on the water from spreading, she said. It would also collect “any kind of debris or hazmat (materials) or oil.” They've also placed 2,400 feet of sorbent boom at the site, according to an afternoon statement from the joint command team overseeing the incident.\n\n“The Coast Guard is working with the Unified Command to address the safety of the public and the environment,” Reaves said, adding that the salvage process was in the planning stages.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\n'Risk was too much' to continue search, expert says\n\nThe officials who made the call to focus on a salvage operation at the site of the Baltimore bridge collapse were faced with a very difficult decision – risk the lives of search crews in what experts have said are dangerous conditions or suspend the recovery attempt for the bodies of the four workers still missing in the wreckage.\n\nThe workers had been on a break and were sitting in their trucks on the bridge when the Dali cargo ship smashed into it and came toppling down. Maryland state police head Butler said the trucks are “encased in the superstructure and concrete” in the water.\n\nStephen Frailey, a partner with the West Coast-based Pacific Maritime Group − which helps with marine salvage and wreckage removal − said he was surprised and saddened to hear the search had been called off so soon.\n\n“We all have to trust in the on-scene experts and this decision had to be difficult for them,” Frailey said. “I believe the murky conditions, currents and tangle of debris must present enough of a hazard that they weighed the continued search effort against potential risk of injury or death to searchers and the risk was too much in this case.”\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nBridge collapse galvanizes Baltimore community\n\nBaltimoreans, including pastors and business owners, have stepped up to offer their support, while residents have donated thousands of dollars in what they described as an outpouring of empathy, sadness and solidarity with the impacted families.\n\nAko Walker, pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus and Saint Patrick, has been tasked with accompanying the family members of the collapse victims during the public grieving process, trying to find the delicate balance between providing comfort and knowing when to give them space while also fielding interview requests from scores of media outlets that have descended upon the city.\n\n\"These families need a lot, a lot of support on all levels, spiritual, physical and emotional,\" he said. \"The community here will try its best to be of assistance.\"\n\nLatino Racial Justice Circle set a goal of raising $18,000 in donations to support families of the victims, organizer Katherine Jakuta said on the fundraiser’s website. Within nine hours, the nonprofit had raised more than $98,000.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nInsurers could face losses up to $4 billion, experts say\n\nThe bridge collapse could cost insurers billions of dollars in claims, analysts say, and one put the toll at as much as $4 billion, which would make the tragedy a record shipping insurance loss.\n\n\"Depending on the length of the blockage and the nature of the business-interruption coverage for the Port of Baltimore, insured losses could total between $2 billion and $4 billion,\" said Marcos Alvarez, managing director for global insurance ratings at Morningstar DBRS. That would surpass the record insured losses of the Costa Concordia luxury cruise liner disaster in 2012, he said.\n\nInitial estimates of the cost of rebuilding the bridge, which is likely to be paid by the federal government, are at $600 million, economic software analysis company IMPLAN said. The closure of the port for just one month could see a total loss of $28 million for Maryland, according to IMPLAN analysis.\n\n– Reuters\n\nCould tugboats have prevented the crash? Yes, experts say\n\nA pair of tugboats helped the Dali unmoor itself from the main terminal at the Port of Baltimore and orient the ship toward open waters early Tuesday. But they broke away before the massive ship navigated under the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n\nHad the tugboats accompanied the ship all the way under the bridge, some experts said, they might have been able to stop, slow or steer it away before it smashed into one of the span's support columns.\n\nSuch a scenario should be standard operating procedure in all ports, said Capt. Ashok Pandey, a master mariner and associate professor of maritime business at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. But he said the industry’s reliance on tugs has waned over the years as technological advancements gave many ships the ability to maneuver through channels independently.\n\n“We went wrong by simply equipping ships with bow and stern thrusters that we use in lieu of tugs to maneuver in and out of the ports,” Pandey told USA TODAY. “When we are getting into ports like Baltimore, within a few miles of the bridge, that's too important an asset that we must think of protecting it by all means possible. And we can do that. We can easily do that.”\n\nKevin Calnan, assistant professor of marine transportation at California State University Maritime Academy, said tugboats “definitely” could have stopped the Dali from hitting the bridge. He said he has been in similar situations where the power went out and “having tugs there basically saved the day.”\n\nMore:Tugboats left before ship reached Baltimore bridge. They might have saved it.\n\n– Emily Le Coz and Trevor Hughes\n\nOrioles to honor victims of Baltimore bridge collapse on opening day\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles planned to honor the victims of the bridge collapse, their families and first responders before Thursday afternoon's season opener at home.\n\nThe Orioles scheduled a moment of silence and planned to lower during the national anthem a replica of the flag that flew over Fort McHenry when Francis Scott Key wrote the Star-Spangled Banner, the baseball team said in news release.\n\nThe ship underwent routine engine maintenance at Baltimore port\n\nThe container ship, the Dali, underwent \"routine engine maintenance\" at the port before it set out on a weekslong journey to Sri Lanka, lost power and crashed into the bridge, U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath said, adding that the Coast Guard was not informed of any issues with the vessel or its engine. The National Transportation Safety Board has not stated a cause for the crash, citing ongoing investigations.\n\nThe 9-year-old container ship was involved in at least one prior accident before it crashed into the Baltimore bridge. In 2016, the Dali struck a loading pier made of stone while leaving port in Antwerp, Belgium, causing damage to the ship’s stern, according to VesselFinder.com, a site that tracks ships across the world. An investigation found the ship’s master and pilot had made a mistake and were to blame. The ship required repair and a full inspection before being returned to service.\n\nDuring an inspection in June, officials discovered a deficiency with the Dali's \"propulsion and auxiliary machinery (gauges, thermometers, etc),\" according to the Tokyo MOU, an intergovernmental maritime authority in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dali was carrying the cargo of Maersk, the major shipping company that chartered it.

They are standard equipment in ports worldwide and are especially useful to help ships with docking and undocking.\n\nOn Tuesday, a pair of tugboats operated by McAllister Towing and Transportation did just that, helping the Dali unmoor itself from the main terminal at the Port of Baltimore and orient the ship toward the open waters.\n\nBut they broke away before the massive ship navigated under the bridge, as is common practice. Minutes later, the Dali appeared to lose power and propulsion, sending the craft adrift and directly into one of the bridge’s support columns. The steel-truss bridge immediately collapsed into the frigid Patapsco River.\n\nThe accident is igniting debate over the proliferation of “megaships” that fuel today’s commercial transportation industry and whether port protocols have ramped up to safely accommodate them. Although the Dali is average-sized compared to many of these behemoths, the devastation it caused in Baltimore was formidable.\n\nLive updates:Two bodies in Baltimore bridge collapse recovered; search for 4 others ends\n\nHad the tugboats accompanied the ship all the way under the bridge, some experts said, they might have been able to stop, slow, or steer it away from danger.\n\nSuch a scenario should be standard operating procedure in all ports, said Capt. Ashok Pandey, a master mariner and associate professor of maritime business at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. But he said the industry’s reliance on tugs has waned over the years as technological advancements gave many ships the ability to maneuver through channels independently.\n\nTechnology is great, Pandey said, until it fails.\n\n“We went wrong by simply equipping ships with bow and stern thrusters that we use in lieu of tugs to maneuver in and out of the ports,” Pandey said. “When we are getting into ports like Baltimore, within a few miles of the bridge, that's too important an asset that we must think of protecting it by all means possible. And we can do that. We can easily do that.”\n\nIt may be rare for a ship to lose power at such a high-stakes moment, but it clearly does happen, and he said tugboats could have averted catastrophe.\n\nImplementing such a practice would require a significant investment for U.S. ports, which either own and operate their own tugboats or contract out for tug services. Those costs are then rolled into the ports’ fees charged to shipping companies who use their facilities.\n\n“There are a finite number of tugs, and 99.9% of the time there are no issues,” said Sal Mercogliano, a former merchant mariner and current maritime historian at Campbell University who also hosts a YouTube show called “What’s Going On With Shipping?”\n\n“If the port required tug escorts in and out, then they would not be able to help other ships dock, and undock,” Mercogliano said. “It would need more tugs, and the question becomes, how much will this cost, and will it be passed on to the consumer?”\n\nBecause ports compete with each other for shipping business, he said, it’s unlikely that one port would mandate tug escorts unless all of the ports did it for fear of losing lucrative contracts. Shipping companies want the most efficient and cost-effective deal and will simply move to the next port if confronted with higher costs or longer waits.\n\nMercogliano said he’s not even sure tugboats would have been able to stop the Dali from hitting the bridge. When its power appeared to fail, the ship was going about 8 knots – roughly 9 mph – with a weight of over 100,000 tons.\n\n“It would be like a Prius trying to move a Mack truck on the highway,” he said.\n\nRealities of the container ship arms race\n\nThe Dali isn’t even big compared to other container ships hauling goods from port to port these days.\n\nOver the past several decades, newly constructed ships have ballooned to gigantic proportions with load-carrying capacities that used to require five or six ships. The largest container vessel in the 1980s had a maximum capacity of 4,300 20-foot containers – otherwise referred to as TEUs, or 20-foot equivalent units – the standard unit of measurement for cargo capacity.\n\nToday’s largest ship, the MSC Irina, has a capacity of 24,346 TEUs.\n\nThe Dali, by comparison, has a capacity of just under 10,000 TEUs, making it the typical “meat and potatoes of container ships,” said Kevin Calnan, assistant professor of marine transportation at California State University Maritime Academy.\n\nLike most container ships, Calnan said, the Dali has one engine and one propeller. Its emergency diesel generator, standard in all such vessels, has enough power to keep key systems going – but not enough to restart the engine or provide propulsion.\n\nIn a video posted to social media, lights on the Dali shut off, then turned back on, then shut off again before the ship struck the bridge. Experts said that was likely the generator as it powered up the lights but not the engine.\n\nIt would have taken a second engine on board to fully power the ship and restore propulsion at that point. But Calnan said nobody in the commercial shipping industry is advocating for two engines because of their size and cost.\n\n“Cargo is money, and companies want to maximize the amount of space they want to put cargo in, so to build a ship with a whole other engine would be taking up the space of, like, 150 containers on that ship,” he said. “Unfortunately, there’s not too much movement to require these ships to have two engines.”\n\nCalnan, who has worked and sailed on numerous ships during his career, is among the experts who believe tugboats “definitely” could have stopped the Dali from hitting the bridge. He said he has been in similar situations where the power went out and “having tugs there basically saved the day.”\n\nIt may take a disaster for industry and ports to change\n\nThe bigger the boats and the more sophisticated the technology, the fewer the crew members on board. The Dali's crew is 22-strong.\n\nIn his 26 years sailing on commercial ships, Capt. Mike Campbell said he witnessed that shift to smaller crews as automation and electronics made it possible to do more with less when it came to docking, navigating and maintaining the engines.\n\n“I had captains who would turn the radar off in the middle of the day because they didn't want to wear it out, and you'd just go off visual cues, take readings off lighthouses. Now everything is chips and boards,” he said. “And people are more dependent or reliant on it because they are more reliable.”\n\nCampbell, now a professor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy and master of the training ship Kennedy, said he’s also seen captains push to meet tight schedules, recalling a time when several other chemical carriers owned by competitors sailed out of the Port of Philadelphia into bad weather. His ship stayed put for three days, and arrived in Houston, safely, a day behind schedule. The other ships, he said, all had to sail to shipyards for repairs caused by the storm.\n\n“I was fortunate that the people I sailed under, my mentors, they never worried about the schedule. It was always about the safe operation of the ship,” he said. “You don't want to push things.”\n\nMariners are always worried about their schedules now, Pandey said.\n\nThe shipping industry has become so highly competitive, with companies all vying for a slice of the business, that crews are more likely to leave port without containers than wait on a late shipment and risk falling behind. Ships typically go from port to port, spending anywhere from six to eight hours in each before moving on to the next.\n\nHe called it a race to nowhere in which everyone – from the ports to the shipping companies – is playing along.\n\nU.S. ports have spent billions of dollars over the years adapting to the new reality – upgrading their facilities and dredging their channels deep enough to accommodate these massive ships. Some experts warn they could get even bigger in the future, possibly doubling in cargo capacity at some point.\n\nAmid the race to compete for the revenue and jobs brought by these ever-larger ships, port authorities seem to have forgotten about protecting their critical infrastructure, according to Pandley, the former master mariner. He said Tuesday’s accident might be the wake-up call they need to do some real soul-searching.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the American Association of Port Authorities to ask its thoughts on requiring tug escorts or any other measures to avert the kind of disaster that happened in Baltimore, but a spokesman said nobody was immediately available to take those questions.\n\nUnfortunately, experts said, it often takes a tragedy to improve an industry.\n\nThat’s what happened after the 1989 Exxon-Valdez oil spill in Alaska when the U.S. government required double-hull construction for all newly built oil tank ships and all oil tank barges in American waters. California passed a law in the aftermath of that disaster, requiring all oil tankers to have tug escorts in its ports and harbors.\n\n“We have a saying that the laws are written in blood,” said Roland Rexha, international secretary-treasurer of the Marine Engineers’ Beneficial Association, the oldest maritime union in the United States.\n\n“Knowing what we know now, could we have had tugs accompany the ship to the bridge? Sure. But what were the issues that caused the vessel to lose power in the first place?” he said. “There will be an investigation, and we’re hopeful that the lessons learned will lead to an active change in how things are operated.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/03/26/cargo-ship-hits-bridge-francis-scott-key-bridge-baltimore-maryland/73103196007/", "title": "Cargo ship hits bridge in Baltimore, causing collapse.

Its crew warned Maryland officials of a possible collision because they had lost control.\n\n“The vessel notified MD Department of Transportation (MDOT) that they had lost control of the vessel” and a collision with the bridge “was possible,” according to an unclassified Department of Homeland Security report. “The vessel struck the bridge causing a complete collapse.”\n\nAn official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed to USA TODAY that the DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is working with federal, state, and local officials “to understand the potential impacts of this morning’s collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.”\n\nClay Diamond, executive director, American Pilots’ Association, told USA TODAY power issues are not unusual on cargo ships, which are so large they cannot easily course correct.\n\n“It’s likely that virtually every pilot in the country has experienced a power loss of some kind (but) it generally is momentary,” Diamond said. “This was a complete blackout of all the power on the ship, so that’s unusual. Of course this happened at the worst possible location.”\n\nThe ship in Tuesday's crash, Dali, was involved in at least one prior accident when it collided with a shipping pier in Belgium.\n\nThat 2016 incident occurred as the Dali was leaving port in Antwerp and struck a loading pier made of stone, causing damage to the ship’s stern, according to VesselFinder.com, a site that tracks ships across the world. An investigation determined a mistake made by the ship’s master and pilot was to blame.\n\nNo one was injured in that crash, although the ship required repair and a full inspection before being returned to service. The pier – or berth – was also seriously damaged and had to be closed.\n\nVesselFinder reports that the Dali was chartered by Maersk, the same company chartering it during the Baltimore harbor incident.\n\nThe 9-year-old container ship had passed previous inspections during its time at sea, but during one such inspection in June at the Port of San Antonio in Chile, officials discovered a deficiency with its \"propulsion and auxiliary machinery (gauges, thermometers, etc),\" according to the Tokyo MOU, an intergovernmental maritime authority in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe report provided no other information about the deficiency except to note that it was not serious enough to remove the ship from service.\n\nFollow here for live updates:Baltimore's Key Bridge collapses after ship strike; construction crew missing: Live Updates\n\nWhy did Dali crash into the Baltimore bridge?\n\nOfficials said Tuesday they’re investigating the collision, including whether systems on board lost electricity early Tuesday morning, which could be related to mechanical failure, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAccidents at sea, known as marine casualties, are not uncommon, the source told USA TODAY. However, “allisions,” in which a moving object strikes a stationary one with catastrophic results, are far less common. The investigation of the power loss aboard the Dali, a Singapore-flagged vessel, will be a high priority.\n\nIn a video posted to social media, lights on the Dali shut off, then turned back on, then shut off again before the ship struck a support pier on the bridge.\n\nNumerous cargo and cruise ships have lost power over the years.\n\nThe International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea requires all international vessels to have two independent sources of electricity, both of which should be able to maintain the ship's seaworthiness on their own, according to a safety study about power failures on ships, citing the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.\n\nThe Dali's emergency generator was likely responsible for the lights coming back on after the initial blackout, Diamond said.\n\n“There was still some steerage left when they initially lost power,” he said. “We’ve been told the ship never recovered propulsion. The emergency generator is a diesel itself – so if you light off the generator, that’s also going to put off a puff of exhaust.”\n\nUnder maritime law, all foreign flagged vessels must be piloted into state ports by a state licensed pilot so the Dali's pilot is licensed by Association of Maryland Pilots.\n\nDiamond described the incident based on information from the Maryland agency that licensed the pilot aboard the ship. His organization represents that group and all other state piloting agencies in the US.\n\n“The pilot was directing navigation of the ship as it happened,” he said. “He asked the captain to get the engines back online. They weren’t able to do that, so the pilot took all the action he could. He tried to steer, to keep the ship in the channel. He also dropped the ship’s anchor to slow the ship and guide the direction.\n\n“Neither one was enough. The ship never did regain its engine power.”\n\nHow big is the Dali ship?\n\nThe Dali is a 984-foot container vessel built in 2015 by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea. With a cruising speed of about 22 knots – roughly 25 mph. It has traveled the world carrying goods from port to port.\n\nThe ship, constructed of high-strength steel, has one engine and one propeller, according to MarineTraffic.com.\n\nThe Dali arrived in Baltimore on Sunday from the Port of Norfolk in Virginia. Before that, it had been in New York and came through the Panama Canal.\n\nIt remains at the scene of the collapse as authorities investigate.\n\nWho owns and operates the Dali?\n\nIt is owned by the Singapore-based Grace Ocean Pte Ltd but managed by Synergy Marine Group, also based in Singapore. It was carrying Maersk customers’ cargo, according to a statement from the shipping company.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by this incident and are closely monitoring the situation,” Maersk said in the statement.\n\nSynergy, which describes itself as a leading ship manager with more than 600 vessels under its guidance, issued a statement on its website acknowledging the incident and reporting no injuries among its crew and no pollution in the water.

Those who were killed included a driver of an empty bus, the driver of the motorcycle and three people in trucks that went into the river, according to city officials.\n\n“Improper operations” by the ship’s crew caused the collision, according to officials at the city’s press conference.\n\nThe container ship Lianghui 688 collided with the Lixinsha Bridge twice while navigating through the waterway. The city official said the ship hit adjacent bridge piers, leading to the rupture of the bridge deck over the space between the piers.\n\nBased on reports obtained by online news platform Jimu News, the ship measured about 197 feet in length and 59 feet in height and transmitted its final position around 5:29 a.m. on Feb. 22.\n\nWeibing Peng, an expert on bridge construction and collapse incidents from Zhejiang University of Technology analyzed the incident and told Jimu News that the ship first hit one pier on a diagonal course, then swung nearly parallel to the bridge and hit a second pier.

It was coming from Singapore.\n\nIt would take nearly a week to free the ship from the bridge and resume traffic, the Merco Press reported.\n\nWhy did the Francis Scott Key bridge collapse?\n\nThe bridge collapsed after the Dali slammed into one of its main support columns.\n\nBridges work by transferring the load they carry ‒ cars, trucks or trains ‒ through their support beams onto columns or piles sunk deep into the ground. They also depend on those support columns to hold them up.\n\n“You go frame by frame in the video and you can see the support removed, and then as you watch, the entire structure comes down,\" Benjamin W. Schafer, a civil engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore told USA TODAY. “Literally the whole bridge comes down as a rigid body.”\n\nThough modern bridges are typically designed so a small failure in one area doesn’t \"propagate\" to the entire bridge, steel-truss structures, like the Francis Scott Key Bridge are particularly at risk.

The city official said the ship hit adjacent bridge piers, leading to the rupture of the bridge deck over the space between the piers.\n\nBased on reports obtained by online news platform Jimu News, the ship measured about 197 feet in length and 59 feet in height and transmitted its final position around 5:29 a.m. on Feb. 22.\n\nWeibing Peng, an expert on bridge construction and collapse incidents from Zhejiang University of Technology analyzed the incident and told Jimu News that the ship first hit one pier on a diagonal course, then swung nearly parallel to the bridge and hit a second pier. The second pier tilted, resulting in the partial collapse of the bridge.\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton and Dian Zhang, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}]}

New photos show person wanted by ...", "text": "Editor's note: USA TODAY has continuing coverage on Friday, December 6, about the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nA day after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot on a New York City sidewalk, police still have not found the shooter but they did release photos Thursday of a person wanted for questioning.\n\nThe two surveillance pictures show a \"person of interest'' without a face mask wearing a hooded jacket similar to one worn by the masked person captured on photos and videos from Wednesday morning's shooting outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\n\n\"This does not appear to be a random act of violence,\" the New York Police Department wrote in a statement accompanying the photos made public Thursday. \"All indications are that it was a (premeditated), targeted attack.\"\n\nNear the hotel, investigators discovered a cellphone they had begun to analyze forensically, as well as three bullet casings inscribed with the words \"deny,” “defend” and “depose,\" multiple news outlets reported Thursday. Those terms have been associated with insurance companies' strategies for rejecting claims, but police have said they are still working to determine the shooter's motive.\n\nBefore 7 a.m. Wednesday, a masked gunman waited outside the Hilton for several minutes before Thompson, 50, neared the building, where he was scheduled to attend his company's annual conference for investors.\n\nSurveillance video shows the person stepping behind Thompson and firing into his back. At one point, the shooter's gun appeared to jam, but the gunman managed to clear the malfunction and continue firing, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny said at a news conference, describing the shooter as likely \"proficient in the use of firearms.\"\n\nThompson, who arrived in New York from Minnesota on Monday to attend the conference, was the highest-ranking executive at UnitedHealthcare, one of the largest insurance providers in the nation.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the company said it was focusing on supporting Thompson's family, ensuring the safety of its employees, and working with law enforcement to \"bring the perpetrator to justice.\"\n\n\"So many patients, consumers, health care professionals, associations, government officials and other caring people have taken time out of their day to reach out. We are thankful, even as we grieve,\" the company said. \"We, at UnitedHealth Group, will continue to be there for those who depend upon us for their health care.\"\n\nPolice finding new clues about shooter\n\nSeveral clues emerged about the gunman's actions before the shooting. Authorities believe he arrived by bus on Nov. 24 and stayed at a hostel in the Upper West Side, booking a room with a fake New Jersey ID, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe bus began its trip to New York from Atlanta, but it's not clear where the gunman boarded it, according to CNN, which also reported his unmasked photos were captured at the hostel's front desk during an exchange with a clerk.\n\nPolice have said they recovered a water bottle and the wrapper for a protein bar they believe the man bought at a Starbucks close to the hotel, and they're being analyzed. But the Times reported a fingerprint on the bottle was too smudged to help the investigation.\n\nNYPD releases images of 'person of interest'\n\nAn NYPD online posting with the new photos Thursday says they show a \"person of interest wanted for questioning\" in the shooting.\n\nThe person in the images is wearing a hooded jacket and a black backpack that appears different from the gray backpack the shooter carried during the shooting early Wednesday morning.\n\n\"The full investigative efforts of the NYPD are continuing, and we are asking for the public’s help,\" the department said in a statement on the X platform. Police are offering a $10,000 reward for information that could lead to an arrest and conviction.\n\nExtensive camera system helping pursuit\n\nThe intense hunt for the shooter has relied on footage from the thousands of surveillance cameras across New York City, along with drones and trained dogs.\n\nThe camera system, mostly installed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, allows police to monitor feeds in real time and to review previous footage, said Felipe Rodriguez, a former NYPD detective sergeant who now teaches criminal justice at John Jay College.\n\n\"It's called the real-time crime center: actionable intelligence can be relayed to the responding officers in the field,\" Rodriguez told Reuters.\n\nPolice are also pursuing leads about a man who stayed at a hostel in the Upper West Side, according to media reports.\n\nBullet casings say 'deny,' 'defend' and 'depose': Reports\n\nInvestigators discovered writing on the bullet casings found at the scene of the fatal shooting, The New York Times, NBC News and other outlets reported, citing police sources with knowledge on the investigation.\n\nThe words discovered written on the bullet casings were “deny,” “defend” and “depose,” sources told NBC and the Associated Press.\n\nThe words are similar to the title of a book critical of the insurance industry published in 2010 titled \"Delay Deny Defend.\"\n\nIn addition, police discovered a water bottle and a candy wrapper in the area where the shooter was waiting for Thompson, ABC reported, adding that the evidence, as well as the cellphone, are believed to be linked to the shooter.\n\nShooter last seen riding e-bike into Central Park\n\nAfter the gunman shot Thompson, police say he hid in an alleyway before boarding an e-bike and riding into Central Park, where he was last seen.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, police officials said the shooter got on a CitiBike, New York City's official bike share system that is run by Lyft. The ride-share company did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment about whether a CitiBike was used by the gunman.\n\nPolice released several images of the shooter in which the gunman can be seen wearing a dark-colored, hooded jacket, a black facemask, black-and-white sneakers and a distinctive gray backpack.\n\nThompson had received threats, wife says\n\nThompson's wife, Paulette Thompson, told NBC News her husband had been the target of threats, but she didn't know their nature or from whom.\n\n\"I don’t know, a lack of coverage? I don’t know details,\" she told the news outlet. \"I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\"\n\nAbout 12 hours after Thompson was killed, police in his hometown of Maple Grove, Minnesota, and the Minneapolis Police bomb squad investigated a bomb threat on his home but determined it was likely a hoax.\n\nAdditionally, UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, was aware of concerning threats against its executives, CNN reported, citing a source with knowledge of the investigation.\n\nThe company said it had no further comment in response to questions about threats allegedly made against UnitedHealth Group executives.\n\nThompson lived in Maple Grove, Minnesota, about 15 miles northwest of Minneapolis. The police departments in both cities said they didn't have any records of threats against him.\n\nWho was Brian Thompson?\n\nThompson started at UnitedHealth Group in 2004, and over the next two decades climbed up the ranks, working in several departments before taking up his most recent role overseeing its health insurance unit.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, the company described Thompson as \"a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him.\"\n\nHe graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a Bachelor's in business administration and accounting, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nThompson is survived by his two sons and wife, Paulette Thompson, a physical therapist of over 20 years who graduated from the same college as her husband, according to her workplace bio.\n\nMike Tuffin, president and CEO of AHIP, a commercial health insurance trade association, said in a statement he was \"Heartbroken and horrified by the loss of my friend Brian Thompson.\"\n\n\"He was a devoted father, a good friend to many and a refreshingly candid colleague and leader,\" Tuffin said. \"All of us at AHIP are thinking of Brian’s family and his UnitedHealth Group colleagues at this difficult time.”\n\nThompson accused of insider trading in pension fund's lawsuit\n\nEarlier this year, Thompson and several other UnitedHealth Group executives were sued by a pension fund in Hollywood, Florida, that accused them of selling millions of dollars in company stock before news of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation sank the company's stock.\n\nIn February 2022, the DOJ challenged UnitedHealth’s acquisition of Change Healthcare, a technology company that provides a highly used payment processing system. Months later, a judge permitted the transaction.\n\nTwo years later, in February, the Wall Street Journal reported the DOJ had reopened its antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth, plummeting the company's stock.\n\nIn a lawsuit, the City of Hollywood Firefighters’ Pension Fund alleged that \"UnitedHealth was aware of the DOJ investigation since at least October 2023 ... Instead of disclosing this material investigation to investors or the public, UnitedHealth insiders sold more than $120 million of their personally held UnitedHealth shares.\"\n\nThompson, according to the lawsuit, sold over $15 million of his UnitedHealth shares. The lawsuit remains active in Minnesota.\n\nAfter news of the lawsuit broke, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Sen. Edward J. Markey sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, \"urging him to open an insider trading investigation into stock trading by executives at UnitedHealth Group.\" It's unclear if the agency began investigating the company.\n\nLast month, the Department of Justice filed suit on antitrust grounds to prevent UnitedHealth from acquiring the home care and hospice provider Amedisys. UnitedHealth also has been confronting the aftermath of a huge data hack of its Change Healthcare payment processing unit in February, a cyberattack that disrupted medical care for patients and reimbursement to doctors for months.\n\nContributing: Nick Penzenstadler and Mary Walrath-Holdridge, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/09/manhunt-suspect-brian-thompson-killing-updates/76857886007/", "title": "Suspect charged with murder in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page is a summary of news on the arrest of Luigi Mangione in connection with the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson for Monday, Dec. 9. For news updates on the investigation, visit USA TODAY's article on the arrest of Luigi Mangione for Tuesday, Dec. 10.\n\nA Maryland man arrested at a McDonald's restaurant with what police say was a gun and silencer made with a 3-D printer was charged Monday night with murder and other felonies in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City.\n\nA criminal complaint filed by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, also charged Luigi Nicholas Mangione, 26, with forgery, tampering with records or identification, giving police false ID, and possessing instruments of a crime. He was arraigned and jailed without bail.\n\nAuthorities said they found a 3D-printed handgun and a silencer when they searched Mangione's backpack upon detaining him at the McDonald's. The police officers, responding to a restaurant employee's tip, said they recognized Mangione right away from widely distributed law enforcement photos once he removed his face mask upon their request.\n\n\"We just didn’t think twice about it,\" rookie officer Tyler Frye said at a night news conference. \"We knew that was our guy.’’\n\nAccording to the complaint, Mangione presented a fake New Jersey driver's license when first approached by officers, who said he grew silent and started shaking when they asked if he had recently been in New York City.\n\nThe evening proceedings capped a dramatic day when authorities got a big break with the worker's morning call after searching for Thompson's killer since he was gunned down outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel early Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro commended the worker while chastising those who have celebrated Thompson’s killing because of frustration with health care insurance companies.\n\n\"In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero,\" Shapiro said. \"Hear me on this: He is no hero. The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald’s this morning.\"\n\nMangione family member releases statement after arrest: 'Shocked and devastated'\n\nNino Mangione, a Maryland state delegate, is a cousin of Luigi Mangione, according to WBAL-TV. Nino Mangione released a statement on behalf of the family after the arrest Monday night.\n\n\"We only know what we have read in the media,\" Nino Mangione said in the statement, posted on X. \"Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"\n\nThe Baltimore-area family issued the statement before New York City prosecutors charged Mangione with murder. The 26-year-old is currently being held in Pennsylvania but is expected to be extradited to New York.\n\nThe targeted killing of the health care executive and the ensuing dayslong manhunt for a suspect has quickly spread the Mangione name around America. But in Baltimore, the family is better known for their contributions to the area.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Michael Loria, Chris Kenning, and Charles Ventura\n\nBusted for fake ID: How authorities nabbed Luigi Mangione\n\nAltoona police arriving at a local McDonald’s on a tip asked a man resembling the United Healthcare CEO shooter if he had been to New York recently and when they did he grew quiet and began to shake, according to a criminal complaint in the arrest of Mangione.\n\nMangione, the person of interest in the killing of Thompson, was at the McDonald’s when a customer spied him and reported him to an employee who then called police, state police said at a news conference Monday evening. Mangione was wearing the signature blue surgical mask the shooter was wearing in New York City surveillance footage and seated at the back of the restaurant using a laptop, the Altoona Police Department complaint added.\n\nPolice discovered the identification card Mangione produced — for a Mark Rosario of New Jersey — was fake, at which point he identified himself, according to the criminal complaint. Law enforcement found a black 3D-printed pistol and silencer in Mangione’s backpack, according to charging documents.\n\nFrye, six months on the job, said Mangione \"was very cooperative.\" Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania, according to Pennsylvania court documents.\n\nThe Altoona McDonald’s was the suspected killer’s latest stop in a several-day trek around Pennsylvania that included stop-overs in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, according to state police. New York City prosecutors are expected to file charges soon at which point Mangione could be extradited to Manhattan, said Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.\n\nThe arrest came the same day Thompson was buried in Minnesota, according to officials.\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nNYC police commissioner: Articles found on Mangione 'consistent' with items used by CEO's killer\n\nUpon announcing the arrest of a person of interest earlier Monday, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said a gun, silencer, mask, and fake identification card found on Mangione were \"consistent\" with items believed used by Thompson's killer.\n\n\"We have a strong person of interest in the shooting that shook our city,\" New York Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference. \"It was crucial that we were able to remove him off the streets of America.\"\n\nHandwritten papers found on Mangione \"speak to his motivation and mindset,\" Tisch said. Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said the three-page document included no other targets but expressed \"ill will toward corporate America.\"\n\nMangione had a ghost gun, which can be assembled at home and is difficult to trace, Kenny said. The gun may have been made on a 3D printer and capable of firing a 9mm round, he added.\n\nAuthorities uncovered numerous videos and photos of the person of interest from which they developed a precise timeline for his escape from the shooting scene and flight from the city. Authorities said Mangione was raised in Maryland, went to college in Pennsylvania, and had a last known address in Honolulu.\n\nHere's what we know so far:Who is the man detained in UnitedHealthcare CEO's killing?\n\nGov. Shapiro: 'We are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice'\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro defended the Pennsylvania McDonald’s customer who identified the person of interest in the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO at a news conference Monday evening.\n\n\"In some dark corners this killer is being hailed as a hero,\" Shapiro said of Mangione. \"Hear me on this, he is no hero. The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald's this morning.\"\n\nShapiro’s defense of the customer comes after an outpouring of support online for Mangione, whom many have hailed as sticking up for Americans against the health insurance industry.\n\n“Some attention in this case, especially online, has been deeply disturbed as some want to celebrate this killer,” said Shapiro.\n\nThe arrest of the suspected killer comes just months after the attempted assassination of President-elect Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Shapiro shared he was deeply concerned about what he saw as a troubling trend in the nation.\n\n\"We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences,\" Shapiro said. \"I have no tolerance, nor should anyone for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters most.\"\n\n\"In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice,\" said Shapiro.\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nGoogle pulls McDonald's negative reviews after arrest in UnitedHealth killing\n\nGoogle on Monday removed derogatory reviews about McDonald's after the suspect in the killing of a UnitedHealthcare executive was arrested at its restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where police say a customer alerted a local employee about him.\n\nThe negative comments aimed at McDonald's were the latest in what is known as \"review bombing,\" where an establishment is hit with a litany of bad reviews based on a political view or an occurrence unrelated to its actual business.\n\nIn this case, the negative and one-star reviews showed up after Mangione was captured at a McDonald’s in Altoona. He was spotted eating at the restaurant by a customer who alerted a McDonald's employee, state police said.\n\n\"These reviews violate our policies and have been removed,\" a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n— Reuters\n\nMangione's path from valedictorian to person of interest\n\nA private school valedictorian. An Ivy League graduate. And now a person of interest in the killing of the United HealthCare CEO that's captured the attention of the nation.\n\nMangione — law enforcement’s person of interest captured in Pennsylvania — has an impressive resume and Ivy League education, with the kind of affluent and influential family ties that can often pave a path to a successful future. But now Mangione, who hasn't been charged in the crime, finds himself at the unlikely center of a murder investigation that has sparked a conversation around health care in the U.S. and how untraceable \"ghost guns\" and silencers can be assembled via a 3-D printer.\n\n\"Even early on the class of 2016 was challenging the world around it,\" says Mangione in his Gilman School valedictorian speech in Baltimore. \"The class of 2016’s inventiveness also stems from its incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Mangione was personable, witty, and confident. The news of his arrest shocked the leaders of the prestigious schools he attended.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione’s suspected involvement in this case is deeply distressing news on top of an already awful situation,\" Gilman's Head of School Henry Smyth wrote in a statement. \"Here on campus, our focus will remain on caring for and educating our students.\" Read more here.\n\n— Michael Loria and Chris Kenning, USA TODAY\n\nMagione appeared to approve of 'Unabomber' manifesto\n\nAn online post by a reviewer who appeared to be Mangione was highly supportive of a manifesto written by Ted Kaczynski, known as the \"Unabomber\" who killed three people and injured 23 in a series of mail bombings between 1978 and 1995.\n\nThe Goodreads review from January 2024 was written by a user with a profile name \"Luigi (lnmangione)\" and the same photo Mangione used in other social media profiles.\n\n“It’s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies,'' the reviewer said. \"But it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\"\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nWhat is a ‘ghost gun’ and are they legal?\n\nNew York City officials said early information indicated the firearm seized with Mangione was a so-called ‘ghost gun’ that may have been created on a 3D printer.\n\nThe term refers to un-serialized firearms that are manufactured at home with do-it-yourself kits. Critics of the firearms say they are problematic because they are not traceable like traditional firearms with serial numbers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has announced a federal rule to require manufacturers of the kits to perform background checks and mark the weapons with serial numbers – the same requirement of standard gun producers.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held arguments in October about the regulation, which could be struck down. The ruling would not impact the legality of \"privately made firearms\" by individuals, which are legal for personal use as long as they're not sold or transferred.\n\nThe number of suspected ghost guns recovered by law enforcement and submitted for tracing to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives increased by more than 1,000% between 2017 and 2021. The number more than doubled from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAlumnus Mangione bringing unwanted attention to Penn\n\nOutside Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, reporters gathered and University of Pennsylvania students and West Philadelphia residents rushed by, but no one wanted to talk about Mangione, at least not on the record.\"No comment,\" a young man said brusquely as he walked into the brick twin house, past the red cups and a beer can on the porch. He let the door slam behind him. No one answered the bell.Penn student Paige Nolan said her father, who works near the scene of the shooting in Manhattan, called her when he heard the news. \"He was really curious and wondered who it was,\" Nolan said.\n\nNatasha Yajadda, also a student at the school, said she was surprised someone from an educated, privileged background “would take such violent action.”“It brings attention to the school, and not in a good way,” she said. Neither she nor Nolan, though, thought the alleged actions of one graduate would harm the prestigious university’s reputation.— Phaedra Trethan\n\nInvestigators hail crucial role of public in finding person of interest\n\nTisch, the police commissioner, said the tip from the McDonald's employee in Thompson's slaying is the third recent case in which the public has helped police. A tip also helped with the investigation of a recent triple stabbing in Manhattan and a gunpoint robbery in Queens, during which an NYPD officer was shot. Tisch said the tips \"led to the recovery of crucial evidence.”\n\n\"We should never underestimate the power of the public to be our eyes and ears in these investigations,\" Tisch said.\n\nWhile investigators recovered \"an enormous amount\" of forensic and video evidence in the case, Kenny told reporters Monday the lynchpin came after the release of the photos of the person of interest, which went viral on social media. Hundreds of tips poured in after authorities released the photos and offered $60,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nIt's extremely common for the public to help police identify suspects in all kinds of crimes, which is why the relationship between the police and the community is so important, said Joe Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\"Considering how much money was on the table with the reward money, I mean, the whole country was looking for this guy. He had no friends,\" Giacalone said.\n\nEx-FBI profiler on the investigation: This is not a TV show\n\nFormer FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole told USA TODAY on Monday that she was not surprised at the length of time the investigation took despite the scores of police and FBI agents working the case.\n\n“We expect these cases to be solved overnight, like they do in a TV show. But this is not TV and these cases take more time than that,\" O’Toole said.\n\nO'Toole said fake money from a Monopoly game found in the suspect's backpack had concerned her.\n\n\"He knew the police would find it,\" she said. \"If he thinks this is a game, he may not understand the egregiousness of what he has done. And he may have other targets.\"\n\nPressure on law enforcement to solve crime\n\nChristopher Dennison, an associate professor of sociology and criminology at the University at Buffalo, says the shooting prompted widespread discussion about inequities in the U.S. health care system that likely placed added pressure on authorities to solve the crime. But those pressures aside, time is always of the essence, he said.\n\n\"The chances of finding the offender significantly decrease as we get further away from the incident,\" Dennison said. \"In the end, the last thing anyone wants is for this case to turn into another D.B. Cooper.\"\n\nSuspect was tracked to a bus station\n\nThompson, 50, was shot Wednesday on a Midtown street outside a hotel where he was set to speak at an investment conference. Surveillance cameras show a shooter firing multiple times from behind Thompson at close range at about 6:45 a.m.\n\nPolice, primarily through surveillance cameras around the city, tracked the suspect's movement as he fled on foot before mounting an electric bike and riding into Central Park. He caught a cab around 7 a.m. on the Upper West Side and was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, NYPD's Kenny said.\n\nThe latest photos of the suspect, released late Saturday, appear to have been taken from a camera in the cab and show him wearing a blue medical mask and a hooded jacket. In one photo, he appears to be looking through the partition from the back seat; in the other photo, he is on the street.\n\nPreviously released photos have provided a relatively clear view of his face.\n\nTo them, slain UnitedHealthcare CEOBrian Thompson was a local farm boy\n\nBrian Thompson's roots go back to rural Iowa\n\nTo the world, Thompson was the leader of a major corporation and a brilliant executive whose death last week ignited a massive manhunt. But residents of Hamilton County, Iowa, knew Thompson as a friend, neighbor and classmate. Thompson, 50, was raised on a farm between the small town of Jewell and the even tinier town of Stanhope and graduated from the communities' shared South Hamilton High School in 1993.\n\nTaylor Hill says he and Thompson grew close in their middle and high school years before Thompson left for college at the University of Iowa. They played golf, basketball and baseball together, trading sports cards and making mix tapes of the hits they listened to while growing up.\n\n\"He was one of the smartest kids, if not the smartest, and I would say the smartest person I've ever known,\" Hill said. \"He was probably smarter than half our teachers. And the thing with our teachers is they knew it, too.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Kyle Werner, Des Moines Register\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/08/ceo-brian-thompson-shooting-identity-killer-updates/76849698007/", "title": "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shooting updates: Photos ...", "text": "The manhunt for the killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson intensified Sunday after New York authorities released two new photos of the widely sought suspect and hinted the killer's identity may have been determined.\n\nThe photos appear to have been taken from a camera in a cab, which authorities believe the suspect boarded after the shooting and show him wearing a blue medical mask and a hooded jacket.

Joseph Kenny, the chief of detectives, told CNN the police have video of the gunman going into a bus terminal the day of the attack.\n\n“We have reason to believe that the person in question has left New York City,” Commissioner Jessica Tisch told the outlet.\n\nPreviously, the New York Police Department released surveillance images on Thursday of a \"person of interest\" checking into a youth hostel and asked for the public's help finding the man, who was wearing a jacket similar to one worn by the gunman but a different backpack.\n\nInvestigators are analyzing a cellphone found near the scene along with three bullet casings inscribed with the words \"deny,” “defend” and “depose,\" multiple news outlets reported. Those terms have been associated with insurance companies' strategies for rejecting claims, but police are still working to determine the shooter's motive.\n\n'Meticulous,' maybe professional: Experts on killer\n\nEven when the weapon appeared to jam, the killer remained composed. He stood over Thompson, fired again and walked away, leaving behind bullet casings inscribed with messages, multiple news outlets reported\n\nExperts told USA TODAY that the details provide investigators key clues about who the man is ‒ and how tough it will be to catch him.\n\nThe more Michael Alcazar, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, sees video footage of the shooting, the more he believes the shooter may have been a professional.\n\n\"It looks like this guy may have had some experience, and I'm sure investigators are entertaining the possibility,\" said Alcazar, a former detective with the New York City Police Department. \"It definitely crossed my mind.\"\n\nPolice haven’t recovered the gun but the shooter's apparent choice of a bolt-action pistol indicates to Alcazar he had an objective: \"That's a very specific weapon that just needs one shot,\" Alcazar said. \"It shows confidence.\"\n\nOthers aren't so sure.\n\nA professional would have made sure the weapon he planned to use was in proper working order and wouldn't jam, said David Carter, a professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University and director of the university's Intelligence program.\n\n\"A paid assassin would use a revolver, which is more reliable and has no cartridges, or he would pick up the cartridges,\" Carter said.\n\nThe words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose\" etched into bullet casings, according to multiple reports, also indicate a motive that leans toward a personal grudge, according to Carter.\n\n\"There is no reason someone who's a paid killer would do that,\" said Carter, \"because that's evidence, and it's unique evidence.\"\n\nThe shooter seems to have taken steps to plan the attack and conceal his identity, including using a fake ID, wearing a face mask and staying at a hostel. He also did not rent a car but instead fled on foot and then on a bike.\n\nHis use of what appeared to be a silencer also likely helped him escape undetected, Alcazar said.\n\n\"If he used a regular gun, there would be more eyes and more attention on him, it would have caught more attention,\" Alcazar said. \"It’s really smart to help with his getaway.\"\n\nBut Carter and Alcazar both believe the shooter, whether a professional assassin or a person out for revenge or with some other motive, will be caught.\n\n\"He seems to have been very meticulous,\" both in planning and in his escape, Alcazar said. \"So when they're processing the scene and gathering surveillance and evidence, (law enforcement) will have to be just as meticulous.\"\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nHealth insurance CEO murder unleashes Internet vitriol aimed at industry\n\nThe brazen murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed social media scorn at his company and a U.S. health insurance industry that serves as gatekeeper to the nation's $4.5 trillion health care system.\n\nAlthough social media is often filled with hatred and “good riddances” after a high-profile murder, and there have been instances of violence against people involved in health care before, the reaction this time felt different, experts said.\n\nThe Midtown Manhattan murder tapped a groundswell of public anger over an industry the public often only knows through impersonal delays and denials to needed health care, said Wendell Potter, a former CIGNA executive who became a whistleblower against the health insurance industry.\n\n\"I've been hearing for years now from people who have been so frustrated because of denials or delays of care, and this was an opportunity for people to vent and to take out their anger against someone who just became known to them all of a sudden,\" Potter said.\n\nHealth insurer shares fall after UnitedHealthcare executive's murder\n\nShares of health insurance companies including UnitedHealth Group continued to fall on Friday, two days after Thompson, the CEO of the company's health insurance unit, was fatally shot outside a Manhattan hotel.\n\nShares of UnitedHealth were down 4.8% on Friday after a 5% drop on Thursday. Rival insurers Elevance, Centene, CVS Health, and Cigna also fell between 1% and 3% in afternoon trading. Those shares all lost ground on Thursday as well.\n\nThe news comes after Thompson's death sparked a wide social media conversation over frustrations with navigating the U.S. health insurance system, particularly when medical expenses are not covered or insurance claims or requests for care are denied.\n\n\"The anti-insurer sentiment expressed by the public after this event suggests that UnitedHealth and perhaps the industry may need to adjust how they handle coverage decisions,\" said Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback.\n\nThe insurance industry has been facing higher costs over the past few quarters due to increased demand for healthcare under government-backed Medicare plans for older adults or those with disabilities, as well as changes in Medicaid eligibility from states, which has left insurers with more patients who require more medical services.\n\nOfficials testing DNA as police hunt for killer\n\nAfter searching areas where the shooter was seen, police investigating Thompson's slaying have recovered DNA and sent it to the city's medical examiner for testing, according to reports from multiple media outlets.\n\nPolice reportedly were able to recover DNA from a water bottle they believe the shooter bought at a Starbucks close to the hotel, the New York Post reported. The New York Times reported Friday it's not clear where the DNA was found or whether the DNA could immediately identify the gunman, adding that investigators would still need to find a match in a law enforcement or other database.\n\nNYC police hunt for executive’s assassin as 48-hour window closes\n\nSecurity experts said the first 48-hours after such a crime are a critical window of opportunity to catch a fleeing suspect – a timeframe that has now passed.\n\n“The clock is running,” said Felipe Rodriguez, a former NYPD police detective and an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “They still haven’t recovered gun, the bicycle, the backpack. The longer it takes, they could be losing vital pieces of evidence.”\n\nRodriguez said solving the case is like putting together a difficult jigsaw puzzle.\n\n“You start from edges first and work your way in, but right now they might not have all the pieces. But the case is moving forward,” he said.\n\nRodriguez added that police must cast a much wider net than just New York City, because the suspect might have fled the city or state.\n\nHealth care companies pull executive info after shooting\n\nCVS Health removed photos of its executive leadership from its website following the Thompson's shooting, a spokesperson for the company confirmed to USA TODAY Friday. Spokesperson Ethan Slavin declined to answer questions about why the photos were taken down.\n\nA copy of the company's \"Meet our leadership team\" page from the day of the shooting saved by the Internet Archive features a stack of photos accompanying links to the bios. As of Friday, depictions of the smiling executives, from the CEO and president to an array of vice presidents are gone.\n\nMedica, a nonprofit health plan that serves nearly 1.5 million people, also has removed biographical information about the company’s executives from its website as a precaution in response to Thompson's killing, spokesperson Greg Bury told USA TODAY. The firm is also temporarily closing all six locations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and North Dakota.\n\nHealth insurer Centene, took down pictures of executives from their corporate websites in an apparent tightening of security measures. Centene said late on Thursday it would no longer hold an in-person investor day next week, and the event would be streamed online.\n\nThe moves come as executives and their families across many sectors, including health care, have faced a spike in digital and physical threats as a result of \"increased discontent, increased cyber risks, increased vitriol,\" according to Chris Pierson, CEO of security firm BlackCloak.\n\nPierson said its become more difficult to protect executives because so many of their activities are made public – from board meetings to conferences and speaking engagements. Thompson was due to speak at UnitedHealth's annual investor conference at the hotel where he was slain.\n\n\"For board members and corporate executives, their digital lives, their personal and work lives are just so incredibly intertwined that the risks and threats that they now face are much greater than ever before, and the same thing applies to their families,\" Pierson said.\n\nNew York mayor not worried, says CEO killer will be caught\n\nIn an interview on NY1 Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams said he has confidence the NYPD will capture the killer, even as precious time ticks away since the ambush.\n\n“We’re on the right track. We’re going to bring this person to justice,\" he said, according to the New York Times. “This person was fully masked, and we used good old-fashioned police work to come up with the picture you have.”\n\nPolice finding new clues about shooter\n\nInvestigators are following a trail of clues the gunman left before and after the shooting. Authorities believe he arrived by bus on Nov. 24 and stayed at a hostel in the Upper West Side, booking a room with a fake New Jersey ID, the Times reported.\n\nThe bus began its trip to New York from Atlanta, but it's not clear where the gunman boarded it, according to CNN, which also reported his unmasked photos were captured at the hostel's front desk during an exchange with a clerk.\n\nPolice have said they recovered a water bottle and the wrapper for a protein bar they believe the man bought at a Starbucks close to the hotel, and they're being analyzed. But the Times reported a fingerprint on the bottle was too smudged to help the investigation.\n\nPolice are offering a $10,000 reward for information that could lead to an arrest and conviction.\n\nNYPD analyzing surveillance video to identify killer\n\nNew York City police continue to review images from public and private cameras to determine the gunman’s movements before and after the shooting.\n\nAt 6:17 a.m., cameras inside a Starbucks at West 56th Street and 6th Avenue, two blocks from the hotel, recorded the suspect at a counter, CBS News reports. Though his face is partially hidden, police are using facial recognition technology to try to identify him, the BBC reports.\n\nAbout half an hour later, surveillance video captured Thompson being shot outside the hotel.\n\nMore:How the NYPD is analyzing surveillance video to identify Brian Thompson's killer\n\nPolice have released several images of the shooter in which the gunman can be seen wearing a dark-colored jacket with a hood over his head, a black facemask, black-and-white sneakers and a distinctive gray backpack. The NYPD on Thursday released new surveillance images of a person they described as a \"person of interest wanted for questioning\" in the shooting.\n\nWho was Brian Thompson?\n\nThompson lived in Maple Grove, Minnesota, about 15 miles northwest of Minneapolis. The police departments in both cities said they didn't have any records of threats against him.\n\nThompson is survived by his two sons and wife, Paulette Thompson, a physical therapist of over 20 years who graduated from the same college as her husband, according to her workplace bio.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a Bachelor's in business administration and accounting, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nThompson started at UnitedHealth Group in 2004, and over the next two decades climbed up the ranks, working in several departments before taking up his most recent role overseeing its health insurance unit. The company on Wednesday described Thompson as \"a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him.\"\n\nMike Tuffin, president and CEO of AHIP, a commercial health insurance trade association, said in a statement he was \"Heartbroken and horrified by the loss of my friend Brian Thompson.\"\n\n\"He was a devoted father, a good friend to many and a refreshingly candid colleague and leader,\" Tuffin said. \"All of us at AHIP are thinking of Brian’s family and his UnitedHealth Group colleagues at this difficult time.”\n\n(This is a developing story and will be updated.)\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, Jeanine Santucci, George Petras, Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla,David Oliver and Mary Walrath-Holdridge; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/09/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooter-reward/76867850007/", "title": "Reward in search forUnitedHealthcare CEO's killer: Who gets it?", "text": "Six days after the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street, police announced Monday they had a suspect in custody after a robust campaign asking for the public's help in identifying the shooter.\n\nThe search intensified over the weekend when the FBI joined the New York Police Department in the investigation, adding an additional $50,000 reward to NYPD's $10,000. With information flooding in, the NYPD ultimately said a tip from a McDonald's restaurant employee allowed authorities to identify and locate the suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione.\n\nMangione was arrested on five charges in Pennsylvania Monday, but has yet to be charged in relation to the killing itself, as of Monday evening. Police said Monday that a search found Mangione in possession of fake IDs, a \"ghost\" gun and silencer and clothes and a mask matching the suspected shooter.\n\nMore:People are obsessing over the man charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO. How did we get here?\n\nWith law enforcement agencies lauding the tip given by the McDonald's employee as crucial, questions have arisen as to the offered rewards and who will end up getting them. Here's what would need to happen for the up to $60,000 in rewards to be paid out.\n\nUpdates:Person of interest detained by police in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing\n\nWho is the 'person of interest' arrested in CEO shooting?\n\nMangione, 26 was initially detained as a person of interest Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania on gun charges. Mangione has not been charged with murder or other crimes related to the CEO's killing, as of Monday evening.\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said he was found with a gun, mask and fake identification card \"consistent\" with items believed used by Thompson's killer.\n\nThe man was identified Monday based on a tip after he was recognized by a McDonald’s restaurant employee, Tisch said. The employee told police they saw him around 9:15 a.m. in the restaurant \"acting suspiciously\" and carrying multiple fraudulent IDs, as well as a U.S. passport.\n\nNYPD, FBI offer a combined $60,000 for UnitedHealthcare shooter\n\nThe NYPD initially offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Thompson's shooter. Over the weekend, the FBI added the shooter to the Most Wanted list and publicized an additional $50,000 reward.\n\nHundreds of tips poured in after authorities released multiple photos and offered $60,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWho would get the reward for turning the killer in?\n\nAt this point, no one is entitled to the award and likely won't be for a while.\n\nWhile law enforcement agencies are asking for the public's assistance in finding the shooter, not just any tip that proves useful will be rewarded with the $60,000. A tip would have to not only lead to the arrest of a suspect, but a conviction as well.\n\nUntil a trial can be held and a perpetrator is convicted in a court of law or at least indicted, no one will be eligible for the reward.\n\nHow are rewards determined and paid?\n\nTo be eligible for a reward through the FBI, you would first have to be nominated by a U.S. investigating agency such as the Department of Defense or the FBI to receive the reward, according to the FBI's website. A person who provided information cannot self-nominate.\n\nAn interagency committee then reviews the nomination and its legal eligibility. If it is determined that the information provided merits a reward, the suggestion is passed on to the Secretary of State, who makes the final decision. In federal cases, the Attorney General must also agree.\n\nThe FBI generally does not announce that a reward has been paid out. The agency does not share information received as part of the investigation, nor does it disclose identity information about individuals who receive payment, though it does submit a confidential report to Congress.\n\nBeing found eligible for or even being approved for a reward does not guarantee the receipt of a specific amount of funds. Reward payment amounts are based on multiple factors, the FBI says, including the value of the information provided, the level of threat mitigated by the information received, the severity of danger or injury to U.S. persons or property presented by the threat, the risk faced by a source and his/her family and the degree of a source’s cooperation.\n\nA payment to a source may be any amount up to the total dollar amount of an advertised reward offer.\n\nAs far as the NYPD, the rewards program is executed through Crime Stoppers, where tips can be anonymously called in at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or online at crimestoppers.nypdonline.org. After submitting information, tipsters receive a unique reference number.\n\nBecause law enforcement agencies do not gather other identifying information about tipsters, those hoping to receive a reward will have to call back or go online to check the status of the investigation using this reference number, according to the NYPD and Crime Stoppers websites. If a reward is being offered and the New York City Police Foundation and/or Crime Stoppers Board of Directors approves one related to their tip, the caller will then be instructed as to how to receive it.\n\nWould McDonald's employee that reported 'person of interest' get the reward?\n\nMangione, the suspect named in the investigation, has not been charged with Thompson's murder, as of Monday evening.\n\nTo receive the FBI reward, the McDonald's worker would first have to be nominated by an involved agency and then be approved through the committee. If the Secretary of State were to agree, they would then determine how much money the information provided by the employee is worth, up to but likely not totaling the $50,000 advertised.\n\nIn both the case of the NYPD and FBI, rewards are only paid after an arrest and importantly, indictment or conviction, depending on the situation and agency.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Nick Penzenstadler, Jonathan Limehouse, N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Jorge L.

And we’ve seen that reaction.”\n\nAt the news conference, Kenny was asked about some of the tips that police received and steps officers took to run them down.\n\nHe said Mangione's mother, Kathleen Mangione, had filed a missing persons report on her son on Nov. 18 in San Francisco.\n\nNew York police officers embedded within an FBI task force then got the tip that the missing person in San Francisco, Mangione, might be their suspect and called his mother.\n\nAccording to the NYPD's Kenny, a San Francisco police sergeant working on the missing case saw the photo of Mangione and reached out to the FBI's San Francisco field office \"and said hey, basically, 'I'm working on a missing case. I saw the photograph that was distributed by the NYPD, there bears a resemblance.' That tip was forwarded to us close to 45 hours after the incident took place.\"\n\nMore:Michael Moore pens letter after Luigi Mangione arrest for CEO killing: 'I condemn murder'\n\n\"It was one of four tips that they had received that day, and they were vetting it,\" Kenny told reporters. \"They had a conversation where she didn't indicate that it was her son in the photograph, but she said it might be something that she could see him doing.\"\n\nThe information was going to be passed along to New York detectives assigned to the case the next morning, Kenny said. \"But fortunately, we apprehended him before we could act on that.\"\n\nMangione's mother could not immediately be reached for comment on Kenny's account.\n\nNino Mangione, a cousin of Luigi and a Maryland state delegate who issued an initial joint statement for the family, did not respond to a message on a number listed to him.\n\nMore:Luigi Mangione merchandise raises controversy, claims of glorifying violence\n\nUSA TODAY also has reached out to Mangione’s New York lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo.\n\nHours after Mangione's arrest, his family released a statement saying they were \"shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest\" and offered \"our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"\n\nMangione is currently in custody at a Pennsylvania state prison after a judge denied bail on Tuesday. He faces charges in Pennsylvania including allegedly possessing an untraceable \"ghost gun.\" In New York, he had been charged initially with counts including second-degree murder.This article was updated with a new video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/12/09/snl-unitedhealthcare-ceo-death-jokes/76858269007/", "title": "'SNL' CEO skit: UnitedHealthcare shooting jokes echo an angry ...", "text": "This story was updated to include new information.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" reflected a fed-up America back to itself over the weekend with a spate of jokes about the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nThe late-night sketch comedy show took aim at the NYPD and America's reaction to the crime Saturday during its \"Weekend Update\" segment with a series of one-liners about the killing and the ongoing manhunt for the suspect.\n\nAt the time of the sketch, the alleged gunman who shot and killed Thompson Wednesday outside the Hilton hotel in New York City where the CEO was staying was still unidentified. The murder has captivated Americans as new details continue to emerge that add intrigue. The suspect allegedly fled on an e-bike into Central Park before taking a bus out of the city.\n\nA Maryland man has been detained in Pennsylvania and was being questioned about the shooting.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"This week, New York City officials sent a a tough message on crime: If you shoot somebody in the middle of the street, you better get on your bike, hop on a bus and get the heck outta here, mister,\" joked Colin Jost, a longtime \"Weekend Update\" co-host.\n\nJost also pointed out how close the shooting had been to the 30 Rockefeller Center, the building where \"SNL\" films.\n\n\"The guy just bicycled away,\" Jost quipped, \"probably because they have every cop in the city guarding our Christmas Tree.\"\n\nThe UnitedHealthcare CEOwas killed and many had little sympathy. Why?\n\n\"SNL\" is not alone in poking fun at the murder. A look-alike contest for the alleged gunman, similar to those held for Timothée Chalamet and Glen Powell, took place in New York's Washington Square Park over the weekend.\n\nThat the murder has all the trappings of a Hollywood-produced crime thriller has only added fuel to the fire. Beyond the inscribed bullet casings, a backpack thought to belong to the killer was also found full of Monopoly money, which some were quick to argue was an allegory to the dangerous monopolies that exist in American healthcare.\n\n\"It really says something about America that a guy was murdered in cold blood and the two main reactions were 'Yeah, well healthcare stinks' and also 'Girl, that shooter hot,'\" Jost joked.\n\n\"New York City police say that they were able to get the smiling picture of the suspect after the man apparently was caught on camera at a local hostel flirting with a female employee,\" Jost's co-host Michael Che chimed in.\n\nWhile some social media posts voiced concern, calling the jokes \"classless\" and \"sick,\" the segment reflected a larger swath of social media users, for whom Thompson's death has served as an opportunity to vent frustration and ire at a healthcare system they perceive as broken.\n\n\"Today, we mourn the death of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, gunned down.... wait, I'm sorry - today we mourn the deaths of the 68,000 Americans who needlessly die each year so that insurance company execs like Brian Thompson can become multimillionaires,\" Anthony Zenkus, a professor at Columbia University, posted on X to the tune of 112,000 likes.\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann, Jorge L.

It's closing the circle because one of my first joys was the final in Sevilla in 2004.\"\n\nThe Davis Cup knockout phase will be played from Nov. 19-24.\n\nNadal's career has been hampered by injuries and he missed the 2023 French Open and was beaten in the first round by German Alexander Zverev this year.\n\nThe 'King of Clay' won his last Roland Garros title in 2022 and left Paris on a jaw-dropping 112-4 win-loss record.\n\nNadal played only 23 matches in the last two seasons.\n\nHe will hang up his racket two years after his great rival Roger Federer, leaving 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic of Serbia as the only member of the 'Big Three' still active.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Nadal's rival in the youngsters' ranks, Frenchman Richard Gasquet, said he would end his career after next year's French Open.\n\nNadal thanked his family and his team for his stellar career, with a special word for his uncle Toni, who was his coach for most of his time on court.\n\n\"I believe that thanks to him, I have also been able to overcome many situations that have been difficult in my sporting career,\" he said.\n\nTo his fans, Nadal said: \"I can't thank you enough for what you have made me feel.

In the world of sports, it can seem like an eternity.\n\nAs this decade began, the Yankees were reigning World Series champions, the Saints were about to win the franchise’s first Super Bowl title, Kobe Bryant was on his way to leading the Lakers to back-to-back NBA titles and Tiger Woods – with 14 major victories by the age of 34 – was seemingly a lock to break Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18.\n\nHow things have changed. The Yankees, Saints and Lakers have yet to return to the pinnacle of their sports, and Woods went 11 years before winning his 15th major.\n\nThen again, some stars who ruled the sports world in 2010 have managed to stay on top. Which ones deserve recognition as the greatest athletes of the past decade?\n\nThirty-five members of the USA TODAY Sports staff voted to determine the top 50 athletes of the decade. Points were given in descending order, so an athlete who was voted No. 1 received 25 points, followed by No. 2 receiving 24 points and so on. Point totals are in parentheses.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n1. LeBron James (786 points)\n\nThe start of the decade coincided with James entering his prime, having just turned 25. He delivered, playing in eight NBA Finals and winning three titles, being voted MVP twice and winning a gold medal in 2012. Plus nobody has scored more points since the start of the 2009-10 season than James. But it's his impact off the court that elevates James beyond other athletes of the 2010s, adding to his philanthropic efforts and becoming a leading voice on social and political issues.\n\n2. Serena Williams (781 points)\n\nNarrowly beat out by James, Williams is arguably the the greatest tennis player in history with 23 Grand Slam tournament singles titles, more than any man or woman in the Open Era. Not all of those majors came in this decade, but winning 10 of them – as well as Olympic golds in singles and doubles – after turning 30 might be an even more impressive feat.\n\n3. Tom Brady (742 points)\n\nA sixth-round draft choice in 2000, Brady's career has spanned two decades, and he's still going strong at 42. In the 2010s, he won two MVP awards (2010 season and '17) and led the Patriots to five Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl titles (2014 season, '16 and '18).\n\n4. Simone Biles (740 points)\n\nBiles hit the elite gymnastics scene as a 14-year-old in 2011. Two years later she claimed her first world championship gold medals, winning the floor exercise and all-around competitions. She won eight more golds at worlds in 2014-15 before leading the USA to team gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Individually, Biles won gold in the floor exercise, vault and all-around competitions with a bronze in the balance beam. After taking 2017 off, she returned by winning seven more individual golds at the 2018 and 2019 world championships.\n\nTEAM OF THE DECADE:US women end 2010s where they started it, as world's best\n\nCOACH OF THE DECADE:In evaluating coaches, no one was better than Nick Saban\n\n5. Usain Bolt (654 points)\n\nBolt was already an international star and Olympic champion when the decade started. But he added to his legacy by becoming the only sprinter to win gold medals in both the 100 and 200 meters in three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, 2016). He also won 11 gold medals at the track and field world championships from 2009 to 2015. And he currently holds the world record in both the 100 and the 200.\n\n6. Mike Trout (610 points)\n\nTrout made his major league debut in 2011 at 19 and a season later won the AL Rookie of the Year award and finished second in AL MVP voting. He hasn't slowed down since. An eight-time All-Star, Trout has won three MVP awards and finished second four times. The only blemish on his career is a lack of postseason success, but he's only 28.\n\n7. Steph Curry (571 points)\n\nThe seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Curry quickly established himself as one of the game’s best shooters. He led the NBA in 3-point field goals for five consecutive seasons, including a record 402 in 2015-16. An All-Star in each of the past six seasons, Curry was named the league’s MVP in 2015 as he led the Warriors to their first NBA title in 40 years. The following year, Curry repeated as MVP as the Warriors finished with an unprecedented 73-9 record but lost the NBA Finals in seven games to the Cavaliers. Entering the 2019-20 season, Curry and the Warriors have represented the Western Conference in each of the past five NBA Finals, winning three.\n\n8. Lionel Messi (570 points)\n\nIn the decade’s greatest soccer rivalry, Messi comes out slightly ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo. A prolific goal-scorer, Messi has won a record six Ballon d’Or awards (five this decade) as the world’s top player. He has spent his entire pro career with Barcelona, where he holds the record of six Golden Boot awards as the leading scorer in the top division of the five major European leagues. The native of Argentina is his country’s all-time leading scorer with 70 goals in 138 international appearances. He also led Argentina to the 2014 World Cup final.\n\n9. Michael Phelps (541 points)\n\nAlthough many of his accomplishments came in the 2000s, Phelps arguably did enough alone in this decade to be considered the greatest swimmer in history. Following his unprecedented eight gold medal-winning performance at the 2008 Olympics, Phelps cut back his schedule – winning four golds and two silvers in 2012 in London. He was chosen as the U.S. flag bearer for the 2016 Rio Games, then added another five golds and one silver. His victories in the 200-meter butterfly and 200 medley made him, at 31, the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history.\n\nFROM BASEBALL:Dream team, position-by-position for the decade\n\nDARKEST MOMENT:Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal rocked the world\n\n10. Novak Djokovic (479 points)\n\nMen's tennis has been ruled by three players this decade. Of the three, Djokovic holds the upper hand. Of his 16 Grand Slam tournament titles, 15 have come since 2011 – including all five Wimbledon crowns and six of his record seven Australian Open titles. His 2015 season, in which he won three majors and reached the final in a fourth, is considered one of the greatest in history.\n\n11. Katie Ledecky (443 points)\n\nLedecky is quite simply the most dominant freestyle swimmer in history. At 15, she claimed her first Olympic title in 2012, setting a record for an American and winning the 800-meter freestyle by more than four seconds. Breaking world records and going undefeated in every international final she entered between the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, Ledecky hit more milestones at the 2016 Rio Games. She won gold in the 200-, 400- and 800-meter free, posting world-record times in the 400 and 800 that still stand. All told, she’s set 14 world records.\n\n12. Kevin Durant (398 points)\n\nStarting in the 2009-10 season, Durant led the league in points five years in a row with the Thunder, went to the 2012 Finals, was league MVP in 2013-14 and won Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. But Durant didn’t become an NBA champion until he joined the Warriors in 2016. He won back-to-back titles (winning Finals MVP) and was the leading playoff scorer last season until he was hurt before the Finals.\n\n13. Rafael Nadal (396 points)\n\nThe King of Clay won the French Open eight times during the decade and three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2010. He’s the reigning champion at the French and U.S. Open. Nadal was ranked No. 1 for 140 weeks, including now, and No. 2 for 133 weeks.\n\n14. Cristiano Ronaldo (387 points)\n\nHe signed with Real Madrid before the turn of the decade and dominated, scoring 40 or more goals three times and winning back-to-back Ballon D’Or awards in 2013 and 2014 and 2016 and 2017. He was named the top forward as Portugal won UEFA Euro 2016. He transferred to Juventus in 2018 and led that team to a first-place finish in his first year.\n\n15. Aaron Rodgers (297 points)\n\nThe Packers' quarterback was MVP of the 2011 Super Bowl XLV win against the Steelers, throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns. He was NFL MVP in 2012, when the Packers went 15-1, and he had a career-best 4,643 passing yards and 45 TD passes. He picked up six All-Pro nods and won 10 or more games seven times, including this season.\n\n16. Roger Federer (273 points)\n\nHe began the decade ranked No. 1 and finished No. 3. There was a lot of fluctuation in there, including a drop to 16, but he won five Grand Slam tournaments and the Federer-Nadal rivalry remains fun to watch.\n\n17. Sidney Crosby (268 points)\n\nThe hockey world wondered if the Penguins' star would be able to return from a concussion suffered in the 2011 Winter Classic. He spent parts of two seasons on the sideline but came back strong. He led the league with 104 points in 2013-14 to win MVP and was playoff MVP twice as the Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup titles in 2016 and 2017, the first NHL team to do that since the late 1990s.\n\nFROM HOCKEY:The people, places, things that have changed NHL\n\nFROM NASCAR:Top feuds feature familiar names, iconic moments from decade\n\n18. Clayton Kershaw (256 points)\n\nThe Dodgers' pitcher dominated in the regular season, winning the Cy Young Award in 2011, 2013 and 2014. He was voted National League MVP in 2014, when he went 21-3 with a 1.77 ERA. He hasn’t been able to repeat that dominance in the postseason, though, with a combined 5.40 ERA in World Series games.\n\n19. Alex Ovechkin (239 points)\n\nThe runaway NHL goal-scoring leader of the decade. The Capitals' star scored his 600th goal on March 12, 2018, and is closing in on 700. Ovechkin eliminated the one blemish on his career by winning the Stanley Cup in 2018.\n\n20. Carli Lloyd (217 points)\n\nA force on the U.S. Women’s National Team, she scored the winning goal in the 2012 Olympics, was captain of the 2015 World Cup team and had a hat trick in the championship game against Japan. She scored three goals in the 2019 World Cup as the USA repeated as champion.\n\n21. American Pharoah (160 points)\n\nYes, horses are athletes too. American Pharoah won the Triple Crown in 2015, the first to do so since Affirmed in 1978. He took the Kentucky Derby by 1 length, the Preakness Stakes by 7 lengths and the Belmont Stakes by 5½ lengths. Trained by Bob Baffert, American Pharoah went on to win the Breeders’ Cup Classic, the first to win all four races in one year.\n\n22. Floyd Mayweather Jr. (154 points)\n\nMayweather added to his perfect record by winning nine fights in the decade, including a 10th-round TKO of UFC fighter Conor McGregor in August 2017. That gave Mayweather a 50-0 record, surpassing Hall of Fame boxer Rocky Marciano’s 49-0 mark. Mayweather announced on Instagram in November that he was “coming out of retirement in 2020,” but no bout has been scheduled.\n\n23. Max Scherzer (123 points)\n\nScherzer started the decade as an up-and-comer who just completed his first full season in the major leagues. He finishes the 2010s with the most strikeouts and wins in the decade, three Cy Young Awards and a newly earned World Series title.\n\n24. Lindsey Vonn (119 points)\n\nVonn's decade as a skier was filled with remarkable achievements and excruciating injuries. She won Olympic gold in the downhill and a bronze in the super-G at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. In 2013, she suffered torn knee ligaments and a broken leg and did not fully recover in time for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. Vonn returned to the Games in 2018, taking bronze in the downhill. She announced her retirement in 2019 after claiming a record 82 World Cup victories, the most of any female skier in history. She also has seven world championship medals and was the first female skier to win medals at six world championships.\n\n25. Mikaela Shiffrin (118 points)\n\nThe world’s dominant slalom skier has won the World Cup season title six times. Shiffrin, 24, also has won three consecutive overall World Cup titles. Currently tied for second on the list of World Cup victories with 62, Shiffrin could pass Ingemar Stenmark’s record of 86 before the Beijing Olympics in 2022. At the 2014 Olympics at 18, she became the youngest to win Olympic gold in slalom. Four years later, Shiffrin won gold in the giant slalom and silver in the combined.\n\n26. Maya Moore (104 points)\n\nThe five-time, first-team All-WNBA honoree helped the Lynx win four championships since her rookie year in 2011. Moore was also named MVP in 2014. She has missed only one game in eight seasons, with career averages of 18.4 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. In February, Moore, 30, announced that she would sit out the 2019 season to focus on family and “some ministry dreams.”\n\n27. James Harden (86 points)\n\nA seven-time All-Star and two-time NBA scoring champion, Harden was the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year (2011-12) with the Thunder before he was traded to the Rockets. Since the trade, Harden, 30, has averaged 29.4 points and 7.7 assists. He’s led the NBA in scoring each of the past two seasons: 30.4 points in 2017-18 – when he was the league MVP – and 36.1 points in 2018-19.\n\n28. Justin Verlander (83 points)\n\nVerlander won two Cy Young Awards in the decade, including one in 2019 when he became the oldest pitcher to achieve the feat since 42-year-old Roger Clemens did it in 2004. Now 36, Verlander is second to Max Scherzer in wins and strikeouts in the 2010s and first in innings pitched. He also won a World Series title with the Astros in 2017.\n\n29. Elena Delle Donne (69 points)\n\nShe is the first player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with two teams: the Sky in 2015 and the Mystics in 2019. A seven-year veteran, Delle Donne, 30, led the Mystics to the team’s first league championship in 2019. She is the first player in WNBA history to shoot over 50% from the field, over 40% from 3-point territory and over 90% from the free throw line in a season (2019).\n\n30. Tiger Woods (57 points)\n\nWoods hasn’t been the same since he crashed his Escalade outside his Florida mansion on the day after Thanksgiving in 2009. He endured personal scandal and several surgical procedures on his back. But Woods had his share of moments of triumph on the golf course. He was named PGA Tour Player of the Year in 2013 and won 11 tournaments in the 2010s. His Masters victory in 2019 was one of the decade's most dramatic moments and marked his 15th career major, keeping Woods within reach of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18.\n\n31. Abby Wambach (55 points)\n\nInducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in September, Wambach, 39, is the career-leading goal scorer in women's international soccer with 184 goals. In the 2010s, she was a member of the U.S. women's team that won gold at the 2012 Olympics and the 2015 World Cup. She was the FIFA world women's player of the year in 2012.\n\nT32. Allyson Felix (49 points)\n\nFelix finishes the decade as the most decorated woman in U.S. Olympic track and field history with nine medals. She captured three gold medals in 2012 and two more in 2016 to bring her career total to six, most of any female track and field athlete in Olympic history. She won her 12th gold at the world championships in 2019, her first since becoming a mother.\n\nT32. Marcel Hirscher (49 points)\n\nAt just 30 years old, the Austrian is already widely considered the greatest Alpine skier ever. Hirscher won a record eight consecutive overall World Cup titles from 2012 to 2019, plus six titles each in the slalom and giant slalom disciplines and two Olympic gold medals in 2018.\n\n34. Drew Brees (48 points)\n\nBrees earned nine of his 13 career Pro Bowl nods in the 2010s and was the 2011 Offensive Player of the Year. He leads quarterbacks for the decade in touchdowns, yards, pass attempts and completions. He also finishes the decade as the NFL's career leader in passing yards and touchdowns.\n\n35. Megan Rapinoe (46 points)\n\nRapinoe played in three World Cups during the decade, winning two, including the performance of a lifetime to lead the Americans to a second consecutive title in 2019. She was awarded the Golden Boot as the tournament’s top scorer with six goals and earned the Golden Ball as the best player.\n\n36. Diana Taurasi (35 points)\n\nConsidered one of the greatest female basketball players in history, Taurasi spent the 2010s burnishing her Hall of Fame résumé. She earned five All-Star nods and seven All-WNBA selections during the decade and won her third WNBA championship and second Finals MVP in 2014. Taurasi became the WNBA’s all-time leader scorer in 2017 and won Olympic gold medals with the U.S. in 2012 and 2016.\n\n37. Klay Thompson (35 points)\n\nThompson teamed with Steph Curry to form the Splash Brothers, the best shooting backcourt in NBA history and cornerstones of a Warriors dynasty that won three championships. Thompson was a five-time All-Star and two-time All-NBA third-team pick during the decade.\n\n38. Patrick Kane (34 points)\n\nThe top pick in the 2007 draft, Kane became a cornerstone of the Blackhawks' teams that won three Stanley Cup championships during the decade. Kane won the Art Ross Trophy as NHL scoring champion and the Hart Trophy as league MVP in 2015-16, becoming the first American-born player to win each.\n\n39. Alex Morgan (28 points)\n\nMorgan became the latest international soccer star for the U.S. She appeared in three World Cups, helping the U.S. win the 2015 and 2019 titles. In April 2019, Morgan became the seventh American woman to score 100 international goals, and she finishes the decade with 107.\n\n40. Lewis Hamilton (25 points)\n\nHamilton established himself as one of the most accomplished drivers in Formula One history with five championships in six years (2014-15, 2017-19). His six total championships and 84 race wins are both second behind Michael Schumacher, and Hamilton holds the F1 career record with 88 poles.\n\nT41. Canelo Alvarez (21 points)\n\nCanelo became one of boxing’s biggest draws this decade, signing a massive deal with the DAZN streaming service for his fights in 2018. In the ring, the four-division champion has gone an impressive 23-1-1 over the past 10 years.\n\nT41. Sue Bird (21 points)\n\nBird finishes the decade among the best women to ever play basketball. She won two of her three WNBA titles (2010 and 2018), made five All-Star teams and three All-WNBA teams and became the league’s all-time assists leader in 2017. Bird also helped the U.S. win Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016.\n\nT41. Aaron Donald (21 points)\n\nThe accolades started piling up in 2013 for Donald, as he was named the ACC defensive player of the year and cleaned up in award season, taking home the Nagurski Award, Bednarik Award, Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award. He continued in the NFL as he was named Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2014 and captured back-to-back Defensive Player of the Year awards in 2017 and 2018, the latter when he led the league with 20½ sacks.\n\nT41. Brooks Koepka (21 points)\n\nThe 29-year-old golfer became one of the best big-game players on the planet in the last few years of the decade. He captured four major titles – twice taking home the PGA Championship (2018 and 2019) and twice winning the U.S. Open (2017 and 2018). When he wasn’t winning in 2019 he was in the hunt, finishing second at the Masters, second at the U.S. Open and fourth at the British Open.\n\n45. Jon Jones (20 points)\n\nThere was plenty of controversy for “Bones” during the decade as he was stripped of his light heavyweight championship multiple times.

JJ Watt (18 points)\n\nPerhaps no defensive player was as dominant as Watt in the 2010s. He won three NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards (2012, 2014, 2015) and twice led the league in sacks. Watt's career has been slowed of late by injuries, but in 2017 he made perhaps his biggest impact off the field when he was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year after helping to spearhead a massive fundraising effort in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.\n\n47. Julio Jones (17 points)\n\nThe wide receiver began the decade as a star on Alabama as the Crimson Tide captured their first national championship in 17 years in January 2010. He was drafted by the Falcons with the sixth overall pick in 2011 and hasn’t slowed down, twice leading the league in receiving yards while clearing 900 yards in all but one year of his NFL career.\n\nT48. Larry Fitzgerald (16 points)\n\nFitzgerald has spent the decade continuing to build one of the most impressive resumes of any wide receiver in NFL history. The greatest player in Arizona Cardinals history is now second in career receptions and yards and sixth in touchdowns. He also has the most receptions of the 2010s.\n\nT48. Shaun White (16 points)\n\nOne of the most recognizable names in extreme sports, White won Olympic gold medals in snowboard halfpipe at the 2010 and 2018 Winter Games.

Tennis is experiencing an era in which the men’s game and to a degree the women’s have been defined by a small quota of dominant players with astonishing career longevity.\n\nTo fill the knowledge gap, the All England Club has teamed up with IBM to use artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to boost fan engagement – and try to predict every match winner in the process.\n\nSpectators in fancy dress as their tennis icons at Wimbledon 2017.

Users can choose to track players and are served up personalized highlights as the tournament progresses.\n\nAn IBM technician poses with screens showing AI-generated highlights during Wimbledon 2019. The tournament has partnered with IBM to educate the fans at the 2022 tournament. GLYN KIRK/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWatson’s party piece is using data to predict every match winner. Displayed as a simple percentage likelihood, the AI makes the call by drawing on millions of data points recorded before and during the tournament. Factors include previous results between the athletes, current form, and more granular details like first serve win percentage, ace frequency and percentage of points won returning first serve.\n\nFarrar explains that tournament data is compiled by a team of “very good tennis players” – usually county level and above – watching each match at Wimbledon, with three statisticians on show courts and one on the outside courts. Hawk-Eye ball and player tracking is also used.\n\nNot all data fed into the predictor is based on hard stats, however. Intriguingly, positive or negative media sentiment is also taken into account, scanning thousands of news articles about players.\n\n“One of the markers of ‘who’s interesting?’ is ‘who is the media excited about?’” says Willis. “Many members of the media, particularly in a sport like tennis, where they’re with the players week in, week out, have a sense and an understanding of how well people are playing – those sort of soft factors that don’t necessarily show up in (structured data points).”\n\nMore than just a makeshift hat: newspaper stories are analyzed by Watson to glean media sentiment towards players. LEON NEAL/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFarrar reported that Watson predicted results with “pretty much 100% accuracy” on day one of the tournament, but day three provided its first big upset when women’s number 2 seed and 66% match favorite Anett Kontaveit was beaten by unseeded Jule Niemeier in straight sets.\n\nDespite employing one of the world’s most famous AIs, Willis insists “this is not intended to be exact or an exact science.”\n\nAnd even if Watson loses, it’s still a win-win, insists Farrar. “That’s an interesting talking point, and it’s engaging with fans, which is the key goal.”\n\n“Sports fans love debate.

Kamala Harris, a woman, left-leaning like herself, who favors diplomacy? Or Donald Trump, whose populism and bluster about tariffs represent an enormous risk for Mexico?\n\nSheinbaum \"would much prefer to be facing an amenable neighbor to the north,\" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. \"Sheinbaum really comes out of a lifetime of commitment to the left in Latin America. It would be hard for her to get along with Donald Trump.\"\n\nWho is Claudia Sheinbaum?\n\nSheinbaum's election broke barriers. The first woman to lead Mexico is also Mexico's first president of Jewish ancestry, notable in a country whose Spanish colonial roots are Catholic and millions venerate the Virgin of Guadalupe. All four of her grandparents were Jewish immigrants to Mexico, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.\n\nSheinbaum is 62, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and the former mayor of Mexico City, the country's political and cultural center with a population of more than 9 million people in a metropolitan area of more than 22 million.\n\nShe represents the political party MORENA, founded by her political mentor and predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who is beloved by the many Mexicans who benefit from his generous financial support programs, including seniors and the unemployed.\n\nSheinbaum won Mexico's presidential election in a landslide in June and is expected to continue López Obrador's political project.\n\nShe has enjoyed broad support in the honeymoon period between the election and inauguration day: Two-thirds of Mexicans surveyed in a recent poll by Mexico City-based Buendía y Marquez reported holding a positive opinion of Sheinbaum, and 3 in 4 of those surveyed said they expect the country will do as well or better than during the past six years.\n\nSheinbaum's inauguration took place in Mexico City at the nation's congressional chamber known as San Lázaro.\n\nMore:Mexico elects first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum declared winner in historic election\n\nElection 2024: What's at stake for Mexico\n\nOnce in office, the stakes for Sheinbaum in the U.S. election couldn't be higher.\n\nMexico's economy depends heavily on the United States. It's underpinned in part by $475 billion in exports to the U.S. and $63 billion in remittances sent home by Mexicans working abroad, most of them in the U.S.\n\nMexico's gross domestic product expanded less than 2% a year over the past two years, and growth is expected to slow into next year, according to Mexico's central bank. Roughly 80% of the country's exports go to the U.S., including the medical devices, computers, TV screens and automotive components assembled in Mexican border cities and headed for U.S. factories and consumers.\n\nCrucially, the free trade agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada is up for renegotiation in 2026, and the outcome for Mexico could differ dramatically depending on who is in the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Mexico has been engaged in a massive effort to prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. border. Sheinbaum will be under immediate pressure to keep it up, even as the rising number of migrants stuck in Mexico risks angers the Mexican public. She will be under pressure from the U.S., as well, to target the dangerous criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl and migrants to the United States.\n\nShe faces domestic challenges, too, as she's tasked with carrying out initiatives begun by López Obrador, whose political shadow is expected to loom large over her presidency.\n\nTo start, she has to implement a sweeping overhaul of Mexico's judicial system, which will see the country's local, state and federal judges elected rather than appointed. López Obrador pushed the constitutional change in the final weeks of his administration, blowing off sharp criticism by the U.S. government.\n\nMore:Easing insecurity: Claudia Sheinbaum's task for boosting Mexico’s global business appeal\n\nMexico's inauguration day\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden was at the inauguration ceremony, along with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, Mexican police erected movable steel barriers around Mexico City's sprawling public square known as the Zócalo – the typical site of celebration and protest in the country.

Sheinbaum uses the hashtag #EsTiempodeMujeres, meaning “this is women’s time”, and told Gatopardo that “girls see an example in me”. Gálvez says she rebelled against her abusive father to pursue education, and when a man tried to rape her when she was 17 she fought back with a soldering iron.\n\nViolence against women has been rising. “In Mexico, some 10 women and girls are killed every day by intimate partners or other family members,” according to the UN. Women have been “dying at a frightening pace”, The Associated Press reported, a result of “cultural machismo, systemic gender inequality and latent domestic violence”. Even when crimes are punished, many view sentences as too lenient.\n\nThe current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has faced criticism for his inability to stop Mexico becoming a “femicide nation”, The Guardian reported last year.\n\nAnd in August he “sparked ridicule and outrage” when he responded to more questions on the subject by suggesting that he too could be the victim of gender-based violence. “Everything they say to me, isn’t that gender-based violence?” López Obrador said. “Or is gender only female?”\n\nSheinbaum and Gálvez have put women’s rights at the forefront of their respective agendas. And the feminist movement has already brought about change. Last week the Supreme Court, which in January elected its first female president, legalised abortion, stating the “denial of the possibility of a termination violated the human rights of women”. The majority of senators are now women and the central bank governor is female.\n\n“It’s not quite Barbie Land,” said The Washington Post, “but the progress is remarkable in a country where women couldn’t even vote until 1953.”\n\nNext June’s election is “a feminist’s dream”, Mexican women’s rights activist Maricruz Ocampo told the newspaper. It “is going to signify a turn in the way that we see women in politics”.\n\nMany women in Mexico, who make up 52% of the population, “hope the government that takes office in October 2024 will empower them as never before”, said Reuters.\n\nOthers are more cautiously optimistic. “They’re not magical unicorns; they don’t have magic wands,” Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the University of London, told The Washington Post. “They’re not going to fix centuries of discrimination against women overnight.”", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/06/05/mexico-presidential-election-texas/73982578007/", "title": "Mexican nationals in Austin face voting barriers in Mexico's election", "text": "Gerardo Flores was proud and determined.\n\nHe drove to the Mexican Consulate in Austin late Sunday morning as millions of other Mexicans prepared to participate in an election that was almost guaranteed to usher in the country's first female president.

A group of about eight was outside, speculating that the consulate was not going to open. It didn't.\n\n\"It bothered me. Since I've had my credential, I've voted. All these years,\" Flores said. He told the American-Statesman in Spanish he had been told by consular staff that he'd be able to vote there when he registered.\n\nThe Austin consulate was not one of the 20 selected by Mexico's electoral agency, known as the National Electoral Institute, to have in-person voting. But that information appeared not to have reached many who hoped to exercise their democratic right. Univision 62 reported dozens showed up to the consulate Sunday.\n\nThe Statesman spoke to many others who were unable to find out where they could vote or who were unable to successfully vote online. As Mexico made history electing Claudia Sheinbaum, many in the U.S. felt excluded.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has estimated that about 10.7 million Mexican-born individuals live in the United States. To vote in Sunday's elections, Mexican citizens needed both a credential from the National Electoral Institute and a registration to vote abroad for the year's election.\n\nOnly about 226,000 individuals met both of those criteria, according to researchers at the Center for the U.S. and Mexico, part of Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nRodrigo Montes de Oca, a research scholar at the Center for the U.S. and Mexico, said this two-step process has been the case since the government first allowed expatriates to vote in 2006.\n\nVoters have increasingly met these requirements. This year's registration figure was higher than the 181,000 voters abroad who registered in 2018 and the 59,000 who registered in 2012, according to Montes de Oca.\n\nBut throughout the U.S., increased participation was hindered when would-be voters were turned away from consulates, including in Houston and Dallas.\n\nThere were other obstacles, too.\n\nJuvenal Cisneros, 58, who stopped by the consulate Monday, told the Statesman he had tried to vote Sunday and thought he was registered, but couldn't figure out how. Cisneros said he called friends and tried to comprehend the information online, but he gave up.\n\nOmar Villarreal, an Austin-based construction worker who used the consulate Tuesday, said he logged in to vote online.\n\nThe loading icon \"kept spinning and spinning, maybe because of the high amount of people who were trying to use it,\" Villarreal told the Statesman in Spanish.\n\nHe eventually gave up but was happy to find out the next day the candidate he preferred had won.\n\nBack in Mexico, Sheinbaum, who represented MORENA, the party founded by popular presidential incumbent Andrés Manuel López Obrador, won handsomely. She earned about twice the votes of her nearest opponent, Xóchitl Gálvez.\n\nMontes de Oca said this year's mishaps should teach the Mexican government that \"there are many more people interested\" in voting and that officials are going to have to be flexible in how they conduct elections for those abroad.\n\nThis, he said, should mean expanding in-person voting options, increasing voter information and allowing candidates to campaign abroad, an act that is currently prohibited by Mexican law.\n\nThe Consulate General of Mexico in Austin did not respond to the Statesman's questions submitted by email or in person.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/06/03/mexico-elects-first-female-president-the-excerpt/73911964007/", "title": "Mexico elects its first female president | The Excerpt", "text": "On Monday’s episode of The Excerpt podcast: Mexico has elected Claudia Sheinbaum as president.

Plus, we take a look at Hunter Biden's gun trial which is set to begin today. And is corporate America keeping promises it made to Black Americans?\n\n♦\n\nMexicans have elected their first woman president. Claudia Sheinbaum received between 58.3 and 60.7% of the vote according to preliminary results announced by Mexico's National Electoral Institute earlier today. On October 1st, she'll become the leader of a country that is the top trade partner of the US and the second-largest economy of Latin America. She'll also be overseeing a country slammed by violence tied to organized crime. With Sheinbaum's win, Mexico beat the United States in electing a female head of state. Sheinbaum is a scientist, engineer, and former mayor of Mexico City who shares the populist ideology of her political mentor, outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. For more on what's next across the border, check out our Saturday episode of The Excerpt when I spoke with USA TODAY national reporter Lauren Villagran who put the election in context for us. You can find a link to that episode in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nHunter Biden's felony gun trial is set to begin today following the collapse of a deal with federal investigators last year. I spoke with USA TODAY Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen for a look ahead. Bart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bart, the build-up to this trial has really been kind of start, stop, start, stop for months. What's that issue here and what's happened leading up to this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThe government had tried to reach a plea agreement with Hunter Biden last July to resolve its multi-year investigation of tax and gun complaints, and it envisioned him pleading guilty to a couple of misdemeanors for tax charges and then getting put into a pretrial diversion program over gun charges so that if he completed the program, which meant two years of sobriety and no other crimes committed, that he could have those charges wiped out entirely. So it looked like last July, he was going to be able to walk away without any jail time and resolve this lengthy investigation. Well, the plea negotiations fell apart and so the prosecutor David Weiss, who is the US Attorney in Delaware and he was later appointed to special counsel to pursue this investigation further, he indicted Hunter Biden on three felony gun charges in September. And those are the charges that are coming to trial today finally in Delaware. A second set of nine tax charges are scheduled for trial in California on September 5th.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what can we actually expect today and the rest of this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nJury selection starts today. The trial overall is expected to last a couple of weeks. The charges against Hunter Biden focus on a form that he filled out where he was asked, \"Are you the unlawful user or addicted to marijuana, depressant, stimulants, or a narcotic drug or other controlled substance?\" And he marked an X on that page. But his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has suggested that he didn't know what the term addict or user meant at that time, and he had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and he was living with a sober companion so that he didn't view himself as a current user or addict.\n\nNow, that will be something for the jury to decide. Prosecutors have said that they want to use federal definitions of what is a user or an addict. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms says that a user or an addict is somebody who used a controlled substance within the past year or had multiple arrests during the past five years. So they take a much more expansive view. Hunter Biden's lawyers have tried to rule out that view and disputed whether the jury will be instructed to consider the charges in that way. And so that's one of the key points that we're going to be seeing in this trial.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, the timing here is interesting coming just days after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on all counts in his hush money trial, and half of Americans say they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he's the president's son. That's according to a Reuters Ipsos poll last summer. Bart, how are Americans viewing this trial in the wake of being so focused on the former president in recent weeks?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, there's definitely a lot of skepticism about how Hunter Biden's investigation was handled because he is the son of the president. When the plea agreement was announced and the prospect of no jail time was revealed, House Republicans just blasted as a sweetheart deal. They said clearly he was giving favored treatment because he is the son of the president. Attorney General Merrick Garland has forcefully denied that. He said the investigation was carried out independently. They followed the facts and the law. And then as the plea agreement fell apart over basically a dispute between defense lawyers and prosecutors over whether Hunter Biden would be protected from potential future charges, ones that we don't even know about yet, when that deal fell apart, Garland named David Weiss, the US Attorney in Delaware, as a special counsel so he would have even more independence to pursue charges. And Weiss then came back two separate indictments, one dealing with gun charges and one dealing with tax charges.\n\nBut so then on the flip side, Democrats are now criticizing the investigation, saying that it has now become too harsh that the gun charges at stake about lying on the federal form about whether you are an addict are rarely prosecuted and that basically Hunter Biden is being prosecuted just because he is the president's son. And so it is almost flipped to the other side, the accusations that the trial is too harsh. So it is absolutely viewed through a political lens from both sides, and there'll be a lot of attention paid to how the trial goes because of the implications for potentially having the first presidential child convicted of a crime while the president is in office. That would be a first.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Bart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA TODAY. Thanks, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs Pride Month begins this week, LGBTQ+ communities and allies around the country are taking steps to promote safety at Pride events. In Colorado, organizers at the Pikes Peak Pride Festival are making plans to mark the event's 34th anniversary in Colorado Springs where a gunman killed five and injured 25 at the LGBTQ+ nightclub, Club Q, in 2022. Pikes Peak Pride board member Justin Burns said, \"The importance of Pride and celebrating our identity is more important than any fear.\" At a time of continuing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and a spate of legislative measures targeting the trans community, LGBTQ+ groups and their advocates say it's more important than ever to maintain a proud sense of identity while remaining vigilant in the face of unknown threats.\n\nLast month, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement to raise awareness of the potential targeting of LGBTQIA+ events like Pride by foreign terrorist organizations or their supporters. One national group hopes to provide the community a sense of security by training faith leaders and congregants to play a protective and calming role at Pride events around the country. Interfaith Alliance, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ rights and inclusive faith communities, teamed with the Southern Poverty Law Center to offer the training as part of its third annual Faith for Pride initiative. You can read more about steps being taken to keep Pride safe this month with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nAn estimated 5.4 million children provided care to parents, grandparents, or siblings with chronic medical conditions or functional decline in 2019. That was up from just over a million in 2005 according to reports from the National Alliance for Caregiving and others. An aging population, more drug and alcohol use, mental health issues, shorter hospital stays, and long COVID have likely boosted the need for kids to help in the home according to experts. And in-home care and nursing homes are hard to find and unaffordable for most, especially if you're still relatively young.\n\nPresident Joe Biden took executive action last year to expand care and raise wages, but none of them help youth caregivers. Other countries, including the UK and Australia, recognize young carers through legislation and policy and offer stipends. In the US, Medicare does not pay family members to provide care, and low income families on Medicaid can only get reimbursement for adults. Experts say help for now is left to nonprofits.\n\n♦\n\nAmid an anti-DEI backlash, is corporate America keeping the promises it made to Black Americans after George Floyd's murder? I spoke with USA TODAY senior reporter Jessica Guynn for more. Jessica, thanks for hopping on.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Jessica, what did companies promise when it comes to diversity in the wake of George Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, four years ago as a business journalist, I couldn't go a few minutes without a press release or a tweet from companies declaring that they were all in the fight against racial injustice and vowing to do their part after George Floyd's murder. And in these missives, they ponied up billions in financial commitments and they outlined pretty ambitious goals to make their workforces look more like America.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo are companies keeping those pledges?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nFor the last 10 years at USA TODAY, I've been documenting the deep racial disparities in the nation's largest and most powerful companies. And these companies were certainly signaling that they were really ready to do something about it, but then they ran headlong into a conservative-led backlash that is hellbent on vilifying just the kind of diversity efforts that they were undertaking.\n\nThis what they call anti-woke movement gain momentum last year with the Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions, and activists claim that DEI in the corporate world is handing women and people of color jobs and promotions at the expense of more qualified candidates. They also argue that corporate programs that exclude white people like a fellowship or an internship geared to racial minorities is just as illegal as a program that excludes Black people. What's more, there are now questions about the legality as some of these initiatives in the wake of that ruling, and that's put the business world on the defensive. They've began to scrutinize and walk back some policies and programs they adopted after Floyd was killed, such as hiring targets for Black executives. Critics say those hiring goals are illegal quotas in disguise.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo have Black workers made any gains since Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nBlack Americans are making headway, and we've established that in our own data investigations here at USA TODAY. For example, we reported last year that the nation's 100 largest companies had four Black CEOs and a growing number of top executives who were Black. But of course, that's just a small dent. Of the 533 top executive officers across these companies, white men were 7 in 10. And of those companies, about 1 in 7 had executive teams that were made up only of white men.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica, DEI refers to diversity, equity, and inclusion. But what are some companies saying about shifting this conversation to refer to just the word inclusion instead?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, no one wants to be caught referring to DEI anymore. Companies are dropping that language from their shareholder reports and in earnings calls. Some companies are even listing DEI as a risk factor. Instead, increasingly we're seeing talk of inclusion, and that's an attempt to sidestep some of the controversy that's been created around DEI. The idea being that creating inclusive workplaces is less likely to get you in hot water with critics since you're stressing company initiatives that are for everyone, not just certain demographic groups.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica Guynn is a senior reporter with USA TODAY.

It took her two failed campaigns in 2013 and 2017 before making it to the top post in Honduras, one of Latin America’s most conservative countries – with few female elected officials.\n\nCastro greets supporters at a presidential campaign rally in 2013 in Tegucigalpa. Eduardo Verdugo/AP\n\nCNN reached out to Castro for this article. Her team told CNN that she was not giving interviews before her inauguration.\n\nA watershed moment\n\nBorn in the capital Tegucigalpa, Castro dedicated her early years to family life, marrying businessman and politician Manuel Zelaya at the age of 19 and later raising their four children while managing his businesses, according her Libre Party website.\n\nWhen Zelaya took office in January 2006, Castro had no other political ambitions than to accompany him and to support his work, sociologist Julio Raudales of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) said, playing an active role in social programs that included early education initiatives and HIV/AIDS advocacy work.\n\nAn unexpected twist in 2009 would change their lives. Zelaya was abducted from his house by military officers in a coup over a planned referendum on constitutional reform that would allow the president to be re-elected for a second term. Zelaya was taken to Costa Rica in his pyjamas. When he returned to Honduras in May 2011, he founded the Libre Party.\n\nCastro said soldiers shot at the door of the residence she shared with President Zelaya, her husband, in Tegucigalpa in 2009. Arnulfo Franco/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThen-United States President Barack Obama called the turmoil a step backward from the “enormous progress of the last 20 years in establishing democratic traditions in Latin America.”\n\nMeanwhile, Castro took the helm as leader of the resistance movement that demanded Zelaya’s return to office. It was from that incident that her political career took shape, Raudales said.\n\nBefore then, Castro was seen as “just the wife of a former president,” lawyer and political analyst Raul Pineda said.\n\nHer election victory marked a watershed moment in Honduran politics, said Raudales.\n\n“At a time when Honduran democracy was highly questioned, Castro managed to show that you can defeat a lot of opposition if you work properly and get the sympathy of the population in Honduras,” he said.\n\nIn 2021, President Hernández was accused by United States federal prosecutors of helping an alleged drug trafficker deliver thousands of kilos of cocaine to the US in exchange for hefty bribes – a claim his office rejected as “100% false.” Hernández has not been charged.\n\nMarvin Reyes, a restaurateur from the town of Santa Lucia, told CNN that “Hondurans were tired of so much corruption, of so much theft, so much impunity. So, it [voting for Castro] was a protest vote, rather than a hope vote – that was felt nationwide.”\n\nA geopolitical balancing act\n\nOutside of the problems that Castro’s already facing in Congress, there are other significant challenges Castro must tackle, Raudales said, including getting her agenda moving quick enough.\n\nChange in Honduras cannot “occur overnight,” he said, even if Hondurans are ready for it.\n\nThe country is one of the poorest in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the World Bank.\n\nAnd poverty is on the rise, according to a 2021 National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) report.\n\nPoverty rates increased from 59.3% in 2019 to roughly 70% in 2020, the report said, a situation that UNAH attributes to a “failed” Poverty Reduction Strategy implemented by the previous government and natural disasters.\n\nAnd that poverty is one of the main drivers of migration to the United States every year.\n\nEarlier this month, up to 8,000 US-bound migrants entered Guatemala from Honduras over the course of just two days, according to a Guatemalan immigration official.\n\nCastro’s promise to stamp out the systemic problems behind poverty – one of the root causes of that migration – is not only popular with the electorate, but has made her an attractive ally for US President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to attend Castro’s inauguration on Thursday, a move that Rolando Sierra, director of Honduras’ Latin American Faculty of Social Science (FLACSO) said “sends a good message.”\n\n“The US is legitimizing Castro’s government because they’re seeing in Xiomara Castro the possibility of a certain leadership within the region,” Sierra said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and Central American countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua are strained.\n\nNow, the US is eyeing Castro’s domestic policies aimed to mitigate migration as some of the most promising in the region. She has vowed to tackle the causes of poverty – and violence – that are driving Hondurans north, with a broad economic and social plan that includes free education, universal health care, social security, and a focus on creating more jobs inside the country.\n\nAt least 701,049 migrants from Central America’s northern triangle (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) were detained at the US southern border in the 2021 Fiscal Year, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nMeanwhile, Castro has said in her foreign policy manifesto that the country is looking to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing, to the ire of Washington.\n\nHowever, her transition team told Reuters last month that “the new government will maintain relations with Taiwan.”\n\nHonduras is one of few countries that has diplomatic ties with Taiwan. As China recognizes Taiwan as its own territory, most countries need to choose one or the other to form diplomatic relations with.\n\nPineda notes that China’s investments are in Nicaragua and El Salvador. “So if China is not interested in having a strategic and commercial relation with Honduras,” Honduras will keep their relationship with Taiwan, “regardless of what Castro has said.”\n\nLeftist Castro will also need to keep the US – which has a military base in Central America is in Honduras – on her side, Pineda said.\n\n“I understand that they [the US] have conditioned economic support to the Castro government [on the maintenance of] a prudent distance from the governments of Cuba or Venezuela. Cordial relations will exist, but with a clear inclination towards the United States government,” he said, adding that any conflict with the US would be “economic suicide.”\n\nBut how Castro, who evoked the slogan of the Cuban revolution in her November 28 victory will negotiate that balance remains unclear.\n\nRaudales told CNN that while Castro has the support of the country’s left, including union and labor leaders, he questions how deeply her radical politics lie.\n\n“I don’t believe Xiomara and Zelaya have ever read the Communist Manifesto,” Raudales said.\n\nBut Castro has promised to listen to the needs of her citizens.\n\nAbortion reform\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Castro stood firm on her stance on women’s reproductive rights, promising to overturn the country’s laws on abortion and a long-standing ban on the use, sale and distribution of emergency contraception.\n\nCastro vowed to decriminalize abortion for three reasons: In cases of rape, fetal impairment, or if the mother’s life is at risk. Women’s rights organizations have welcomed her proposals.\n\nRates of intimate partner violence in Honduras are high, with nearly one in three Honduran women over the age of 15 having experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner, according to UN data.\n\nAbortions carry heavy sentences, with those convicted of obtaining one facing up to six years in prison.\n\nBut since her victory, Castro has scaled back her rhetoric, proposing that those policies be first debated in a public forum.", "authors": ["Karol Suarez"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/08/women-history-election-clinton/93496180/", "title": "No matter who wins, it's a historic day for women", "text": "Kristen Jordan Shamus, and Zlati Meyer\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nThey went to the polls Tuesday because of Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells and Elizabeth Cady Stanton — trailblazers who nearly 100 years ago fought for their right to be there.\n\nSome wore pantsuits, a staple of Hillary Clinton's wardrobe. Others wore white, a nod to women's suffrage movement. Many put their \"I voted\" stickers on the graves of the crusaders who didn't live to see the day when a woman could be a major-party candidate for the highest office in the land.\n\nAnd many of these women cast their votes for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first female candidate for president of the United States.\n\nAs America waits to learn whether the nation has elected its first woman president, these Michigan women shared the stories of their own historic votes:\n\nAn historic day\n\nMarsha Philpot of Detroit was awash in white, sporting a crochet top, shawl and hat Tuesday, knowing that what she was about to do was historic.\n\n\"I felt like it was a monumental election,\" said Philpot, who lives in the Lafayette Park neighborhood of Detroit. \"I wore white in response to the call that had gone out among many women to honor the memory of the suffragettes a century ago, and also to recognize the significance of electing a woman president.\n\n\"I did not wear a pantsuit. I don’t do the pantsuit thing.\"\n\nShe said she always knew this day would come; she just didn't know when. \"One hopes that it would be inevitable, and that sooner or later there would be a viable woman candidate.\"\n\nClinton, she said, overcame so many obstacles to get to the top of the ballot, name-calling from her opponent among them.\n\n\"For every women who’s been disrespected, treated as less-than, I had a feeling of casting a vote as a statement against this type of treatment. I come from a tradition of African-American women who have recognized the power of voting and take that very seriously.\n\nA long legacy\n\nThese days, it's hard for Rachel Fox of West Bloomfield to make it to her local polling place.\n\nBorn five years before the 19th Amendment granted American women the right to vote, the 101-year-old made her ballot choices in advance of Tuesday's election.\n\nThe great-grandmother of four chuckled and answered no when she was asked if she ever thought she'd live to see a female president.\n\n\"I always expected a man to be in office,\" she said. \"I think a woman should have just as much right as a man if she has the inclination. I liked a lot of presidents before, but I think it’s time now we do have a woman. I think she’ll do a very good job.\"\n\nFox said the experience of filling out her ballot for a woman was special.\n\n\"I wasn't afraid to vote for a woman,\" she said.\n\nNeither was Kathy McCurdy of Okemos.\n\nThe 71-year-old former teacher is the great-great-granddaughter of suffragette Eliza Seaman Leggett, who lived, ironically, in Clintonville, which falls within Oakland County's Waterford Township.\n\n\"I think she’d be overwhelmed. She would be so excited and she would definitely think this is the right thing for the country,\" McCurdy said, reflecting on how her ancestor would react to the 2016 presidential ballot. \"I often think of Eliza when I do things. She thought women were more than capable of doing jobs that men thought only they could do. ... I don’t think she'd be shocked at all. She'd think it's more than past time for a woman to be president.\"\n\nQualified to run\n\nApril Anderson is a 43-year-old Detroit business owner who refused to vote for Clinton simply because she is a woman.\n\n\"I’m voting for her because she’s the most qualified for the job,\" said Anderson, who co-owns Good Cakes and Bakes with her wife, Michelle Anderson. \"I really get upset with people who try to make it like that. She has a track record of doing things.\"\n\nWhat won Anderson's vote were Clinton's initiatives to support women in business, her poise during the debates, and her evolution and changing views over the years on criminal justice issues.\n\nAnderson waited 45 minutes in line at the polls Tuesday, but she said she would have waited hours to get the chance to vote.\n\n\"There were so many feelings. For one thing, I realized that this is making history. This is actually making history,\" Anderson said.\n\nKnocking on ceilings\n\nFlorine Mark, the owner of the Farmington Hills-based Weight Watchers franchise, recalled how difficult it was for her to start her business.\n\n\"Thirty-five-plus years ago when I started my business, I couldn’t get a loan for $5,000. I had a business plan, I had collateral. They said, 'Your husband has to sign.' I said, 'No way.'\"\n\nHer franchise went on to employ as many as 10,000 women.\n\nBefore she became an entrepreneur, she did admin work. \"I remained as an office manager. I could never go forward. Maybe I didn't even try.\"\n\nShe described voting on Tuesday as a thrilling experience, but doubts the country will change by Wednesday morning — or soon after that.\n\n\"If a woman became president, have we broken the glass ceiling? Absolutely not,\" she said. \"Look how many women there are sitting on boards. We have (GM chairman and CEO) Mary Barra who’s really up there, but at what other big companies have women climbed that high?\"\n\nKnocking on doors\n\nTina Kowalczyk, 49, of Trenton knocked on doors campaigning for Clinton, but it wasn’t easy in this bitter race for the White House.\n\n“All you hear is crooked Hillary, and this and that,” she said. “Heck, you can’t even post anything on Facebook. There’s so much anger and nastiness.”\n\nShe wishes her mother and her grandmother were alive to witness the historic election.\n\n\"Everyone is like, 'Oh, I took my 90-some-year-old grandmother to the polls,\" she said. \"Being Mexican, I know my mom would have supported Clinton, too, especially for all she’s done for minorities, for everybody.\n\n\"My grandma would probably be like, 'Oh, my!' They’d be proud. They’d be excited. You know, probably because in their lifetime, they never thought they would see it. And now, it’s happening, and they’re not here. It would be something great to share with them. But now, I’ve got my four daughters.\"\n\nKowalczyk took her girls to Detroit's Eastern Market to hear Clinton speak last week, and filling in the circle on the ballot for a woman Tuesday was: \"Amazing. I’ve got to say, anything is possible. It’s going to be normal to be able to vote for a woman. It’ll be like normal.\"\n\nFight of lifetime\n\nArlene Frank said she’s been a feminist since she was 14 years old.\n\nThe 61-year-old Detroiter voted for Clinton Tuesday because, she said, the candidate has fought long and hard for women’s rights around the world.\n\nYet, as the daughter of Holocaust survivors, she noted that she could never have voted for Trump.\n\n“Hearing the anti-Semitic and xenophobic statements Trump was making and emboldening others to make was horrifyingly similar to if not the same as the actual words my parents heard in Europe,” she said. They had to escape direct persecution based on those types of statements.\n\n“I cannot imagine having someone as president who believes those things. … It’s really unnerving. …The things he has said about women are outrageous.”\n\nThough the rhetoric was ugly during campaign season, Frank, who wore a suffragette sash to the polls, said it did bring women’s issues to the fore.\n\n“This campaign — both by having a woman running for president and based on the statements Trump has made — has helped women talk about the sexism that exists and what that means for our lives, how we think of ourselves, how we raise our daughters, but also how do our voices get heard so the appropriate legislation gets passed.\n\n“When we feel threatened, we realize the gains we’ve made can be taken back, and we really haven’t made as many gains as we need to.”\n\nContact Zlati Meyer: 313-223-4439 or zmeyer@freepress.com.

Today’s electoral journey showed that our people are very political. A people committed to democracy,” López Obrador said in a video message.\n\nHe thanked all of the candidates before addressing Sheinbaum’s historic victory as the first female president of Mexico.\n\n“But also, the president who possibly has gotten the most votes in the history of our country,” López Obrador said, adding that he would have more to say on Monday morning.\n\nWith an estimated 60 percent turnout, this was one of Mexico’s biggest elections in history. Nearly 100 million people were eligible to vote.\n\nFor the first time, Mexican citizens living in the United States were able to cast their ballots in person at 20 consulates in the U.S., including in Phoenix.\n\nINE said the turnout abroad exceeded the agency’s expectations. There were long lines of people waiting to vote in most consulates, and lots of frustration when many were turned away when polls closed.\n\nOnce the results of the quick count are confirmed, Sheinbaum would become Mexico’s first female president in the country’s 203-year-old history. She will also be Mexico’s first president of Jewish descent.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nGálvez: ‘the best is yet to come’\n\nXóchitl Gálvez, one of the two women hoping to become Mexico’s next president, is telling her supporters to keep calm and to wait for more votes to be counted. But she made vague accusations of lies and hidden votes, though she did not specify who she was directing those accusations at.\n\nGálvez is trailing by about 27 percentage points behind her main challenger, Claudia Sheinbaum, with 25 percent of precincts reporting as of 11:20 p.m. local time in Mexico City.\n\n“The best is yet to come. It will be a historic night,” Gálvez said in a series of messages published on her official campaign account on X, formerly Twitter, late Sunday night.\n\nThe candidate for the coalition of PAN, PRI and PRD parties acknowledged that the majority of the votes counted so far have gone to Sheinbaum and her MORENA party.\n\n“The precincts with the greatest participation are ours,” Gálvez added. “The more votes, the longer it takes to count them.”\n\nHowever, Gálvez also published a series of tweets on her personal X account that took a more confrontational tone.\n\n“The votes are there, we won’t allow them to hide them,” though she didn’t specify who she was alluding to. To support her claim, Gálvez published a photo of the final tally posted at her precinct in Mexico City, which showed that she had won the majority of the votes cast there.\n\nSheinbaum has yet to make any statements or public appearances since the polls closed on Sunday night.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nSheinbaum takes commanding lead in early results, 2% precincts reporting\n\nMexico’s National Electoral Institute or INE began releasing the first batch of voting results two hours after polls closed throughout Mexico and the United States. The results are posted and updated every five minutes to INE’s Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) website.\n\nAs of 9 p.m. local time in Mexico City (8 p.m. in Arizona), the PREP website had published the results for 808,000 votes. That’s a small fraction of the millions of votes cast in this election.\n\nMore than 100 million Mexicans were eligible to vote on Sunday’s elections. Preliminary numbers show voter turnout hovering near 57 percent, although that number has been climbing as more votes come in.\n\nThe preliminary results published to date showed Claudia Sheinbaum with an early but commanding lead, getting 60 percent of votes so far. Her closest challenger, Xóchitl Gálvez, trailed with 28 percent of the votes.\n\nBut the counting has just begun. The PREP website shows that only about 2,900 of the country’s 170,000 precincts have reported their results as of 9 p.m. on Sunday. The preliminary results also show that none of the votes cast abroad have been counted yet.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nVote count underway in historic presidential election\n\nAs INE's preliminary count was underway, both campaigns proclaimed a sweeping win, providing a message of gratitude to voters and calling on the opposing parties to accept results as they came in.\n\nMario Delgado, national leader of the governing Morena party, triumphantly proclaimed Sheinbaum the winner from the stage of the leading candidate's headquarters at the Hilton Hotel off Pseo de la Reforma in Mexico City.\n\n“We are fortunate to live the stellar moment of our history, of our country and also for Latin America and the world. Claudia Sheinbaum will be the first female president in our history,” he said.\n\nHe had previously proclaimed that his party had achieved “full victory” in races for governorships in the states of Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Veracruz, Yucatán, Chiapas, Tabasco and Guanajuato, in addition to the Head of Government of Mexico City and, of course, the presidency.\n\nNearby, Gálvez, leader of the Fuerza y Corazón por México coalition, personally asked President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to respect the vote of Mexicans.\n\n\"I had told them for months that we were going to win these elections, despite all the traps, all the lies, despite all the abuse of power and their millions of pesos diverted to help their candidate,\" she said from her headquarters at InterContinental Presidente hotel in Polanco.\n\n— Diana García\n\nMexican nationals removed from consulate in Phoenix\n\nDozens of voters still inside the General Consulate of Mexico in Phoenix were escorted out by Phoenix police officers Sunday afternoon, after they refused to leave, calling for Mexican election officials to allow them to vote.\n\nAt 5 p.m., INE personnel closed their doors, allowing only those inside the building to cast their vote and leaving hundreds of voters outside in 100-degree heat. Most of the folks outside who spoke to The Republic had a similar experience — some had arrived as early as 5 a.m. and waited 12 hours only to be turned away.\n\nTen minutes after closing the space, officials opened the doors to the consulate once again and an avalanche of people entered the facilities demanding their right to vote.\n\nPhoenix police officers in patrol cars circulated outside the consulate and around 5:40 p.m. an officer entered the voting space to evacuate Mexican citizens. Outraged, they began to leave the consulate while others argued with election officials. No arrests had been reported.\n\nAaron González, originally from Hermosillo, Sonora, lined up at 8:30 a.m. thinking it was early, but by then the line was already too long. He was one of hundreds who failed to cast their vote on Sunday.\n\n“It is very sad for me because it is the first time that I was going to vote because it is the first time that I see that there is a change, that there is a purpose, and I couldn't vote.”\n\n— Paula Soria\n\n'We want to vote!' Polls close with hundreds still waiting in Phoenix\n\n\"We want to vote! We want to vote!\" This chant was heard across the parking lot in front of the General Consulate of Mexico in Phoenix, where hundreds of Mexican nationals were left without a chance to vote in the June 2 election as polls closed.\n\nConsulates in Arizona, California and Texas saw the same problem arise as voter turnout exceeded the INE's expectations.\n\nFrom very early hours, Mexican citizens formed long lines at consulates. In Phoenix, voters showed up as early as Saturday night to ensure their vote. As polls closed at 5 p.m., disenfranchised voters angrily demanded that INE officials at the Phoenix consulate open the doors and allow them to vote.\n\nIn Phoenix, an INE employee said, about an hour before closing, that an average of 60 people per hour have voted with five polling stations open.\n\nA similar situation was experienced at the Mexican Consulate in San José, Los Angeles and Fresno, California, and in Houston and Dallas, Texas, where residents expressed their discomfort about these delays.\n\n— Nadia Cantú and Paula Soria\n\nPolls officially close. When do results come in?\n\nAt 6 p.m. CST polls throughout Mexico and abroad closed. The INE said that if any citizen was in line at that time, they had the right to exercise their vote even after closing. For folks abroad, those who made it inside the consulate offices by closing time would have 30 minutes to cast their vote.\n\nThe tallying system — known as the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) — would begin counting at 8 p.m. CST, the INE said in a statement. Preliminary results could be expected within the hour.\n\nThe INE guaranteed voters that its system is secure and resistant to hacks, with an audit that is simultaneously carried out by the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Unidad Iztapalapa.\n\n”This computer system has modules for capturing digitized records and data, as well as verification and comparison functions between the captured data, as well as the image of the Scrutiny and Computation Record, which ensures that the information that is published in the results module is reliable,\" the statement reads.\n\n— Diana García\n\nVoting abroad 'has exceeded expectations'\n\nThe INE reported that Mexicans residing abroad showed up to the 23 consular offices overseas to participate in this election day in an unprecedented capacity.\n\n“In cities like Madrid, Los Angeles, Chicago and Phoenix, the large influx of people who wish to vote at the consular headquarters has exceeded expectations,” the electoral agency said in a Sunday afternoon statement.\n\nA total of 23 consular offices — 20 in the US, and three additional ones in Canada, Spain and France — were selected to vote as day-of operating centers, the first time this has been allowed during a general election. Every voting module was set up to serve those who are registered on the Nominal List of Electorates Abroad (LNEE), as well as 1,500 people who will be able to vote without prior registration.\n\nPolls were set to close at 6 p.m. CST, or 5 p.m. Arizona time.\n\nAccording to INE officials at the General Consulate of Mexico in Phoenix, where dozens of voters were hopeful for their chance to vote, doors would close at 5 p.m. Anyone who made it inside by that time would have until 5:30 p.m. to vote.\n\n— Diana García\n\nMajor delays as hundreds wait in Phoenix heat to cast vote\n\nHundreds of Mexican citizens braved an excessive heat warning in effect in Phoenix to cast their vote in Sunday's election.\n\nA line that wrapped around the parking lot in front of the General Consulate offices in Phoenix was still visible around noon, many protecting themselves from the extreme heat with umbrellas, cardboard boxes and, for the lucky ones, under a few canopies set up by the poll staffers.\n\nThe National Election Institute (INE) planned for over 2,000 ballots to be cast — over 500 from registered voters and 1,500 additional if needed from folks with an active voter registration who did not register to vote by the February deadline. All votes are submitted electronically in what should only take about 4-5 minutes, according to Beatriz Cabrera, an INE representative.\n\nBut by noon, just over 300 votes had been cast in Phoenix.\n\nCabrera attributed the long wait times to many senior folks not knowing how to use the voting technology, delaying what they anticipated would be a smooth electoral process.\n\n— Silvia Solis\n\nBorder residents cast their ballots\n\nHundreds of voters snaked around the outdoor gymnasium of a private school in a well-to-do neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, waiting to cast a paper ballot.\n\nThis industrial powerhouse across from El Paso, Texas, is home to more than 300 factories that pump out everything from car parts to wind blades for export to the United States. It's also notorious for its high level of violence tied to organized crime.\n\nAreli Márquez, 30, said she had been waiting an hour already but was excited to cast her ballot \"during a historic moment\" when Mexico will elect its first woman president.\n\nMárquez said she is most concerned with education and violence against women.\n\n\"I hope that a woman president can reduce the violence and ensure the value of women's rights,\" she said.\n\nMárquez said she wants to see policies and scholarships that would allow the country's youth to study instead of prematurely going to work to earn for their families.\n\n— Lauren Villagran\n\nPresidential candidates vote in historic election in Mexico\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum, Xóchitl Gálvez and Jorge Álvarez Máynez cast their votes early Sunday surrounded by supporters.\n\nSheimbaum, the leading candidate, told the crowd outside of the Tlalpan polling place — the Mexico City burrough where she currently lives — that she cast her ballot in favor of another candidate, Ifigenia Martínez, a senator with the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), who is not a candidate.\n\n“¡Qué viva la democracia!” “Long live democracy!” she said as she addressed the crowd following her vote.\n\nGálvez cast her vote in her corresponding polling place at the Miguel Hidalgo Mayor's Office in Mexico City and called on all Mexicans to vote, recognizing a difficult and close election day ahead.\n\n“To all the citizens, my most sincere recognition for the effort you are going to make which is done voluntarily. To those who are watching over votes today, you also have my respect and my recognition,” she said after casting her ballot.\n\nMáynez cast his vote at the polling station located in Colonia Condesa, Mexico City, accompanied by his family and his campaign team.\n\n— Diana García\n\nSheinbaum casts historic vote\n\nSheinbaum casts historic vote in Mexico’s City burrough\n\nSurrounded by hundreds of voters and supporters and to the chorus of “president, president, president!” Claudia Sheinbaum cast her historic vote at the Tlalpan polling station, in Mexico City.\n\nThe Morena candidate arrived at the polling station shortly after 10 a.m. to greet the electorate and stand in line with them.\n\nWithin an hour, she left the venue, applauded by the crowd.\n\n— Diana Garcia\n\nHundreds wait to cast ballot in Phoenix\n\nHundreds of Mexican nationals living in Phoenix lined up outside the offices of the Consulate General of Mexico in downtown, waiting to cast their ballot in this historic election.\n\nThis year marks the first time ever that Mexican citizens living abroad can cast their ballot in the U.S. via participating consulate offices. Phoenix’s office is the only active polling place for Arizona.\n\nJust two hours after polls opened, hundreds lined the outside of the consulate, some arguing there was a lack of organization.\n\n— Silvia Solis, Nadia Cantú\n\nAMLO casts last vote as president\n\nAccompanied by his wife, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador cast his vote just before 10 a.m. Sunday at a polling place along Morena Street, near his residence at Palacio Nacional in Mexico City.\n\nThis is the last vote he will cast as President of Mexico before handing leadership over to the next country’s leader Oct. 1.\n\nLópez Obrador was expected to cast his ballot in support of his party candidate Sheinbaum, who has been ahead in the polls by at least 20 percentage points and the expected winner of Sunday’s election.\n\nMeanwhile, in Tlalpan, Mexico City’s borough where Sheinbaum served as delegation chief from 2015-2017, dozens of voters lined up as they waited for the Morena presidential candidate to cast her vote.\n\n— Diana García", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/africa/kenya-elections-women-candidates-intl/index.html", "title": "A record number of women are running in Kenya's elections but ...", "text": "Lamu, Kenya CNN —\n\nJust before sunset, Umra Omar boards a speedboat that will take her around the historic Lamu channel for meetings with voters. As her boat zooms past idyllic islands and arrives at shore 30 minutes later, dozens of women and children rush to greet a candidate they hope will be their next governor.\n\nOmar is native to Lamu, a conservative region near the Somali border, best known for its preserved Swahili culture and being a UNESCO heritage site.\n\n“If we’re to address the challenges we’re facing as women, young people, and indigenous communities, we have to take up the political battle as well,” she tells CNN.\n\nThe 39-year-old is the coastal county’s first female candidate for the top job. She is among a record number of women running for office in Kenya’s August 9 general election.\n\nOmar is a humanitarian who has in the past been named a CNN Hero for her work with award-winning social enterprise Safari Doctors, which provides basic healthcare in remote areas of Lamu.\n\nShe says she is running for office as a natural progression after seven years of providing “band-aid solutions”for poor healthcare.\n\n“Being able to really dig our teeth into the root causes of rural challenges is what definitely propelled us into politics,” Omar says.\n\nBut she faces an uphill battle.\n\nEven though women make up nearly half of registered voters, Kenya still has the fewest elected female leaders in East Africa.\n\nA constitutionally mandated gender quota to break the male supermajority in power has consistently failed in the 12 years since it was passed.\n\nBut this election could be different.\n\n‘Kenya is ready for women at all levels’\n\nIf opposition leader Raila Odinga wins, Kenya could have its first female deputy president in 64-year-old Martha Karua.\n\nWhen she ran for president on her own in 2013, Karua got less than 1% of the vote, coming a distant sixth behind five men.\n\nVeteran politician and former Justice Minister Martha Karua addresses a crowd during a campaign rally in Kirigiti Stadium on August 1, in Kiambu, Kenya. If elected, she will become the country's first female deputy president. Ed Ram/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nIn the 25 years since a woman first ran for Kenya’s presidency, this is the closest any has come to the top seat.\n\nKarua bristles when asked if Kenya is ready for a female president like neighboring Tanzania.\n\n“That question suggests that women ought not to be on the ballot, because I have never had anybody question whether Kenyans are ready for yet another male. So that question is in itself discriminatory,” the former Kenyan justice minister tells CNN.\n\n“I think that Kenya is ready for women at all levels.”\n\nHer nomination energized the Odinga campaign and excited many women, some of whom compare her to US Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn her three decades in Kenyan politics, Karua has earned a reputation as a principled politician and the nickname “the Iron Lady” – a moniker she hates.\n\n“That name speaks to the misogyny within society. Strength is not perceived as female, strength is perceived as male,” Karua tells CNN pointing out that it was first used to describe former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who came to power in 1979.\n\n“It speaks to the misogyny and the patriarchy that rules the world,” she says.\n\n‘A systematic exclusion of women’\n\nAlthough the number of women entering Kenya’s political sphere has grown over the years, only 23% of seats were held by women in the last parliament. That includes the Woman Representative positions that are exclusively reserved for them – 47 seats out of 349 are currently reserved for women for this position.\n\n“We’re seeing more and more women running, which tells us it has never been a problem about women wanting to participate in politics,” says Marilyn Kamuru, a lawyer and writer on women in politics. “It continues to be a problem about the systematic exclusion of women.”\n\nThat exclusion includes financial barriers to competing in notoriously expensive campaigns that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, and regular violence employed against women running and even those already serving in office. For example, in 2019, a Kenyan MP was arrested for allegedly slapping a female colleague and calling her names.\n\n“It chills the environment for women, it makes women think again, hold back,” and consider running for lower positions or abandoning their campaigns altogether, Kamuru says.\n\nThe latest election cycle has followed the familiar pattern, with many women reporting violence or threats of physical harm and misogyny being used to intimidate them out of the race.\n\n“We’ve had some major, mindblowing character assassination, to the point of discrediting the work that we’ve been doing with Safari Doctors, but we try not to let that distract us,” Omar says.\n\nShe laments the propaganda used against her in the race, including taboo accusations such as being an LGBT “recruiter” or a drug dealer to derail her campaign.\n\nIt is harder for women in rural parts of Kenya to be involved politically because of socio-cultural barriers, Daisy Amdany, women’s rights advocate and executive director at the Nairobi-based Community Advocacy and Awareness Trust, told CNN affiliate NTV.\n\n“There are certain cultures that don’t even give women the right to keep their voter cards, so you need a man’s permission,” Amdany said. She added that negotiated situations where elders determine who gets to run for office also disadvantage women and they are “more common than you would think.”\n\nDespite the roadblocks to political office, Kenyan women persist. “As long as we remain non-negotiable players the system has to accommodate us,” Kamuru said.\n\nA long shot campaign\n\nThe powerful governor role Omar is eying is considered a long shot as only three out of Kenya’s 47 counties are headed by a woman. One recent opinion poll placed her thirdout of four candidatesbut she’s not discouraged.\n\nWhile everyone CNN spoke to in Lamu was aware that she was running, some men felt that she was punching above her weight and should have vied for the less powerful Woman Representative county-wide parliamentary seat.\n\nBut 24-year-old Constance Kadzo, owner of a small grocery stall, told CNN she was inspired to see an indigenous Swahili woman running for a top seat.\n\n“I’m voting for her because she’s the only woman who’s brave enough to go up against the men and I know she will fight for us.”", "authors": ["Larry Madowo Bethlehem Feleke", "Larry Madowo", "Bethlehem Feleke"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}]}

From miscaptioned videos to false claims about his conviction, viral claims have repeatedly misrepresented the president's son and his relationship with the law.\n\nIn the wake of Biden’s conviction on three federal gun charges, the USA TODAY Fact Check team recapped some of the false and misleading claims that have gone spread most widely — and what’s actually true.\n\nRead more: After Hunter Biden's guilty verdict, a look back at viral falsehoods\n\nJoe Biden doesn't address Hunter Biden case in first public comments since verdict\n\nJoe Biden gave remarks on gun violence in Washington on Tuesday, just hours after his son was convicted in his felony gun trial.\n\nThe president spoke at Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund’s “Gun Sense University,” where he called for banning assault weapons, instituting universal background checks and passing other gun control measures.\n\nJoe Biden was specifically addressing gun violence in his remarks. Hunter Biden was not accused of physically harming others in the felony case.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat kind of gun did Hunter Biden buy?\n\nThe gun Hunter Biden purchased and held onto for 11 days in 2018 is a .38 caliber Cold Cobra, known as a 38 special. The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense. The president's son told Delaware State Police he bought it for target practice in 2018.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nJoe Biden said he would not pardon Hunter Biden while he was on trial for federal gun charges last week, according to a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nABC anchor David Muir, interviewing Biden in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, asked whether he would accept the outcome of his son’s trial.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\nMuir also asked if he would rule out a pardon for his son.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the military?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge, which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict adds to Joe Biden's distractions\n\nHunter Biden's felony conviction on Tuesday could continue to distract President Joe Biden during pivotal weeks of his 2024 reelection bid, with the first presidential debate against former President Donald Trump fast approaching and the president's son's second federal criminal trial coming shortly before Election Day.\n\nAlthough not a part of his father's campaign and not on the ballot himself, Hunter Biden's conviction on three gun related charges could also complicate Joe Biden's campaign's labeling of his opponent, Trump, as a felon who should not return to the Oval Office.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat's next for Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden’s conviction in his federal gun trial is not the end of his legal drama.\n\nStill pending are the 54-year-old's sentence, his potential appeal and a Supreme Court case that could overturn the law behind his charges. The president's son − a lawyer, businessman and author − also faces a second federal trial on tax charges set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for the three charges: lying on a federal screening form by denying, lying to a gun dealer and possession of a firearm while using or addicted to unlawful drugs. But sentences for first-time and nonviolent offenders are typically shorter than the maximum possible.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGOP lawmakers both celebrate and downplay Hunter Biden verdict\n\nFor the Republicans who have long sought to prove wrongdoing by President Joe Biden and his family, Tuesday’s jury decision finding the president’s adult son, Hunter, guilty on all charges was welcome news.\n\nHowever, the fanfare was somewhat muted – at least, less than one might expect from a Congressional cohort that has been probing the Biden family's business ties for more than a year and with a presidential campaign already in full bloom ahead of November's Election Day.\n\nHouse Republicans spearheaded an investigation in 2023 and early 2024 into Hunter Biden’s ties to foreign businesses as part of an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. They say Joe Biden benefited financially from Hunter Biden’s business deals, but have not unearthed evidence that supports that claim and the inquiry has largely fizzled out.\n\n– Riley Beggin and Ken Tran\n\nDavid Weiss speaks publicly after verdict\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss said in a three-minute statement that the verdict reflected that no one in the country is above the law. He thanked Attorney General Merrick Garland for ensuring his independence of the investigation.\n\n“Ultimately this case was not just about addiction,” Weiss said. “This case was about the illegal choices the defendant made while in the throes of addiction.”\n\nWeiss did not take questions from the media, noting DOJ has \"additional trial work to be done\" on the Hunter Biden case.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Isabel Hughes\n\nJuror: ‘Oh man, I don’t want to be here.’\n\nA couple of the jurors who heard the Hunter Biden trial are speaking publicly about their deliberations.\n\nOne woman who served said she feared the case would be politically charged once she realized the trial involved the president’s son.\n\n“Oh man, I don’t want to be here,” she said. “I was expecting all of us to be at each other’s throats because you know of who his father is and how the political climate is in this country,” she said.\n\nBut after being selected, evaluating the evidence and returning guilty verdicts, she said there was not a problem with deliberations.\n\n“It turned out much better than what I expected,” she said. “There was not fighting, none of that in the jury room.”\n\nAnother juror agreed that politics played no role in any jurors vote.\n\n“It was just following the evidence,” the juror said. “We just had to find out the truth.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Bart Jansen\n\nJurors: First vote was split even\n\nTwo jurors who presided over Hunter Biden’s criminal trial said they took an evenly split vote on count one shortly after receiving the case for less than an hour of deliberation on Monday afternoon.\n\nFrom there, they studied the elements of the charges in the jury instructions and talked, jurors said. They deliberated for about two hours after returning guilty verdicts.\n\n“We broke it down and heard other people’s opinions,” one juror said after issuing the verdict. “That is what moved me to guilty on all three.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJuror says Hunter Biden case was a 'waste of taxpayer dollars'\n\nA female juror who lives near New Castle, Delaware said she felt the case should not have been prosecuted. She said Biden needed rehab, “definitely not imprisonment.\"\n\n“In my opinion this was a waste of taxpayer dollars,” the woman said as she left the courthouse. “They could have just fined him.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHere's how Hunter Biden, his lawyer Abbe Lowell reacted to verdict\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking his family for their love and support during the trial while saying he was “disappointed by the outcome.”\n\n“Recovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time,” Biden said.\n\nHis lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said he respected the jury’s verdict, but he would “continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump advisor comments on Hunter Biden's conviction\n\nKash Patel, a national security advisor for former President Donald Trump, said in a statement Tuesday that \"Hunter Biden’s guilty verdict is a rare example of constitutional justice, one not where individuals receive biased treatment based on their last name. The jury was able to consider the prosecution and the defense evidence in full, in accordance with due process.\"\n\nPatel alleged without evidence that the former president did not receive the same treatment in his New York hush money trial, when he was convicted on 34 felony counts.\n\n– Erin Mansfield and Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden reacts to Hunter Biden's verdict\n\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement on Tuesday following Hunter Biden's conviction, saying that \"I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\"\n\nHe added that \"(first lady Jill Biden) and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRead Hunter Biden's verdict\n\nWhen will Hunter Biden be sentenced? Judge Maryellen Noreika doesn't immediately set date\n\nMaryellen Noreika, the judge who presided over Hunter Biden's case, didn't set a sentencing date for the president's son on Tuesday.\n\n\"Usually when we do sentencing it is 120 days out, but we will get in touch with you,\" she said before the courtroom adjourned.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden guilty of?\n\nThe president's son was convicted on three firearms felonies. In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n2024:Hunter Biden guilty verdict adds to president's distractions ahead of Trump debate\n\nHunter Biden looks to lawyer, wife after verdict announced\n\nHunter Biden pat Abbe Lowell, his lawyer, on the back after his felony conviction was announced. He then turned to look at his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden and hugged other members of his defense team.\n\nHe was holding his wife's hand as he was ushered into elevators after the court adjourned.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Esteban Parra\n\nWhat's next for Hunter Biden?Sentencing, likely appeal and looming trial on tax charges\n\nHallie Biden received texts about drugs from Hunter Biden\n\nHallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, testified during the trial about how her brother-in-law introduced her to drugs. She also walked the jury through a series of text messages in the days after Hunter Biden bought the gun on Oct. 12, 2018.\n\nA text the next day said he was behind a baseball stadium in Wilmington “waiting on a dealer named Mookie.”\n\nHallie Biden later texted Hunter Biden, stating that she tried calling him “500 times in the past 24 hours.” He eventually responded: “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nHunter Biden called Hallie Biden ‘stupid’ for trashing gun\n\nHallie Biden told the jury she found the gun in Hunter Biden's car 11 days after he bought it. Rather than risk their kids finding it, she put the gun in a leather case and drove to a grocery store, where she threw it into a trash can.\n\n“I realized it was a stupid idea now, but I was just panicking,” Hallie Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden confronted her when he discovered what she had done.\n\n“It’s hard for me to believe anyone is that stupid,” Hunter Biden said in a text. “Do you want me dead?” he asked in a later text.\n\nRetiree found gun in grocery store trash can\n\nAn 80-year-old retiree, Edward Banner, who scavenged trash containers for aluminum cans, found the gun outside Janssen’s Market in Greenville. A state police lieutenant tracked him down and asked whether he’d found anything unusual.\n\n“I definitely remember finding that,” Banner said.\n\nFBI chemist found cocaine residue on Hunter Biden gun pouch\n\nForensic chemist Jason Brewer testified that he found cocaine in the residue on the leather pouch that held Hunter Biden’s gun. Two spots on the pouch had a “minimal amount” of “off-white powder,” which Brewer pointed out in a picture prosecutors projected onto a screen in Biden’s trial on gun charges.\n\n“Cocaine was identified within the residual white particles I sampled,” he told the jury.\n\nHunter Biden trial followed collapse of plea deal for gun and tax charges\n\nA plea agreement that fell apart last July offered the possibility Biden could avoid jail time for all of the charges. Noreika rejected the deal because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about Biden’s protection from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, a special counsel to continue an independent investigation. Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued unsuccessfully the charges should be dismissed because no new evidence had emerged since the plea agreement.\n\nThe gun indictment charged Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver. He was charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he was charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms. The three charges carried a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nThe tax indictment charges Biden with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors. He allegedly engaged in a scheme in which he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed taxes from 2016 through 2019, and also evaded tax assessment for 2018 when he filed false returns.\n\nThe previous agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, which could have resulted in no jail time, and enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied.\n\nBut Republicans blasted the agreement as a sweetheart deal and Hunter Biden became a lightning rod for criticism of his father.\n\nWhere does Hunter Biden live?\n\nHunter Biden lives in southern California.

He's faced three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.

And it’s the place where, last weekend, he made a decision that his critics and even some of his supporters fear will tarnish his legacy long after he has left office.\n\nOn Sunday, just hours after returning to Washington following another Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket, Biden announced that he had granted a “full and unconditional pardon” to Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of federal gun charges and also pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax evasion.\n\nThe Democratic president had insisted for months that he would not pardon his 54-year-old son. But the White House said, after agonizing over the decision, he changed his mind because he felt Hunter Biden had been unfairly targeted by political opponents who were looking to break him by going after his family.\n\nThe backlash against the 82-year-old lame-duck chief executive was predictable, swift and bipartisan.\n\n“Joe Biden is a liar and a hypocrite, all the way to the end,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wrote on X.\n\n“It sets a bad precedent,” conceded Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who will soon be sworn as his state's junior senator.\n\nBiden leaves office in just a little more than a month, but the precedent-setting nature of the sweeping pardon issued in the final stretch of his presidency could shape how he is remembered for years to come.\n\n“The problem that President Biden has legacy-wise is he said he wouldn't pardon his son,” said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian and professor of history at Rice University. “He gave his word, crossed his heart, and then alas, he ended up doing it. It will strike some people as unfair and other people will say it’s a father doing what he had to.”\n\nIn the end, Brinkley said, the pardon will be “a dark mark” on Biden's legacy.\n\n“There's nothing positive about it,” he said.\n\n'An albatross around his father's neck'\n\nInterviews with Biden’s supporters, historians and political experts, along with the president's own memoir and statements from lawmakers following the pardon, make clear that his legacy will be defined by his two sons – and his nemesis Donald Trump, whose two nonconsecutive terms as president will serve as bookends to Biden’s single term in office.\n\nBiden entered the White House in January 2021 promising Americans that he would offer competent leadership, a steady hand and a return to normalcy after four chaotic years of Trump, who he had defeated in a close, hard-fought election. The country was still in the throes of the COVID pandemic, so Biden took on the task of mobilizing vaccination shots and instituting an unpopular mask mandate. Over time, COVID deaths declined, Biden lifted the mask mandate, and Americans went on with their lives.\n\nBut Biden’s presidency also was at times rocked by turmoil. Inflation rose to a 40-year high, 13 soldiers died during the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, migrants poured into the country illegally along the southern border, and wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip tested the nation's influence on the world stage.\n\nBiden’s last-minute decision to end his bid for a second term amid questions about whether he could beat Trump again and Vice President Kamala Harris’ entry into the race as the Democratic nominee injected uncertainty in the presidential contest. Harris’ loss to Trump in November was a serious blow to Biden and his legacy since many of his accomplishments in office will almost certainly be wiped out by Trump when he returns to the White House in January.\n\nBiden’s pardon of his son complicates his legacy even more.\n\n“Hunter Biden's been an albatross around his father's neck for the entire presidency,” Brinkley said.\n\n'We want you to run'\n\nBoth of Biden’s sons had wanted him to run for president and urged him, during the family Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket, to enter the race to succeed Barack Obama. Biden was vice president at the time.\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2014, just after returning from Thanksgiving dinner in Nantucket, Biden sat on a couch in the Naval Observatory, the vice president’s official residence in Washington, D.C., and made a diary entry, he wrote in his 2017 memoir “Promise me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose.”\n\n“NavObs, November 30, 2014, 7:30 p.m.,” Joe Biden wrote. “Just home from Nantucket. I pray we have another year together in 2015. Beau. Beau. Beau. Beau.”\n\nThat Thanksgiving meal in 2014 would be the last he would have with Beau. The eldest Biden son, a former Delaware attorney general and Delaware National Guard member who served in Iraq, died of brain cancer six months later on May 30, 2015, at age 46.\n\nCourt records:President Biden bypassed Justice Department in pardoning son Hunter\n\nIn his memoir, Biden chronicles balancing his duties as vice president and wrestling with the question of running for president in 2016 during the gut-wrenching period while Beau Biden fought for and lost his life.\n\n“You’ve got to run. I want you to run,” Joe Biden recalled Beau saying.\n\nHunter Biden agreed, telling his father: “We want you to run.”\n\n“Hunt kept telling me that of all the potential candidates I was the best prepared and best able to lead the country,” Biden wrote. “But it was the conviction and intensity in Beau’s voice that caught me off guard. At one point he said it was my obligation to run, my duty. ‘Duty’ was a word Beau Biden did not use lightly.”\n\nStill grieving the loss of his son, Biden decided to sit out the 2016 presidential race and watched from the sidelines as Trump scored an upset victory against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Four years later, Biden would adhere to both of his sons’ wishes and run for the nation’s highest office, defeating Trump in a race that was so acrimonious that Trump refused to concede he lost.\n\nMeanwhile, Beau Biden’s death crushed his younger brother, who descended into depression and began drinking heavily, using crack cocaine and indulging in other self-destructive behavior.\n\nA Yale-educated lawyer, Hunter Biden was involved in a number of foreign financial dealings in Ukraine and China that would dog his father’s White House campaign in 2020 and would become the target of investigations by the Justice Department and congressional Republicans. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden resulted in his first impeachment, which ended in a Senate acquittal.\n\nLast summer, Hunter Biden's legal troubles exploded into public view. In June, a Delaware jury convicted him of three charges for lying about his drug use on a document that he had filled out when buying a handgun in 2018. In September, he pled guilty to federal tax evasion charges for a period spanning from 2016 to 2019. He had been scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 12 for his conviction on federal gun charges and Dec. 16 on the tax charges.\n\nJoe Biden’s sweeping pardon clears his son in both of those cases – both of which have since been terminated – and applies to any other federal crimes Hunter Biden may have committed over the past decade. That is significant because Trump had threatened to continue and amplify the federal investigation into the Biden family’s business dealings upon his return to office.\n\nIn his statement announcing the pardon, Joe Biden said he watched his son “being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.”\n\n“There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,” the president wrote. “In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here.”\n\n'Unprecedented':Hunter Biden pardon 'very unusual,' experts say\n\nUltimately, Trump's election victory may have forced Biden's hand.\n\n\"If it had been a different type of Republican being inaugurated president in January, Biden may have thought twice,\" Brinkley said. \"But the thought of Trump in the end having control over his son's future in a federal prison was a bridge too far.\"\n\nBiden's supporters say they understand the president’s desire to protect his son.\n\n“It is his only (living) son, and Trump being the vindictive man, he would have persecuted Hunter further simply to make a point,” said Shekar Narasimhan, a donor and longtime supporter of the president. “I cannot put myself in Joe Biden’s shoes. But I cannot criticize this decision given the circumstances.”\n\nEven so, the criticism of Biden’s actions has been unrelenting and came not just from the expected Republican corners, but also from his fellow Democrats.\n\nSen. Michael Bennett, D-Colo., said on X that Biden’s “decision put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans’ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.”\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., said Biden’s pardon confirmed a common belief she hears in southwest Washington: that well-connected people are often gifted special treatment by a two-tier justice system.\n\n“The President made the wrong decision. No family should be above the law,” she wrote on X.\n\nBipartisan criticism:President Biden faces backlash from Democrats for breaking promise by pardoning son\n\nBiden accused of trying to 'rewrite history'\n\nPresidents have broad authority under the Constitution to grant pardons for federal crimes, but many, like Biden, have faced criticism for how they’ve used that power.\n\nGerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon probably cost him a second term. Bill Clinton was pilloried for granting a series of pardons in his final hours in office, including one for his brother Roger Clinton, who had been convicted of selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. Trump pardoned dozens of people during his first term, including including his son-in-law's father and some of his closest allies who were convicted of crimes ranging from financial fraud to witness tampering and more.\n\nBiden, however, is the first president to pardon one of his children.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, who on Tuesday ended the criminal tax case against Hunter Biden following his pardon, took a shot at the president’s characterization of his son's prosecution. The Trump-appointed California federal judge wrote that the Constitution gives the president broad authority to grant clemency, \"but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history.\"\n\n“For example,” Scarsi wrote, “the President asserts that Mr. Biden ‘was treated differently’ from others ‘who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions,’ implying that Mr. Biden was among those individuals who untimely paid taxes due to addiction. But he is not.”\n\nMelissa DeRosa, a Democratic strategist and author, said the Democratic Party is going to be further splintered by Biden’s decision.\n\n“Now you have a split within the party about whether or not this was the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do at a moment when the party is already so fractured coming out of this election and trying to figure out who it is,” she said.\n\nAmericans can sympathize with a parent wanting to help their child, she said, but Biden’s actions undermine his credibility and his legacy and who people believed he was at his core.\n\n“He was always known as an honorable man with integrity,” DeRosa said. “And this calls that into question.”\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen and Michael Collins.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

Biden pleaded guilty Thursday to all nine charges he that failed to pay his taxes from 2016 through 2019. His June trial and conviction on three gun charges featured wrenching testimony about his addiction to crack cocaine during that period and he avoided putting his family through a second ordeal with his surprise tax plea.\n\nBiden, 54, must now prepare for sentencing Nov. 13 of up to 25 years in prison on the gun charges and Dec. 16 of up to 17 years on the tax charges. The convictions came after a plea agreement fell through in July 2023 that provided a chance for him to walk away with probation and no prison time.\n\nBut legal experts expect Biden, as a first-time offender, to get nowhere near the statutory maximums when U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika sentences him in the gun case and when U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi sentences him in the tax case.\n\nMore:'I will not subject my family to more pain:' Hunter Biden pleads guilty to tax charges\n\nFederal authorities will calculate sentencing guidelines for the judges based on the circumstances of the crime, mitigating factors such as addiction issues, the amount of unpaid taxes of at least $1.4 million and the need for deterrence of future crime. But the judges aren't bound by the guidelines and defense lawyers could ask for less punishment.\n\nShanlon Wu, a former counselor to Clinton-era Attorney General Janet Reno, said he would be “a little bit surprised if he gets hit hard with a bunch of actual jail time” as a first-time offender.\n\n“I think we should expect a relatively light sentence,” Wu said. “Given these circumstances I don’t think it’s impossible the judge could give him probation or home confinement.”\n\nLegal experts expect Biden to highlight his recovery from drug addiction, his repayment of the taxes before charges were filed and the lack of need for a deterrent to discourage him from buying another gun while using drugs.\n\nMore:As Democrats kick off convention, House GOP unveils Biden impeachment report\n\n“What I expect he will argue at sentencing is at the end of the day, all of these issues were driven by his addiction, which he’s now got under control and he has been put through the ringer in ways that an ordinary citizen, whose father was not a political figure, probably would not have been,” said Julian Andre, a former federal prosecutor. “The assumption is he’s going to seek probation and argue the government thought that was appropriate two years ago.\"\n\nHere's what we know about sentencing:\n\nHunter Biden's high profile shouldn't hurt him at sentencing: experts\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued that prosecutors charged him with more crimes after the collapse of the plea agreement without additional evidence because of political pressure on Justice Department special counsel David Weiss. But Weiss told Congress politics played no role in the investigation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said Scarsi, who is presiding over the tax case in Los Angeles, could order a stiff sentence because the case has drawn so much attention. \"My sense is that he might be strict on sentencing, especially in such a high profile case,\" Tobias said.\n\nBut Andre said it would be \"problematic\" for either court to sentence Biden to a longer term because his father is president.\n\n“I assume the court will take the position that his prominence is irrelevant, that he should be treated like any person who pleaded guilty to these crimes,\" Andre said.\n\nMore:Hunter Biden tries to toss criminal cases based on Trump special counsel ruling\n\nBiden's lawyers expected to argue gun and tax charges rarely prosecuted: experts\n\nThe gun charges against Biden − lying about his drug use when he bought a handgun in 2018 and then possessed it for 11 days before a romantic partner threw it away − are rarely prosecuted unless the weapon was used in a crime of violence, legal experts said. The tax charges are rarely prosecuted when repaid, experts said.\n\nAlso unusual is for a defendant to plead guilty to all charges without an agreement with prosecutors about the sentencing. Biden will be able to argue he took responsibility and repaid the debt.\n\n“It’s a very, very unusual thing,\" Wu said. “It does allow Lowell to make the argument that he’s totally accepted responsibility here.\"\n\nMore:Supreme Court orders another review of gun charge behind Hunter Biden's conviction\n\nWhat happened with Hunter Biden's plea deal?\n\nThe plea agreement that collapsed in July 2023 anticipated Biden pleading guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges for not paying taxes and entering a pretrial program for lying when he bought the gun while using drugs.\n\nBut prosecutors and defense lawyers disagreed at the plea hearing about whether the deal protected Biden from other potential future charges. Noreika rejected the plea agreement because of the dispute.\n\nBiden’s concern was that he was also under investigation for possibly lobbying for foreign entities to influence government policy without reporting it, a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He had business deals with companies in Ukraine, China and other countries that Republicans have seized on. But Biden hasn’t been charged with foreign lobbying.\n\nMore:Hunter Biden's gun case was spurred by an ATF form.

There was no evidence the president discussed business when he called his son when he was meeting with potential clients.\n\n\"It was, you know, just general niceties and, you know, conversation in general, about the geography, about the weather, whatever it may be,\" Devon Archer, a Hunter Biden business associate, told a House panel.\n\nAfter a hearing in March, even some House Republicans questioned the evidence against the president.\n\n\"What's missing, despite years of investigation, is the smoking gun that connects his ne'er-do-well son's corruption,\" a former prosecutor, Rep.

Here are the convictions that led to a presidential pardon\n\nPresident Biden, White House repeatedly denied pardon\n\nFor months, the White House repeatedly denied Biden would pardon Hunter Biden.\n\nJoe Biden said in June during a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News that he would not pardon his son. \"No,\" the president told reporters traveling with him to an economic summit in June when asked whether he would do so.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, repeated the denials, telling reporters Sept. 5 that the president wouldn't pardon or commute Hunter Biden's sentence.\n\n\"No, it is still very much a no,\" she said.\n\nShe continued to deny a possible pardon as recently as Nov. 8.\n\n“We've been asked that question multiple times,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"Our answer stands, which is no.\"\n\nJohnson pointed to those denials in condemning the pardon.\n\n“President Biden insisted many times he would never pardon his own son for his serious crimes,” he wrote on X. “But last night he suddenly granted a ‘Full and Unconditional Pardon’ for any and all offenses that Hunter committed for more than a decade!”\n\nMore:President Biden pardons his son Hunter Biden despite pledges not to\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One as the president traveled to Angola, Jean-Pierre said Biden had \"agonized\" over the decision. “There were political opponents who were very clear and very vocal about going after his son,” Jean-Pierre said. “One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn’t seem like his political opponents would let go of it. It didn’t seem like they would move on.”\n\nDuring his first term, Trump regularly assailed Hunter Biden, and numerous leading Republicans, including his nominees to lead the Justice Department, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, had labeled him a criminal long before the gun and tax convictions.\n\nThe pardon was necessary, wrote Norm Eisen, who was special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Donald Trump’s first impeachment, because \"Trump otherwise would’ve tortured Hunter.”\n\nDemocrats call pardon 'warranted' but also 'bad precedent'\n\nDemocratic reaction to the pardon was mixed.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder called the pardon “warranted” and said that most prosecutors would not have pursued the gun case unless the weapon was later used in a violent crime − a claim echoed by President Biden. Holder contrasted the Hunter Biden prosecution with Trump’s announcement that he will nominate MAGA loyalist Kash Patel as FBI director.\n\n“Ask yourself a vastly more important question,” Holder wrote on X. “Do you really think Kash Patel is qualified to lead the world’s preeminent law enforcement investigative organization? Obvious answer: hell no.”\n\nU.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., criticized the pardon as a misuse of power.\n\n\"President Biden’s decision to pardon his son was wrong. A president's family and allies shouldn't get special treatment,\" Peters said in a statement. \"This was an improper use of power, it erodes trust in our government, and it emboldens others to bend justice to suit their interests.\"\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Biden’s pardon sets a bad precedent that can be abused down the road, arguing that Hunter Biden “brought the legal trouble he faced on himself.”\n\n“While as a father I certainly understand President @JoeBiden ’s natural desire to help his son by pardoning him, I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country,” Polis said on social media. “This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.”\n\nHow did the Hunter Biden investigation begin?\n\nHunter Biden's criminal investigation began during the first Trump administration, which he revealed in December 2020.\n\nDavid Weiss, the Delaware U.S. attorney appointed by Trump and retained by Biden, eventually reached a plea agreement that called for Hunter Biden to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors, for which he could have received no jail time. He would have entered a pretrial program to avoid a gun charge if he went two years without committing another crime or relapsing.\n\nCongressional Republicans criticized the agreement as a \"sweetheart deal.\" U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected the deal over a dispute about what crimes it would have covered. Prosecutors said they could have still investigated Biden for not reporting foreign business deals under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nAfter the collapse of the plea deal, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Weiss a special counsel to continue his investigation with greater independence, which led to the two indictments on gun and tax charges.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges were the result of political pressure because the indictments contained no new evidence beyond what was available for the plea agreement. President Biden repeated that argument in issuing his pardon.\n\n\"Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases,\" Joe Biden said.\n\nTrump weighs pardoning Jan. 6 defendants\n\nThe pardon came after Trump has argued for years that Justice Department investigations of him were politically motivated.\n\nHe called special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election a partisan witch hunt and blasted special counsel Jack Smith, who secured two indictments against Trump on charges of conspiring to steal the 2020 election and mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nTrump has repeatedly considered pardoning defendants in the Jan. 6 riot as political prisoners. More than 1,500 people have been charged in the Jan. 6 attack on charges ranging from misdemeanors to violent felonies to seditious conspiracy. More than 1,000 have pleaded guilty.\n\n\"Biden is doing exactly the wrong thing by pardoning Hunter,\" John Bolton, who had served as Trump's national security adviser, wrote on X. \"This will now give Trump the license to pardon all of his supporters including those from Jan 6th.\"\n\n\"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\" Trump said on social media on Sunday. \"Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"\n\nHouse Republicans spent years investigating the president and his son for potential corruption based on Hunter Biden's overseas business deals. The White House rebutted the accusations by arguing lawmakers found no direct links showing Hunter Biden's income went to the president or influenced federal policy.\n\nBut Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., who heads the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, continued to accuse the president of years of corruption with his son.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability,” Comer said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/11/hunter-biden-felony-conviction-guilty-verdict-president-campaign/74004595007/", "title": "Hunter Biden's guilty verdict and President Joe Biden's campaign", "text": "WASHINGTON – Hunter Biden's felony conviction Tuesday could continue to distract President Joe Biden during pivotal weeks of his 2024 reelection bid, with the first presidential debate against former President Donald Trump fast approaching and the president's son's second criminal trial coming shortly before Election Day.\n\nAlthough not a part of his father's campaign and not on the ballot himself, Hunter Biden's conviction on three gun-related charges could also complicate Joe Biden's campaign's labeling of his opponent, Trump, as a felon who should not return to the Oval Office.\n\nHunter Biden, a 54-year-old businessman and attorney, was found guilty of falsely claiming he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt revolver in 2018 and illegally possessing that gun for 11 days after he bought it.\n\nTrump has largely avoided talking about the trial proceedings.

First lady Jill Biden, who is Hunter's stepmother, watched much of the testimony along with her daughter Ashley Biden and Hunter Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden. After about three hours of deliberation the jury found Hunter Biden guilty on three counts Tuesday.\n\nThroughout the the proceedings, the White House and Biden's campaign team refused to discuss the historic occurrence of the child of a sitting president facing felony criminal charges for the first time, which they called an internal family matter. Within an hour of the verdict, the president issued a statement that expressed his love for Hunter, saying he is “so proud of the man he is today.”\n\n“So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,” Joe Biden said.\n\nBut ultimately, the president underscored that he must respect the jury’s decision.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” Joe Biden said in his statement. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nThe president stayed away from the courthouse and avoided discussing the trial in public, but it has long been apparent that he is extremely protective of his youngest, and only surviving, son.\n\nJoe Biden halfway through the trial that if convicted, he would not pardon Hunter Biden.\n\nNonetheless, George W. Bush biographer Bill Minutaglio said the airing of Hunter Biden's dirty laundry has gone beyond what other president's children have been subject to, and that must eat at the president.\n\n\"I'm sure that he deeply, deeply cares for Hunter, and it must drive him crazy. It really must cause him a lot of sleepless nights to weigh the political calculus versus the personal calculus,\" Minutaglio said.\n\nThe family put up a united front in the Wilmington courtroom as it has for the unrelated year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Biden family's business dealings by House Republicans.\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about Hunter Biden?\n\nGOP officials largely avoided discussing the Delaware case, with some saying Republican voters were already up in arms about Trump's 34-count felony conviction and they didn't want to change the topic.\n\nHouse Republicans' impeachment inquiry into the president has largely stalled ahead of the election, though Republican leaders wrote to the Justice Department during the trial recommending Biden’s son Hunter and brother James be charged for making false statements to Congress during the investigation.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., who has been the face of that impeachment effort, called the verdict \"a step toward accountability\" but again urged the Justice Department to do its own investigation of Hunter Biden's overseas business.\n\nDuring the trial, Trump himself was asked to address the proceedings during an appearance on Fox News, but he instead pivoted to talk about addiction and his brother Fred Trump Jr., who died of complications from alcoholism.\n\nThat is noticeably different than how Trump acted in the 2020 contest. The former president repeatedly brought up Hunter Biden's business ties to Ukraine, and mocked his past drug abuse.\n\nThe former president's allies also released multiple reactions after the verdict.\n\nKash Patel, Trump's national security adviser, said in a statement that the verdict \"is a rare example of constitutional justice, one not where individuals receive biased treatment based on their last name\" and \"a fleeting moment of justice for all.\"\n\nHe attempted to contrast Hunter Biden's verdict with Trump's, saying in this situation the jury got to view all the evidence, a complaint Trump made in his case that the judge would not allow some evidence to be admitted.\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued an additional statement on Tuesday saying the Hunter Biden trial, “has been nothing more than a distraction” from the “real crimes” being investigated by Congress.\n\n“Crooked Joe Biden’s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on Nov. 5,\" Leavitt said.\n\nDuring their first presidential debate in 2020, Trump called out Hunter Biden for being administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nThe specter of Hunter Biden's legal troubles will likely rise again ahead of Election Day. He faces a second trial in September in California over his failure to pay taxes for several years.\n\nMore than half of Americans said in a Reuters/Ipsos poll last summer that they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he is the president's son. That includes 75% of Republicans, 42% of independents and 33% of Democrats, the survey showed.\n\nCongressional Republicans made similar claims Tuesday.\n\n\"Timing is everything. This is the veil of fairness in the Justice System under (the president),\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said on X, \"never forget DOJ tried to avoid this trial & verdict by giving Hunter a sweetheart plea deal. Until the judge exposed them.\" The gun case went to trial after a plea deal fell apart in July 2023 that could have resolved gun and taxes charges without prison time.\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict may also muddy waters for Democrats, who as of late have relished in calling Trump a convicted felon. Other progressive allies, however, may use this moment to undercut Trump and Republican claims that there is a two-tiered legal justice system.\n\nWill Hunter Biden's conviction matter to voters?\n\nWhether any of this will have an impact on the election is up for debate.\n\nRepublican thinkers hold varying opinions on how Hunter Biden’s legal woes could play out on the trail, with some suggesting Trump should take a no holds barred approach.\n\n“This takes the gloves off now that these law cases are part of the political system, and it’s perfectly clear now that they ought to be discussing Hunter Biden’s behavior. I do not think this should be left alone,” Jim Gilmore, a former Virginia governor who served in the Trump administration, told USA TODAY.\n\nPolling has shown the president's son isn't the top of mind for most voters, but other gauges show Joe Biden's son is a vulnerability.\n\nAn October 2023 AP-NORC poll found 68% of U.S. adults think Joe Biden acted either unethically or illegally in his son's business dealings. Just 30% said Joe Biden has done nothing wrong regarding Hunter’s business dealings.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican strategist, said it could be wise for Trump to mostly steer clear of talking about his son on the campaign trail.\n\n\"People already want to fire Biden, and where he's going to win the race is giving them a reason to rehire him and this has nothing to do with that,\" he said.\n\nBut Jennings said Hunter Biden's criminal charges could be used as a Republican jab against Biden when he speaks up for gun control or wealthier Americans paying a higher tax rate.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican political consultant who worked on former Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid, said the multiple Trump statements on Tuesday underscore that the presumptive GOP nominee’s team hasn’t figured out how to talk about this yet.\n\nShe said Trump won’t be able to resist bringing up Hunter Biden on the trail, but that may not win over pivotal voters.\n\n\"The problem is going to be fundamentally that Trump is on the ballot and Hunter isn’t,\" she argued. \"People really don’t care about Hunter as a criminal the way they care about Trump as a criminal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/13/joe-biden-donald-trump-hunter-biden-convicted-felon/74068598007/", "title": "Biden tagging Trump a 'convicted felon' muddied by son's conviction", "text": "WASHINGTON ― After Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts in his New York hush-money trial last month, President Joe Biden quickly embraced a new label for his successor and presumptive Republican nominee − \"convicted felon.\"\n\n“For the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,” Biden told supporters at a June 3 fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nYet with Tuesday's conviction of Hunter Biden on three gun charges by a federal court jury in Delaware, the same description now applies to the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict − a historic first for a child of a sitting president − could complicate the Biden campaign's efforts to use Trump's conviction for falsifying business records against the former president in the 2024 election.\n\nOfficials on Biden's reelection campaign and congressional Democrats have echoed the president calling Trump a \"convicted felon\" and \"convicted criminal.\" But after Tuesday's conviction of Hunter Biden, branding Trump a criminal might invite heightened scrutiny about Biden's family.\n\nA source close to the Biden campaign said it won't shy away from calling Trump a \"convicted felon\" even after Hunter Biden's conviction, insisting Americans know the difference between verdicts for Trump, who is running for president, and Hunter Biden, a private citizen.\n\nBut Republican strategist Scott Jennings said Hunter Biden's guilty verdict could provide Trump an effective counter during his first of two televised debates with Biden on June 27.\n\n\"Especially if Joe Biden goes in on repeatedly calling Donald Trump a convicted felon, trying to get under his skin,\" Jennings said. \"I think Trump could fire back. It might give Joe Biden some pause on how hard he goes at the debate, because he's going to have to deal with a retort.\"\n\nTrump also faces indictments in three other pending cases, two of which are federal, including his handling of classified documents and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. Outcomes for each, however, might not come until after the November election.\n\nRichard Painter, a law professor at University of Minnesota who was chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said he doesn't believe the Hunter Biden case has any relevance on Biden attacking Trump as a convicted felon.\n\n\"Hunter Biden is not running for president,\" Painter said. \"The real problem is that Donald Trump is running for president, and he has serious legal difficulties, and a lot of them have to do with his conduct in office. That directly goes to whether Donald Trump is capable of being a good president for four years.\"\n\nHunter Biden verdict delivers blow to Republicans' argument of 'weaponized' DOJ\n\nUnlike Trump, who has sought to discredit the U.S. judicial system and decried a \"rigged trial\" after his conviction, President Biden said he will accept the outcome of his son's case, respect the judicial process as Hunter Biden considers an appeal and won't pardon him.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday would not say whether Biden would consider commuting Hunter Biden's upcoming sentence, which will come on a later date.\n\nDemocrats seized on the parties' strikingly different reactions to the two cases.\n\n\"The divide here is stunning, and it's a great reminder that one political party remains committed to the rule of law and the other doesn't − it's that simple,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass, said at a congressional hearing Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans' claim of a \"weaponized Justice Department\" orchestrated by the Biden administration and Democrats was undercut by Hunter Biden's guilty verdict. The case was brought by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed Justice Department special counsel, and was overseen by a Trump-appointed judge. Hunter Biden also faces another federal trial starting Sept. 5 in California for allegedly avoiding taxes.\n\nStill, Trump and Republicans responded to Hunter Biden's guilty verdict by calling his conviction on gun charges \"a distraction\" from bigger crimes, pointing to unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden profited as vice president from his son's overseas business dealings.\n\n\"As usual, the only 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' going on around here is on the other side of the aisle,\" McGovern said. \"People are saying that Biden orchestrated the conviction of his own son in order to justify the criminal charges against Trump. That is how you think when you are in a cult.\"\n\nHe added: \"Here's the bottom line: Republicans just can't wrap their heads around the idea that their presidential candidate, your presumptive nominee, is a convicted felon.\"\n\nJulian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University, said he doesn't believe Hunter Biden's guilty verdict handcuffs the Biden campaign from labeling Trump a convicted felon, particularly given Republicans' continued efforts to delegitimize the legal system.\n\n\"I don't think the fact that Hunter Biden was convicted for this complicates the message,\" Zelizer said. \"In some ways, Democrats are hoping it strengthens how Americans see the Democrats being committed to a legal process that many Republicans are essentially questioning.\"\n\nThe first family has stayed loyal publicly to Hunter Biden amid his legal troubles. First lady Jill Biden sat on the front row of a Delaware federal courtroom throughout his trial. \"As I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" President Biden said in his statement after his son's conviction.\n\nAfter giving remarks before a gun control advocacy group in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, Biden altered his schedule to travel to Wilmington, Delaware, where he embraced Hunter Biden with a hug on an airport tarmac.\n\nBiden left Washington on Air Force One Wednesday for Italy, where he is attending a Group of Seven nations summit. The president has not taken questions from reporters about his son's conviction.\n\nZelizer said the enormous media consumption of Hunter Biden's guns case, along with the upcoming tax evasion trial, poses a challenge for the Biden campaign because it risks drawing attention from its argument against Trump and the former president's own legal woes.\n\nAnd even though Hunter Biden's cases don't involve the president, Zelizer said Trump and Republicans \"will try to muddy the waters\" and argue \"somehow this is evidence that the Biden family and President Biden is corrupt.\"\n\n\"So I do think this is something that can hurt Biden and that he needs to figure out how to overcome it,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Phillip Bailey.

He is also the oldest president in the nation's history.\n\nAn influential U.S. senator for 36 years before serving two terms as vice president beside Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, he twice ran for president and failed before he finally found success against Trump.\n\nIt was fitting that the 2020 election, reshaped by COVID-19, forced the Biden campaign to headquarter in Delaware, nearly making the state an unofficial running mate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's official unveiling was at A.I. du Pont High School in Greenville, Biden met with community and religious leaders in the wake of George Floyd's killing at Wilmington's Bethel AME Church, and the Democratic National Convention abandoned Milwaukee for the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. In between were Wilmington campaign events at The Queen, Delaware Museum of Natural History, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center and the Hotel du Pont.\n\nTen years earlier, Wilmington was also where then-President-elect Obama picked up Biden on a whistle-stop train tour in 2009, en route to the inauguration in Washington.\n\nIt was as vice president alongside Obama when Biden and his oversized personality first found widespread fame outside of the world of politics.\n\nPart of Biden's charm is his Everyman demeanor and not just because of his glad-handing or gift of gab.\n\nIt is also for decisions like having the U.S. Secret Service hang back when he made his rounds at hometown spots like a Capriotti’s sandwich shop, Happy Harry’s pharmacy, Brew HaHa! coffeehouse or University of Delaware football games as vice president, so as not to make them an “embarrassing” event.\n\nBiden (finally) wins the White House\n\nWhen Biden lifted his right hand for the oath of office and said, \"I do solemnly swear,\" he was also marking his sixth decade in politics.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person ever to be sworn in and arguably the most prepared, given his experience.\n\nAfter eight years as Obama’s No. 2 and “the last guy in the room” for every major decision Obama made, he finally shook Obama's long shadow when he became the man to beat Trump.\n\nIt started with him beating out nearly 30 fellow Democratic candidates in the primary, the largest field in decades, after jumping into the race late, declaring in March 2019. In the end, Biden became the presumptive nominee when Sen. Bernie Sanders, the last candidate in the race, suspended his campaign in April 2020.\n\nThe key to Biden's win came in South Carolina where he won nearly 50% of the vote, buoyed by the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn. Even though Biden had won the Iowa caucus, his South Carolina win came after Sanders won both New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nBy June, Biden passed the threshold of 1,991 delegates to win his party's nomination and made Delaware history as the first Delawarean to be nominated for president.\n\nIn the general election, Biden never trailed Trump, breaking open a double-digit lead nationally down the stretch after Trump's heckling performance in the first debate.\n\nWhile the election was not called on election night due to tight races, Biden passed 270 electoral votes four days later, setting off celebrations nationwide and across Delaware. Backyard fireworks were blasting in the city at the same time as fireworks and a drone-assisted light show lit up the Riverfront as Biden, Harris and their families basked in victory.\n\nBiden's busy term\n\nWhen Biden was sworn in at the U.S. Capitol, it was 14 days after the Jan. 6 insurrection when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the seat of the nation's legislative branch, assaulted police officers and caused lawmakers to flee. While the attack delayed the joint session of Congress to officially certify the election, legislators reconvened that night to finish the job.\n\nBiden's time in office began with a flurry of executive orders, many of which reversed Trump-era orders with the United States rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization.\n\nHe marked the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 by signing his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, the economic stimulus relief package that included direct payments to Americans, as well as an extension of increased unemployment benefits.\n\nFive months later, the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill became law with his signature, and in August 2022, the $750 billion Inflation Reduction Act did the same – a smaller version of Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act.\n\nEarly in his term, Biden's popularity hit a high of nearly 55%, but the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 hastened his already-slow decline in popularity. Televised scenes showed Afghans running alongside American planes transporting some of the more than 120,000 Americans and Afghans from the Kabul airport to safety as the country quickly fell into Taliban hands.\n\nA suicide bombing at the airport during the \"messy\" withdrawal, as Biden himself called it, killed 13 American service members and about 170 Afghans, sparking criticism from nearly all quarters.\n\nThat's when his approval numbers went underwater, hitting a low of 57% disapproval by July 2022 as the country struggled with high inflation and fuel prices as global supply chain problems due to the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine both hindered U.S. economic recovery.\n\nAmong the highlights of his first term so far was uniting NATO and other nations against Russia's war, the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson following Stephen Breyer's retirement and the successful targeting and killing of Al-Qaida leader and Sept. 11 attack planner Ayman al-Zawahir and ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi in separate strikes.\n\nControversies, dissent\n\nThe final year of Biden's term has been rife with growing dissent across the country, with protests surging in reaction to the president's responses – and nonresponses – to wars overseas.\n\nMany have criticized his support of Israel in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, sparking a wave of protests at college campuses across the country in the spring. Biden announced a cease-fire proposal supported by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June, calling for a truce between Israel and Hamas after nine months of fighting.\n\nThe conflict in Palestine was not the only war to characterize Biden's presidency. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the president and his administration have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, approving billions of dollars in aid. The continued support has drawn criticism from some, who argue that the U.S. should not be investing as much in an outside war.\n\nCritical attention has also come to Biden and his family closer to their home in Delaware, as the president's son Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president tried for a crime. A jury of Delawareans determined on June 11 that Hunter Biden committed three felonies when he purchased a gun while actively using drugs. He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n\nWhile the president himself was not involved in the crimes or the trial, many of those opposed to him linked the guilty verdict to him and his administration. Biden said he supported his son in his recovery, but said following the verdict that he would not pardon or commute any sentence given to Hunter Biden.\n\nThroughout his time in the White House, Biden has never been far from home after famously riding Amtrak home from Washington nightly as a U.S. senator. He often vacations at his Henlopen Acres summer house near Rehoboth Beach and comes home often to Greenville where he has been seen taking in a grandchild's game at Sanford School, grabbing a cup of coffee at Brew HaHa! or attending church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine. And whether in Greenville or at the beaches, the Bidens are often seen enjoying their favorite restaurants.\n\nThe temporary traffic backups caused by his motorcade during home state visits have earned a shorthand nickname from many Delawareans, \"Joe jams.\"\n\nHeartbreak in '72\n\nBiden's adult life has been book-ended by family tragedy, starting with the unthinkable in 1972 when his wife of six years, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash that also injured sons Hunter and Beau.\n\nThe accident came a little more than a month after Biden, then 29, scored a major upset against Republican incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs, a statewide officeholder for 26 years. Biden had become the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history.\n\nIt was Dec. 18, 1972 – seven days before Christmas – when the family’s Chevrolet station wagon collided with a tractor-trailer loaded with corncobs at Limestone and Valley roads in Hockessin, not far from where the Hockessin Athletic Club now stands.\n\nHeartbreaking photos by News Journal photographer Fred Comegys from the accident scene showed the devastation.\n\nBiden was interviewing possible staffers in Washington when the crash occurred. Neilia was supposed to join him in the nation’s capital the next day to finalize the purchase of a home there. He immediately flew home on a rented plane and went straight to the hospital.\n\nShe was 30. Biden had celebrated his own 30th birthday a month prior.\n\nWith his sons hospitalized, Biden wasn’t expected at the memorial service for Neilia and little Naomi. But he attended, staring down unspeakable grief as he stood beside the colorful stained-glass windows of St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church on Concord Pike in Talleyville.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 650, he spoke candidly about his “two girls.”\n\nOnly 18 days after the accident, Biden became a U.S. senator.\n\nInstead of the hallowed halls of the U.S. Capitol, Biden placed his left hand on a Bible held by Neilia’s father, Robert Hunter, and raised his right in the chapel of Wilmington Hospital, then called Delaware Division.\n\nIt was after that devastation that Biden decided to remain home in Wilmington and commute daily to Washington on Amtrak, which he continued to do until he joined Obama in D.C. in 2009. That’s when he moved into the official vice-presidential residence at Number One Observatory Circle, still visiting his home state regularly as vice president.\n\nIn his 2008 book, “Promises to Keep,” he detailed the harrowing time, saying he could understand how deep despair could lead some to “just cash it in” and how “suicide wasn’t just an option, but a rational option.”\n\nHe remarried in 1977 to Jill Jacobs, and the couple had one child, Ashley, in 1981.\n\nAnother familial heartbreak\n\nForty-two years after the death of Neilia and Naomi, Delaware would once again grieve alongside Biden when Beau, then 46, succumbed to an aggressive brain tumor.\n\nThe May 2015 death of the Delaware Army National Guard major and former state attorney general who had announced he was going to run to be Delaware’s 74th governor dealt Biden another tragedy to overcome with the world watching.\n\nBiden himself had a pair of cranial aneurysms in 1988, the first of which was near-fatal. He underwent a pair of surgeries that year to repair the damage.\n\nBeau was 46 when he died. And when Biden's win made him the 46th president, noting the coincidence was unavoidable.\n\nBiden rises in the Senate, joins Obama\n\nIn the years between his twin family tragedies, Biden rose to become one of the most influential senators on Capitol Hill, chairing a pair of powerful committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (2001–2003 and 2007–2009) and the Senate Judiciary Committee (1987–1995).\n\nDuring that time, he pushed for NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in the mid-1990s, which was marked by ethnic cleansing and genocide. The intervention led to a 1995 peace agreement and the prosecution of war crimes.\n\nIn 1994, he also pushed the passage of both the largest crime bill in U.S. history and the $1.6 billion Violence Against Women Act, which he had drafted. In 1997, he helped negotiate a chemical weapons ban.\n\nThose years left Biden on a first-name basis with every American politician of note, along with nearly every world leader, eventually placing the self-described “workhorse, not a show horse” in prime position to be picked by the much more inexperienced Obama.\n\nHe was a foreign policy wonk.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2008, Biden was announced officially as Obama’s running mate as national media camped outside his Greenville home on Barley Mill Road. It was a momentous moment of redemption for the two-time presidential election loser, but also a gleaming moment of pride for Delaware with both state Democrats and Republicans cheering his pick.\n\nBiden’s years of watching Washington from the inside, combined with his blue-collar appeal and sturdy campaign skills, helped Obama make history with Biden’s \"white hair waving like a flag of experience,\" The News Journal wrote at the time.\n\nThe workhorse was in full stride during the campaign against Sen. John McCain and Alaskan Gov. Sarah Palin in the 74 days between his selection and Election Day.\n\nHe led about 90 rallies and fundraisers as he crisscrossed the country stumping everywhere from ice cream stands and burger joints to college gymnasiums and retirement villages, visiting more than 20 states and doing more than 200 media interviews.\n\nDuring his time representing the First State, he never faced a serious threat of being voted out. Not in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002 or 2008. He garnered between 58% to 63% of the vote in each reelection race, a testament to his durable statewide support.\n\nAs Biden campaigned with Obama in 2008, Carol E. Hoffecker, a Delaware historian and author of “Democracy in Delaware,” placed Biden’s position in state history thusly: “No one else except Caesar Rodney, who was there at the founding of the nation, is historically more significant than Joe Biden.”\n\nWith his election as president of the United States, Biden's place atop Delaware history was unofficially enshrined.\n\nVice President Biden as 'last one in the room'\n\nAfter the pair defeated McCain and Palin on Nov. 5, 2008, Obama’s East Coast whistle-stop tour in a 1930 Pullman car en route to the inauguration in Washington pulled into Wilmington Train Station. Two years later, it would be renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station.\n\nThousands swarmed the train on that 19-degree day to send off the state’s most favored son, along with the president-elect.\n\nBiden repeated his well-known line, “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,” to the cheering crowd.\n\nThree days later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens was swearing in Biden as 1.8 million people, the largest inauguration crowd in American history, looked on in freezing temperatures.\n\nBiden reveled in his active role in the administration. He oversaw the 2009 economic stimulus and the draw-down of troops in Iraq in 2010 while also negotiating down-to-the-wire fiscal agreements.\n\nSome historians rank Biden among the most active American vice presidents. In 2012, The Atlantic magazine published a story headlined: \"Joe Biden: The Most Influential Vice President in History?\"\n\nBiden’s policy choices have subjected him to criticism. In particular, some hawkish foreign policy leaders criticized what they saw as Biden’s lack of faith in the military. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote Biden had been wrong about “nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”\n\nBiden argued against the now-legendary raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He opposed the military’s call for a surge of new troops in Iraq in 2007, as well as a similar surge in Afghanistan in 2012.\n\nIn Biden’s final days as vice president, Obama shocked the 36-year public servant in the White House’s State Dining Room with the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\"For your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I'd like to ask the military aide to join us on stage,\" Obama said, revealing the surprise honor.\n\nWith swollen eyes, Biden accepted, turning his back to the crowd to regain his composure while wiping away tears: “I don't deserve this, but I know it came from the president's heart.”\n\nA month prior, Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate paid tribute to him on the Senate floor as an emotional Biden looked on from the presiding officer's chair. The tributes were scheduled to last an hour, but it went on for more than two.\n\n\"There's a reason 'Get Joe on the phone' is shorthand for 'time to get serious' in my office,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said.\n\nBiden's stumbles\n\nFor all his accomplishments and honors, Biden has not been without faults and missteps.\n\nHis failed 1988 presidential campaign was torpedoed by plagiarism accusations after he failed to credit a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock at an August Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair. (He had cited Kinnock in previous speeches.)\n\nThree years later, when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, he presided over Anita Hill’s testimony detailing her accusations of sexual harassment against the judge.\n\nCritics, especially in later years and even more so in the wake of the #MeToo movement, blamed him for the accusatory and suspicious tone of Hill’s questioning by the panel of 14 male senators. Biden has since said he owed Hill an apology, adding that he believed her.\n\nNearly 30 years later, Hill would support Biden's candidacy against Trump \"notwithstanding all of his limitations in the past, and the mistakes that he made in the past.\"\n\nThat same famously loose mouth, which political opponents used to paint him as a buffoon, also could be used to his advantage.\n\nLike in 2007, at a Democratic debate, when he said Republican presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani only mentions three things in a sentence: “a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"\n\nLike in 1988, he lost the 2008 presidential primary as well. It was won by his future boss, Obama.\n\nAfter 2½ months of campaigning in Iowa to meet a presumably attainable goal of a third or fourth-place finish against a field of six, he was trounced.\n\nBiden finished fifth with less than 1% of the vote behind Obama, former vice presidential candidate John Edwards, Clinton and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.\n\nIt was a devastating blow, and it was written on the faces of his family who stood behind him teary-eyed as he announced the end of his campaign that night.\n\nSeveral months later, at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver after Obama selected him as running mate, he said, \"Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.\"\n\nFrom Scranton to Claymont\n\nBiden was born in 1942 in the industrial Scranton, the first of four children for Jean and Joe Biden, a car dealership manager. Biden was 11 when the family moved 135 miles south to Claymont, another blue-collar town just over the state line.\n\nAfter living in an apartment in the Brookview neighborhood off Philadelphia Pike, the family moved to a spilt-level home in Brandywine Hundred. It was there that he overcame the stutter that earned him the callous nickname of “Joe Impedimenta,” as he wrote in “Promises to Keep.”\n\n“I was going to beat the stutter. And I went at it the only way I knew how: I worked like hell. Practice, practice, practice. I would memorize long passages of Yeats and Emerson, then stand in front of the mirror in my room on Wilson Road and talk, talk, talk,” wrote Biden, whose encouraging father called him “Champ.”\n\nAfter graduating from Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden became a true Blue Hen, earning a bachelor’s degree at the University of Delaware, double majoring in history and political science.\n\nAfter meeting Neilia while on spring break in the Bahamas in 1964, the two began dating. She attended Syracuse University and that is where he would go to get his law degree, graduating in 1968, two years after they married in upstate New York.\n\nThe Bidens returned to Delaware, where he worked as a law clerk and public defender before starting his own firm, originally called Biden and Walsh.\n\nBiden the underdog\n\nBut law was not for the 6-foot former UD football halfback.\n\nBy 1969, he was running as a Democrat for a seat on New Castle County Council, winning the seat in a Republican-leaning district. He served for two years before taking on Boggs and the political machine the incumbent had built up over the years as a U.S. representative and two-term Delaware governor.\n\nThe underdog campaign lacked the funds and experience to win, most thought. Managed by Biden’s sister, Valerie, who would later manage more campaigns and grow into a political confidant, he overcame poor early polls and upended Boggs by 3,000 votes.\n\nA month later, the station wagon holding his family was struck and his Senate career officially began in that Wilmington hospital chapel cramped with media with Senate Secretary Frank Valeo traveling to Delaware from Washington for the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nPale, but smiling, he became the first U.S. senator in decades to take the oath of office away from the Senate chamber. But he made clear that his surviving family was his priority – a priority that led him to forgo a presidential run in 2016.\n\n“I make this one promise,” he said to the media after the sterile swearing-in. “If in six months or so, there’s a conflict between me being a good father and a good senator … I promise you I will contact [the governor] … and tell him to get another senator.\n\n“[The boys] can’t get another father.”\n\nIn the end, he pushed onward, using the advice his own father regularly gave him as a child: “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up.”\n\nBiden captured and recaptured the soul of Delaware every time he got back up, especially when he did it five years after Beau's death to finally win the presidency.\n\nThis story includes information and reports from The News Journal archives.

The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law in August 2022 capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month for all seniors on Medicare, according to the White House. Several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, followed suit and limited the monthly cost of the drug to $35 per month as well. But there is no evidence Biden limited the cost of insulin beyond this.\n\nThe price of insulin was also never set at $400, though many paid about this much. The price a person pays for insulin depends on a variety of factors, including what type of insulin they are using, insurance status and whether they're eligible for a rebate from the drugmaker, according to NBC News. While estimates vary, one government study published in December 2022 reported that in 2019, the average insulin user with private insurance spent $456 on insulin annually, while those with Medicare spent $449 a year and those without health insurance paid $996, comparatively.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: He is endorsed by Border Patrol agents\n\n“The border patrolmen endorsed me, endorsed my position.”\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council – the labor union that represents more than 18,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents – posted to X, formerly Twitter, minutes after Biden made the claim and said, “To be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.”\n\nBut the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive\n\n“I've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.”\n\nBiden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week.\n\nIn remarks posted on June 26, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action.\n\nHowever, immigration experts have cautioned that it’s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim.\n\nImmigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned\n\n“I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.”\n\nThis is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a “bad thing.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: Historians voted Trump ‘worst’ president in history\n\n“(Trump) was the worst in all of American history. … He can argue (the historians) are wrong, but that’s what they voted.”\n\nBiden was presumably referring to the 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey, which is a joint project from University of Houston professor Brandon Rottinghaus and Coastal Carolina University professor Justin Vaughn.\n\nThe survey respondents in late 2023 voted Trump the lowest in “overall presidential greatness,” behind James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln was rated highest. Joe Biden ranked at No. 14.\n\nRespondents included scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in related scholarly journals or academic presses and current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, which the survey described as “the foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics.”\n\nOut of 525 respondents invited to participate, the survey received 154 usable responses, yielding a 29% response rate.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: I brought in National Guard during 2020 Minnesota unrest\n\n“If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city (Minneapolis) would have been destroyed.”\n\nIt was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who activated the state’s National Guard to respond to unrest following the death of George Floyd, according to a press release issued by Walz’s office on May 28, 2020.\n\nWalz said at the time that he was responding to “local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.”\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale also looked into the claim back in 2020, detailing the timeline of events provided to the network by Walz’s press secretary, Teddy Tschann. In a statement to CNN, Tschann said Walz activated the National Guard at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before the governor spoke with the White House.\n\n“Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No,” Tschann said in the statement, according to CNN.\n\nOn May 30, 2020, the Minnesota National Guard posted on Twitter, now X, that Walz had “announced the full mobilization” of the Guard for the first time since World War II.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nBiden claim: Trump praised Hitler, saying he did 'some good things'\n\n\"This is a guy who says Hitler has done some good things\"\n\nBiden's quote of Trump is a reference to comments the former president allegedly made while talking with his White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, in 2018 during a trip to Paris, according to excerpts from an upcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\n“Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly told Kelly, according to a CNN report.\n\nTrump later denied that he made the comments and denied that the conversation took place. Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson, told CNN the claim is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"President Trump never said this,\" Harrington said. \"It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\nTrump has previously faced criticism for saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and describing his political opponents as \"vermin,\" reminding many of language used by authoritarian leaders.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: Record ‘approval rating’ from VA\n\n“I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.”\n\nThis is both false and a mischaracterization of what the quarterly customer experience surveys from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs measure.\n\nThe Veteran Signals surveys track the proportion of servicemembers who express having trust in the VA. It's not a presidential approval rating.\n\nIt has topped 80% twice: It was at 80% in 2020 during Trump’s administration, and it reached a high of 80.4% in May under Biden.\n\nTrump made a similar version of the claim during a May rally in Wisconsin, according to a report from Wisconsin Watch.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: More illicit drugs coming into US under Biden\n\n“The number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far.”\n\nThis is false. When measured by weight, drug seizures are trending down.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations seized nearly 549,000 pounds of illicit drugs in 2023, according to federal data. That’s down 16% from 2022, when 656,000 pounds of substances were confiscated. More than 900,000 pounds were seized in 2021, according to federal data.\n\nMost of the drugs involved were marijuana (150,000 pounds) and methamphetamine (140,000 pounds).\n\nFentanyl seizures were up, however, with the 27,000 pounds in 2023 accounting for nearly twice the 14,700 pounds confiscated in 2022.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Biden indicted me because I’m his political opponent\n\n“He [Biden] indicted me because I'm his opponent.”\n\nThis is false. Trump was indicted and convicted in New York for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But there is no evidence Biden or his administration had anything to do with these charges. Since the charges were brought by the state of New York, Biden and the federal government are not party to the indictment and have no say in the charges, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“When you’re dealing with state prosecutions, it’s district attorneys elected by the voters of their jurisdiction,” said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. “That has nothing to do with the federal government.”\n\nThe idea of Biden interfering in Trump's prosecution is further weakened by the fact that the agency under his purview declined to file charges. The Justice Department had the authority to pursue a case against Trump over the hush money circumstances but chose not to do so.\n\nIn Trump's two federal cases, things are a bit different. The charges he faces cover the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents in Florida and a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from Biden in Washington.\n\nThere is no law that prohibits a president from involving himself in a federal case, experts acknowledged. But they also said Biden has kept himself separate from the prosecution of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Biden publicly vowed not to speak to Attorney General Merrick Garland about any specific case. And a key reason for the November 2022 appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel for the federal cases against Trump was to add a layer of separation between the investigation and the Biden Administration.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Food prices have 'doubled and tripled and quadrupled' under Biden\n\n\"You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.\"\n\nThe cost of food has gone up under Biden, but not to the extent Trump claimed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's all-food consumer price index shows food prices rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer behavior and led to supply chain disruptions, driving large increases in some foods. In 2022, food costs increased faster than any year since 1979, \"partly due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that affected egg and poultry prices,\" according to the department's report.\n\nBut grocery prices have stabilized over the last year, increasing by just 1.2% in the past 12 months, according to the Consumer Price Index report from March 2024.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: No sex with porn star\n\n“I didn’t have sex with a porn star.”\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nOn May 30, a New York state jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels testified at trial that she had sex with Trump in July 2006 following a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTrump has denied the sex happened.\n\nThe trial focused on a $130,000 payment that was arranged by Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Biden called African Americans ‘super predators’\n\n\"He did a crime bill. 1994. Where you called them super predators. African Americans. Super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\"\n\nWhile Biden once warned of “predators” in 1993 while advocating for a 1994 crime bill he sponsored as a senator, he never referred to African Americans as “super predators.” Rather, it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton who linked that term to the 1994 crime bill, as USA TODAY previously reported\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband in 1996, Clinton praised the 1994 crime bill for curbing gangs, saying, \"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\"\n\nNotably, she did not connect this comment to Black people.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Unprecedented numbers of murders by immigrants under Biden\n\n“People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\nWhile Trump has made a version of this claim before, there is no data that points to a wave of homicides being led by people living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA review of 2024 crime data by NBC News suggests the opposite might be true. Overall crime levels have fallen in cities where a Texas program has transported migrants from the border, the network reported in February.\n\nCrime is down year over year in Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles, according to the report. Washington experienced an increase, but officials do not attribute that spike to migrants, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump previously made a version of the claim during a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nResearch suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Corporate tax cut from 39% to 21%\n\n“The corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that.”\n\nTrump was off with one of his numbers.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower the corporate tax rate to 21%. But it started at 35%, not the 39% that Trump claimed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Trump meant with his reference to “plus beyond that.” He promised business leaders that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, The New York Times reported June 13.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Trump told Americans to inject bleach to treat COVID-19\n\n\"He said it’s not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm, you’ll be all right.\"\n\nBiden is referring to comments Trump made during a press conference early in the pandemic when he suggested disinfectants might be a possible treatment for COVID-19. But he overstates what Trump said.\n\nTrump's statement came after Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed a new study that found sunlight and household disinfectants effectively killed the virus on surfaces or in the air.\n\n\"And then I saw the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, though, never directly instructed people to inject bleach or any other disinfectant. Some states issued warnings following Trump's comment, as did Lysol, which told people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nBiden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office.\n\nBut the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier.\n\nBiden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Hunter Biden's ongoing legal troubles sure to hang over campaign\n\nIn early June, a jury found Hunter Biden – Joe Biden's son – guilty of three federal gun charges, making him the first child of a sitting president to be convicted at trial. The situation has been politically charged as it coincides with the elder Biden's ongoing campaign for reelection.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, repeatedly alleging that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nJoe Biden, who earlier said he wouldn't pardon his son, released a statement shortly after the jury's verdict was announced reiterating that position.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” he said. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nHunter Biden is expected to stand trial again in September in California, where he faces tax charges.\n\nBut even before his legal troubles, the president's son has been a frequent target for misinformation. Here are some of the claims we've already debunked:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Vast differences between Biden, Trump on gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues\n\nWith Pride Month winding down, LGBTQ+ issues – specifically, those related to gender identity – remain pivotal for voters in both parties.\n\nThe candidates have taken widely different positions on those issues, with President Joe Biden – hailed as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history – marking his first day in office with an executive order on LGBTQ rights.\n\nHis administration is challenging Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. He also unveiled in April a set of sweeping changes to Title IX rules that protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on their gender identity, but a federal judge blocked their enforcement in four states.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump vowed in May to roll back transgender student protections “on Day 1” of his presidency by reversing an executive order issued by Biden in 2021. Trump also vowed in February 2023 to punish medical professionals and facilities that provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors and said he would support banning transgender women from women’s sports.\n\nHere are some of the false claims related to LGBTQ+ issues that we’ve debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Israel’s war against Hamas sparks unrest in US as peace deal remains elusive\n\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response, plunged President Joe Biden into the second major international conflict of his term. He has been forced to balance America’s military support for Israel with calls from the left to broker a ceasefire deal as casualties mount in the Palestinian territory.\n\nBiden said in May that it is “time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,” laying out a proposal that called for Israel to cease military operations in the Gaza Strip and Hamas to release hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut a peace deal has proved elusive, leading to unrest on college campuses across the country after pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up protest camps. Former President Donald Trump cheered police crackdowns on demonstrators, calling them “a beautiful thing to watch.” But he’s also called on Israel to finish its war, saying the violence is hurting its standing among the international community.\n\n“Israel has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done,” Trump told Israeli outlet Israel Hayom in an interview posted in March. \"And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for Israel, and for everybody else.”\n\nThese are some claims related to the Israel-Hamas war that we’ve already addressed:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts spotlight on US involvement in foreign wars\n\nRussia’s war against Ukraine entered its third year in February, and the conflict has had political implications in the U.S., where pushes to approve war aid for Ukraine have been met with contentious debate over the extent of American involvement in foreign wars, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has remained committed to supporting Ukraine and its effort to join NATO, signing a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 13.\n\n“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” Biden said at a press conference about the agreement. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime … in the future.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the Oval Office, but he’s offered few details about his plan. The Washington Post reported Trump’s plan could include pressuring Ukraine to give up territory, which Ukraine has opposed.\n\nHere are some fact-checks about claims related to the war in Ukraine:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Fight over immigration reform plays out during presidential campaign\n\nImmigration has become one of the most heated topics of the 2024 election, as President Joe Biden grapples with high levels of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and former President Donald Trump vows to deport millions of migrants if re-elected.\n\nThe situation at the Southwest border – where U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.5 million migrant encounters in fiscal 2023 – prompted Biden to take executive action earlier this month to implement new restrictions on asylum access.\n\nThe action came after Republican lawmakers in February blocked an immigration bill blocked by Biden that would have revamped the country’s immigration and border policies.\n\nBiden blamed the legislation’s failure to gain traction in Congress on opposition from Trump.\n\n“Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor,” Biden said at the time. “Why? A simple reason. Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to reinstate policies from his first term in office and limit asylum access if elected in November. He also wants to institute a merit-based immigration system and deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement “to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals,” according to his campaign website.\n\nHere are some immigration-related claims we previously debunked:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Biden and Trump face age-related concerns, though both insist they're fit to serve\n\nAt 81 years old, Joe Biden is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. His age has been a concern for voters and a frequent target for critics, including Donald Trump, who often suggests Biden's age makes him unfit to be president.\n\nTrump is 78 years old, three years younger than Biden, but he has also faced criticism related to his age and mental acuity, including when he confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama in multiple campaign speeches.\n\nEither man would be the oldest person to take the oath of office if sworn in next January.\n\nIn February, Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur released a report indicating Biden wouldn't face charges for his handling of classified documents that included multiple comments about Biden's age and memory, describing him as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities,\" including memory loss. However, Biden and his administration pushed back, with Biden saying his \"memory is fine\" during a televised speech.\n\nWhile Trump's doctor said multiple times he was healthy during his presidency, there were – and still are – reports of him slurring words during his speeches. Late in his term, Trump was recorded slowly descending a ramp after a speech at at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, during which he used both hands to drink a glass of water. Trump dismissed concerns raised about his age after that incident, claiming the ramp was long, steep and \"very slippery.\"\n\nHere are a few of the age-related claims we've already addressed:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Election integrity remains key issue – even without evidence of widespread voter fraud\n\nThroughout the campaign one question has persisted: Will the candidates and their supporters trust – and abide by – the results of the election?\n\nMost recently, former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure “transparency and fairness.” The move has drawn criticism from opponents who say it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nState-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nClaims questioning the integrity of the election frequently center around a handful of predictable themes that include assertions of widespread voter fraud and election “hacking.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Trump’s conviction, pending trials loom over debate, election\n\nThe first former U.S. president convicted of a felony will take the debate stage as an ex-president for the first time in an attempt to convince voters to give him his old job back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s felony conviction and his three pending criminal trials continue to loom large over both the race and the debate – his first of the presidential election cycle – with President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election. Days before the debate, the judge in that case lifted the gag order restrictions that protected the witnesses and jurors. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 – days before the start of the Republican National Convention, during which he is expected to formally receive the party’s nomination.\n\nTrump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nTrump’s legal problems have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Biden’s support for the swap overrides opposition from the Department of Justice, which is generally against prisoner trades.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that “so far, there is no agreement on this issue.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday that the US presented a “substantial proposal” to Moscow “weeks ago” for Whelan and Griner, who are classified as wrongfully detained.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the State Department, Blinken said Biden was “directly involved” and signed off on the proposal. Although Blinken did not directly confirm Bout was part of the deal, saying he “can’t and won’t get into any of the details of what we proposed to the Russians over the course of so many weeks now,” he said “in terms of the President, of course he was not only directly involved, he signs off on any proposal that we make, and certainly when it comes to Americans who are being arbitrarily detained abroad, including in this specific case.”\n\nThe top US diplomat said he intended to discuss the matter on an expected call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov this week – his first conversation with his counterpart since the war in Ukraine began – telling reporters, “my hope would be that in speaking to Foreign Minister Lavrov, I can advance the efforts to bring them home.”\n\n“There is in my mind utility in conveying clear, direct messages to the Russians on key priorities for us. And as I mentioned, these include securing the return home of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan,” he said.\n\nA senior administration official suggested Moscow has not been responsive to the “substantial offer” first presented in June, telling CNN “it takes two to tango.”\n\n“We start all negotiations to bring home Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained with a bad actor on the other side. We start all of these with somebody who has taken a human being American and treated them as a bargaining chip,” the official said. “So in some ways, it’s not surprising, even if it’s disheartening, when those same actors don’t necessarily respond directly to our offers, don’t engage constructively in negotiations.”\n\nAdministration continues to communicate offer\n\nThe official declined to comment on the specifics of the “substantial offer.” They said it was in Russia’s “court to be responsive to it, yet at the same time that does not leave us passive, as we continue to communicate the offer at very senior levels.”\n\nThe families of Whelan, who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018, and WNBA star Griner, jailed in Moscow for drug possession since February, have urged the White House to secure their release, including via a prisoner exchange if necessary.\n\nNational Security Council Strategic Coordinator for Communications John Kirby said Wednesday that a senior administration official spoke with the families prior to Blinken’s announcement about the “substantial proposal.” Biden recently spoke by phone with Griner’s wife, Cherelle, and Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth.\n\nGriner, who pleaded guilty in early July but said she unintentionally brought cannabis into Russia, testified in a Russian courtroom Wednesday as part of her ongoing trial on drug charges, for which she faces up to 10 years in prison. It is understood that her trial will have to conclude prior to a deal being finalized, according to US officials familiar with the Russian judicial process and the inner workings of US-Russia negotiations.\n\nDuring months of internal discussions between US agencies, the Justice Department opposed trading Bout, people briefed on the matter say. However, Justice officials eventually accepted that a Bout trade has the support of top officials at the State Department and White House, including Biden himself, sources say.\n\nThe Russian government has frequently floated Bout as the subject of a potential trade for a number of Americans.\n\nAsked at the Aspen Security Forum last week why Moscow is so interested in getting Bout back, CIA Director Bill Burns replied, “That’s a good question because Viktor Bout’s a creep.”\n\n“The Russians over the years have certainly expressed an interest in in you know, Victor Bout’s return but those are, as I learned in my old life, very complicated issues in terms of trying to sort through,” he said, referencing his long tenure as a diplomat.\n\nFormer Soviet military officer and arms trafficking suspect Viktor Bout arrives at Westchester County Airport in 2010. US Department of Justice/Getty Images\n\nThe US government has long resisted prisoner swaps, claiming concerns that they only incentivize countries to detain Americans so they can be used as bargaining chips. Advocates have questioned these concerns and have argued that it is more important that Americans are able to come home.\n\nAmong senior Biden administration officials, the idea of prisoner swaps gained new momentum earlier this year after the successful release of Trevor Reed, a former Marine who was held captive in Russia for more than two years. Reed was traded for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot then serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for cocaine smuggling conspiracy.\n\nBiden officials had been concerned the decision to swap Reed for Yaroshenko would be criticized by Republicans. Instead, it won bipartisan praise, including from a handful of Republicans who are normally sharp critics of the administration. That reception, sources say, led the administration to reexamine all options – including potential swaps – to get Whelan and Griner out of Russia.\n\n“Whatever the kind of moral indignity of them holding innocent people and trying to extract from us someone like a Mr. Yaroshenko, who is the opposite of that, we nonetheless are so committed to bring our people home that we will make those painful choices in certain circumstances,” the senior administration official told CNN.\n\nSecuring their release would also give the White House a much-needed political win ahead of the midterm elections in November, a point that some officials quietly acknowledged when speaking privately to CNN. There is also a sense of urgency to bring the two detainees home as the White House faces growing public scrutiny from the families of Americans unlawfully detained abroad.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comment.", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood Evan Perez Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Evan Perez", "Jennifer Hansler"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}]}

A viewing guide for this year's sky show.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nA total eclipse occurs when the moon appears the same size as the sun and blocks the entire disk, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. The resulting \"totality,\" when observers can see the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona.\n\nThe day before the eclipse, the moon will come closest to Earth this month. On eclipse day, that means the moon is only 223,000 miles away. That proximity will make the moon appear larger in the sky, resulting in an exceptionally extended duration of sun-blocked darkness.

It will then touch southeast Canada before moving out to sea, according to NASA.\n\nThe eclipse's path will cross 13 states from Texas to Maine, and experts say the southern end of the path has the best chances for good viewing.\n\nThose who don't live on the path or can't travel to a place that is, might be wondering when their next chance to see a total solar eclipse will come. Here's what we know.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse visible from the U.S.?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again.\n\nAccording to NASA, after the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, the next total solar eclipse that can be seen from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\n2044 total solar eclipse path of totality\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse.\n\nThe Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy, says that during the 2044 eclipse, the path of totality will only touch three states.\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nIn the event of a solar eclipse, the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching a small part of our planet. Partial eclipses, when some part of the sun remains visible, are the most common, making total eclipses a rare sight to behold.\n\nTotal eclipses can lead to a period of darkness lasting for several minutes, during which time nocturnal animals stir while confused birds and insects may fall silent, NASA says.\n\nWhen a solar eclipse reaches totality, people are able to see the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, which is usually obscured by the sun's bright surface. This offers scientists an uncommon opportunity to study the corona.\n\nTotality also offers spectators a chance to gaze upon the spectacular sight with the naked eye, though proper safety glasses are still required for the rest of the time.\n\nWhat states are on the 2024 eclipse path of totality?\n\nMexico's pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. The path will cut diagonally across the country, traveling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nIn the United States, the eclipse's path will end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nSee interactive maps of the 2024 path.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Ramon Padilla & Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/08/total-solar-eclipse-2024-forecast-updates/72869293007/", "title": "Total solar eclipse 2024: Watch video and see photos of the sky ...", "text": "EAGLE PASS, Texas − In a moment of cosmic alignment that was precisely predicted yet undeniably mysterious, the moon crept across the face of the sun as seen from Earth, casting its shadow onto the United States on Monday.\n\nAnd then it was over: A total eclipse of the sun has come and gone.\n\nThe partial shadow crossed into the U.S. in Texas just after noon local time, and a bit more than an hour later, the minutes of “totality” began. The total eclipse of the sun then traced a path from southern Texas to northern Maine, where it exited into Canada and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe rare event was an astronomical experience like no other. Monday's eclipse was unusually accessible to millions of people. It was widely anticipated not only for its remarkable period of darkness, but for its rare timing: No total solar eclipse would be visible from the contiguous United States again until 2044. While millions of Americans may have seen today’s eclipse, a small group in Texas was among the very first.\n\nEdge of eclipse shadow began in south Texas\n\nAlejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from the south Texas border city of Eagle Pass, peered up at the gray, gauzy sky, anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse’s entrance into the USA.\n\nSitting with a telescope under a camping canopy in a corner of the county airport, Martinez, 42, and two other science enthusiasts had been recruited by NASA to participate in an effort called Citizen CATE 2024, where more than 30 teams perched in the eclipse’s path will record the shadowy trek across the country.\n\nIn this spot, less than five miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, she and her team would be among the first people in the U.S. to witness the phenomenon. Eagle Pass sits near the very beginning of the eclipse’s track from southwest to northeast across the country. It also sits very near dead-center of it, where the period of “totality” will be the longest. That total shadow was still more than an hour away when the edge of the shadow began to darken the sky.\n\nMartinez, dressed in a “This Totality Rocks” T-shirt and eclipse-themed skirt, watched as the penumbra crept across the airfield, about 10 minutes past noon local time. She put on her eclipse glasses and peered up at the sky. The gauzy clouds parted. “There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nClouds came and went as the shadow grew for the next hour. As totality approached Eagle Pass, the sky shaded a dull gray then a heavy brown and the temperature dropped a few degrees. Only a sliver of the sun remained.\n\nA few seconds before 1:27 p.m. CT, the crowd counted down, “3..2..1…” The sun was gone, completely covered by the moon. Darkness spread over the small airport grounds. “Oh my god,” Martinez said, a hand covering her heart. “This is so cool!”\n\nHow to tell if you have eye damage from looking at a partial eclipse?\n\nFor those who took a chance and looked at the sun without protective eyewear during the eclipse, concerns may arise if their vision starts to seem impaired. Have they suffered eclipse blindness?\n\nLooking directly at the sun even briefly without the proper safety glasses can result in eye damage, either temporary or permanent. The body's natural squinting reaction in normal circumstances prevents people from staring directly at the sun, but that reflex may not be activated during partial eclipses, even though a partly shielded sun can still burn the retina.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology says pain won't be an indication of damaged eyes because the retina lacks pain nerves. Worrisome signs are instead blurry vision, headaches, light sensitivity, blind spots in the central vision, distorted vision and changes in color perception. Anyone experiencing those symptoms should see an ophthalmologist, the AAO says.\n\nWhat was the timeline of the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse began in Mexico at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, Monday before crossing into Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. It ended in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT. Even those who weren't in the path of totality could see a percentage of the eclipse.\n\nTo find out exactly when the eclipse occurred in your area, you can search by USA TODAY's database by ZIP code for a viewing guide.\n\nStudents in Washington get hands-on learning\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Students at the school in northwest D.C. had had lessons about the eclipse leading up the day’s teaching outside the classroom.\n\n“Anytime we can get hands on or dynamic learning … it’s invaluable,’’ said Mangum, a social emotional learning coach. “We talked about it so much. It’s nice to see them get excited about qeeky Mr. Mango type of stuff.”\n\nSkylar Cruel, 12, had come outside with her science class. “I just really wanted to see it,’’ she said. “You get to see it turn from light to dark.”\n\nSteps away at Whittier Elementary School, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nMichael Haile joined his daughter, Markan Worku, 9, a student at Whittier, and brought along his 5-year-old son, Keab. He called it a memorable experience for his children. Markan, who had been learning about solar eclipses in her third-grade class, simply said, “This is cool!’’\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nIn Michigan, a bonding experience for a mother and her three kids\n\nIn Michigan, eclipse enthusiasts packed a watch party along the Detroit Riverwalk near Cullen Plaza. They sat on the grass, on benches and berms. For Janelle Ikonen of Waterford, it was a chance to bond with her three children − Hannah, 9; Elim, 12; and Isaac, 14 − whom she took out of school for the day.\n\n“I wanted to experience a unique event with them,” said Ikonen, 47. “It’s one of my big deals to me, to experience things with my kids. … I hope they’ll remember spending time with me.”\n\nIn Grand Rapids, where 94% coverage of the sun was expected, viewers gathered on the city's “Blue Bridge,” which offered a view of the eclipse over the Grand River. With no cloud cover over the city, visitors had an unobstructed scene. The Grand Rapids Public Museum set up a series of solar telescopes.\n\nJill and Wes Johnson, 50 and 14, were among those awaiting max coverage. They’d considered traveling from Grand Rapids to a place with total coverage, but decided 94% coverage was worthwhile enough to stay home.\n\n“I think people are excited to see something unique,” Jill Johnson said.\n\n− Georgea Kovanis and Arpan Lobo, Detroit Free Press\n\nUS women's soccer team takes in eclipse ahead of title game\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio − The U.S. women’s national soccer team took a break from SheBelieves Cup preparation to watch the eclipse.\n\nSeveral team members, including World Cup veterans Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma and Trinity Rodman, coaches and staff members donned eclipse glasses and went outside their hotel to see the rare event.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the moon moved in front of the sun, someone yelled, “Come on, keep going!” Columbus is just outside the path of totality, so all but a sliver of the sun wound up being covered.\n\nThe USWNT is in Columbus for the final of the SheBelieves Cup on Tuesday night against Canada.\n\n− Nancy Armour\n\nWitnessing the first total eclipse from a cruise ship\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise ship eagerly gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time to watch the spectacle of a solar eclipse.\n\nPositioned off the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico − the first city in North America to witness the total eclipse − the ship provided an ideal vantage point for viewing the celestial event. Accompanied by an astronomer, the captain meticulously adjusted the ship's position to ensure the best possible view.\n\nDan Fueller, an experienced eclipse observer who had previously seen similar phenomena from ships in 1991 and 1998, emphasized the advantages of viewing the eclipse from a cruise ship. He noted the flexibility of the ship's mobility allowed for optimal positioning along the eclipse's path, ensuring unobstructed views.\n\n\"You're on a cruise ship and (the best view) is a little bit farther to the west or a little bit farther to the east − along the path, there's a clear sky − the ship can move. If you're on land and there's not a road there, you better have a tank.\"\n\n− Joshuan Rivera\n\nPartial eclipse 'like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun'\n\nIn Parthenon, Arkansas, the eclipse began near the Buffalo National River. Five friends traveled from Florida to be on a rock outcropping to witness the celestial event.\n\n“Yes! I see it!” Angie Printiss exclaimed.\n\n“Oh ya! You can see it,” said Kate Estes. “It’s like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun.”\n\nAt 20 minutes before totality, the sky got noticeably darker. The shadow of crescent sun shapes played off the limestone rocks.\n\n“It looks like water − like fish scales,” Estes said. “That is so weird, when the trees move you can really see it.”\n\n− Jennifer Portman\n\nNew Englanders travel for better view of the eclipse\n\nCrowds ballooned into the thousands midday Monday in the center of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the nearly cloudless sky and warm sun boosted temperatures to an unseasonably 60 degrees.\n\nJim and Kim Cooper drove over from New Hampton, New Hampshire, their first time doing more than just passing through the town locals call St. Jays. Their son had proposed to his girlfriend in Tennessee during the 2017 eclipse and then had an eclipse-themed wedding, but the Coopers had never seen a total eclipse for themselves, so they decided to come to the closest place where they could be assured of a good view.\n\nJeffrey Breau had seen that 2017 eclipse for himself and was so impressed that he convinced family members to join him this time. Breau’s girlfriend, Nell Hawley, came up with him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, while his brother Alex and his girlfriend Diana Ventura drove up from New York City. The Breau brothers' father, Walter, joined them in taking in their first eclipse.\n\n“I would have been OK watching it in the yard,” Walter said, though he would only have seen a partial eclipse from there. “That’s what you think now,” Jeffrey said quickly. “Talk to me in two hours.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nKids bring homemade eclipse viewers to National Mall\n\nLucas and Lucy Porto Banco didn’t need to buy fancy eclipse glasses – the 7- and 10-year-old siblings made their own eclipse viewers from two cardboard shoe boxes left over from a couple of their mom’s recent shoe purchases.With the help of a YouTube tutorial video, they made two holes in each box with a whittling knife and taped tin foil over. Then they used dry spaghetti to poke holes in the tin foil for the sun’s light to pass through and project onto the dark inside of the box.The kids put together the viewer in little more than five minutes, Lucy said. “Maybe 15, with covering all the gaps in the shoe box,” she said.Even with his own eclipse-viewing creation, Lucas said he may still take advantage of his eclipse glasses. “I’m going to do both,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' − and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts used a bunch of specialized words Monday as the nation experienced its first solar eclipse since 2017 and the last one for until 2044. Here are a few of those terms and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBaily's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nPenumbra: The lighter part of the moon's shadow, making up its outer portion, where light can reach.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes, 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\n− Dale Denwalt, The Oklahoman\n\nA last-minute search for glasses for 'a perfect spot'\n\nPatsy Faoro walked toward a half dozen people gathered at the gate of Turner Farm Park in Great Falls, Virginia. The people were awaiting the opening of an eclipse viewing event complete with telescopes and educational presentations.\n\nFaoro, who lives near the park in this upscale Northern Virginia neighborhood, just wanted glasses to safely view the eclipse.\n\nShe visited CVS, Safeway and a 7/11 convenience store, all of which had advertised the availability of glasses to view the eclipse. None of the retailers had any glasses remaining when Faoro checked this morning.\n\n“We have this great big open space that’s a perfect spot,” said Faoro, who viewed her first eclipse in the 1970s. “We just need some glasses.”\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway event draws tens of thousands\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity. Patrick and her family traveled 160 miles to Indianapolis Motor Speedway from their home in Granger, Indiana. They were expected to have 97% totality at home, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“They will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said.\n\nPatrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39, from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event and on Sunday afternoon saw a double rainbow over the speedway’s iconic pagoda. An estimated 50,000 tickets were sold for the day’s festivities, presented in partnership with NASA and Purdue University.\n\nElsewhere in the stands, Ryan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nFamily travels from Baltimore to Rochester, N.Y., to view the eclipse\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed to witness the next notable solar eclipse.

And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 a.m. on Monday and drove nearly seven hours to Rochester, New York.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park, where he and hundreds of others are awaiting a view of the full eclipse. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\n– Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nIn Brooklyn: Eclipses glasses, check. Lawn chair, check.\n\nRalph Emerson held a pair of paper sunglasses in his hands while riding the subway to Brooklyn's sprawling Prospect Park on Monday. He exited the train with a folded lawn chair strapped across his shoulder, and said he felt energized and full of anticipation.\n\n\"This is special,\" Emerson, 61, said. \"I haven't woken up with this much excitement since the Super Bowl.\"\n\nWalking to the park's botanic garden, Emerson said appreciating natural phenomena makes it easier to manage the stresses that come with living in a big city. Also like a big sports game, the eclipse will draw lots of people together to experience something much larger than themselves, in community, he said.\n\n\"A lot of times it's tragedies that bring us together, but sometimes things like this do,\" he said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nTexas Eclipse Festival cut short by weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival was canceled Monday in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, because of weather concerns. The festival, which included bands and other events, began Sunday and was supposed to wrap up Tuesday.\n\n\"We regret to inform you of the severe weather forecast, including risks of high winds, tornadic activity, large hail, and thunderstorms for later today, including during the eclipse, Tuesday, and Wednesday,\" festival organizers said on their website. \"Your safety is our top priority.\"\n\nFestivalgoers were urged to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Guests, however, were allowed to stay \"provided they pack and are prepared to depart after totality.\"\n\nTraffic jams, collisions mar eclipse watchers' travel\n\nTraffic crashes and road delays were reported across the nation as Americans flocked to prime locations to gaze up at the rare solar eclipse. Local roads and highways in states including Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Vermont and New Hampshire were overwhelmed with eclipse chasers, many of whom were from out of state. The most intense bottlenecks appeared to be in the path of totality, where spectators will be able to view the full eclipse.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time narrowed eastbound lanes on I-40, a major transcontinental highway that runs from California to North Carolina. The crash occurred not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events, and it's also within driving distance of the full eclipse path, which includes parts of southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nMultiple crashes were reported on an interstate in Waco, Texas, a city in the path of totality, where several festivities and eclipse viewing events were scheduled. The crashes all occurred on I-35, which runs from southern Texas to Minnesota.\n\n\"Expect major traffic delays in this area,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in a statement.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nAirport draws a crowd of jets for eclipse\n\nEAGLE PASS, Texas − Maverick County International Airport in Eagle Pass, Texas, usually sees maybe three private planes a day. By 10 a.m. CT on Monday, more than 10 planes crowded the tarmac, including Cessnas, Pipers and at least one corporate jet − all there to catch an early glimpse of the total solar eclipse. Eagle Pass will be one of the first American cities to witness the phenomenon. Some watchers, like Brandon Beck, 43, flew in Sunday night from San Diego and spent the night in a sleeping bag on the tarmac next to his friend’s Mooney single-prop piston four-seater.“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.”\n\nFirst the Cherry Blossoms, then the eclipse\n\nWASHINGTON − The Cherry Blossoms brought Ali and Aurore Youssouf to the city all the way from Paris, but the pair were delighted to learn that their trip would overlap with the eclipse. The day is extra special for Aurore Youssouf, 43, who has never seen an eclipse before. On Monday morning, the couple arrived by chance at the National Mall early enough to snag a few pairs of free eclipse glasses distributed by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the occasion.“We didn’t even know. We just ended up here and found out that they were giving away some glasses,” said Ali Youssouf, 46.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAwaiting eclipse − and hail − in Texas\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas − Forecasts called for considerable cloudiness, rain and possible hail, but retired NASA engineer Jeff Stone stayed positive as he and his wife prepared to host more than a dozen people for a watch party at their hilltop home in Texas Hill Country. Stone, an eclipse enthusiast who had met family in Missouri to watch the solar eclipse of 2017, said he recently reviewed video footage of that event and said current conditions weren’t that much different than they were back then.\n\n“I’m outside and seeing patches of blue among scattered clouds, so we’re remaining hopeful,” he said.\n\nAbout 150 miles to the northeast in Gatesville, lead pastor Eric Moffett of Coryell Community Church said a similar forecast did little to deter an expected gathering of about 800 visitors for the church’s family-oriented “Eclipse at the Crosses” event. Many, if not most, were from out of town or even out of country − Canada, Wales, France, Italy. Many locals were staying home to avoid the crowd, he said.\n\n“It’s partly cloudy, but the sun is shining on me right now,” he said. “We are praying that it stays that way.”\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. The Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, NASA says. Another major difference: No special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the a lunar eclipse, and people can directly stare at the moon.\n\n− Saman Shafiq\n\nSolar eclipse, lunar eclipse:What is the difference?\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will shroud much of the United States in darkness on Monday, leaving many people to wonder: Is it safe to drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nIt is safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse. But the automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to \"find a safe place to park (not on the side of a road or highway) away from other traffic and then wear your eclipse glasses,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman from AAA.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally,\" Diaz said. \"People will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse: Congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after totality, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests the worst of the traffic – on interstates and rural back roads alike – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to leave all at once.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again. According to NASA, after Monday's total solar eclipse, the next one viewable from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse. The path of totality during the 2044 eclipse will only touch three states, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. The eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nBut another eclipse scheduledfor Saturday, Aug. 12, 2045, will trace a path of totality over California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Gabe Hauari and Eric Lagatta\n\nEclipse and pets: It's not the sky that's the problem\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Experts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and eager people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” Carlson said.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nA guide to the solar eclipse for kids\n\nHere's an easy-to read, illustrated guide to help kids understand what the April 8 total solar eclipse means, where it will be visible and how you can watch it safely. It also shows them how an ordinary kitchen colander can easily be used to view a solar eclipse − the colander's holes can project crescent images of the sun onto the ground. There are even pages that can be downloaded and colored.\n\nTrump's eclipse experience lit up internet in 2017\n\nSeven years ago, when the last total solar eclipse crossed over North America, a photo of then-President Donald Trump seemingly gazing at the sun with his naked eyes set the internet ablaze. During the afternoon of Aug. 21, 2017, Trump, who was president at the time, was joined by then first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron to watch the rare phenomenon from the Truman Balcony at the White House. Photos taken by members of the media captured all three donning eclipse glasses while looking at the eclipse.\n\nBut at one point during the viewing, the former president was captured in photos and videos without proper eye protection, seemingly gazing directly at the sun. Looking at an eclipse before or after the brief phase of totality without proper eyewear can lead to eye damage.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?What to know about the next eclipse's path, timing\n\nHow to make a solar eclipse viewer\n\nPeople who didn't manage to get their hands on glasses are not completely down and out. There are other safe ways to view the eclipse, say experts, and a lot of them only require a little bit of craftiness and items you can find lying around the house.\n\nSteps to make the cereal box eclipse viewer (And here is a video aid):\n\nGet an empty, clean cereal box.\n\nCut a white piece of cardboard that will fit snuggly in the bottom of the box, or secure it permanently by gluing it in place.\n\nCut the top of the cereal box, removing both ends and leaving the center intact.\n\nPut a piece of tape across the center of the top to securely hold it closed.\n\nTape a piece of heavy-duty foil or double a single layer for additional strength, covering one of the openings at the top of the cereal box. The other opening will remain open for viewing.\n\nUsing a small nail (approximately 3mm in diameter) push a hole in the foil.\n\nCover the entire box with construction paper, leaving the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nThe finished box should be held with the pin-hole side facing the sun. It may take a little practice pointing the box. With your back facing the sun, look through the viewing opening. A small image of the sun, about ½ cm in diameter, can be seen projected on the white paper inside the box.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdrid\n\nWhat is the path of the solar eclipse called?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in August 2017.\n\nHow to look at eclipse without glasses\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nHow fast does an eclipse shadow travel?\n\nAccording to a post from the National Weather Service in Indianapolis on X, an eclipse shadow travels at speeds from 1,100 to 5,000 mph. Near the equator, it travels at around 1,100 mph and increases in speed as it approaches the poles.\n\nThe eclipse party is over? Time to recycle those glasses!\n\nAstronomers Without Borders, or AWB, a non-profit organization running its second nationwide eclipse glasses recycling drive. Her business will join over 300 schools, museums, city governments, commercial businesses, community organizations and local libraries that will collect and ship an estimated millions of glasses to be repurposed for use by underserved communities around the world in future solar eclipses.\n\nAWB launched its first run of the program after the last solar eclipse in 2017 when volunteer centers across the country collected millions of the glass. After vetting them for reuse, more than half a million glasses were distributed to Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nPeople can visit AWB's website to find their nearest participating collection center and learn more about recycling the glasses, said Andrew Fazekas, the organization's communication manager.\n\n\"We figure there's probably going to be tens of millions of glasses out there at the very least,\" he said. \"And most of them are probably very gently used.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/04/what-to-know-about-aprils-total-solar-eclipse-how-to-see-it-in-brevard/72803195007/", "title": "Next total solar eclipse is just over a month away.

It will start in the South Pacific Ocean, travel from Mexico into Oklahoma and move diagonally across the country through New Hampshire.\n\nWhile Florida is not in the path of totality, you will still be able to enjoy some of the eclipse from Brevard.\n\nWhat will the total solar eclipse look like in Brevard?\n\nBrevard’s view of the eclipse will be just over half of the sun to more than ¾ of it obscured by the moon. It will vary a bit depending on where you are.\n\nMore of the moon will be blocked the farther northwest you go.\n\nWhat time will the eclipse be visible in Brevard?\n\nThe total eclipse will hit the coast of Mexico on April 8, 2024, around 2:07 p.m. EDT.\n\nThe partial eclipse will begin first as the edge of the moon becomes visible, and then about an hour and 20 minutes later the totality will begin and last for three or four minutes before the sun begins to appear again.\n\nFlorida residents should start to see the eclipse beginning around 1:35 p.m. EDT, with the midpoint at 2:55.\n\nWhere are the best places in Florida to see the eclipse?\n\nHead to the Panhandle for the best viewing location in Florida. Pensacola will reach just over 80% at midpoint, according to eclipse2024.com.\n\nThe farther south, or southeast you go, the less coverage you’ll see. Tallahassee will get 75.4% coverage, Jacksonville about 70%. Southwestern Florida will see about 60% of the sun blocked, Palm Beach 58%, Miami 55.7%, and down in the Keys it'll be 55.1%.\n\nHow to safely view the eclipse\n\nEven though Brevard is getting a partial view, it is still imperative that you not look directly at the sun. NASA recommends wearing safe solar viewing glasses.\n\nEclipse glasses are thousands of times darker than regular sunglasses (which are not enough to protect your eyes during an eclipse) to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. They should not be used if they are torn or scratched.\n\nProtective eyewear is needed even if viewing the eclipse through binoculars, a telescope or camera lens. Looking at the eclipse with bare eyes will result in severe eye injury.\n\nWarber Parker at The Avenue Viera will be giving out free eclipse glasses beginning April 1.\n\nHow often are total solar eclipses?\n\nTotal solar eclipses aren't that uncommon, they happen somewhere on the Earth's surface about every 18 months, according to Space.com. But the area on the ground covered by totality is only about 50 miles wide and any given spot on the planet might see a total eclipse once every hundred years or so.\n\nThe next total solar eclipse visible in North America won't be until 2033, according to NASA.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2024/12/27/5-animated-satellite-images-showcase-stunning-views-of-earth-park-fire/77242676007/", "title": "5 animated satellite images showcase stunning views of ... - Redding", "text": "The Earth was ready for its close-up this year.

Partial eclipses, when some part of the sun remains visible, are the most common, making total eclipses a rare sight to behold.\n\nTotal eclipses can lead to a period of darkness lasting for several minutes, during which time nocturnal animals stir while confused birds and insects may fall silent, NASA says.\n\nWhen a solar eclipse reaches totality, people are able to see the sun’s outer atmosphere called the corona, which is usually obscured by the sun's bright surface. This offers scientists an uncommon opportunity to study the corona.\n\nTotality also offers spectators a chance to gaze upon the spectacular sight with the naked eye, though proper safety glasses are still required for the rest of the time.\n\nWhat states are on the 2024 eclipse path of totality?\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which is expected to occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow will northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. The path will then cut diagonally across the country, traveling through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nThe eclipse's path is expected to end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT before visiting the maritime provinces of Canada, according to estimates.\n\nSee interactive maps of the 2024 path.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Ramon Padilla & Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/14/solar-eclipse-in-tallahassee-what-youll-see-where-to-get-glasses/72959099007/", "title": "A total solar eclipse is coming.

Not quite.\n\nA total solar eclipse will span across the North American continent with totality in 10 states April 8, but Florida and Tallahassee will only get a partial view of the astronomical phenomenon.\n\nThe rare total solar eclipse happens when the moon is perfectly aligned between the sun and the Earth, completely covering the sun and casting a shadow over the Earth. Viewers within the path of totality could catch a glimpse of an almost literal black-hole sun with the naked eye (if clouds cooperate).\n\nA total solar eclipse is far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow.\n\nIn Tallahassee, viewers will see a partial solar eclipse, but viewers must wear special protective glasses while admiring the sun. Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhen will it happen?\n\nThe total solar eclipse will start on Monday, April 8 at 11 a.m., off the coast of Mexico and gradually make its way through Texas. The eclipse's path of totality will pass over cities like Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York. And those places will attract sky gazers from all over the country.\n\nAccording to timeanddate.com the partial eclipse will last for about two and a half hours in Tallahassee, starting at about 1:42 p.m. and ending at about 4:17 p.m. with maximum viewing at 3 p.m.\n\nWhat you can expect to see in Tallahassee\n\nFloridians will see 71% of a total eclipse, so not completely covered, but Alan Hanstein, executive director of the Challenger Learning Center, says folks will still be in for a \"real treat.\"\n\n\"The sun is so bright that even at 71% if you were just walking around town, you would think it's just a cloudy, hazy day,\" Hanstein told the Tallahassee Democrat during a preview event at the Challenger Learning Center where staff gave a presentation with information about the solar eclipse and handed out safety solar glasses to patrons.\n\nDuring the annular solar eclipse in October 2023, the Tallahassee forecast was cloudy, and many didn't catch a view. In 2017, the last North American total eclipse, Tallahasseeans enjoyed good views of 86 percent coverage of the sun.\n\nWhere to get glasses\n\nExperts warn to never look at a solar eclipse with a naked eye unless it's in the brief window of totality.\n\nIt is not safe to watch the event unfold without special protective eclipse glasses. Even sunglasses won’t keep out damaging rays that can burn a hole through the retina.\n\nA list of suppliers for safe solar filters and viewers can be found online from The American Astronomical Society (AAS). Various Home Depot, Lowes and Walmart locations sell ISO-compliant safe eclipse glasses and/or handheld viewers, the group states.\n\nSafe eclipse glasses will meet the \"ISO 12312-2\" standard. To best protect your eyes, the AAS recommends wearing eclipse glasses that are \"recognized by the American Astronomical Society's Solar Eclipse Task Force as a supplier of safe solar viewers/filters,\" per the AAS site.\n\nThe Challenger Learning Center is also selling approved solar eclipse glasses for $2.\n\nHanstein also shared that there are alternative options for viewing the eclipse if glasses are not available. Casting a shadow on the ground using a pen and punching a hole through a sheet of paper or using a colander works just as well as any pair of glasses. The AAS site offers helpful instructions to set them up.\n\nWatch party planning in the works for Kleman Plaza, Challenger Learning Center\n\nInside the planetarium, the Challenger will stream the celestial event and the movement of the eclipse across North America. They'll also have glasses on hand for an outdoor watch party in Kleman Plaza.\n\nIn 2017, thousands of all ages gathered at the Challenger Learning Center's viewing party at Kleman Plaza to witness the brief but historical solar eclipse.\n\nHolding coveted solar eclipse-safe glasses — or waiting in a long line for a pair — people worried if a cloudy sky would block their view of the rare sun-and-moon alignment.\n\nBut soon the sun teased its rays from behind clouds that finally gave way. Gasps of wonder cooed through the crowd as the moon shadowed the sun.\n\nCan't catch the view? Wait till 2045 or 2052 when Tallahassee is in for totality\n\nMany of the youngsters who gathered at Kleman Plaza in 2017 and in 2024 for the solar show might be around to witness the next eclipse — a total one. And they won't even have to leave their hometown to view it.\n\nThe next total solar eclipse will be in August 2045 and Tallahassee will be right in the path of totality.

From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nStarting at 2:07 p.m. April 8 in Rochester, the moon will begin to appear to move in front of the sun. Totality begins at 3:20 p.m. and will last for 3 minutes and 38 seconds (plus or minus a few seconds depending where you are standing.) By 4:33 p.m. the moon will have moved past the sun, returning the light to normal. Along the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes.\n\nRochester NY in eclipse path of totality\n\nAll told, nearly 500 cities in the U.S. are located on the eclipse's path of totality. Some of the major cities include:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/03/19/longest-solar-eclipse-april-8-mexico/72900282007/", "title": "Longest solar eclipse will take place over west coast of Mexico", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nPaul Maley grew up in Texas at the height of the Space Age of the 1960s, often looking skyward. He was mesmerized by solar eclipses, including one he photographed as a young teen, its image projected on a lawn chair.\n\nOver the years, an interest in eclipses took him far beyond any Texas backyard.\n\nToday, the 76-year-old is among America’s most prolific eclipse chasers. He has followed them across the globe in 42 countries including Indonesia, Peru, Turkey and Saudi Arabia – taking him to remote villages, sandy deserts and even the icy shores of Antarctica.\n\nOn April 8, the retired NASA contractor aims to notch his 84th eclipse – and 30th total eclipse – while floating in the Pacific Ocean on a ship somewhere west of Mazatlan, Mexico.\n\n“I look at every solar eclipse that I can possibly get to,” he said.\n\nFor die-hard eclipse chasers, the Holy Grail is a total eclipse – and in the path of totality, this year’s best destination is in central and western Mexico. That’s because the area around Mazatlan, Durango and Torreon provides the likeliest chance of clear skies and the longest period of darkness before the shadow arcs northeast through 13 U.S. states, from Texas to Maine, its shadow sweeping across the land at 1,500 mph.\n\nMaley will be in Mexico helping organize two eclipse trips, one on land and one at sea. They’ll be just some of the eclipse tourists – including dedicated viewers who call themselves umbraphiles, for “shadow lovers” – who have booked hotels, cruise ships or RV trips to Mexico.\n\nIs the April 2024 eclipse safe for pets?Why experts want you to leave them at home.\n\nFred Espenak, a former NASA astrophysicist who has viewed 30 total eclipses – and who once chased a total eclipse with a path so remote, he had to fly to a landing strip in the Libyan desert so remote it was lit by vehicle headlights – will be with another group in Mazatlan.\n\nJoseph Izen, 67, a retired physics professor, plans to pull a trailer with telescopes and cameras as part of an RV caravan en route to a borrowed ranch north of Durango, Mexico. He said it was the best shot for clear skies that provide an incomparable experience – and an adventure to boot.\n\nHe has seen fewer total eclipses than some other chasers but is just as passionate. “As we say in the community, this will be my fourth time in shadow,” he said.\n\nWhile Maley wouldn’t miss an eclipse himself, total or otherwise, working as a trip coordinator in connection with the Johnson Space Center Astronomical Society means he is able to introduce “newbies” to the profound experience that has driven him around the globe.\n\nIn a total eclipse, broad daylight suddenly darkens, temperatures drop, birds quiet and the sun’s corona flickers around a blackened disk, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that can provoke strong reactions.\n\n“I've seen people cry. I've seen them scream. I've seen them run around and just make wild exclamations,” Maley said. “We had one guy that became so overcome, they had to bring him a paper bag ... he was hyperventilating.”\n\nMore:What does a total solar eclipse look like? Photos from past events show what to expect in 2024\n\nFascination fuels shadow chasing\n\nBy the late 1960s, around the time of the first lunar landings, Maley landed a job with a company that did contracting work for NASA. He would go on to spend years doing various work including on flight control to support the Apollo missions, Skylab, the space shuttle and the International Space Station.\n\nHe kept going to see any eclipse he could, and by 1977 he also began organizing trips in connection with the Johnson Space Center Astronomical Society to help others travel to see them, too.\n\nIt became an endless pursuit: Total eclipses cast their shadow at various locations on Earth approximately every 18 months, and chasing them brought adventures around the globe.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he traveled to the island of Java, visiting one small town with an Indonesian military police escort. Some residents went inside to avoid looking directly at the sun, he recalled, leaving them largely alone to observe the eclipse.\n\nDuring the 1990s, his trips took him to Peru, including in the Amazon, to view eclipses. There, he met an American woman who he realized had lived near him back home. Lynn Palmer would later become his wife, and she still travels with him.\n\nHe’s also seen people with “New Age” views who sought to “absorb the energy” they connected with eclipses, he said.\n\nIn India, he never forgot the indelible image of women standing in the Ganges River with eclipse glasses looking at the sky. In 2010, he journeyed to Uganda to take certain solar measurements at the edge of a path of a total eclipse, instead of the centerline. (He says he’s not among those thrilled only by total eclipses – he finds them all fascinating.)\n\nIn 2021, he organized a cruise to Antarctica to view an eclipse, with passengers paying up to $20,000. But cloud cover blocked the view. On top of that, the captain turned back to Argentina early because of bad weather, limiting the number of shore visits. Participants were “noticeably upset,” he recalled, and some blamed him.\n\n“It was bad luck,” he said. “We always tell everyone that regardless of where the eclipse is, there's no way we can guarantee that it will be clear.”\n\nBut if eclipses are a reminder of people’s place in a vast universe, weather complications in chasing them – which once included trying to watch an eclipse in Georgia next to a chicken coop in the rain – were also a reminder to him of all that is beyond our human control.\n\nThe eclipse-chasing elite\n\nWhile some veteran eclipse-chasers are solar researchers, others are tour operators, photographers or simply die-hard enthusiasts who chase with their own resources, said Kate Russo, who has written several books on the psychology of eclipse-chasers.\n\nIt’s a small community, said Espenak, who formerly worked for NASA on planetary atmosphere modeling and later developed eclipse predictions.\n\n“People who have seen 10 or more total solar eclipses, I doubt there are more than a couple hundred of us,” Espenak said.\n\nGuinness World Records lists the title for the most instances within the moon's umbral shadow, or most total eclipses viewed, at 35, as being held jointly held by two American umbraphiles: Glenn Schneider and John Beattie, whose most recent viewing was on a flight in 2019, according to spokeswoman Kylie Galloway.\n\nJay Pasachoff, a well-known eclipse-chaser, shared the record before he died two years ago. He had seen more than 70 eclipses, including one in Easter Island, Chile, that he wrote about in an 2010 op-ed in the New York Times. Called “Why I Never Miss a Solar Eclipse,” it described a small community of veteran eclipse chasers reuniting from previous far-flung adventures.\n\n“On this Pacific outpost, 2,200 miles west of the South American coast, hundreds of us have gathered, exchanging warm greetings and catching up on life since we last saw one another – in the Galápagos five years ago, or in Zambia nine years ago, or in Papua New Guinea 16 years ago,” he wrote. “We are umbraphiles: having once stood in the umbra, the Moon’s shadow, during a solar eclipse, we are driven to do so again and again, whenever the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun.”\n\nThe Guinness Book of World Records does not track records on the total number of times people have viewed all types of eclipses, Galloway said. Other types of eclipses includes partial, annular and hybrid.\n\nMaley said he is drawn to see all types of eclipses. On Eclipse Chaser Log, where many but not all chasers self-report their experiences, Maley is listed as being among the top five people for the number of totality views, and having seen the most when all types of eclipses are included. Still more have logged more “time in totality,” meaning they spent more time inside the shadow.\n\nRusso said it’s the experience of totality that drives most chasers. That’s because it provides reactions akin to “primitive fear” and a “sense of wrongness” related to an environment that seems out of line with the normal world.\n\nVeteran chasers describe being hooked by feelings that made their hair stand up on their neck or gave them chills – and has had them coming back for more.\n\n“As soon as that eclipse was over, I realized that this could not be a once-in-a-lifetime event for me, I had to see another one,” Espenak said.\n\nChasers flock to Mexico\n\nMaley was thrilled to see interest in eclipses skyrocket after the 2017 eclipse that ended a decadeslong drought for the continental United States. NASA estimates that 215 million U.S. adults viewed that eclipse directly or virtually.\n\n“That was a big moment,” he said, one that led many to make years-ahead plans for viewing this year’s eclipse, with some setting their sights on Mexico.\n\nOn one Solar Eclipse Chasers Facebook group, one man said recently that he had reserved a place in Mazatlan four years ago.\n\nWhile the moon’s shadow will first appear 370 miles off the west coast of Mexico, Mazatlan will be the first region of the mainland to experience totality, according to Space.com. The shadow will cross Mexico in 25 minutes, passing Durango, Torreon and Monclova as it heads northeast, crossing the U.S. border at about 1:32 p.m. CT.\n\nIn the middle of it will be David Gedalia, a 56-year-old amateur astronomer who has seen three total eclipses and 10 partial ones. The Southern California resident is driving to Concordia, Mexico, in a camper truck in an RV caravan, to ensure safety while traveling through the countryside. He said the cost and time to experience it in person rather than look at photos or video makes the long journey worth it. “It's almost like watching somebody ride a roller coaster on TV, rather than riding a roller coaster yourself.”\n\nIzen, the retired physics professor with a trailer full of telescope gear, will soon be packing up for an overland trip with about 35 RVs organized by the Mexican-based RV touring company Caravanas de Mexico. The group will meet in Nogales and be north of Durango near Ciudad Canatlán on April 8.\n\nIzen saw his first eclipse in 1979 and most recently saw one in Australia, where the jet-lagged enthusiast told an Australian TV reporter, “Seeing totality and seeing my children born – it’s tough to say which is more exciting.”\n\nAbout 190 miles away, Espenak will be in Mazatlan with a group of about 80 people seeking to mix eclipse watching and a beach trip. He’s preparing a lecture and to be available for questions, he said.\n\nMaley will be offshore with 186 for a 10-day cruise on a small Swan Hellenic cruise ship, at a cost of about $14,000 for a couple in one room. If the clouds roll in, he said, they can try to motor to a clearer location and work with the crew to position the ship for the best viewing.\n\nBeing off the coast will provide up to four minutes and 28 seconds of totality, close to the maximum viewing anywhere along the eclipse path. At sea, he said, the sight is just as arresting as it is on land, appearing as if the sun is setting in every direction.\n\nInterest in going to see eclipses may spike after this year’s eclipse, which will pass over more than 31 million residents in the U.S. alone and be the last to be visible in the lower 48 states until 2044.\n\nMaley says he is already planning a series of trips, including going to Egypt in 2027.\n\nAnd if he makes it to every eclipse between now and 2031, he’ll reach a significant milestone – viewing 100 solar eclipses of different types. That’s if the stars align for him.\n\nBut as eclipses have taught him, he can’t control whether that will happen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/16/partial-lunar-eclipse-supermoon-harvest-moon-september/75247924007/", "title": "Partial lunar eclipse, supermoon to appear across U.S.: How to see it", "text": "Skywatchers have all kinds of reasons to look up at the moon this week.\n\nNot only is September's full moon also a so-called \"supermoon\" because of its size and brightness, but it's also due to be eclipsed by Earth as it rises into the late-summer skies. And unlike April's total solar eclipse that sparked a nationwide viewing frenzy, those who live in North America don't need to make any last-minute travel arrangements to witness the celestial sight.\n\nHere's what to know about the upcoming partial lunar eclipse and how to see it:\n\nWhat is a partial lunar eclipse?\n\nLunar eclipses always occur at the full moon phase when Earth is positioned between the moon and the sun.\n\nWhen those three bodies align, Earth’s shadow falls upon the surface of the moon, dimming it and causing odd changes in its appearance, according to NASA. In the case of a total lunar eclipse, the moon moves into the inner part of Earth’s shadow, or the umbra, which can turn the lunar surface a striking red for a few hours.\n\nStart your day informed: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nBut what's happening this week is a partial lunar eclipse, which can still cause the moon to give off a reddish hue.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse occurs when the three celestial bodies do not form a straight line as the moon passes through only part of the umbra while the rest of the moon is covered by Earth's outermost shadow, the penumbra.\n\nThough the shadow grows and then recedes, it never entirely covers the moon, and, thus, only part of it appears red.\n\nWhere and when will the lunar eclipse be visible?\n\nAny lunar eclipse can only be seen from half of Earth.\n\nThis week's partial lunar eclipse should be visible Tuesday night across the entire northern hemisphere, including North America. For those in the United States, that means all lower 48 states should have a view.\n\nAccording to NASA, the moon will enter Earth's partial shadow at 8:41 PM EDT, but it's the peak of the eclipse that viewers will want to witness. While the moon will slightly dim around 10:13 p.m., the peak itself will occur at 10:44 p.m.\n\nAt that time, a dark shadow will appear at the top of the moon, gradually covering about 8% of it, before receding. The moon will finish exiting the full shadow at 11:16 p.m. and the partial shadow on Wednesday morning at 12:47 a.m., NASA said.\n\nTimeanddate.com offers a detailed eclipse schedule for any location on the planet.\n\nLunar eclipse coincides with supermoon\n\nAdding to the lunar fun: September's full moon, the \"Harvest Moon,\" is also a supermoon.\n\nAs one of the biggest and brightest moons of the year, a supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the satellite's closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit.\n\nFor skywatchers, that means this year's Harvest Moon – so named for its historical ties to when crops needed to be picked from the fields – will also be occurring this week from about Monday evening through Thursday morning.\n\nAfter Tuesday, the next supermoons are Oct. 17 and Nov. 15.\n\nWhen is the next eclipse?\n\nUp next is a “ring of fire” annular solar eclipse, which will be visible Oct. 2.\n\nThese celestial events occur when the moon appears slightly smaller than the sun, covering only part of the sun's disk and creating the appearance of a ring of light outlining the moon's silhouette, according to the Planetary Society. Because the moon is at the furthest point from Earth in its orbit during an annular eclipse, the moon appears with a slightly smaller appearance from Earth's perspective.\n\nThe \"ring of fire\" will be visible from parts of South America, the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and Antarctica. But in the U.S., Hawaii is the only state expected to have a partial view.\n\nAs for the next lunar eclipse, it won't be until March 14, 2025 that a total lunar eclipse is visible to the entire United States.\n\nContributing: Mary Walrath-Holdridge.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}]}

She demanded that his body be handed over to his family amid reports it was \"picked up\" by investigators.\n\nNavalny's death deprives Russia of one of its most effective −and fearless − political rivals to Putin, who has long silenced his critics. It robs Navalny's many followers and admirers of a charismatic talisman willing to stand up to Putin and has shocked world leaders and human rights groups. But it is unlikely, Russia experts say, to transform or weaken Putin's authoritarian grip on his country.\n\nAlready, Russia's security services have moved quickly to stamp out any signs of mass gatherings or demonstrations. About 100 people across eight cities were detained by Russian police as they tried to lay flowers and attend various vigils related to Navalny's death, according to OVD-Info, a Moscow-based independent human rights group and information service that focuses on political persecution in Russia.\n\nBlaming Putin for Navalny's death\n\nNavalny's death was first reported Friday by Russia's state media. The Federal Penitentiary Service of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, where he was being held, said Navalny, 47, \"felt unwell\" after he went on a walk and \"almost immediately lost consciousness.\"\n\nNo cause of death was detailed. The prison service said it tried to resuscitate him without success. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had no information about how Navalny died.\n\nAs word of Navalny's death spread, his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, blamed the Kremlin and called for justice. “We cannot believe Putin and his government,” Navalnaya said, addressing an audience at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. “They are lying constantly.\"\n\n\"But if it’s true, I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country, with my family and with my husband,\" she said. \"They will be brought to justice, and this day will come soon.”\n\nNavalny:Young Russians mourn death of charismatic opposition leader\n\nWorld leaders were quick to blame the Russian president. \"Make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny's death,\" President Joe Biden said at White House. \"What has happened is yet more proof of Putin’s brutality. No one should be fooled. Not in Russia, not at home, not anywhere in the world.”\n\nAnd some Russia observers went even further, saying the Russian president was more than simply ''responsible'' for his death.\n\n\"Putin killed Navalny,\" Igor Eidman, a Russian political dissident and political commentator, told USA TODAY. Putin had him \"poisoned, imprisoned, rolled into the Arctic Circle, rotted in a punishment cell. But it wasn’t enough for him.''\n\nMore:President Biden says 'Putin is responsible for Navalny's death'\n\nWho was Alexei Navalny?\n\nHe was a lawyer, an anti-corruption activist and a political prisoner.\n\nNavalny had been a thorn in Putin's side for more than a decade, leading multiple investigations into the wealth of Russia's leader and his inner circle. He attempted to run for president in 2018 but was barred from that vote.\n\nTwo years later, he was poisoned by a nerve agent while on a trip to Siberia. After he was treated in Germany he returned home to continue his work. Just before taking off from a Berlin airport, he posted a video to Instagram of his wife quoting a line from a popular Russian crime movie: \"Bring us some vodka, boy. We're flying home.\"\n\nInstead, he was immediately arrested.\n\nMore:What to know about Alexei Navalny, Putin's top critic who died in prison.\n\n\"Navalny,\" a film about his poisoning and imprisonment, won an Oscar for best documentary in 2023.\n\nThe dissident was being held in jail on extremism and fraud charges that were widely viewed as retribution for his years at the forefront of the anti-Kremlin opposition. Navalny had been imprisoned since 2021, most recently about 40 miles north of the Arctic Circle in a penal colony nicknamed \"Polar Wolf.\"\n\nIt is one of Russia's toughest jails.\n\nHe would periodically appear by video link from prison looking gaunt, with his head shaved. Yet he also projected optimism and good spirits. In one video, published in January, he joked that he had not yet received any mail for Christmas. A month earlier, he said, \"I'm a special-regime Santa Claus,\" a reference to his Arctic location.\n\n'They can come for you':For Russian protesters, a free-speech crackdown sharpens threat\n\nWhat changes in Russia with Alexei Navalny's death?\n\nErin Baumann, a Russia expert at Boston College, said that Navalny's death was unlikely to lead to mass protests and wouldn't have any impact on Russia's presidential election in March. That vote is seen as a foregone conclusion that will return Putin to power because he has marginalized any effective opposition. Many Russian activists who oppose his government have either fled the country or are themselves imprisoned.\n\nFor years, Putin's foes have tended to die in mysterious ways including poisonings, by falling out of windows and even in a plane crash, such as happened to Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nRussians escape Putin's war on Ukraine:They find a new home – and a moral dilemma\n\nHowever, Baumann said that Navalny did put Putin under pressure, especially because he was able to continue some aspects of his activism from behind bars through his vast network inside and outside Russia.\n\n\"Navalny undermined Putin,\" she said.\n\n\"He created just enough instability to keep the Putin administration on its back foot.\"\n\nAfter Navaly was arrested in 2021, he released a two-hour video investigation on YouTube detailing a luxury mansion on Russia's southern Black Sea coast reportedly belonging to Putin.\n\nThe video alleges the mansion sits on a private estate 39 times the size of Monaco, is the largest private home in Russia, and was paid for with \"the largest bribe in history.\" The property has a theater, a casino, a church, a hockey rink, an \"aquatic\" disco and a hookah lounge with a pole-dancing stage.\n\nPutin denied owning the opulent palace.\n\nA port city, a steel cage, a palace:The steps that made Putin 'the richest man in the world'\n\n\"Navalny's message was 'I'm not necessarily right for Russia. I can promise you he (Putin) isn't,'\" said Baumann.\n\nKonstantin Sonin, a Russian political economist who knew Navalny personally, said that his death \"guarantees\" the absence of any real opposition threat to Putin and means \"he will never step down peacefully.\"\n\nNavalny: A source of US-Russia tension\n\nNavalny's fate has also long been one of the many flashpoints between Moscow and Washington. These tensions extend to Moscow's support for rogue states, its alleged cyberattacks and election meddling, and human rights.\n\n\"Navalny’s death would be another indication that Russia has little or no intention of abiding by basic fundamental human rights,\" Biden said in Geneva in 2021 when he last had a face-to-face meeting with Putin.\n\nBiden said he made it clear to Putin the \"consequences\" of Navalny's death would be \"devastating\" for Russia.\n\nHe did not elaborate.\n\nOn Friday, European politicians expressed sorrow and outrage over Navalny's death, pointed out his courage in the face of his imprisonment and said they would ultimately seek to hold Russia accountable.\n\n\"Navalny paid with his life for his resistance to a system of oppression. His death in a penal colony reminds us of the reality of Vladimir Putin's regime,\" said French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"(He) didn't die in prison, he was killed by the Kremlin's brutality and its aim to silence the opposition. Russia's regime must face consequences. It must be brought to justice,\" said Lithuania's President Gitanas Nausėda.\n\nAlexei Navalny's legacy\n\n\"Navalny was Putin's number one domestic enemy,\" said Eidman, an exiled Russian political commentator.\n\n\"He was a symbol of hope for change, for Russia to become a normal democratic state. He combined the qualities of an effective tough politician and a fiery idealist.\"\n\nEidman said Putin was not content to leave Navalny \"rotting in a punishment cell.\"\n\nSonin, who teaches at the University of Chicago, said that before he was jailed Navalny \"was the only person in Russia who could say 'I'm organizing a protest' and thousands of people would show up.\"\n\nHe said there is nobody to replace him.\n\nThis is true for Navalnaya, Navalny's wife, too.\n\n\"I am asking everyone who is here to unite and help punish the Russian regime,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Dan Morrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/03/15/2024-russia-presidential-election-putin-reign/72940493007/", "title": "In 2024 Russia election, Putin may cement longest reign since Stalin", "text": "Sasha Skochilenko's crime was swapping supermarket price tags with anti-war messages. Oleg Tarasov was locked up because of the name he gave his Wi-Fi network. Aleksey Moskalyov was convicted of discrediting the Russian military for a drawing his 13-year-old daughter made at school.\n\nVladimir Putin, 71, Russia's longest serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, will almost certainly emerge victorious in the nation's eighth presidential election. The vote takes place Friday to Sunday, and the winner will be inaugurated in a lavish ceremony in May at the Grand Kremlin Palace, former residence of tsars and empresses.\n\nIf, as widely expected, Putin cruises to another six-year term − the former KGB officer has held continuous positions as Russia's president or prime minister since 1999 − opponents say it will be because he has used all facets of the state to weaken every threat to his authority, because he has spent a fortune implementing rigid control over Russia's political system, and, well, because the vote is rigged.\n\n\"This is not an election, it's a selection,\" said Alena Popova, a Moscow-based human rights activist.\n\nPopova failed to win a seat in parliamentary elections in 2021. She ran on a platform that put women's rights and highlighting domestic violence at the center of her political campaign. Authorities said her feminist views were \"extremist\" and could lead to the \"destruction of traditional values.\" She was designated a \"foreign agent,\" a quasi-legal classification that is tantamount to being called a spy or traitor.\n\nPopova compared Russia's presidential vote to Stalin's \"fictive electoral process,\" when it was obvious to many that it wasn't Russia's voters who decided anything but Russia's vote counters who decided everything.\n\n\"Putin has criminalized the expression of any alternative opinions,\" she said.\n\nIn Tucker Carlson interview:Putin's plans for Ukraine appear to echo Trump's\n\nSkochilenko, 33, an artist from St. Petersburg, was jailed for seven years for replacing small supermarket labels with messages that read, \"The Russian army bombed an art school in Mariupol (in Ukraine's South East)\" or \"My great grandfather did not fight in World War II for four years so that Russia could become a fascist state.\"\n\nCollege student Tarasov, 22, was given a 10-day prison sentence for labeling his Wi-Fi network with the pro-Kyiv slogan \"Slava Ukraini! (\"Glory to Ukraine),\" according to court records.\n\nMoskalyova's school south of Moscow called the police after she drew a picture depicting missiles flying over a Russian flag toward a woman and child. A police investigation revealed that her father had criticized the Kremlin in social media posts. He was jailed for two years.\n\nHis daughter was sent to an orphanage.\n\n\"While the war is going on and the current president is in power, we can hardly do anything to hasten her release from prison,\" Sonya Subobina said of her girlfriend Skochilenko.\n\n\"But I emotionally support her and tell her that we will get through everything together.\"\n\nWhy is Putin bothering to hold a vote at all?\n\nAs part of Putin's clampdown on dissent, authorities in Russia have in recent years adopted a slew of laws restricting human rights, including freedom of speech and assembly, as well as the rights of minorities and religious groups. Putin has made it illegal to call Russia's invasion of Ukraine a war.\n\nPutin changed Russia's constitution in 2021 to allow him to rule until at least 2036 if he wants to. In another sign of the president's tight grip, he has allowed only a few handpicked candidates who cooperate with the regime to run against him in this year's vote.\n\nLeonid Slutsky is an extreme nationalist from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Nikolai Kharitonov will represent the Communist Party. Vladislav Davankov, a national centrist, will take part for the New People Party.\n\nAlexei Navalny died:What does it mean for Russia?\n\nNone are against the war in Ukraine. Like Putin, all three are on Western sanction lists. None have committed to bringing independent observers to voting stations. All three support anti-feminist and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, including the decriminalization of domestic violence and bills outlawing gender-affirming procedures.\n\nThe death last month of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose family and supporters believe he was murdered in prison, and the many Putin opponents like him who over the years have died or been seriously injured in mysterious circumstances, shows that Putin may also not be above state-sponsored assassinations.\n\nSee how Russian elections work:How long has Vladimir Putin been president?\n\nThe Kremlin denies any part in these violent episodes.\n\nStill: If Putin can effectively do what he wants in Russia, why is he even bothering to hold a vote?\n\nSam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at King's College London who lived and worked in Moscow for many years, described Russia's election as a \"ritual\" to make sure \"everyone's singing from the same hymn sheet.\"\n\n'Greetings from Putin's henchmen':Top Alexei Navalny aide attacked with hammer and tear gas\n\nHe said Putin \"doesn't want to risk telling Russians their vote doesn't count because they need to be able to look around and think − plausibly − that the majority of Russians support Putin even if they don't.\"\n\nGreene said that because \"authoritarian leaders tend to get pulled down not by the streets but by the elite,\" the election is also about Putin demonstrating he is a leader who can \"keep control of the masses.\"\n\nMarina Litvinenko, the widow of a former Russian spy who was poisoned to death with radioactive polonium in London in 2006, a killing the British government concluded was likely done on Putin's direct orders, said she's convinced that even though Russia's vote is taking place in what she called a \"fake\" system, for Putin it's real.\n\n\"He lives in this fake world that he has created,\" she said, where the president accepts his own government's lies as reality. \"I think he really believes in it. When somebody from the West criticizes Putin, he gets very emotional. I think he would be really disappointed to hear that people aren't actually supporting him or that he somehow isn't following the rules.\"\n\n'We believe change will eventually come'\n\nRussia’s exiled opposition is now led by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who called on Russians to show up at the polls en masse at noon Sunday to overwhelm voting booths in a sign of protest.\n\n\"This is a very simple and safe action, it cannot be prohibited, and it will help millions of people see like-minded people and realize that we are not alone,\" Navalnaya said. \"We are surrounded by people who are also against war, against corruption and against lawlessness.”\n\nSeveral people were detained for vandalism at voting stations on Friday, according to reports. One woman was caught on a video throwing a Molotov-cocktail-style bomb at one voting booth near St. Petersburg. In another, green paint could be seen being poured into ballot boxes at various polling stations in Moscow.\n\nBut even minor displays of dissent in Putin's Russia are easier said than done.\n\nAfter death of Alexei Navalny:Biden sanctions 500 Russian targets\n\nAlmost 20,000 people have been detained, often brutally, across Russia in various anti-war protests and demonstrations since Putin ordered the military to invade Ukraine a little over two years ago, according to OVD-Info, a Moscow-based independent human rights group and information service that focuses on political persecution in Russia and offers legal advice to people who have been imprisoned.\n\nNavalny was Russia's highest profile political prisoner. But there are more than 500 more in Russia’s penal colonies, according to the U.S. State Department. They face a grim reality of physical and psychological pressure, sleep deprivation, insufficient food, poor health care and a dizzying set of arbitrary rules.\n\nAuthorities have shut down or blocked independent media outlets and banned books by bestselling authors who espouse anti-war opinions. Independent artists have been harassed with invasive home searches.\n\nAfter Navalny's death, Russia's security services have moved quickly to stamp out any signs of mass gatherings or hints of criticism. About 400 people were detained by Russian police as they tried to lay flowers and hold vigils for Navalny, including on the day of his funeral.\n\n\"I don't think that asking people to come out on the streets is necessarily a good idea because the police are heavily armed, and if there's an actual mass protest I'm pretty sure people will get fired on,\" said Ksenia Maximova, a Moscow-born opposition activist who heads the London-based Russian Democratic Society.\n\nMaximova said her sources in Russia have told her that specially trained national guards who report directly to Putin took part in combat-style exercises ahead of the election.\n\n\"We understand that the democratic forces inside Russia are not strong enough to topple Putin,\" said Vladimir Ashurkov, a friend of Navalny's who helped found his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\n\"But we believe democratic change will eventually come.\"\n\nA 'state of quasi-martial law'\n\nRussia's Central Election Commission says there are about 112 million eligible voters inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Another 1.9 million voters live overseas.\n\nCallum Fraser, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London, said Russia's election could turn out to be \"the most rigged\" in the country's history.\n\nFraser said Putin will need to ensure high support and turnout, both around 80%, in a climate of severe voter apathy to give the perception that his mandate is clear and convincing. He said voter turnout in Russia, as in most authoritarian states, is \"notably poor\" − typically 40% to 60%.\n\n\"Authoritarians are not great at showing they have the mandate of the people,\" Fraser said.\n\nEurope is 'very impatient':New ambassador raises alarm over stalled $60 billion in Ukraine aid\n\nOne Russian who won't be giving Putin, or anyone else for that matter, his mandate is Boris Vishnevsky, a veteran liberal politician in Russia’s second-largest city, St. Petersburg. Vishnevsky said he intends to deliberately spoil his ballot by writing the word \"peace\" on it, with an exclamation mark in front of Putin's name.\n\n“We live in the state of quasi-martial law, so the election result is absolutely predictable,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nAnother is Lev Shlosberg, deputy leader of the socially liberal Yabloko party, Navalny's party before he was kicked out in 2007 for his then \"nationalist views\" and racist and xenophobic statements.\n\nSchlosberg plans to cross out every name on the ballot.\n\n\"The opposition exists in Russia, but it is not political − it's a moral opposition,\" said Elena Panfilova, who founded the Russia chapter of Transparency International, an organization that tracks and fights corruption.\n\nPanfilova lives in Moscow.\n\n\"It is not collective but individual opposition. It is deeply inside people,\" she said. \"Not in these clowns in power.\"\n\nSubobina, whose girlfriend Skochilenko was jailed for seven years in a penal colony for replacing supermarket labels with anti-war messages, said: \"The only thing I can say about the elections in my country is that I don’t believe in their integrity. And I am very afraid they will be followed by increased repression.\"\n\nContributing: Anna Nemtsova", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/03/13/alexei-navalny-ally-leonid-volkov-attacked-in-lithuania-with-hammer-tear-gas/72953870007/", "title": "'Greetings from Putin's henchmen': Alexei Navalny aide attacked ...", "text": "A long-time ally of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was attacked with a hammer and tear gas while in his car outside his home near Lithuania’s capital Vilnius, Navalny spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said late Tuesday.\n\nThe assailant's identity and the motive for the assault on Leonid Volkov were not clear, but it came about a month after Navalny’s unexplained death in a remote Arctic penal colony. A fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Navalny was serving a 19-year prison term on extremism charges widely seen as politically motivated.\n\nThe attack also comes ahead of an election this weekend in which Putin is expected to win his fifth term as president in a carefully stage-managed vote marked by extreme censorship and a near-total crackdown on opposition. It would mark Putin's third consecutive six-year term.\n\nNavalny, a thorn in Putin's side, dies:What does it mean for Russia?\n\nYarmysh and other members of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has an office in Vilnius, posted pictures on social media of Volkov, 43, with what appeared to be a bloody leg and bruising to his temple.\n\n\"This is a clear political attack, there is no doubt,\" said Ivan Zhdanov, another Navalny ally.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin.\n\nPolice in Lithuania launched a criminal investigation. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, called the attack \"shocking\" and said the \"perpetrators will have to answer for their crime.”\n\nLeonid Volkov vows to 'not give up'\n\nVolkov was in charge of Navalny's election campaigns when he unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013 and then attempted to challenge Putin in Russia's 2018 presidential vote.\n\nLike many Russian opposition figures, Volkov left Russia several years ago under pressure from the authorities. He stepped down as chairman of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation last year after it emerged that he called for the European Union to drop some sanctions on Russian oligarchs imposed in response to the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut Volkov has still been helping lead the foundation's anti-corruption investigations into Russian officials, organizing livestreams of major events and has played a big role in anti-Putin activism from Lithuania.\n\nA port city, a steel cage, a palace:The steps that made Putin 'the richest man in the world'\n\nThe attack took place shortly after Volkov arrived at his home near Vilnius.\n\n\"We will work, we will not give up,\" Volkov said in a short video posted on Telegram on Wednesday.\n\nThe video shows Volkov with his arm bandaged and in a sling.\n\nHe said his arm was broken and his leg hit 15 times with a hammer.\n\n\"It was a typical gangster greeting from Putin’s henchmen, from bandit St. Petersburg,\" he said, an apparent reference to Putin's time as deputy mayor in Russia's Second City in the 1990s when it was overrun by criminality.\n\nThorns in Putin's side forced to leave Russia\n\nPutin has criminalized virtually every form of dissent against him and his war in Ukraine.\n\nRussians risk jail sentences of five to seven years, for example, for \"discrediting\" the army. They can be arrested for making offhand anti-Kremlin remarks or for their social media posts.\n\nIn fact, many thorns in Putin's side have either fled Russia for the U.S. or Western Europe. Hundreds of thousands of young Russians are estimated to have left Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussians escaping Putin's war:They find a new home – and a moral dilemma\n\nRussia’s exiled opposition is now effectively led by Aleksey Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya. She and others have called on Russians to show up en masse to voting booths this weekend to overwhelm election officials.\n\nVladimir Ashurkov, a London-based Navalny friend and associate, said in addition to its investigations and fundraising for political prisoners, much of the Anti-Corruption Foundation's work is focused on advising activists inside Russia on how to safely put up anti-war posters and vandalize military recruitment offices. It coordinates volunteers outside Russia to call people inside Russia to talk about the war and persuade them to vote.\n\nAshurkov described this as a \"long-term strategy\" to defeat Putin.\n\nBut some voices inside Russia have questioned how effective the work of those based overseas really is.\n\n\"The exiled opposition cannot influence anything in Russia, since many of them have been prosecuted as 'extremists' or 'terrorists' and it annoys me when some of our critics abroad lecture us here on how to fight the bloody regime,\" said Boris Vishnevsky, a Russian opposition politician in St. Petersburg.\n\nVishnevsky is planning to boycott Russia's presidential vote.\n\nStill, Sam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at King's College London, said that inside Russia the opposition has \"talked itself into believing that they are powerless against a highly authoritarian regime.\"\n\nHowever, he said \"history is full of examples of nonviolent movements\" that have been successful at ousting unpopular leaders and governments. \"The idea that unarmed people can't bring down armed people is false.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/13"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960463/is-alexei-navalny-being-slowly-killed-in-captivity", "title": "Is Alexei Navalny being slowly killed in captivity? | The Week", "text": "Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is being gradually poisoned behind bars, his allies claim.\n\nThe prominent critic of Vladimir Putin is being held at the maximum security IK-6 penal colony at Melekhovo, about 155 miles east of Moscow, for charges including embezzlement and contempt of court.

The Kremlin denied any involvement.\n\nAfter returning to Russia in January 2021, Navalny was detained for violating his parole for a 2014 conviction for alleged embezzlement – a move “widely regarded as a politically motivated campaign to silence” him, said The New York Times. In what Amnesty International called a “sham” trial, Navalny was slapped with a two-and-a-half year prison sentence for parole violations, before being sentenced in March last year to a further nine years for additional fraud and contempt charges.\n\nNavalny claims to have been “repeatedly placed in solitary punishment cells for up to 15 days at a time for trivial offences, such as introducing himself incorrectly, washing his hands too early in the morning, or having the top button on his prison uniform undone”, said The Washington Post. He is now serving his “13th stint in solitary confinement in a small, stuffy punishment cell”, with just a book and a cup, and an hour’s exercise a day in a small yard.\n\nWhile in confinement, the opposition leader has “suffered acute stomach pains and seizures”, the paper continued, and lost more than 17lbs (7.7kg) in just over two weeks. His lawyer has “demanded toxicological and other medical tests”, and complained to the authorities, after the doctor who treated Navalny reportedly “gave no diagnosis and told him that everyone has health issues during spring”.\n\nRuslan Shaveddinov, a member of Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation, told the Financial Times last week that “it’s a sort of slow and methodical murder, happening in front of our eyes right now”. Navalny’s press secretary, Kira Yarmysh, told Reuters that the team “couldn’t rule out” the possibility of incremental poisoning.\n\nThis “might sound like paranoia”, Shaveddinov told The Guardian, “but after the novichok poisoning, it seems completely plausible”.\n\nIt is “hard to adduce an innocent explanation for a mysterious ailment” afflicting Navalny, said The Times’s leading article today. The Kremlin “must be held accountable” for his safety, and “Western governments should demand it”.\n\nWhat next?\n\n“To be a dissident, or even merely a dogged journalist, in Russia requires raw courage,” said The Times. Many have died in violent, unexplained circumstances, including reporter Anna Politkovskaya, who was “gunned down” in 2006, and Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer killed in police custody in 2009.\n\nBeyond Russian borders, former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko was murdered with polonium in London in 2006. Former Russian intelligence officer-turned-UK double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter ,Yulia, survived a novichok assassination attempt in Salisbury in 2018.\n\nAnd today another opposition activist, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was sentenced to 25 years in jail for charges linked to his criticism of the Ukraine war. It is “the longest sentence an opposition figure has received so far”, said the BBC Kathryn Armstrong. Kara-Murza, who denied all the charges against him, reportedly told the closed court that “his trial reminded him of a Stalin-era show trial of the 1930s”.\n\nAmid mounting concern about Navalny, The Times warned that even if he was not being deliberately poisoned, his life was in danger from the conditions of his imprisonment. He is “a prisoner of conscience being targeted by a rogue regime” willing to torture and murder those who oppose it.\n\nYet his “fate risks being overlooked” while Western countries focus on supporting Ukraine, the paper added. Relations between Russia and the West are “already at a nadir short of outright hostilities”, which is “entirely Mr Putin’s handiwork, and no good will come from tempering outrage at his treatment of a brave critic”.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Elliott Goat", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/16/what-to-know-about-alexei-navalny-in-prison-his-family/72626411007/", "title": "Who was Alexei Navalny and why was he in Russian prison?

He was serving a 19 year sentence when he died.\n\nNavalny had just returned to Russia when he was arrested three years ago. Before that, he was in Germany being treated for poisoning.\n\nAn attempt on his life he blamed on Putin, Navalny had been poisoned with a nerve agent during a work trip to Siberia.\n\nWhat had Navalny said about Putin?\n\nNavalny emerged as one of Putin's most outspoken opponents. Amid protests in 2011, Navalny famously labeled the ruling Russian party one of \"crooks and thieves.\"\n\nHe continued speaking out against Putin in his campaign for mayor of Moscow in 2013 against a Kremlin-back incumbent.\n\nNavalny was also critical of Russia's war with Ukraine, telling a Moscow appeal court in 2022, \"This is a stupid war which your Putin started ... This war was built on lies.\"\n\n\"One madman has got his claws into Ukraine and I do not know what he wants to do with it - this crazy thief,\" Navalny said at the time.\n\nDoes Alexei Navalny have a family?\n\nNavalny is survived by his wife and two children.\n\nNavalny married his wife, Yulia, in 2000. The pair have a daughter, Daria, and son, Zahar.\n\nWhat has Trump said about Navalny?\n\nDespite international outcry at the time, then President Donald Trump declined to condemn Russia for Navalny's poisoning in 2020.\n\n\"It's tragic. It's terrible, it shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet, but I will take a look,\" Trump said about the incident in a news conference at the time.\n\nThe former president's 2024 Republican opponent Nikki Haley responded to Navalny's death Friday, writing on X, formerly Twitter, \"Putin did this.

The Ivy League graduate was then transported and formally charged with federal murder and stalking crimes in a Manhattan courtroom, alongside state murder and terrorism charges previously announced by New York prosecutors.\n\nThe highly publicized escort has garnered mixed reactions on social media and rekindled the debate about staging so-called \"perp walks.\" Experts told USA TODAY that the striking display was likely motivated by authorities attempting to make a statement.\n\n\"Obviously, the practice is highly controversial because it can be very prejudicial to see someone walking around with handcuffs behind their back and surrounded by a cadre of police officers, kind of insinuating that this person is already guilty, already highly dangerous,\" said Jorge Camacho, policy director for the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School, and a clinical lecturer on law.\n\nAfter his arrest, Mangione has received a following online among some people expressing anger at what they view as greedy corporations and health care insurance companies. Whether the publicity of his appearance will fuel or stunt that sentiment remains to be seen, according to Camacho.\n\nSwell of fanfare may have motivated staging, experts say\n\nRobert Weisberg, a law professor at Stanford University and faculty co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, said the so-called \"perp walk\" has little to do with the legal system and is a part of American political theater. He added that it is often simpler, and safer, to transport defendants without parading them in public.\n\n\"This one looks particularly staged,\" Weisberg said, referring to the publicized appearance of Mangione's arrival in New York. \"The orchestration of it is almost too transparent.\"\n\nFollowing the swarm of internet fanfare after Mangione's arrest, the perp walk may have been a \"well-intentioned effort to make him not look like a martyr,\" Weisberg said, adding that it could backfire by highlighting his image in the public sphere even further.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment. The mayor's office and NYPD did not immediately return USA TODAY's requests for comment.\n\nMayor makes unusual appearance in Mangione’s return to NYC\n\nIn a rare move, New York City Mayor Eric Adams joined officials in escorting Mangione, walking a few paces behind the suspect.\n\n“This act of terrorism and the violence that stems from it is something that will not be tolerated in the city,” Adams told reporters after the escort, with NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch beside him. “We wanted to personally be here to show the symbolism of leading from the front.”\n\nAdams’ appearance comes as he and a former staffer face legal challenges. On Thursday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the indictment of Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide to Adams, on bribery charges.\n\nIn September, Adams was indicted on unrelated federal corruption charges, which he denies. Weisberg told USA TODAY the mayor's intentions for the perp walk appear \"pretty straightforward,\" given the legal difficulties.\n\n\"Mayor Adams needs good publicity, that's for sure,\" Weisberg said.\n\n'Part of the kind of dramaturgy of American government'\n\nEarlier in the day, a long line formed outside the Pennsylvania courthouse ahead of the initial morning hearings, some of whom gathered to express support for Mangione.\n\n\"We feel his anger, his frustration,\" said Andrea Aye, who noted she traveled to the courthouse from northern Ohio. \"It has definitely woke people up. We hear him.\"\n\nThe demonstrations outside the courthouse are what one would expect in a big case, Weisberg said, noting the nation's long history of such rallies both for and against defendants.\n\n\"This is just part of the kind of dramaturgy of American government and American society in some ways,\" he added.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Claire Thornton, and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; Judy D.J.

Al Sharpton, a Democratic kingmaker, told USA TODAY. “That’s garbage.”\n\nThe embattled mayor claims he's a victim of federal payback for complaining about the financial strain of absorbing 210,000 asylum seekers from the southern border.\n\nSix Democrats – current and former elected officials, consultants and party leaders – said they worry the mayor’s allegations could hurt Harris in battleground states by bringing more attention to immigration, a subject on which former President Donald Trump handily leads the vice president in polls.\n\nMore:Eric Adams and the missing password: Feds say NYC mayor locked phone before FBI seized it\n\nAnd, with Trump now boosting Adams' claims of White House persecution, politicos are concerned the mayor could spoil the Democrats' chances of retaking the House of Representatives by refusing to resign, becoming a poster boy for misgovernance five weeks before Election Day.\n\nRepublicans currently have an eight-seat majority in the House, with three vacancies in Democratic districts. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would become the first Black speaker if Democrats prevail.\n\nThe Adams mess has Democrats “worried about House seats in suburban districts” outside the city, said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime New York political consultant.\n\nFlanked by clergy and local civil rights figures – but no Democratic elected leaders – at a press conference after his indictment was unsealed Thursday, Adams said: “I think we need to ask the federal prosecutors who gave the directive or the order.”\n\n“I don't know,” he said. “You should ask them who gave the directive.”\n\nDonald Trump weighs in\n\nRushing to Adams’ defense – and amplifying his statements – was former president Donald Trump, who claimed to have predicted the charges.\n\n“I said, 'You know what? He'll be indicted within a year,'” Trump told reporters. “And I was exactly right.”\n\nSharpton said he will meet mid-week with his fellow New Yorkers, Minority Leader Jeffries of Brooklyn and Rep. Gregory Meeks of Queens, to discuss the Adams imbroglio.\n\n“It does not speak well of him that Trump is complimenting him,” Sharpton said of his troubled ally.\n\n'It's in Sharpton's hands'\n\nAdams and Sharpton have had a long relationship. Adams served an early board member at the Democratic mainstay's civil rights organization, the National Action Network, and was baptized by Sharpton last March in a ceremony at the Rikers Island jail complex.\n\nAdams performed security work for Sharpton in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"If he said resign, I just don't think there's anything Adams could do but step down,\" said Ron Howell, author of \"King Al,\" a political biography of Sharpton.\n\n\"I guess you could say it's in Sharpton's hands,\" he added.\n\nA spokesman said Jeffries \"is not scheduled to meet with other elected officials to discuss the mayoralty.” Sharpton is not an elected official. Meeks' office didn't reply to a request for comment.\n\nA 'weaponized' scandal\n\nFederal investigators are also probing Adams’ inner circle, including a former police commissioner, two deputy mayors, the schools chancellor and, in a separate matter, the city's interim police commissioner.\n\nThe office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has also joined the investigation, seizing the phone of top City Hall aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin on Friday as she got off a flight from Japan.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul has the power to remove Adams, but Sharpton and others have warned her against that politically fraught step.\n\n\"There is a fear that this corruption stuff will be used against them in Congressional and Senate races,\" said George Arzt, a veteran New York political consultant.\n\nBetween the Adams indictment and the federal corruption conviction of former Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Republicans have a ready-made attack ad, Arzt said.\n\n\"Trump is backing Eric now, but it's going to be used against Democrats,\" he added.\n\n\"I see it as a concern if it's weaponized,\" Sharpton said.\n\nMore:New York City Mayor Eric Adams pleads not guilty in federal court to corruption charges\n\nThe cloud over Adams, coupled with any new indictments, could turn uncommitted New York voters against Democratic candidates, several political operatives said. The party is fighting to pick up four seats it unexpectedly lost to Republicans in 2022.\n\n\"Whenever there's a scandal on one side of the aisle or the other, that party tends to lose independent or swing voters,\" said Robert Hornak, former executive director of the Queens Republican party.\n\n'He can't function'\n\nPressure is building for Adams to quit, several Democrats said, in part because city government is paralyzed by the overlapping federal investigations.\n\n“He is presumed innocent,” State Sen. Liz Krueger told USA TODAY. But “he can’t be mayor. He can’t function and his people can’t function.”\n\nThe mayor said Thursday the swarm of investigations wouldn't affect the city's operations.\n\nAdams is charged with accepting illegal foreign campaign donations and free travel from Turkey and of defrauding the city's public campaign finance system of $10 million.

This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday New York's mayor has been indicted on federal criminal charges. Plus, we have the latest on Hurricane Helene and we discuss what Zelensky is pushing for when it comes to long-range missiles for Ukraine.\n\n♦\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted on federal criminal charges according to multiple reports, after authorities raided the homes of his top aides and confidants earlier this month, in what appeared to be part of a major corruption investigation. The charges against Adams were unclear as the indictment remained sealed last night, the New York Times and Fox News reported, both citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The indictment is likely to be unsealed today when Adams may appear in court, according to the Times. Adams, in a video statement released yesterday, called the charges entirely false. The mayor's administration has been under federal scrutiny over the last year for a separate probe on possible illegal foreign donations from Turkish officials during Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign. The Times previously reported on Monday that federal prosecutors submitted grand jury subpoenas to City Hall, Adams, and his campaign in July, demanding information related to Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea, and Uzbekistan. In recent weeks, other top city officials have resigned amid multiple federal corruption investigations. Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned on September 12, a week after investigators from the US Attorney's office in Manhattan seized his mobile phones. Caban was among several of the mayor's aides and confidants who received federal search warrants earlier this month.\n\nHurricane Helene is predicted to reach Florida as a category four this evening. The storm reached hurricane status yesterday and was forecast to grow more powerful and dangerous before making landfall on the state's Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center warns that a catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along parts of Florida's Big Bend Coast, and the center said the storm's speed will likely allow it to penetrate inland across the southeast. Several Florida airports have closed today, including Tampa International, and several universities have canceled classes.\n\nYou can stay up on all the latest today and through the rest of the week with usatoday.com.\n\n♦\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is pressing Western allies for permission this week at the United Nations General Assembly to use US guided weapons to strike deep inside Russia. I spoke with USA TODAY Pentagon correspondent Tom Vanden Brook about what that might mean for the conflict in Ukraine, Russia, and beyond. Howdy, Tom, how are you today?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nTaylor, I'm good. Good to be here. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for helping on The Excerpt. So what exactly, Tom, is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushing for this week at the United Nations General Assembly?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nHe's looking for permission to use missiles with a far longer range than he currently has so that he can strike deep inside Russia to help prevent some of these attacks that are devastating Ukrainian infrastructure in residential neighborhoods.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, really, how would this functionally shift Ukraine's strategy on the battlefield, Tom?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, it would allow Ukraine to hit deep inside Russia, which is a concern for Western allies because it's another of the red lines that Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn saying that if it's crossed, that it'll drag NATO nations into the war in Ukraine. So that's part of this issue with a big part of the consideration for Western allies, in particular the Biden administration.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo we'll talk about the US part of this equation in a second, but have we seen Ukraine push deeper into Russia previously during this conflict, send long-range missiles, and if so, how did that go?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nNot Western-supplied missiles, Taylor, they don't have the range currently with Western missiles to hit deep inside Russia. They can do it with their own home-built drones, but there are restrictions in what the US has put on weapons that it is sending to Ukraine as how far they can hit inside Russia, right along the border right now. And Western allies like Great Britain and France want to allow some of their weapons to go in deeper as well. But those weapons have guidance systems on them that are US-designed and made, and unless the US provides permission for that, they can't use those missiles for deep strikes as well.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nOn the US side of things, Tom, what are the calculations really for the Biden administration and the Pentagon on this decision?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nThere are a few different things. The main one obviously is that this would cross a red line and prompt Vladimir Putin to attack a NATO ally, and an attack on a NATO ally is an attack on all of them. So it could draw the US and the West into a much broader war that nobody wants to see. Secondarily to that, there just aren't that many of these missiles in US stockpiles. Number one, to make a difference on the battlefield for the Ukrainians, and then as well, we just can't draw down the stocks that we have here so that they're available for other contingencies, say in Taiwan, for instance. So those are some of the considerations that the White House and the Pentagon are considering right now.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd I think we're at what, two and a half years of this war at this point? What could be the broader downstream impacts going into next year and beyond of this decision for Ukraine and Russia and also, Tom, the United States?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, the hope if you're on the Ukrainian side is that this would be enough to prompt Russia to enter into negotiations that would allow Ukraine to recover some of the ground that it's lost to Russia. About 20% of Ukraine is now occupied by Russian troops. At the moment, it's a war of attrition, and the time is on Russia's side. If those missiles start striking deeper inside Russia, a senior US official told me, there would be a consideration perhaps on Putin's part to want to negotiate further because it would be bringing this war home to Russian citizens who haven't really seen it so far.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Tom Vanden Brook covers the Pentagon for USA TODAY. Thank you, Tom.\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nThanks, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe US, France, and several allies called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border, while also expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza after discussions at the United Nations yesterday. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has expressed hope that a ceasefire can be reached soon to end fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, but fighting continues. Israeli airstrikes overnight hit some 75 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including weapon storage facilities, the Israeli military said. In the latest deadly strike, at least 23 Syrians were killed when Israel hit a three-story building in the Lebanese town of Younine, the town's mayor told Reuters. Dozens of projectiles were fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted with the rest falling on open ground, said the Israeli military.\n\n♦\n\nUS officials and lawmakers yesterday said that Iran is trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump, as well as members of his former administration, and the current Biden administration, as payback for the killing of an Iranian general and other hardline policies. The comments came after Trump's disclosure earlier this week that he had been briefed by the office of the Director of National Intelligence about Iran's real and specific threats against him. Republican Senator Mike Rounds, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he hadn't seen any indication Iran had anything to do with two alleged assassination attempts against Trump. But he said he thinks there's clear evidence that Iran, \"Has made it clear that they intend to. If they could, they would try to assassinate the former president.\" Iran has denied trying to assassinate US officials, but the Justice Department has launched numerous investigations and prosecutions into such efforts, including into plots against former Trump National Security Adviser, John Bolton. US officials have been issuing public warnings about Iran's desire for vengeance since shortly after General Qasem Soleimani was killed.\n\n♦\n\nSeveral key election officials say they're prepared to certify 2024 presidential election results if county governments go rogue. I spoke with USA TODAY democracy reporter Erin Mansfield for more. Erin, thanks for hopping on today.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Erin, what do election officials say in these swing states about potentially suing counties over refusing to certify election results?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nIt has become a trend since 2020 that a lot of local officials, usually at the county level, will go rogue and decide that they don't want to approve election results for reasons that really aren't relevant to whether or not that vote should be certified or approved. And we've seen cases in other states where election officials have sued, for example, a Secretary of State suing a county saying, \"No, you have to do this.\" So I spoke with election officials in most of the swing states last week. The ones in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin generally said that they were prepared to sue a county that decided to stand in the way of election results.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you touched on this a bit Erin, but what really led up to this point? Why do officials say this might be necessary?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nSo what we've seen since 2020, that was the election that former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed was stolen from him, but we know factually President Joe Biden won. We have seen people, usually at the county level, who are supposed to do a very administrative task where they just sign off on election results, essentially comparing one column to another, making sure the numbers match. But what they have decided to do, and these arguments are often based in some sort of misinformation about the 2020 election, the one that Donald Trump talks about quite a bit. They say, \"No, we're not going to certify these.\" And it's an outgrowth of what happened on January 6th, 2021 when folks showed up to the capitol, some violently, trying to stop the certification of an election, or change it to be certified for another candidate, the one who lost. So what's happening is this battle has not actually ended, it's just moved down to the local level, it's in people's backyards.\n\nAnd so what states are saying is, \"Well, counties have to do what they're told. They don't get to just decide whether or not an election was valid based on some thoughts about maybe a voter role, or some guidance they didn't like from the state, that's not their place.\" So what's happening, and what has happened before, is states will bring counties to court so that the court can say, \"You have to do your job.\" Certifications will start November 6th, that's the day after the election. So it's something I'm keeping my eye on and it sounds like other people are keeping their eye on too. And they did confirm in several of these states that they will take someone to court if they have to make sure that the legitimate election is upheld.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you mentioned in the piece, Erin, lawsuits are not the only potential remedy here. What other options do state election officials have to ensure election results are certified properly?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nSo in Michigan, for example, the state can actually step in and certify if the county won't. So they don't even have to go to court, they just do it. That's actually true in Colorado as well, not a swing state, but a state that we've seen a similar movement related to fighting election certification. North Carolina has a different remedy, and in 2023, last year, the State Board of Elections actually stepped in and removed two members from a local board of elections, that was in Surrey County. So that's just a different remedy from the process that they were talking about in Pennsylvania and Arizona. But this was a question we wanted to ask up front to know what we might be able to expect. In Georgia, Secretary of State Raffensperger, he said that might not be necessary to actually engage with a county that doesn't certify, but he did say, \"At the end of the day, we'll make sure every county follows the law and follows the constitution.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin Mansfield covers democracy for USA TODAY. Thank you, Erin.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThere have now been not one but two assassination attempts on Donald Trump. Both candidates now speak behind bulletproof glass at outdoor events, and after falsely claiming that Haitian immigrants are eating pet dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, shooting and bomb threats have skyrocketed. Is incendiary campaign rhetoric to blame, or is political violence just the new normal here in America? Tune in right here after 4 P.M.

For the latest news, view our story for Thursday, Aug. 8.\n\nTropical Storm Debby made landfall in South Carolina early Thursday, prompting fears of flash flooding in areas already soaked by the slow-moving weather system.\n\nAccording to a 2 a.m. ET update from the National Hurricane Center, Debby made landfall near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm, located 20 miles southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and 65 miles south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, was moving northwest at 5 mph, with maximum sustained winds up to 50 mph.\n\nDebby has drenched parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina in over a foot of rain and could drop up to 50 trillion gallons of rainwater along its path, according to one estimate. The flash floods Debby caused forced evacuations, overwhelmed drainage systems and breached multiple dams in Georgia.\n\nAt least six deaths have been tied to the storm. The sixth one was confirmed Tuesday after police in Gulfport, Florida, found the body of a boater who had been missing, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nAfter pushing off the coast of Georgia on Tuesday, Debby is projected to pick up wind speed before moving ashore along the central coast of South Carolina on Wednesday night or early Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Debby could dump an additional 3 to 9 inches of rainfall − and local amounts could range as high as 25 inches in South Carolina and 15 inches in southeast North Carolina through Friday.\n\n\"People should be prepared to seek higher ground and to know of an evacuation route and have a plan in place,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said.\n\nSome Mid-Atlantic cities began to feel Debby's effects Tuesday as the system's tropical moisture interacted with a cold front, spawning early storms. New York City, Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, were soaked in several inches of rain, and there were reports of flooding in low-lying areas.\n\nLate Wednesday, swaths of eastern North Carolina were under flash flood warnings after receiving 4 to 6 inches of rain with more on the way. Brunswick County Schools, which serves about 13,000 students in the southernmost part of North Carolina, announced it would be closed on Thursday due to flooded roads and anticipated heavy rain overnight, though one high school would operate remotely.\n\nResidents in northeastern South Carolina were also under flash flood warnings late Wednesday as the National Weather Service warned up to six more inches of rain could damage roadways after some areas had already seen 2 to 4 inches.\n\nDebby is predicted to combine with a frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic on Friday and then gain speed and push through the Northeast, dumping more rain across the region and causing \"considerable flash and urban flooding as well as river flooding,\" according to the weather service.\n\nWeather alerts via text: Sign-up to get updates about current storms and weather events by location.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎New York City sent out drones to alert residents of low-lying areas about the possibility of flooding Tuesday, but the announcements made in Spanish − spoken at home by about one-quarter of New Yorkers − were barely understandable, The Associated Press reported. City officials apologized.\n\n∎The National Weather Service office in Charleston, South Carolina, has confirmed four tornado touchdowns: In Moncks Corner, Edisto Beach, Kiawah Island and Lady's Island.\n\n∎Flash and river flooding is expected through Aug. 15 from South Carolina up to south-central Virginia, according to the National Water Center, which said flooding is also forecast or already happening in the Suwannee and Tampa River basins in Florida up through the Georgia coastal plain.\n\n∎ The federal Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in Georgia and South Carolina on Wednesday, a day after issuing a similar declaration in Florida.\n\n∎ The Canoochee River, about 50 miles west of Savannah, Georgia, broke a 99-year-old record Wednesday when it reached 18 feet, slightly above the previous mark of 17.8 set in 1925, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n'Cats swimming through' flooded Charleston street\n\nBarbara Zeller, 54, is lucky to be an Olympics enthusiast. The flooding triggered by Debby trapped her in her Charleston home for days, so she spent large parts of them watching the Paris Games.\n\n\"You're basically in prison,\" said Zeller, who moved to the area about five years ago after living in New York City for two decades.\n\nBy Wednesday, the rain was still coming down in Zeller's neighborhood near the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, which connects Charleston and the town of Mount Pleasant. Still, it was far less than the consistent downpour from Monday and Tuesday, she said.\n\nOn her flooded street, \"the water is thigh-high, almost to my waist,\" Zeller said. \"I've seen cats swimming through, because there's no other way around it.\"\n\nZeller moved her vehicle to a parking garage at higher elevation that the city opened ahead of the storm. \"Everywhere below me, including my own parking garage, floods very, very badly,\" she said.\n\nTropical wave unlikely to develop\n\nAnother tropical system that had concerned forecasters earlier in the week appears to be less of a threat to develop into a named storm, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday. The center is now giving the system only a 10% chance of development within the next seven days.\n\n\"Disorganized showers and thunderstorms located over the southwestern Caribbean Sea are associated with a tropical wave,\" the center said. Although a portion of the wave could reach the southwestern Gulf of Mexico over the weekend, \"any development of this system should be slow to occur,\" the center said.\n\nEven if it doesn't develop, the system will still dump heavy rain across portions of Central America and Mexico over the next few days, Weather.com reported. If its sustained winds reach 39 mph, which is not expected, the wave would become a named tropical storm. The next name on the storm list is Ernesto.\n\nNortheast storms related to Tropical Storm Debby\n\nThe heavy rain and severe thunderstorms that walloped the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday were indirectly related to Tropical Storm Debby, meteorologist Rick Otto of the Weather Prediction Center told USA TODAY. And more is on the way, even before Debby moves in later in the week.\n\nOtto said that while the main impacts from Debby have been in the Southeast, a plume of moisture from the tropical storm interacted with other weather systems such as a cold front to produce torrential rain and flooding in cities Tuesday such as New York, Philadelphia and Newark, wreaking travel havoc.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said there were dozens of reports of severe weather, mainly from strong wind gusts, from Ohio through Pennsylvania and New Jersey on Tuesday. More than 330,000 homes and businesses in northeast Ohio were out of power early Wednesday afternoon, the majority in Cuyahoga County, home to Cleveland.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, there will be additional episodes of flooding downpours and severe thunderstorms with strong wind gusts into Wednesday night from portions of the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic to New England.\n\nNorth Carolina counties, towns issue voluntary evacuations\n\nLocal officials in North Carolina have issued voluntary evacuation orders for low-lying and coastal areas as the effects of Tropical Storm Debby began to intensify.\n\nMultiple counties and beach communities, including North Carolina's Brunswick County and Ocean Isle Beach, near the South Carolina border, have urged residents to evacuate, citing heavy rains and dangerous storm surge.\n\n“Don’t take this storm for granted simply because it is labeled a tropical storm − there will be severe weather impacts throughout the week,\" Randy Thompson, chairman of the Brunswick County Board of Commissioners, said in a news release.\n\n\"Due to the high probability of life-threatening flood waters on the coast and inland over the next few days, visitors should carefully consider evacuating,\" said a statement posted Wednesday by officials in Ocean Isle Beach.\n\nFrom Folly Beach, South Carolina, to the coasts of North Carolina's Ocracoke Inlet, storm surge from Debby could reach 1-3 feet if it coincides with peak high tide, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby's latest rainfall totals\n\nSince Monday, Debby has inundated the Southeast with torrential rain, causing widespread flooding from Florida to North Carolina. Below are some of the highest rainfall totals recorded so far, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nFlorida:\n\nRuskin: 21.7 inches\n\nPalm Harbor: 20.34 inches\n\nParrish: 18.86 inches\n\nSarasota: 17.78 inches\n\nPinellas Park: 14.04 inches\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nGreen Pond: 16.55 inches\n\nEdisto Beach: 13.90 inches\n\nBeaufort: 12.74 inches\n\nBennetts Point: 12.50 inches\n\nHardeeville: 12.15 inches\n\nGeorgia:\n\nRincon: 13.29 inches\n\nRocky Ford: 12.89 inches\n\nBelville: 12.00 inches\n\nSpringfield: 11.43 inches\n\nSavannah: 10.40 inches\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nCalabash: 5.17 inches\n\nSunset Harbor: 5.09 inches\n\nShallotte: 4.87 inches\n\nHolden Beach: 4.32 inches\n\nBolivia: 4.06 inches\n\nDebby is worst storm in Georgia resident's recent memory\n\nWhen Glenn De Vecchis tried to leave his house in east-central Georgia on Wednesday morning after Tropical Storm Debby left the area, the state of the roads left him \"really scared.\" The storm scattered some branches across the roads, and deep puddles in several places blocked his vision.\n\n\"When I hit those big, giant puddles, I couldn't see anything,\" Vecchis, 69, told USA TODAY. \"I was lucky I stayed on the road because I was wobbling all over the place.\"\n\nThe storm lashed De Vecchis' home in Metter, about 65 miles west of Savannah, with rain for three days – \"morning, noon and night, without stopping,\" he said. The retired business owner said his house was set up high enough to avoid the floodwaters and sturdy enough to withstand the winds.\n\nThe last serious storm to pass through was 15 years ago, he said, but \"this is the worst I have seen.\"\n\nStreets flood, dams breached in Georgia\n\nThe record-breaking rainfall from Debby caused the breach of several dams in northern Georgia and led to evacuations downstream from a vulnerable dam in South Carolina.\n\nThe National Weather Service reported Thursday afternoon that officials in Bulloch County, Georgia, are warning about the imminent failure of the Cypress Lake Dam, about 50 miles northwest of Savannah. If the dam breaks, the weather service said flooding will occur in portions of neighborhoods immediately downstream and then flow onto U.S. Highway 301. Residents in low-lying areas below the dam were advised to move to higher ground immediately.\n\nHours after dams at Simmons Pond burst, the dam at Oglesby Pond was breached, according to Bulloch County Public Safety, which warned that rushing water would cross a nearby highway and wash into neighboring ponds and lakes.\n\nMeanwhile, in Colleton County, South Carolina, local officials warned Tuesday afternoon that the McGrady Dam had \"the potential to fail\" and issued evacuation notices to residents downstream. Hours later, the county's fire rescue department said there was \"substantial flooding in the area of the dam and creek,\" but that the structure was holding.\n\nDebby pulls down power lines, scatters debris in Savannah\n\nAs Debby moved over Savannah, Georgia, Michael Kavanaugh watched rain pour down for more than 48 hours, flooding the streets of his home community of Wilmington Island, around 10 miles east of the city's downtown. Although he didn't see widespread destruction and only a few nearby trees were downed, the storm still left a mark, said Kavanaugh, 67.\n\n\"There's a lot of debris all over,\" he said. \"A couple of power lines were drooping on the ground.\"\n\nThe storm prompted Kavanaugh, the pastor of Saint Peter the Apostle Catholic Parish, to close down the church's school Monday and Tuesday. Other areas of Savannah, like the historic downtown neighborhood of Ardsley Park where Kavanaugh grew up, would likely experience longer inconveniences from the flooding, he said.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Kavanaugh walked out of his office and noticed the storm clouds had broken. \"I saw blue skies for the first time since I don't know when,\" he said.\n\nCharleston lifts citywide curfew as Debby churns offshore\n\nThe city of Charleston on Wednesday lifted a curfew that had been in place since Monday night when Debby first began inundating South Carolina with torrential rain.\n\n\"After assessing overnight conditions, officials have determined that it is safe to return to normal activities,\" the statement said, adding that main thoroughfares in and out of the city have been reopened. \"Thanks to the curfew, Charleston Police and Fire Departments did not need to perform any rescues during the (storm).\"\n\nDowntown Charleston received 3.56 inches of rain Tuesday, breaking the previous record of 3.46 that was set in 1992, according to the National Weather Service. Surrounding areas in Charleston County were drenched in up to 10.5 inches of rain since Monday.\n\n\"Expect long term river flooding to inhibit recovery efforts at least into next week, possibly beyond,\" the weather service office in Charleston said on X.\n\nCharleston Mayor William Cogswell said in a statement that the city \"will remain vigilant as Debby lingers nearby, but for now we are just grateful for everyone doing their part.\"\n\nNearly 21,000 without power in Florida amid heat advisories\n\nTwo days after Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, swaths of northern Florida were still without power Wednesday afternoon as intense heat baked parts of the southern U.S.\n\nAcross the Big Bend region, almost 21,000 homes and businesses were in the dark, according to Poweroutage.us. At its peak, more than 250,000 utility customers had no power as the storm's winds knocked down utility poles and uprooted trees.\n\nHeat advisories were active across the Big Bend as well as South Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. In northern Florida, heat index temperatures were expected to reach 109 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, which urged people to stay out of the sun and seek air conditioning.\n\nContributing: Charles Ventura and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Sherry Jones, Renee Spencer, Gareth McGrath, Owen Hassell, Wilmington Star-News; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/05/hurricane-debby-live-updates/74666168007/", "title": "Debby updates: Deadly storm slams Florida with rain, powerful winds", "text": "CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS: This article has been updated to reflect that a 12-year-old girl died in a Sunday vehicle crash, according to a corrected Florida Highway Patrol news release.\n\nEditor's Note: This page is a summary of news about Tropical Storm Debby for Monday, Aug. 5. For the latest on the storm, view USA TODAY's live updates for Tuesday, Aug. 6.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Debby, now a tropical storm, roared ashore Monday along the Big Bend coast of Florida, killing at least four people, flooding streets, and causing widespread power outages as the storm roared toward Georgia and South Carolina, where it's expected to bring catastrophic flooding this week.\n\n\"Tornadoes, catastrophic flash and urban flooding, coastal flooding, rip currents, strong gusty winds are all expected,'' in parts of the Southeast over the next several days, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAn apparent tornado touched down on Edisto Beach, South Carolina after 9:30 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service in Charleston. There were multiple reports of structures damaged on Edisto Beach and across the river from Edisto Island from the radar-confirmed tornado, the weather service said.\n\nOther popular beach destinations, including Kiawah Island and Johns Island, were being warned of possible tornado activity as additional severe storms moved onshore.\n\nDebby, the fourth named storm of what is predicted to be a historic hurricane season, made landfall Monday at 7 a.m. near the coastal town of Steinhatchee as a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Steinhatchee, about 70 miles west of Gainesville and home to some 500 people, is just 10 miles from where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year.\n\nAfter more than three hours moving across northern Florida, Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. ET update. By 11 p.m., the winds had diminished to 45 mph, though the storm was still dropping copious amounts of rain.\n\nState officials reported widespread flooding and inundating storm surge as Debby moved inland. The storm's winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, knocking out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses throughout northern Florida. Forecasters said Debby's powerful winds could also spawn tornadoes, and storm surge could reach 10 feet in some areas.\n\n\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden declared an emergency across Florida, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard were activated to support humanitarian assistance and search-and-rescue missions.\n\nBreaking news, in-depth analysis: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing for news you need to know now.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her campaign rally scheduled for Friday in Savannah, Georgia, because of the expected deluge there, campaign officials said.\n\n∎ The storm surge produced by Debby brought 25 packages of cocaine with a street value of more than $1 million to a Florida beach, where a passer-by noticed them and alerted authorities, a Border Patrol official posted on the X platform.\n\n∎ The National Hurricane Center recorded a 98 mph wind gust near Horseshoe Beach, according to the Florida Severe Weather Network, a collection of state-run weather stations.\n\n∎ The National Water Prediction Service projected major flooding in three locations on the Santa Fe River and a location on the Suwannee River in north Florida.\n\n∎ Debby wreaked havoc on travel. More than 1,700 flights had been canceled and upwards of 5,800 were delayed Monday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration said all flights at Orlando International Airport have been grounded while airports in Tallahassee and Gainesville were closed.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the Southeast coast\n\nDebby is projected to move slowly across northern Florida before unleashing \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" across the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10-20 inches are expected from northern Florida to southeastern North Carolina, while parts of northern Georgia and South Carolina, including Charleston, could get upward of 30 inches of rain through this weekend, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a YouTube livestream.\n\nDebby is expected to head into the Atlantic Ocean by late Tuesday night, then regain strength for a day or two before soaking the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, whose governors have already declared states of emergency as they urge residents to prepare.\n\nNorth Carolina and the mid-Atlantic will start getting heavy rain by midweek, the prediction center said, and tropical storm effects could be felt as far north as southern New England late in the week, AccuWeather reported.\n\nDeath toll up to four after truck driver is killed\n\nAt least four storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida.\n\nThe driver of a semi-truck was killed overnight near Temple Terrace after losing control of his vehicle on a wet Interstate 75 northeast of Tampa, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nThe three previously reported deaths linked to the storm included a woman and a 12-year-old girl killed in a car crash and a teenage boy killed when a tree fell on a mobile home.\n\nThe truck driver, a 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi, lost control of the truck at around 2:30 a.m., Sgt. Steve Gaskins, a public affairs officer with the Florida Highway Patrol, said in a news release. The truck rotated on the wet highway, collided with a concrete barrier and went over the wall, coming to rest hanging over a bridge. Gaskins said the cab came loose from the trailer and fell into a deep canal below.\n\nDivers from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office responded shortly afterward and found the deceased driver still inside the cab underwater in the canal, according to an X post by the Sheriff’s office.\n\nLt. Scott Tummond, a spokesperson for the Levy County Sheriff's Office, told USA TODAY on Monday that more trees could fall after torrential downpours soaked the ground, posing a threat to residents on the road at night.\n\n\"If you're moving around after dark, you might not see it until it's too late, especially if you're driving,\" he warned.\n\nFallen tree kills 13-year-old amid Hurricane Debby\n\nA 13-year-old boy was killed as Hurricane Debby made landfall along the Florida coast Monday morning, the Levy County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\n\nDeputies responded to a report of a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home around 8 a.m. in Fanning Springs, about 35 miles east from where the hurricane came ashore. The boy who died was \"crushed inside the home,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,” the sheriff’s office said, urging people to be careful as they begin to assess the storm damage. “Downed power lines and falling trees are among the many hazards. One life is too many. Please be safe.”\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\n\nRisk of tornadoes\n\nWith the center of Debby about 35 miles west of Brunswick, Georgia at 11 p.m. Monday, the Storm Prediction Center said a risk of tornadoes continued in the storm’s northeast quadrant, along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nThe center said it would likely extend a tornado watch for at least some of the 13 counties in the region beyond the scheduled 1 a.m. expiration. In addition to the earlier tornado on Edisto Island, the weather service said it had confirmed a tornado on radar on Kiawah Island around 11 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina town under curfew ahead of storm\n\nAuthorities in Charleston, South Carolina, issued a curfew from 11 p.m. Monday through noon Tuesday ahead of what forecasters warn could be a calamitous storm.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Sunday as Tropical Storm Debby readied to hit South Carolina’s coast this week. The center will move offshore late Tuesday and Wednesday and approach the coast on Thursday.\n\nThe governor said that as of Monday, he does not anticipate needing to issue any evacuation orders or order the closure of state facilities or agencies. John Quagliariello, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the state would likely see \"historic rainfall\" that would result in \"catastrophic\" flash flooding.\n\n\"It's very likely that some areas that have never flooded in the past will be impacted this time,\" Quagliariello said.\n\n– Savannah Moss, Greenville News\n\nTown still recovering from Idalia gets walloped by Hurricane Debby\n\nDonna Luce lost power at 6 a.m. Monday and said rain came down for hours as the storm approached and eventually made landfall. Her home’s rain gauge showed 7 inches of rain fell Sunday alone, she said.\n\n“It is still raining pretty hard and we expect to get that most of the day, kind of like it’s sitting right here on top of us,” Luce told USA TODAY on Monday morning.\n\nMany fellow residents in Mayo, a small town about 30 miles north of where Debby came ashore, have spent the past year recovering from Hurricane Idalia, said Luce, 65.\n\n“Most people had just gotten their roofs repaired, and had gotten back up on their feet,” she said, adding that several of her neighbors still had tarps on their roofs this summer. “Now it’s hitting us again one year later and we are a little discouraged.\"\n\n– Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nFlooding from Hurricane Debby could last 5-10 days\n\nThe widespread flooding and significant storm surge Debby has caused across northern Florida are expected to last several days, DeSantis said Monday.\n\nKevin Guthrie, the executive director for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said some parts of southwest Florida received up to a foot of rain as Debby approached the Big Bend region. He added that flooding in northern Florida will be widespread as up to 20 inches could fall over the next few days.\n\nGuthrie cautioned people to stay indoors as flash floods break out inland and storm surge continues to inundate coastal communities.\n\nThe flood threat from Hurricane Debby, Guthrie said, \"is probably going to be here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days depending on how much rainfall we get.”\n\nStorm sounds like a freight train, uproots trees\n\nAlice Brown and her husband were awoken by what sounded like a freight train early Monday morning. They soon realized it was the wind and rain lashing their home as Hurricane Debby approached the Big Bend region and eventually made landfall.\n\n“This was the strongest wind and most rain I’ve ever seen,” Brown told USA TODAY.\n\nBrown, 68, lives in downtown High Springs, a small city of some 6,000 people outside Gainesville. While she did not lose power, several of her friends had their power knocked out overnight and were still without it Monday afternoon.\n\nJordan Huey, one of Brown’s neighbors, woke up to a tree falling within inches of his son’s bedroom. Another tree in his yard uprooted and destroyed at least 20 feet of his fence. Huey still had not been able to assess the damage because powerful wind gusts were still hurling tree limbs and other debris outside.\n\n“This is the worst it’s ever been in our area,” said Huey, 52.\n\nSeveral reports of more than 10 inches of rainfall\n\nDebby is leaving behind some eye-popping rain totals, including the 16.56 inches over two days reported by a weather station at Lakewood Ranch in Manatee County. There have been several reports of more than 10 inches of rain across the county, including 12.43 inches at the Sarasota Bradenton airport.\n\nThe weather service in Jacksonville issued a flash flood warning for parts of four counties in north Florida, saying between 7 and 14 inches of rain have fallen, and another 3 to 6 inches are possible.\n\nWith Debby's center still over north Florida by early afternoon, a daily rainfall record was set at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, with 2.29 inches to that point, according to meteorologist Steven Taylor with the National Weather Service in Charleston.\n\nTaylor also reiterated the forecast of 10-20 inches of rain with localized amounts near 30 inches is still on track. \"The situation still looks favorable for a historic rainfall event with areas of catastrophic flooding. This is a potentially significant and life-threatening event,\" he said.\n\nWoman, girl die in crash as Hurricane Debby approached Florida coast\n\nA woman and a girl died in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, the eve of Hurricane Debby’s landfall, according to a law enforcement report.\n\nFlorida Highway Patrol troopers arrived at the scene of the crash around 9:30 p.m. A 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old girl were pronounced dead, while a 14-year-old boy was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital for treatment.\n\nWitnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”\n\n“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” the Florida Highway Patrol said. The crash is under investigation.\n\nMore than 130K without power after Debby makes landfall\n\nMore than 130,000 homes and businesses in Florida, the majority of them in the north, were without power by 12 a.m. ET on Tuesday as Debby continued its path across the state.\n\nThe outages were most abundant from Wakulla to Levy County, according to Poweroutage.us. In Taylor County, where Hurricane Debby made landfall at 7 a.m., more than 97% of utility customers lost power at one point. In several surrounding counties, that figure was well over 80%.\n\nAt a news conference Monday morning, DeSantis said 17,000 linemen across the state were poised to begin restoring power once the storm passes.\n\nForecasters watching tropical system near Caribbean\n\nDebby wasn't the only storm forecasters were watching Monday. They were also keeping an eye on another developing tropical system that was approaching the Caribbean Sea.\n\nAlthough chances for development were low as of Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said \"environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nIf its winds eventually reach 39 mph, the system would become a named tropical storm. The next name on the list is Ernesto. It's too early to determine if there will be any impact to the U.S. from this system.\n\nPacific sets 50-year record for storms\n\nThe eastern Pacific hurricane season has also heated up: The Pacific currently has four named storms spinning at the same time: Carlotta, Daniel, Emilia and Fabio. This is the first time since August 1974 that the eastern North Pacific has had four named storms simultaneously, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nNone of the four storms are forecast to approach or impact land as they spin far out to sea in the Pacific, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe activity in the Pacific comes after a very slow start to the season. For the first time since the satellite era began in 1966, the entire North Pacific saw no named storm activity between June 1 and July 3, Klotzbach said.\n\nWhat makes Debby such a treacherous storm?\n\nDebby is a large and slow-moving storm, making the system particularly dangerous as record amounts of rain inundate many areas, especially along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days.\n\nThe storm’s center was forecast to move near Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday night and drag along the South Carolina Coast on Thursday night. \"Multiple days of very, very heavy rainfall\" are possible, Brennan said. The National Weather Service estimates rainfall totals could reach up to 30 inches or more in isolated locations along the coast through Friday.\n\nDebby shows there's more to a storm than wind scale\n\nThe widespread flooding caused by Debby even after being downgraded to a tropical storm illustrates how the wind scale categories used to define hurricanes can fall short of telling the whole story of their impact, scientists say.\n\n\"This is another example of a storm where the primary impacts are going to be from water, rather than wind,\" said James Franklin, a retired branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nJennifer Collins, a professor in the Geosciences School at the University of South Florida, has studied how to better communicate all of a storm’s threats. Looking at the forecasts of up to 30 inches of rain in isolated locations between Savannah and Charleston, Collins said she’s very concerned about the likelihood of “catastrophic flooding.\" Read more here.\n\nDebby tracker\n\nSpaghetti models\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhen is the Atlantic hurricane season the most active?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. The peak of the season is Sept. 10, and the most activity usually happens between mid-August and mid-October, according to the hurricane center.\n\nAfter Hurricane Beryl's deadly rampage in July, forecasters from Colorado State University raised their already record hurricane forecast. They now expect an additional hurricane (a total of 12 for the season) and two more named storms (25 for the season).\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/10/07/strongest-hurricanes-hit-us-milton/75561551007/", "title": "Strongest hurricanes to hit US list could soon include Milton", "text": "Hurricane Milton is barreling toward the western coast of Florida.

For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground:How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states. Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, killed 103.\n\n∎ Energy production in the Gulf was recovering. Only 3% of crude oil and 1% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut down in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said late Sunday.\n\nStorm tracker:Hurricane Center tracking Tropical Depression Joyce, 4 other systems\n\nAsheville water system severely damaged\n\nIn the days after Helene swept through western North Carolina, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer cautioned that those in the county waiting for the water system to come back online must prepare for the long term.\n\n\"And I’m not talking about days,\" she told the Citizen-Times. \"We want them to plan for longer than that.”\n\nWith the city's water system \"severely damaged\" — which feeds not only the city of Asheville, but also Buncombe County and the northern portion of Henderson County — officials said that restoring service to the full system could take weeks.\n\nAssistant City Manager Ben Woody described the damage as \"catastrophic\" and said crews are still attempting to access infrastructure buried by debris or underwater.\n\nWater distribution began on Monday with four county run sites and one city site. As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday. FEMA teams are deploying to Mission Hospital and are currently treating patients, while another team is moving to Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine.\n\nTen federal search and rescue teams are on the ground in the region and another nine teams are on the way, for a total of 900 active personnel, FEMA said. Also being being brought to the region: 25 trailer-loads of meals, 60 trailer-loads of waters, and C-17 cargo plane full of food, water and other essentials.\n\nAccording to a news release, 200 federal ambulances have been provided to the state. The agency has also supplied 40 Starlink satellites to help with responder communications, and 18 helicopters are on standby to help deliver additional resources to affected areas.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDevastation like a scene from 'War of the Worlds'\n\nResidents in parts of western North Carolina where help has not arrived are fending for themselves. Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could. Her family, once everyone was accounted for, was safe, she said\n\nDeSantis sends rescuers for Floridians in North Carolina\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'Biblical devastation':Helene leaves trail of destruction\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area. As excavators and equipment buzzed around him, Chad Adamowski and his friends were shoveling mud out of his tattoo and music store, hoping to tear out walls before mold set in. “It’s a race against time,” he said.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nLoss of cell service 'crippled' North Carolina town\n\nWhen Helene inundated and isolated communities across the Southeast, it knocked out cell phone service in Canton, North Carolina, at the moment residents needed it most, according to the town's mayor.\n\nThe loss of service \"crippled\" the town's ability to communicate during and after the devastating storm, leaving residents few options to get crucial updates and check on their loved ones, Mayor Zeb Smathers told USA TODAY.\n\n“I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most,” he said in a statement. “From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this.”\n\nMaking cell communication accessible during a disaster should be something these companies have the resources and know-how to offer, the mayor said.\n\nMajor cellular providers have said they are working around the clock to provide temporary solutions and fully restore service. But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need. Global relief organization World Central Kitchen began distributing free meals for the public on Monday. WCK is also providing meals in Florida and Georgia. The organization was founded by celebrity chef José Andrés in 2010 to provide fresh food on the frontlines of humanitarian disasters in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"Asheville, we are here,\" the group tweeted Monday. \"WCK is in North Carolina working to reach flooded communities and families stranded by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\n− Tiana Kennell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore:Power outage maps: Mass outages remain in Carolinas, Georgia, Florida after Helene\n\nWorry for neighbors amid communication blackouts\n\nIn Burnsville, North Carolina, Suzanne Vale on Monday posted the names of her neighbors in a group Facebook chat in hopes someone knows how they’re doing. She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived. So, like others in the area, he first grabbed his chainsaw to help clear roads and check on neighbors.\n\n\"The whole side of the mountain came down,\" he said. \"Then it filled up the valley with mud.\" Read more here.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nNorth Carolina town bands together:'That's what we do'\n\nHelicopters, thermal drones used in some rescues\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of Global Guardian, said his international security firm has supported and evacuated over 400 people from disaster areas across the Southeast. Some of the rescues required helicopters and even thermal drones, he said.\n\n\"While we’ve seen the highest demand from clients in the North Carolina region, we are actively conducting wellness checks and delivering food and water supplies along the storm’s path,\" he said. \"The devastation ... and its impact will be felt for months to come.\"\n\nDid the historic Biltmore Estate flood from Helene?\n\nThe Biltmore Estate in Asheville is assessing damage and will remain temporarily closed because of \"significant flooding, impassable roads and widespread power outages in our region,\" according to a statement on the social media account for the historic house and museum. Museum officials were asking people to check biltmore.com/weather-update for the latest. As of Sunday, a message on the website said officials were \"working to reopen\" but provided no timeline.\n\nGeorge Vanderbilt’s 250-room French Renaissance château, which took six years to build in the late 19th century, was the \"largest undertaking in residential architecture in the nation,\" according to the estate website.

For the latest on the storm, see our story for Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\nST. MARKS, Fla. – Helene weakened to a post-tropical cyclone as it swept through the Southeast on Friday but the storm still wielded enough power to inflict historic flooding across multiple states, causing 39 deaths and millions of power outages.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, with 140-mph winds, making it the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851. Overturned boats, flattened homes and a vista of floodwater several-feet-deep were revealed at dawn across the storm-weary region.\n\nIn Steinhatchee, a coastal town just miles from where Helene made landfall, John Kujawski drove a golf cart with his wife, Jamie Lee, over debris and around downed trees, horrified at the damage. The town of some 500 people took on 9.63 feet of storm surge, a record.\n\n“This is overwhelming,” Lee said. “I don’t think it’s sunk in.”\n\nMoody's Analytics estimated the storm will cost $15 to 26 billion in property damage, much of it spanning across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nFor several hours, the storm maintained hurricane strength as it pushed inland across northern Florida and into Georgia. By 5 p.m. ET, the weather service said Helene had weakened to a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm crossed into Kentucky and was about 50 miles south-southeast of Louisville.\n\nFlash flood emergencies and warnings were active Friday night in Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio and the Carolinas. The weather service urged residents in danger zones to stay off the roads and seek higher road, warning that life-threatening flash floods could continue in some areas until Saturday morning.\n\nHundreds of water rescues were underway across the Southeast amid the torrential rain and continued coastal flooding in western Florida. Meanwhile, more than 4 million utility customers were without power from Florida to Virginia.\n\nTrack the storm:Map Helene's forecast path through Georgia\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters 115 structures in the southern Georgia city of Valdosta had been heavily damaged by Helene's high winds, and crews were responding to rescue people trapped inside.\n\n∎ Widespread flooding and a mudslide shut down a long stretch of Interstate 40 Friday afternoon, extending between Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\n∎ Helene is tied as the 14th most powerful hurricane to hit anywhere in the U.S. since records have been kept and the seventh most powerful to slam into Florida, according to National Hurricane Center data.\n\n∎ Federal Emergency Management Agency teams were on the ground in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas Friday. President Joe Biden had approved emergency declarations for all five states ahead of Helene's landfall in anticipation of the storm's sprawling impact.\n\n∎ More than 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, and 28,500 were delayed by late Friday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website.\n\nHelene wrecks dozens of homes in Florida beach town\n\nHelene wrecked dozens of homes across Horseshoe Beach, a tiny beach town and fishing destination in Florida's Big Bend that has been hit by several hurricanes in recent years.\n\nSome houses were shoved off their concrete footings, while others had their roofs flayed off. The wind and water also tumbled docks onto land, tore down chain-link fences and snapped telephone poles.\n\nBill and Debbie Dotson erected a tent beneath their home Friday where they planned to camp after the storm ripped their staircases away, blocking access to the otherwise undamaged house roughly 20 feet off the ground. Helene was their fourth hurricane since moving to the coastal town in 2021.\n\n“We sure are grateful that it’s standing,” Debbie Dotson, 63, said.\n\nLike many homes in Horseshoe Beach, theirs is built atop concrete footings to keep them out of the flood waters. Idalia destroyed about 40 houses, and the Dotsons said they thought this storm caused more damage.\n\nBill Dotson, 67, said he gauged the floodwaters at around 15 feet, based on the damage to the top of his concrete pilings. Last year, Idalia destroyed one staircase and damaged the other. A local contractor had only recently finished rebuilding both sets for $15,000.\n\n“We came out here and saw this beauty and wanted to go fishing in our retirement,” Debbie Dotson said. “We had the discussion about hurricanes, but you never imagine something like this. You just don’t.”\n\n– Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nNorth Carolina city under curfew amid widespread power outages\n\nThe western North Carolina city of Asheville that largely remained in the dark late Friday was under nightly curfews for the next two days in an effort to prevent residents from accidentally wandering into rising waters, police announced.\n\n“We are unequivocally in the most significant natural disaster of our lifetime here in Buncombe County, and maybe in history,” said Buncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole.\n\nThe French Broad River, which flows more than 200 miles from North Carolina to Tennessee, broke previous historic records Friday. The river reached nearly 25 feet in the late afternoon, breaking the July 16, 1916, record of 23.1 feet, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nNearly 70% of Buncombe County, including Asheville, was out of power as of 10 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker. There have been more than 130 water rescues in Buncombe County, and nearly 200 firefighters were actively responding to calls just in Asheville, a city of roughly 95,000 people.\n\n– Contributing: Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDam failure in Tennessee prompting emergency evacuations was false alarm\n\nA reported \"catastrophic\" dam failure that triggered an emergency evacuation for the entire downtown area of Newport, Tennessee, Friday afternoon was a false alarm, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.\n\nCocke County officials urged all residents to flee the area around 3 p.m. ET Friday after reports that Walters Dam had failed. State emergency management officials said around 4:40 p.m. that Duke Energy, which owns and operates the dam, informed them it was still standing.\n\n\"There is no longer a risk of an imminent dam failure for Walters Dam on the Pigeon River,\" the National Weather Service office in Morristown confirmed on X at 4:45 p.m. \"Major flooding continues, however. Continue to heed evacuation orders from local emergency management and law enforcement. Do not drive into flooded or closed roads.\"\n\nThe dam scare comes as nearby rivers continue to rise from the effects of Helene. The Pigeon River at Newport rose to nearly three times its flood stage Friday afternoon, and it's expected to reach 23 feet before receding this evening.\n\n– Tyler Whetstone and Allison Kiehl, the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\n'We have nothing': Florida home washed away by Helene\n\nFrom the posts she saw on Facebook about her Steinhatchee neighborhood, Lynn Padgett knew the damage might be dire at the house she’s called home for 41 of her 48 years.\n\nShe just didn’t expect it would not be where she had left it Thursday.\n\nThe house was located in a riverside neighborhood alongside other homes. Helene's surge of water pushed it off its foundation and relocated it to the edge of a wooded area just down the way.\n\n\"This is the fourth time the river has flooded (the house) and the first time it’s washed my house away,” she said, chuckling, as she sat in her car with five Dachshunds and a cat. Another cat, Muffin, had climbed up a tree in fright.\n\nShe’s not laughing because it’s funny; not only does the Jiffy Food stop manager’s home not have flood insurance, but it’s not insured for wind either.\n\nThe Jiffy store she works at in Steinhatchee is flooded out, too, she said. She was waiting in her car, hoping the water would go down enough so she could get to her house where she lived with her husband, 64; her father, 67, who uses a wheelchair; and her 18-year-old son.\n\n“Laugh, cry, I don’t know what to do,” she said. “We have nothing.”\n\n-Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nDozens rescued from roof of hospital 'engulfed' by floodwater\n\nMore than 50 patients and staff were rescued after being stranded on a hospital rooftop as floodwaters quickly rose at Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee, on Friday afternoon, Sen. Bill Hagerty said.\n\n\"Everyone has been rescued safely from the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin,\" he said. \"More trouble on the horizon for East Tennessee communities. Please stay safe and thank you for your prayers!\"\n\nFloodwaters from the rapidly rising Nolichucky River and high winds prevented ambulances, rescue boats and even helicopters from reaching the hospital earlier, according to a statement from Ballad Health.\n\n\"The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water. The situation at the hospital is very dangerous,\" the statement said.\n\nBallad Health said that at about 12:30 p.m., 54 people were on the roof and seven were in rescue boats. Water has also intruded into the hospital, the statement said. The rescue was complete by about 4:15 p.m., according to Hagerty's post.\n\nVirginia State Police said its aviation units were helping with the rescues and posted a photo on social media showing the building surrounded by high floodwaters.\n\nBig Bend resident maintains resolve to build back up after Helene\n\nHer riverside home is destroyed, eight of the 24 riverside rental units she owns were flooded, and the electrical system powering the riverside marina building may have been fritzed.\n\nAnd still, Danielle Norwood, 59, owner of the Sea Hag Marina that fronts the Steinhatchee River, was smiling somehow as she pointed to a concrete floor that had crumbled.\n\n“I think I’m stunned at this point, I can’t release a lot of emotions,” she said. And then she paused.\n\n“We’ll build back,\" she said. \"We’re those kind of people.”\n\nThe build-back is familiar territory for Norwood. Last year's Hurricane Idalia destroyed $1 million worth of docks and flooding shorted out the building's electrical system. To avoid a repeat, Norwood moved the electrical system to a second floor in the building, but Helene's nearly 10-foot storm surge appears to have shorted it again.\n\nOn the floor below, a wooden bar was still standing; however, the TVs above it had a line across the screen showing how far the water had risen.\n\nThe good news for Norwood is that Helene's fury spared the feral cats who prowl the marina grounds — and the docks that were so badly torn up by Idalia.\n\nRead the full story here:In Florida's Big Bend, officials start rescues, assessing damage post-Hurricane Helene\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nOver 4 million homes and businesses across the eastern U.S. were in the dark Friday night as Helene pummeled the region with powerful winds and heavy rain.\n\nBelow are the outage totals from Florida to Virginia as of 10 p.m., according to the USA TODAY power outage tracker.\n\nSouth Carolina: 1,031,187\n\nGeorgia: 898,176\n\nFlorida: 527,152\n\nNorth Carolina: 748,112\n\nVirginia: 204,561\n\nKentucky: 158,164\n\nTennessee: 66,032\n\nWest Virginia: 71,969\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track widespread outages from Helene in the state\n\nFlorida sheriff says coastal area looks like 'a war zone' in Helene's wake\n\nOfficials in Florida's Pinellas County – hundreds of miles from where Helene came ashore – painted a grim picture when describing the storm's impact on its coast.\n\n“I would just describe it, having spent the last few hours out there, as a war zone,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Friday morning.\n\nHe said roads were impassable and that debris and damage were widespread: \"It’s going to take awhile before that area gets back to any sense of functionality.”\n\nAlong the Pinellas County coast, storm surge overnight reached over 8 feet – ”something we’ve never seen before” said Cathie Perkins, director of the county's emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nDeath toll rises as Helene batters Southeast\n\nAt least 39 people have died as Helene unleashed dangerous weather conditions across multiple states in the Southeast, according to authorities and media reports. Officials have said they expect the death toll to keep rising as they go door-to-door in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nIn Florida, at least seven deaths have been attributed to the storm. In Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, five people suffered storm-related deaths, said Cathie Perkins, director of emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters a person died in Dixie County, along the Big Bend coast, after a tree fell on a home. On Thursday night, a person was killed in a storm-related traffic fatality in Ybor City in Tampa, the governor said.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said at a news conference Friday that 11 people were killed during the storm, including a first responder.\n\n\"One of our finest lost his life trying to save others,\" Kemp said.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 19 storm-related fatalities across six counties, Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for the governor's office, told USA TODAY Friday evening.\n\nOf those, two people were killed by trees that had fallen on their homes, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office and coroner's office told local media outlets. Two firefighters in Saluda County were also killed, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Two people died in Newberry County, Sheriff James Lee Foster said in an email. Four others died in Aiken County, Coroner Darryl Ables told USA TODAY by phone.\n\nIn North Carolina, a 4-year-old was killed and others were injured in a wreck on Thursday that occurred as Helene's outer bands were slamming the state. In Charlotte, North Carolina, a person died and another was hospitalized after a tree fell on a home just after 5 a.m. Friday, according to the Charlotte Fire Department.\n\n“This was a storm related death,” Battalion Chief John Lipcsak, a spokesperson for the fire department, told USA TODAY.\n\nPotential dam failure triggers evacuations in North Carolina\n\nIn Rutherford County, North Carolina, officials issued evacuation orders after major flooding in the area pushed a dam to the brink of failure.\n\nRutherford County Emergency Management on Friday morning announced that \"catastrophic\" flows of water along the Broad River began overtopping the Lake Lure Dam, located about 35 miles southeast of Asheville. As a result, a mandatory evacuation order was issued impacting areas downstream, including River Creek Campground and homes in the Green Hill, Cleghorn and Union communities.\n\n\"RESIDENTS BELOW THE LAKE LURE DAM NEED TO EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\" county emergency officials warned on Facebook. \"DAM FAILURE IMMINIENT!! EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\"\n\nPower outages, road closures abound in North Carolina, Georgia\n\nTowns across the Carolinas and north-central Georgia were battered through Friday morning as Helene swept over the region, leaving entire parts of Atlanta underwater and triggering evacuation warnings.\n\n“All the apps on my phone kept screaming that there were flash flood warnings all night,” said Paul Thatcher, 38, owner of Franklin Terrace Bed and Breakfast in Franklin, North Carolina, about 70 miles southwest of Asheville.\n\nA nearby mountain highway was ordered closed Friday because the edge of the road bank eroded away, causing the edge of the asphalt to break away, sliding down the valley, officials in Macon County, North Carolina, said on Facebook.\n\nIn Elberton, Georgia, near the state’s border with South Carolina, the Samuel Elbert Hotel lost power overnight and regained it around 10 a.m. Friday, front desk associate Deborah Morrison told USA TODAY.\n\nOn her way to work Friday morning, Morrison said she saw four homes damaged by fallen trees. One road in town was completely washed out around 6 a.m., and other roads were closed because of downed power lines or trees, she said. Traffic on some roads had to alternate using a single lane in either direction, leading to lines of cars, Morrison said.\n\n“Everybody’s weathered it pretty fair, there’s no panicking going on,” Morrison, 63, said.\n\nHurricanes can produce tornadoes for days\n\nAs Helene tore through the Southeast on Friday, tornadoes were a growing concern.\n\nWhile tornadoes don’t typically get the same attention as hurricanes' ferocious winds or perilous storm surge, twisters are always one of the clear and present dangers as storms make landfall and trek inland.\n\n\"Hurricanes can produce tornadoes for two or three days after they move inland,\" said Roger Edwards, a lead forecaster at the Storm Prediction Center, who specializes in tornadoes. The highest risk warning the center has ever issued for a tornado situation related to a hurricane was for the third day after Hurricane Ivan made landfall in Alabama in September 2004. Forecasters were confident there would be a lot of super cells in Virginia, Maryland and even in the southern Pennsylvania area.\n\nNOAA posted a tornado watch at 8:05 a.m. for portions of North Carolina, Eastern South Carolina, Southern Virginia and coastal areas nearby until at least 6 p.m. Friday. The tornado threat from Helene would shift northward, through an area about 110 miles on either side of a line from 40 miles west-southwest of Florence, South Carolina to 20 miles northeast of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the agency said.\n\nSevere thunderstorms with hail were also possible, the agency said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nCoastal Florida town slammed by hurricane – again\n\nBefore Friday morning’s light showed boats in yards, homes shredded and docks thrown from the river into roads, 22 members of the Florida State Guard Special Missions Unit were wading through the mud on the south side of Steinhatchee River’s banks, looking for anyone who needed rescuing.\n\nHurricane Helene struck Thursday evening, making landfall not far away in Perry. In Steinhatchee on Friday, what was dry land only hours earlier was submerged in 40 to 50 inches of water, said Jordon Bowen, commander of the unit, as he gazed down a road that now looked more like a river.\n\n“We have four different skiffs cruising through the neighborhood,” Bowen said, scanning the southeast side of Steinhatchee. “We’re searching all the area to make sure no one’s out there.”\n\nSo far, no one needed help. The search effort also included the National Guard, the Coast Guard, Taylor County sheriffs and Florida Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 2. However, the overall situation looks bleak, according to Bowen.\n\n“It’s destroyed,” Bowen said, indicating an area that’s about the size of 27 football fields. “Not accessible, debris, lots of hazards, downed power lines, houses cut in half.\"\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nPerry resident: 'I've had worse'\n\nOutside Perry, Florida, longtime resident Donna Parker, 80, watched as her grandson cut up a toppled palm tree with a chainsaw.\n\nParker has lived in her house since 1985 and has never left for a hurricane, the names of which she can still rattle off.\n\n\"The wind, it was bad. But I’ve had worse. We’ve really had worse. I’ve had it where my whole front yard was a lake,” she said.\n\n“A lot of prayers, I tell you, when the wind come up. But the good Lord looked after us.”\n\nIs there another hurricane brewing after Helene?\n\nWhile Helene was smashing into Florida, a new hurricane was coming to life in the Atlantic. Hurricane Isaac formed Friday morning far out in the ocean, almost 1,000 miles from Bermuda, the hurricane center said.\n\nAlthough the hurricane is moving east across the open Atlantic far from land, swells generated by Isaac are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and could spread into the Azores by this weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nElsewhere, forecasters were also watching a weather disturbance in the central Atlantic Ocean, one that has a 90% chance of becoming a named storm within the next couple of days. \"A tropical depression or storm could form today while the system moves generally westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"The system is then forecast to slow down and turn north-northwestward by this weekend.\"\n\nIf it gets a name, it would be called Tropical Storm Joyce. As of Friday morning, the system poses no threat to any land areas.\n\nFinally, ominously, forecasters were also turning their attention back to the Caribbean Sea, where yet another system appears to be brewing in a similar location to where Hurricane Helene formed. \"Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development while the system moves generally northwestward, potentially entering the Gulf of Mexico by the end of next week,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThat system, if it strengthens to a storm, would be called Tropical Storm Kirk.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nMan and his dog rescued from sailboat, taken to hospital\n\nIn Sanibel, Florida, a U.S. Coast Guard Air Station crew rescued a man and his dog after his sailboat became disabled and started taking on water off the Florida coast.\n\nCrews found the disabled boat 25 miles off the island's coast after a mayday call came in Thursday.\n\nA photo posted on X shows the Coast Guard rescuing the pair near a disabled vessel as high waters swirl around them.\n\nOfficials said the boater and the dog were airlifted to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers.\n\nThe storm came the closest to the barrier island around 3 p.m. Thursday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\nIs Disney World closed for Hurricane Helene?\n\nTheme park-goers awaited official updates Friday morning announcing what parts of Walt Disney World may be closed.\n\nWalt Disney World in Orlando was open Thursday, but a few parts of the massive theme park were closed because of to Hurricane Helene, including the Typhoon Lagoon water park and miniature golf course. Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party was also canceled for Thursday, the Fort Myers News-Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nDisney World has closed less than a dozen times for hurricanes and national emergencies since its opening in 1971, according to the News-Press.\n\nTampa Bay residents say Helene inflicted 'complete devastation'\n\nIn Tampa Bay, residents said they saw vanished beaches, boats that ran into homes and businesses on fire.\n\n\"Complete devastation and loss here,\" Vikki Hudson, who lives in Largo about three miles from the coast, told USA TODAY on Friday. \"The beaches are gone. Everything is under water. Boats pilled on top of houses and yards.\"\n\nHudson said Gulf Boulevard, which runs the St. Petersburg coastline from Pass-A-Grille historic district north to Clearwater, was \"completely under water.\"\n\nHudson, who lives about 20 minutes from Treasure Island Beach where her two businesses are − The Island Girl Tiki Bar and The Island Girl Beach Rentals − said she has not been able to check on either because bridges are closed because of widespread flooding.\n\n\"We don’t know anything yet, we cannot get to any of the barrier islands,\" Hudson said.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\n'The worst I’ve seen': Water rescues underway across Florida\n\nAuthorities in communities up and down the west coast of Florida said they were conducting water rescues on Friday as storm surge continued to inundate coastal areas.\n\nIn Pasco County, communications manager Tambrey Lane, said state and local agencies working together had rescued at least 135 people from rising waters as of 7:30 a.m. Friday, though she added that number might be as high as 200 or more.\n\nCrews were still out as of 8:30 a.m. and rescues were ongoing, Lane said, and some areas remained inaccessible to rescue crews. More than 54,000 homes were under a mandatory evacuation order west of Interstate 19 and about 4,000 more homes east of the highway.\n\n“It’s really bad,” said Michelle Welsh, an emergency communications officer with the county. “I think it’s the worst I’ve seen.”\n\nWelsh, who’s lived in the area since 2007, said her single-wide trailer had no power, but her home, fortunately, was intact.\n\n– Phaedra Trethan, USA TODAY\n\nFlorida city powers down sewage plant, asks residents not to flush or shower\n\nResidents in a section of St. Petersburg, a city of 261,000, were told not to flush toilets or take showers after the city shut off power at a sewer treatment plant.\n\nThe city said it made the “difficult decision” in order to “protect the plant from unprecedented storm surge,\" in a statement released Friday morning.\n\n“Impacted residents/businesses should not drain water, take showers, do laundry or flush toilets,” the city said. “Draining water will cause sewage to back up into homes/businesses.”\n\nMorning light reveals damage in the wake of Helene\n\nDawn broke Friday morning over a battered and sudden Big Bend region of Florida after hurricane Helene roared ashore overnight.\n\nThe sharp smell of pine filled the air, an artifact of the hundreds of snapped trees lining roads between St. Marks and Perry. Emergency workers flooding into the area, wove around downed trees along U.S Highway 98 as sheriff deputies, limited access, and patrolled for possible looting.\n\nIn the tiny community of St. Marks, about 20 miles south of Tallahassee, floodwaters had reached the front of the U.S Post Office building, about 3/10 of a mile from the St. Marks River, which flows into the Gulf a few miles downstream.Some residents had planned to ride out the storm in their homes or aboard fishing boats tied up at the marina. They could not be immediately reached Friday morning, although cellphone service in the area was working.\n\nRescues ongoing in Atlanta as Helene drenches Southeast\n\nAuthorities in the Atlanta metro area conducted rescues early Friday as Helene raced through the state, drenching a vast swath of the Southeast in multiple inches of rain.\n\nAbout 25 people were rescued from a flooded apartment complex north of downtown Atlanta, multiple outlets reported, citing the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.\n\nNearby Peachtree Creek entered major flood stage, reaching a height of more than 23 feet. Flood watches and warnings were active across the state of Georgia, where all counties are under a state of emergency declared by Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nAbout 4-6 inches of rain have fallen throughout north-central Georgia, including Atlanta and its surrounding counties, according to the weather service in Peachtree City, south of Atlanta. Forecasters say an additional 2 inches could fall throughout the morning hours.\n\nHundreds took to shelters in Tallahassee ahead of Helene\n\nAmber Handlin sat in front of her Lab mix Duckey in a makeshift shelter at the Leon High School gym. They were among the 546 people and 60 pets were in Leon County shelters Thursday afternoon.\n\nHandlin lives in her car and has no friends or family nearby, and with several counties in the area under mandatory evacuation orders, she and the dog were both anxious as the storm approached.\n\nSydney Walter, Jacob Walsh and 1-year-old Graylan live near Florida State University's campus. \"We're like nope, we are not even going to try it,\" Walter said. \"I said, I have a baby so I'm not risking anything.”\n\nThe family, which is expecting a new member, decided to shelter at Leon's gym, citing its proximity to their home, the security it offers − and the most persuasive push, the mom said, was Gov. Ron DeSantis' encouragement.\n\n– Alaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nRead the full story:Public schools sheltering local evacuees from Helene\n\nNational weather radar\n\nFlorida boaters ride out Hurricane Helene\n\nAs Helene pummeled northwest Florida with over 100 mph winds and surges of water several feet high, Philip Tooke managed to punch out a terse but frantic message from his phone as he sat riding out the storm – not in his house, but on his boat.\n\n“Lost power,” he wrote from St. Mark’s, 30 miles south of Tallahassee and 20 miles away from where Hurricane Helene hit the mouth of the Aucilla River. But, he adds: \"Still floating.\"\n\nTooke, the 63-year-old owner of a local seafood market, and his brother remained aboard their fishing boats as Helene lashed the area.

Officials have carried out hundreds of water rescues in flooded areas.\n\nAt least 133 deaths have been caused by the catastrophic storm, according to the The Associated Press. Floods and landslides have caused houses to float away, bridges to crumble, grocery store produce to flow into the streets and semi-trucks to be tossed into mangled piles.\n\nAhead of Helene's arrival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned electric vehicle owners to get to higher ground and avoid the risk of fire.\n\n\"If you have an EV, you need to get that to higher land,\" DeSantis said at a Wednesday news conference. \"Be careful about that getting inundated. It can cause fires.\"\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nFlooding from Hurricane Ian, which killed 156 people in 2022, damaged an estimated 358,000 vehicles in Florida and the Carolinas. However, only 21 electric vehicles are known to have caught fire, far fewer than what officials initially warned.\n\nHere's what to know about whether flooding impacts electric vehicles.\n\nCan submerged electric vehicles catch on fire?\n\nExperts say it is not necessarily more likely for an electric vehicle to catch fire due to flooding with only a small percentage of registered EVs doing so, according to USA TODAY analyses.\n\nFor every 100,000 electric vehicles, 25 catch fire annually, statistics compiled by AutoInsuranceEZ show.\n\nHowever for every 100,000 gas-powered cars, 1,530 fires are reported a year primarily due to fuel leaks or crashes.\n\nWhy do flooded electric vehicles catch fire?\n\nIf flooding actually does cause an electric vehicle to catch fire, it is likely because collision or water intrusion has caused its battery to short circuit.\n\nThis rare event is called a thermal runaway, when the battery cell discharges energy and heats up from one cell to the next, causing a fire.\n\nWhat do if your vehicle is submerged?\n\nIf your vehicle stalls in rising waters, do not attempt to restart it, as this could cause further damage to the engine and components.\n\nInstead, AAA urges you to leave the vehicle immediately and move to higher ground or a safe location.\n\nTesla recommends following these three steps if your vehicle is submerged:\n\nContact your insurance company. Do not attempt to operate the vehicle until it's inspected by an authorized shop. Tow or move the vehicle at least 50 feet from structures, cars, personal property and any other combustible materials.\n\nWhat to do after is recovered from flooding?\n\nBefore using your submerged vehicle after it's recovered, AAA experts recommend assessing the damage. The severity of the damage will depend on how high the water got. If the water stayed below your doors, your car likely didn't sustain much damage.\n\nHowever, if water did rise above the bottom of your doors, they advise those to not make any attempts to restart the vehicle. Doing so could allow water to get inside your engine, causing irreversible damage.\n\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley, Elizabeth Weise and Samantha Neely", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2024/10/01/how-helenes-path-spelled-destruction-for-east-tennessee-towns/75449789007/", "title": "How Helene's path created destruction in East Tennessee – and ...", "text": "Heavy rainfall and widespread flooding made Hurricane Helene more than a generational storm for Southern Appalachia. But what characteristics of the region intensified the billions in damage and dozens of deaths hundreds of miles inland?\n\nWhen the hurricane hit Western North Carolina and East Tennessee as a tropical storm Sept. 26-27, it caused a deadly interaction between the Appalachian mountains, small tributary streams and major rivers.\n\nReservoirs made a life-or-death difference in some spots, bottling up floodwater behind dams, even as those dams spilled record flows downstream and provoked a flood warning.\n\nBy the morning of Sept. 28, the town of Busick, North Carolina, near Mount Mitchell, had received more than 30 inches of rain. Rainfall across North Carolina broke records as Helene traveled north after battering Florida's Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nRunoff from the mountains caused three rivers that flow from North Carolina into Tennessee – the French Broad, Nolichucky and Pigeon – to burst far beyond their banks as they tore through towns like Erwin, Greeneville and Newport.\n\nThe rivers ran uncontrolled and unmoored from their banks for miles, carrying away houses, roads and bridges before converging and flowing into Douglas Lake.\n\n“There are other areas that have flooding damage, numerous small creeks and tributaries, but that is the concentration of damage,” Tennessee Emergency Management Agency director Patrick Sheehan said, describing the rivers during a press conference on Sept. 30.\n\nIn East Tennessee, the rivers flow primarily through Cocke, Greene, Unicoi and Washington counties, though there also was extensive flooding in Carter, Hamblen, Hawkins and Johnson counties.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee declared a state of emergency in Tennessee on Sept. 27, and requested money and assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which the agency approved on Sept. 28.\n\nThe first round of federal assistance includes a 75% reimbursement for restoration work in Carter, Cocke, Greene, Hamblen, Johnson and Unicoi counties, and a 75% reimbursement for evacuation and shelter support in Hawkins and Washington counties. The remaining 25% will be a combination of local and state funds.\n\nOn Sept. 30, Lee wrote to the Biden administration again to request an expedited major disaster declaration, which has been approved in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina, but not Tennessee. The declaration would allow individuals in the eight counties to directly apply for federal aid, including grants for temporary housing or home repairs.\n\nHow Helene broke flooding records in East Tennessee\n\nThe day before Helene arrived in East Tennessee, the National Weather Service office in Morristown warned of the potential for two rounds of flooding. The first was Sept. 25-26, as the region received 2-4 inches of rain. The next was the tropical storm herself.\n\nThe first rain, a so-called \"predecessor event,\" was caused by a band of moist air that came from the outer bands of the storm. It saturated the ground in parts of Tennessee and North Carolina, making runoff from Helene move faster and fuller.\n\nAs Helene moved across the Gulf of Mexico, it picked up more moisture. As it moved up the mountains, the uplift enhanced the amount of rainfall.\n\nThe heaviest rains in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina fell the night of Sept. 26 into the morning of Sept. 27. It was not long before the water came down the mountains and across the state line. Shortly after noon Sept. 27, as the Nolichucky swelled, 62 people, including 54 patients, were stranded on the roof of Unicoi County Hospital for hours.\n\nThey were eventually rescued by helicopters from across the region. Farther downstream at 11 p.m., the Nolichucky Dam near Greeneville withstood record flows nearly twice the amount that pours over Niagara Falls.\n\nSome counties in East Tennessee absorbed more than 10 inches of rain on Sept. 26-27.\n\nTennessee already is one of the rainiest states. In a normal year, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park receives between 55 inches and 85 inches of rain, depending on elevation.\n\nHelene pushed the region beyond its breaking point. It was not just a generational storm, but a millennial one. The Nolichucky River watershed got rainfall \"equal to about a 1-in-5,000-years rain event,\" TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in an email Sept. 30.\n\nThe French Broad River in Newport swelled more than 13 feet higher than its flood stage in its largest flood in the area since 1867, according to the TVA update.\n\nThe Pigeon River in Newport was more than 20 feet higher than its flood stage, beating the previous record set in 1904. TVA's Watauga Dam broke its water level record by 3 feet, and the Watauga River was around 5 feet above its flood stage in the highest level in Elizabethton since 1940.\n\nThe storm led TVA to open spill gates on the Cherokee Dam for the first time in more than a decade. Typically, all water flowing through hydroelectric dams runs through turbines.\n\nAs it cleans up and restores the Nolichucky Dam, TVA is urging people to stay away. TVA Police will be on-site at the dam through the rest of the week. The utility expects commercial traffic along the Tennessee River to be interrupted for several days as it closes locks and sends massive amounts of water through the river.\n\nHelene was more than a \"500-year-event\" for state infrastructure, said Will Reid, deputy commissioner and chief engineer of the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Fourteen state bridges are closed, and five are destroyed:\n\nGreene County: State routes 107, 350 and 351\n\nState routes 107, 350 and 351 Unicoi County: Interstate 26 at mile marker 39.6\n\nInterstate 26 at mile marker 39.6 Washington County: State 81 (Alfred Taylor Bridge)\n\nA section of Interstate 40 washed away near the Tennessee-North Carolina border.\n\nTVA reservoirs store water from Helene\n\nThe Nolichucky and Pigeon rivers eventually flow into the French Broad River before Douglas Dam impounds the river to form Douglas Lake. As the crisis unfolded, reservoirs like Douglas Lake functioned as storage for floodwaters. The water level in the lake rose nearly 22 feet in three days.\n\nBut the water still needed to move through the river system. Through Oct. 1, the Tennessee Valley Authority spilled about 440,000 gallons of water per second through Douglas Dam. The National Weather Service office in Morristown issued a flood warning for parts of Knox and Sevier counties downstream of the dam until 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 1.\n\nDouglas Lake, mostly in Jefferson County, and Watauga Lake, in Carter and Johnson counties, were the two reservoirs TVA relied on most to store water from Helene and move it downstream.\n\n\"Most of our tributaries have crested,\" Darrell Guinn, senior manager of TVA's River Forecast Center in Knoxville, said in a video update Sept. 30. \"Some of those reservoirs still remain elevated, though. Watagua Reservoir (and) Douglas Reservoir continue to be elevated.\"\n\nSouth Holston Lake and Watauga Lake stored much of the water not long after it poured into the northeastern corner of Tennessee through rivers and streams.\n\nBy contrast, the three rivers at the center of the flooding rushed with no storage through Cocke, Greene, Unicoi and Washington counties before reaching Douglas Lake.\n\nHistoric spilling from Douglas Dam led to some evacuations downstream, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency director Patrick Sheehan said in a news conference on Sept. 30.\n\nThe evacuations were small compared to those ordered in Newport when a dam on the Pigeon River was feared to have failed. Walters Dam, operated by Duke Energy, did not end up failing, though muddy and debris-filled water poured through it after record flooding.\n\nTVA's first mission during the Great Depression was to build a system of dams that would prevent flooding and produce electricity for the rural South. It prevents around $309 million of flood damage annually.\n\n\"We are aware that these record releases are causing localized flooding on the Tennessee River,\" Brooks said. \"However, the controlled releases are resulting in much lower river levels than would be possible if the dams weren’t in place.\"\n\nDaniel Dassow is a growth and development reporter focused on technology and energy.

Mayors frantically told citizens to flee. And inmates were desperately removed from a jail directly in the path of floodwaters.\n\nThese were among countless harrowing moments as Helene brought a cascade of destruction across the Southeast. The record-breaking storm hit Florida as a hurricane with wind speeds of 140 mph that flattened buildings. It has since weakened to a post-tropical cyclone with 25 mph winds, as floodwaters besieged parts of North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nHundreds of road closures cut off Western North Carolina amid what Buncombe County has billed as a “catastrophic natural disaster,” in a morning news release from the county. There was no cellular coverage Saturday morning in the county of over 250,000 people. In Asheville, one video posted by ABC 11 showed a house floating away and collapsing into raging floodwaters.\n\n\"This is looking to be Buncombe County's own Hurricane Katrina,\" County Manager Avril Pinder said during an afternoon news briefing, referring to the 2005 storm that led to widespread flooding, destruction and deaths in New Orleans.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper said 10 people had died in North Carolina due to the storm, in a news release on Saturday night. More than 200 others had been rescued by water and helicopter rescue crews who will continue operations through the night.\n\nStay safe:These 3 easy mistakes can be deadly after a hurricane\n\nAcross the border in Tennessee, officials urged some 100,000 residents to seek higher ground Saturday morning as the Nolichucky Dam in Greene County was on the brink of failure, a warning reiterated by the National Weather Service Saturday morning. Hours later, NWS ended its \"flash flood emergency.\" In a Saturday afternoon update, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said the dam remained intact and there were no reports of dam failures. A flood warning was in effect to cover the effects of high water.\n\nThe flooding concerns come as President Joe Biden approved emergency disaster relief aid for Tennessee on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, eye-popping rainfall totals were measured in the North Carolina mountains, including 29.6 inches at Busick and 24.2 inches at Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River and a landmark along the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, becoming the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851. The storm continued its push across western Kentucky on Saturday, and was expected to move slowly southeast, then east along the Kentucky-Tennessee border through the weekend, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n“It’s destroyed,” Jordon Bowen of the Florida State Guard Special Missions Unit told The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Network, referencing the area where Helene made landfall. “Not accessible, debris, lots of hazards, downed power lines, houses cut in half.\"\n\nDozens of deaths have been attributed to Helene’s onslaught, according to authorities and media reports across the Southeast. A tally of the deaths approached 50 on Saturday morning, as officials have said they expected the death toll to continue rising as they go door-to-door in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nBiden was briefed about the deaths, property damage and storm's impact on multiple states by a top official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the White House's homeland security adviser, the White House said.\n\nMore than 3 million customers remained without power on Saturday afternoon across five states, with authorities warning it could be several days before services were fully restored. The worst outages were in South Carolina with more than 1 million homes and businesses without power, and Georgia where 750,000 were without power. Nearly 620,000 were without power in North Carolina as of Saturday evening.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the Florida National Guard to send air assets to North Carolina in support of the hurricane response.\n\nFriday:Stranded people at East Tennessee hospital rescued\n\nMultiple deaths in Buncombe County as rescue crews recover bodies\n\nMultiple people died in Buncombe County amid the damage and havoc caused by Helene, officials said in a Saturday afternoon news briefing.\n\n\"It is a catastrophic event, but now we are sad to report, it is a fatal event,\" said Winston Parrish, chaplain for Buncombe County Sheriff's Department. \"Our emergency crews are not just conducting rescues at this time, but they are also recovering people who have perished in this tragedy.\"\n\nOfficials did not say how many people have died in Buncombe County due to the storm.\n\nOfficials said search and rescue operations in the Western North Carolina community would continue through the night. Some exhausted rescue workers have conducted operations with little to no sleep over the past 72 hours, officials said.\n\n“We have biblical devastation through the county. We’ve had biblical flooding here,” said Ryan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services.\n\nHe said the sheriff's department is working to try to prepare information on the number of deaths.\n\nAsheville Police Chief Michael Lamb said his department had a list of about 60 people with relatives they had not been able to reach. His department planned \"welfare checks\" at homes to check those individuals.\n\nThe storm appeared to cause severe damage to Asheville's water system that will require \"extensive repairs,\" said Ben Woody, Asheville's assistant city manager.\n\nThe county was working to open water distribution sites and planned to announce the sites when they get water and are open, said County Manager Avril Pinder. None had opened as of 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\n“We expect to have that up and running by tomorrow,” Pinder said. “We continue to be without water, for most, without power and without cell service.”\n\nWoody reminded people to boil water vigorously for at least one minute before using it as drinking water.\n\nThis is a “generational weather event,” he said. “Although providing an accurate timeline is impossible, I want to be clear that service restoration will be an extended effort.”\n\nThe city of Asheville also announced an overnight curfew – from 7:30 p.m. Saturday to 7:30 a.m. Sunday –because most of the city remained without power on Saturday.\n\n- Asheville Citizen Times\n\nUNC Asheville cancels classes as downtown hotels fill up\n\nClasses at the University of North Carolina at Asheville are canceled until Oct. 9, the university's student alert system announced on Saturday.\n\nUNC Asheville spokesperson Michael Strysick told the Citizen Times that approximately a quarter of students living on campus left before the storm, leaving around 1,200 still on campus. He said school staff went door-to-door after the storm performing checks on students.\n\nStrysick said UNC Asheville is coordinating with other UNC system schools and is looking into bringing mobile Wi-Fi to campus.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,\" Strysick said.\n\nIn downtown Asheville, nearly all downtown hotels are booked, and any with remaining availability have no running water and aren’t accepting more guests.\n\nJeff Elstro, the general manager of the Flat Iron Hotel, said the hotel has no water, no internet and is not taking guests. Yesterday, locals who went to the hotel searching for accommodations were unable to be helped. Most people at the hotel today are trying to leave, he said.\n\nJordan Hicks, a valet at the Restoration, said all 60 of the hotel’s rooms were full.\n\nOther hotels downtown, like the Haywood Park Hotel, have no vacancies or running water. The Downtown Inn and Suites was closed because it did not have water.\n\nThe Cambria Hotel Downtown Asheville, which posted on Facebook that it has a displacement rate for locals affected by Tropical Storm Helene, does not have rooms available.\n\n- Asheville Citizen Times\n\nFlooding isolates Western North Carolina; hundreds of roads closed\n\nOfficials in Asheville, North Carolina, have billed Helene as a “catastrophic natural disaster,” as Saturday dawned with all rivers still at “major flood status,\" per an 8 a.m. news release from Buncombe County.\n\nThere was no cellular coverage as of Saturday morning in the county of over 250,000 people. Town officials in Buncombe County's Black Mountain reported that most internet, cell phone and landline access was down, and the local water system was non-operational, according to a social media post Saturday.\n\nAll roads in the western part of the state \"should be considered closed,\" the North Carolina Department of Transportation said Saturday. Across the state, more than 400 roads were closed.\n\nNeighboring Haywood County announced a curfew between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. and urged residents to stay off the roads and conserve fuel.\n\nSince Sept. 26, Buncombe County has received over 5,000 calls to 911. The county urged people not to call to report downed trees, power lines or outages.\n\nThe region has seen more than 130 water rescue missions.\n\n“I cannot stress enough how important it is to stay away from the water,” said Buncombe County Fire Marshal Kevin Tipton. “There are down power lines in the water, sewage in the water, and an incredible amount of debris. It is not safe.”\n\nThe 911 center said it would not be providing updates on road conditions, power restoration or internet service.\n\nPublic safety officials urged people to be cautious on the roads. The Highway Patrol urged drivers to avoid the eastbound lanes on Interstate 40 near Asheville.\n\nThe North Carolina Highway Patrol said drivers should take I-40 to Interstate 240 to Interstate 26 if attempting to go south from Buncombe County. Interstate 26 reopened from Asheville to South Carolina.\n\nMotorists were advised to avoid the area's highways and roads for non-emergency travel.\n\nMost airlines at Asheville’s regional airport announced plans to cancel flights Saturday, officials announced on social media. The airport is open and flights can take off and land, but there are “operational difficulties” due to outages and staff are unable to get to work, officials said.\n\n- Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDamage predicted to cost billions\n\nHelene's catastrophic winds and flooding caused somewhere between $95 and $110 billion in damage and economic loss, making it one of the costliest storms in history, according to an early estimate by AccuWeather.\n\nThe estimate includes damage to homes, businesses, roads, vehicles and the effects of power outages, along with lost wages, flight delays, damage to the supply chain and more, AccuWeather said in a release.\n\nOther catastrophic storms include Hurricane Ian in 2022, which caused about $180 to $210 billion in damage; Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017 with a combined total of about $270 billion; Hurricane Sandy in 2012 with $210 billion; and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with damages of about $320 billion. AccuWeather's estimates have been adjusted for inflation.\n\nWhy did Helene cause so much rain?\n\nA confluence of weather patterns over the eastern U.S. set up the historic flooding that forced people from their homes in the dead of night Friday along the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, as officials warned of dam failures and raging torrents ravaged communities.\n\nIn several forecast discussions earlier in the week, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologists described a band of moisture ahead of Helene. This is called a predecessor event and they’ve been documented in the past to cause heavy rains ahead of the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nAlong the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, almost 10 inches of rain fell in Asheville and 8 inches in Tryon, according to preliminary weather service data. Another 6 inches fell over the two days in Bristol-Johnson, Tennessee and more than 4 inches in Knoxville.\n\nThen Helene’s massive circulation moved into the mix with more rain, and then transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone. Recent studies have shown some hurricanes are soaking up more moisture from the warming Gulf of Mexico, further enhancing rainfall totals.\n\nBy Friday evening, record-breaking rainfall totals were reported in some Southeast locations, with more than a foot of rain across swaths of Georgia and South Carolina. Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia saw widespread amounts ranging from 4 to 7 inches.\n\nRain flowing into rivers in the mountainous areas quickly turned into cataclysmic flooding, setting a record high on the Pigeon River at Newport, Tennessee. In Asheville, record high levels were set on the French Broad River and the Swannanoa River near the Biltmore estate.\n\nAt least three of the flood level records broken Friday were set more than a century ago, when the lingering remnants of one tropical system in July 1916 were followed by another, producing heavy rain.\n\n‒ Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nDeath toll continues to climb\n\nDeaths from dangerous weather conditions unleashed by Helene have been reported across the storm's path, and authorities expect the death toll to continue to rise.\n\nIn Florida, at least 11 deaths have been attributed to the storm, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in an update on Saturday morning. In Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, five people suffered storm-related deaths, said Cathie Perkins, director of emergency management, at a news conference Friday. DeSantis said Friday a person died in Dixie County, along the Big Bend coast, after a tree fell on a home. On Thursday night, a person was killed in a storm-related traffic fatality in Ybor City in Tampa, the governor said.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp's office said at least 15 people were killed during the storm, including a first responder. \"One of our finest lost his life trying to save others,\" Kemp said at a news conference.\n\nThe first responder was Vernon “Leon” Davis, assistant chief of the Blackshear Fire Department, Pierce County Coroner William Wilson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Davis died when a tree fell on his city truck shortly before 1:30 a.m. Friday. Also killed in Georgia were a 27-year-old woman and her 1-month-old twin boys, who were in bed together when a tree crashed through their mobile home, McDuffie County Coroner Paul Johnson told the outlet.\n\nAt least 19 people had died during the storm across South Carolina, the Charleston-based Post and Courier newspaper reported, citing local officials. Of those, two people were killed by trees that had fallen on their homes, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office and coroner's office told local media outlets. Two firefighters in Saluda County were also killed, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Two people died in Newberry County, Sheriff James Lee Foster said in an email. Four others died in Aiken County, Coroner Darryl Ables told USA TODAY by phone.\n\nIn North Carolina, a 4-year-old was killed and others were injured in a wreck on Thursday that occurred as Helene's outer bands were slamming the state. In Charlotte, North Carolina, a person died and another was hospitalized after a tree fell on a home just after 5 a.m. Friday, according to the Charlotte Fire Department.\n\nVirginia also recorded its first storm death from a falling tree and building collapse in Craig County, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced in a video on his Facebook page Friday.\n\nFlorida towns flattened under record-breaking winds\n\nHelene hit Florida’s Big Bend first, crashing in with sustained wind speeds of 140 mph. The small area along the state’s Gulf Coast near Tallahassee has seen many bracing storms over the years but none with the force of Helene.\n\n“It’s total devastation,” Scott Peters, the owner of a bar flattened by the storm in Florida, told USA TODAY. “I’ve got to start completely over.”\n\nPeters, the owner of Crabbie Dad's bar, is among those whose property the storm flattened at Steinhatchee, a small town just dozens of miles from where Helene made landfall.\n\nThe town took on a record-breaking 9.63 feet of storm surge, leaving what was dry land submerged in 40 to 50 inches of water, according to Bowen of the State Guard.\n\nJohn Kujawski, another local, told USA TODAY the storm reopened wounds from Hurricane Idalia, which whacked the town in August 2023. Roofs that had been repaired were destroyed all over again, docks tossed ashore, and boats overturned and jammed into marina pilings.\n\nThe storm wrecked dozens of homes at Horseshoe Beach, another coastal town south of Steinhatchee. Some of the homes were shoved off their concrete footings, while others had their roofs flayed off by the wind.\n\nHelene ripped away the staircases to Bill and Debbie Dotson’s home so the couple is staying in a tent on the ground beneath it. The house, like many in the area, is built atop concrete footings in case of flood waters.\n\nThe Dotsons said they thought Helene caused more damage to the area than Idalia, which destroyed about 40 houses. The 2023 storm also destroyed one of their staircases and damaged another, a $15,000 repair job a local contractor had only recently finished.\n\nHelene is the couple’s fourth hurricane since moving to the area in 2021\n\n“We had the discussion about hurricanes but you never imagine something like this. You just don’t,” said Debbie Dotson, 63. “We sure are grateful that it’s standing.”\n\nDeluge of rain in Tennessee\n\nHelene’s winds died down as the storm bore into Tennessee and North Carolina, but it dumped enough water to nearly swallow a hospital, send rivers soaring to record highs and prompt local officials to urge citizens to flee for high ground ahead of potential dam failures.\n\nOfficials from Florida to as far north as Virginia urged people to make for higher ground.\n\nThe Nolichucky River near the North Carolina border came close to sweeping away Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee. Rising waters forced 54 hospital staffers and patients to head for the roof to be whisked away aboard helicopters and boats.\n\n\"The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water,\" Ballad Health wrote in a cry for help on X earlier in the day and hours before conditions calmed down enough for rescue vehicles to move into the area.\n\nThe Pigeon River running through Newport blew past record levels to reach a height of 27 feet. The nearby French Broad River was also expected to almost reach record levels by Saturday morning.\n\nSurging water levels in downtown Newport prompted officials to evacuate the jail, which sits at the bank of the Pigeon. Approximately 60 inmates were taken from the Cocke County Jail to the Jefferson County Jail, a representative for Jefferson County said.\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes, Christopher Cann, Dinah Voyles Pulver, Eduardo Cuevas and Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY; Reuters; Knoxville News Sentinel; Asheville Citizen Times", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/09/hurricane-milton-live-updates-wednesday-florida-landfall/75579293007/", "title": "Hurricane Milton brings devastation across Florida; MLB stadium ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news of Hurricane Milton on Wednesday, Oct. 9. For the latest updates on Hurricane Milton's aftermath across Florida, read USA TODAY's live hurricane coverage for Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nTAMPA, Fla. - Milton slammed into Florida's already storm-blasted west coast Wednesday evening as a Category 3 hurricane threatening huge swaths of Tampa Bay, Sarasota and regions still reeling from the destruction of Helene.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden referred to Hurricane Milton as “the storm of the century” and warned residents to heed evacuation orders. Tropical-storm-force winds, flooding rains, and tornadoes were spreading inland as the fierce hurricane made landfall near Siesta Key in Sarasota County.\n\nNumerous news outlets and Tampa residents also posted video of the roof of Tropicana Field being ripped to shreds by Milton's winds. The domed stadium is home to Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays and has recently been used as a base camp to support the Florida Department of Emergency Management ahead of the hurricane.\n\nMilton is forecast to maintain hurricane intensity as it crosses Florida overnight, the hurricane center said. By 5 a.m. ET Thursday, Milton’s winds weakened to 85 mph — making it a Category 1 storm — as it was 10 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAbout 125 homes had already been destroyed by Hurricane Milton by Wednesday evening, according to Florida officials. More than 3 million homes and businesses were in the dark by early Thursday, according to USA TODAY power outage data.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said most of the lost residences were mobile homes in senior communities.\n\n\"We're trying to get to Florida's most vulnerable to make sure they're taken care of,\" he said. But Guthrie assured Florida residents, \"We are with you.\"\n\nThe latest hurricane strike comes on the heels of Helene, which left a trail of devastated communities across six states. Helene, which first hit Florida as a category 4 hurricane on Sept. 26, killed over 200 people and is estimated to have caused between $10.5 and $17.5 billion of insured losses alone.\n\nMilton brings fear of more widespread damage, with tropical storm-force winds extending out to 255 miles, according to the hurricane center. Millions of storm-weary Floridians had been ordered or urged to flee earlier in the day, particularly in the Tampa area, which was initially projected to be in the bulls-eye of the storm.\n\nTampa, with a metropolitan area that is home to over 3 million people, has not had a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than 100 years. Storm surge from Milton could drive water levels up to 12 feet above ground, the hurricane center said.\n\nMilton is the third hurricane to make landfall in Florida this year. That puts 2024 in a tie with five previous years for the most Florida landfalls in a single season, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University. The other years were 1871, 1886, 1964, 2004 and 2005.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, speaking at a briefing earlier Wednesday, said the state is prepared. Hundreds of search and rescue personnel and 180 high-water vehicles have been embedded in likely storm impact sites, he said. Over 6,000 state National Guard members and 3,000 more from other states are at the ready, along with 50,000 linemen who will work on restoring power after the storm.\n\nHurricane Milton tracker:Follow the latest path of the storm\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Flash flood emergencies remained in effect early Thursday for parts of west-central Florida, according to the hurricane center. The National Weather Service reported that shortly after 1:30 a.m. ET, between 5 and 9 inches of rain had already fallen, and additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were possible in the warned area.\n\n∎ In St. Petersburg, Florida, authorities are responding to a water main break that will \"impact potable water services across the entire city,\" officials said in a statement. The city shut off all potable water service at midnight and officials warned that the temporary shutdown is expected to last \"until the necessary repairs can be completed.\"\n\n∎ High winds and extreme rainfall rates were expected along and to the north of Interstate 4, the weather service said. A gauge in St. Petersburg, Florida, recorded 5.09 inches of rain in an hour on Wednesday night. In total over 22 hours, a gauge at St. Petersburg's Albert Whitted Airport reported 18.31 inches of rain. Along the Northeast Florida coast, a peak storm surge of 3 to 5 feet is forecast.\n\n∎ Tornadic supercells − dangerous, rotating thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes − were beginning to sweep across the Florida peninsula, hurricane officials said. The weather service office in Melbourne received reports Wednesday from Okeechobee, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin counties \"that suggest multiple tornadoes touched down,\" said William Ulrich, warning coordination meteorologist for the weather service office in Melbourne.\n\nWinds cause damages in Tampa Bay area as power outages mount\n\nIn downtown Tampa, fierce winds tore down traffic lights, ripped signs off the ground, and sent construction barricades scudding across the wet pavement. Milton’s winds also ripped off plywood meant to keep the storm out, and a portion of a downtown building’s brick facade collapsed, partially blocking the road.\n\nOver 430,000 homes and businesses were without power in Hillsborough County by early Thursday, according to USA TODAY power outage data. Power outages began to impact services in the area.\n\nThe Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office said on X, formerly Twitter, that its non-emergency line is currently down due to a power outage. The office advised residents to call 911 for \"any emergency\" as authorities work to get the line back up and running.\n\nTampa Bay Water asked residents in the area to \"limit water use immediately\" as its regional water supply system and some facilities are experiencing power outages.\n\n\"The regional supplier continues to run critical facilities on generator power but is asking residents to begin conserving water immediately to help maintain water supply to Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, and cities of New Port Richey and St. Petersburg,\" the water utility company said in a statement. \"Work to restore power may not occur until impacts from Hurricane Milton subside.\"\n\nMLB stadium damaged; crane collapsed at construction site\n\nAfter making landfall Wednesday night, Milton battered the Tampa Bay area with high winds and heavy rains. St. Petersburg officials confirmed shortly before midnight that destructive winds damaged the roof at Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nFootage from local television stations and photos shared on social media showed part of the stadium’s roof torn off amid high winds. A storm deployed weather sensor on the public beach at Anna Maria Island, near the mouth of Tampa Bay, reported 84-mph sustained winds, with a gust to 106 mph at 10 p.m, said Tyler Fleming, a meteorologist with the weather service in Tampa Bay.\n\nEarlier this week, DeSantis announced that the St. Petersburg stadium would serve as a 10,000-person base camp for debris cleanup operations and first responders. St. Petersburg Fire Rescue told ABC News that authorities were in contact with people inside the stadium and confirmed they were safe.\n\nOfficials also reported late Wednesday that a crane collapsed at a building construction site. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the crane collapsed into an office building that houses several businesses and left a hole in the building.\n\nThe building damaged by the crane had closed ahead of Milton’s landfall, according to the newspaper. By early Thursday, the crane remained on the ground, blocking the nearby street.\n\n“The public is urged to continue to shelter in place and avoid both areas until further notice,” the city of St. Petersburg said in a statement. “No injuries have been reported in either incident at this time.”\n\nEarlier, the city shared a video showing winds uprooting a tree at a local hotel.\n\nFeeding America CEO: Taylor Swift donated $5M to relief efforts\n\nTaylor Swift has donated $5 million to hurricane relief efforts for victims of Helene and Milton, the non-profit organization Feeding America announced Wednesday.\n\n\"We’re incredibly grateful to Taylor Swift for her generous $5 million donation to Hurricanes Helene and Milton relief efforts,” Feeding America's CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot wrote in an Instagram post. “This contribution will help communities rebuild and recover, providing essential food, clean water, and supplies to people affected by these devastating storms.\"\n\nFeeding America, a U.S.-based organization dedicated to helping to end hunger, works with local food banks, food pantries, and food programs.\n\n— C. A. Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\n\nPresident Biden: 'It's a matter of life and death'\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were among the administration officials urging Florida residents Wednesday to follow safety instructions as Milton bore down on the state.\n\n“It’s a matter, literally, of life and death,” Biden said at a White House emergency briefing, referring to the hurricane as “the storm of the century.”\n\nBiden has approved emergency declarations for Florida and sent search and rescue teams as well as emergency food, water, power generators and ambulances to the region. In an evening briefing, the president said the Defense Department has also positioned helicopters and high-water rescue vehicles as close to the storm as possible to be ready to conduct life-saving missions.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, encouraged residents in the storm's wake to take precautions. “This is a storm that by every measure, understand, it's going to be more dangerous, more deadly and more catastrophic,” she said.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who located to Florida's capital, Tallahassee, for Milton’s landfall, said there are more than 1,000 federal personnel in Florida addressing the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and other recent storms. She has directed an additional 1,200 search-and-rescue workers to the state to respond to Milton.\n\n\"Floridians, they're no strangers to these storms,\" Criswell said. \"But this one, Hurricane Milton, it is expected to be catastrophic. And I promise you that FEMA is ready.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nReverse storm surge in Tampa Bay\n\nAs Milton approached, the water began rushing out of Tampa Bay in a phenomenon known as reverse storm surge. The phenomenon happens when powerful winds in a landfalling hurricane blow from the land over a bay or waterway and push the water out. South of Tampa along the coast, storm surge was flooding into communities, with increases in water levels exceeding 4-8 feet in some locations. Officials along the Southwest Florida coast warned the storm surge could continue rising into the early morning hours.\n\nMeteorologist Tyler Fleming confirmed to USA TODAY Wednesday night a reverse surge is happening in Tampa Bay. He said water levels for the bay are below normal tide, but urged people to remain indoors until officials give the all-clear.\n\n\"It can cause infrastructure problems and people tend to walk out, which is incredibly dangerous with the water coming back in,\" he said.\n\nNearly 100 tornado warnings from Milton\n\nEven before making landfall, Milton brought a punch for many Floridians as its outer bands prompted 98 tornado warnings from the Tampa Bay, Melbourne and Miami offices of the National Weather Service, the agency said Wednesday.\n\nNWS-Miami meteorologist Will Redman said a preliminary report found at least nine tornadoes were confirmed in Miami, where the office had received 23 reports for South Florida as of 7 p.m. ET. The reports came from trained spotters and residents either seeing a tornado touch down or damage from a possible tornado, according to Redman, who said the worst of Milton has passed for that area.\n\n\"We were never expected to get too much rain from the hurricane,\" Redman said. \"We're just expected to get tropical storm-force winds from the storm with the outer bands.\"\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\n'Wall of black': Tornadoes cause widespread damage\n\nReported tornadoes tore through parts of southwest Florida on Wednesday, including in Collier County and Lee County, causing extensive damage across Fort Myers and Cape Coral.\n\nNorth Fort Myers resident Scott Fincher was sitting on the lanai of his Pine Lakes community home with his family, waiting for Milton. As they waited, they passed the time watching the local news, which was reporting on the \"tornado outbreak.”\n\nReporters then announced a tornado was headed into sister community Lake Fairways, which shares a boundary with Pine Lakes. That’s when Fincher knew: they had to hide.\n\nFincher immediately began moving everyone into the home: his wife, his sister-in-law and his dog. “Just as we were moving everybody in, that’s when it came through,” Fincher said, “and when I heard the rumbling.”\n\n“It was a wall of black,” Fincher said. “It was just as black as could be . . . I felt fear. You could feel the ground shaking a little bit, the house and everything.”\n\n— Kate Cimini, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nDamage, fatalities reported in Southeast Florida\n\nSuspected tornadoes damaged “dozens” of homes along the Treasure Coast in southeast Florida, according to authorities. The storm caused trees and live wires to fall, and neighborhoods were impassable in Martin County.\n\nIt's \"absolutely atrocious,\" said Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. \"It's a mess.\"\n\nSt. Lucie County officials confirmed to local television stations that there were multiple fatalities after tornadoes tore through the area. County Sheriff Keith Pearson told WPBF-TV the fatalities were reported in Spanish Lakes Country Club Village in Lakewood Park, a neighborhood in St. Lucie County north of Fort Pierce.\n\n\"We are going through the rubble,\" Pearson said. \" ... It's devastating. There are no words to describe it.\"\n\nOne of Port St. Lucie's emergency management officials was personally affected by the storm's destruction when a suspected tornado took out his home in northwest Fort Pierce. Billy Weinshank, Port St. Lucie's emergency operations division director, was at work when the storm struck his home, where seven people and \"a couple\" of pets were staying, said Sarah Prohaska, the city's communications director.\n\n\"His house is pretty much destroyed,\" Prohaska said, but noted that all of the people and pets were evacuated safely.\n\n— Treasure Coast Newspapers staff\n\nFor various reasons, several opt to ride out hurricane\n\nIt happens every time a hurricane approaches, no matter how dangerous or how much officials plead for residents to evacuate: Some invariably defy those orders and decide to ride it out.\n\nWhile millions of Floridians poured onto highways to get away from Milton on Tuesday and Wednesday, many opted to hunker down in vulnerable areas. Some residents said their house was elevated and would avoid the storm surge. Others said they feared running out of gas on traffic-jammed highways. Some said they wanted to leave but lacked the means to do so.\n\nLloyd Martinez and two of his friends are among the few staying in the coastal community of Everglades City, about 80 miles south of Fort Myers in the threatened west side of the Florida peninsula, figuring their lodging on the second floor of a riverside seafood restaurant will be safe.\n\n“We’re gonna be fine,” Martinez said.\n\n− Christopher Cann, Chris Kenning and Trevor Hughes\n\nFlorida removed tons of Helene debris before Milton's arrival\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday the state cleared out more than 3,000 truckloads of debris left behind by Helene ahead of Milton's arrival, in an effort to minimize the number of objects that could become projectiles amid high winds.\n\nLandfills have been operating 24 hours a day and a couple of extra ones were opened as the state encouraged residents to also pick up debris and dump it, DeSantis said.\n\nTropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays, has been converted into a 10,000-person base camp for debris cleanup operations and first-responders, but officials said storm-debris collection would stop Wednesday afternoon as Milton approached.\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nHomeless man with criminal record has few options\n\nAs the storm worsened Wednesday afternoon, Nolan Salter sought shelter beneath a building awning in downtown Tampa. Salter, who is unhoused, said he was hoping a friend who recently left town will return soon with a job opportunity for him.He hopes to survive until then.Court records show Salter, 32, got divorced in 2021 and was arrested for drug possession in 2023. Because of his criminal record, many traditional shelters are off-limits for him, and he said he didn’t feel comfortable hiding from the storm in a parking garageSalter said the downtown Tampa bus terminal has some large concrete pillars he felt he could shelter behind if the wind got higher. He said he hoped his heavy jacket, waterproof leather boots and multiple layers of socks and shirts would protect him.Munching on Doritos, Salter said he has more food but worried about access to drinking water. “It’s going to get really bad,” he said as he balanced his belongings in a garbage bag atop a bike with a flat rear tire. Finishing the small bag of chips, he zipped up his jacket and headed into the storm.\n\nBiden denounces Trump's 'onslaught of lies'\n\nBiden said he has spoken with DeSantis and other local and state leaders about Milton and gave them his personal cellphone number to contact him directly if necessary.\n\nThe president also called out former President Donald Trump for leading an “onslaught of lies” on FEMA’s recovery efforts regarding Helene.\n\nBiden said these include baseless claims that property is being confiscated, flood victims are limited to $750 in federal relief aid and FEMA is diverting hurricane relief funds to shelter migrants. Trump has pushed each false claim.\n\n“Now the claims are getting even more bizarre,'' Biden said. \"Marjorie Taylor Greene − a congresswoman from Georgia − is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather. It's beyond ridiculous. It's got to stop.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\n'It’s selfish to stay and make other people put their lives at risk'\n\nAlex Ortiz was on the road for hours, trying to get her mother, her three dogs, eight cats and herself as far away as possible from Milton. They ended up in Destin, 370 miles north of their Pasco County home in Florida. She’d already seen the havoc wrought by Helene, and it cost her: She lost her Toyota Rav4 and a lot of her belongings stored in a ground-level garage.\n\n“I’m exhausted,” said Ortiz, 25. She and her mother had originally planned to stay at a motel in Tallahassee, but didn’t feel safe when they arrived there. They were running out of options. Her mother is partially disabled because of arthritis and most hotels and shelters either don’t take animals or limit their number.\n\n“What am I going to do? Throw some of them out of the car?” Ortiz said. She already had a friend take in her rabbit, but two of her dogs are seniors and prone to seizures. She loves her pets so much, she packed the urns of ones that had died previously into a rented Plymouth Voyager van.\n\n“It’s selfish to stay and make other people put their lives at risk because you put yours at risk,” the lifelong Florida resident said. “Some people here think nothing bad can happen to them, like this is nothing. It’s nothing until it’s something.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nRiding out Milton in home turned refuge\n\nKatie Combs’ living room is full of damp family photos and birth certificates salvaged from her mother’s home after it was wrecked by Hurricane Helene. The storm – which left Combs’ home untouched – inundated and completely emptied her mother’s house in Indian Rocks Beach.\n\n“We found two dining chairs just floating in the ocean … a random tennis shoe hundreds of yards away,” Katie Combs said.\n\nNow, as Hurricane Milton approaches, Combs and her family nailed up boards and brought in furniture at her house in Pinellas Park – which has become a refuge for loved ones whose homes were destroyed by Helene. Recently affixed with a new roof, the house sits 20 feet above sea level and is several miles from the coast, in a city just north of St. Petersburg. She and her family stayed there during Helene and did not lose power.\n\n“If we had to, we could just get in the car and just drive and sleep in the car with the cat,” she said. “But now that we're here and my mom is staying with a friend about 25 minutes away, I don't think getting her and leaving is an option.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nMilton too dangerous for boat owners to stay\n\nAt the Davis Island Yacht Club in Tampa, Commodore Robert Tintera and fellow sailboat racer Emily Wagner spent Wednesday morning fighting increasingly gusty wind and rain to install a remote camera to monitor dozens of members’ boats moored along the docks. A skeleton crew of club members remained at the facility during Helene to loosen and tighten lines as necessary. But they’ve decided it’s just too dangerous to stay for Milton.Tintera's nearby home was significantly damaged by the surge from Hurricane Helene.“The thing I was worried the most about was my sailboat, and it was my house, two motorcycles and a car that got flooded,” said Tintera, who planned to evacuate Wednesday afternoon. “Our hope is that the weak side of the storm pushes the water out of the bay.\"\n\nMetalworker will ride out Milton with 10-foot metal bunny\n\nIn Tampa, while many other people made last-minute preparations, metalworker Dominique Martinez took another tack, driving around in his white pickup with a 10-foot-tall, purple metal bunny in the back. Martinez planned to ride out Milton in his studio home, which is inside an old city firehouse on high ground in Tampa. Because he wasn’t worried about his safety, he said, he could take the time to drive around his sculpture with the aim of bringing some levity to the situation.“So many people come up and are like, ‘this is so cool,’” he told USA TODAY as the wind intensified. “The proof is in the pudding. Look at your smile!”\n\nMapping fuel shortages:Gas shortages grow in Florida ahead of Milton\n\nFlorida's east coast also will face Milton's wrath\n\nMilton is zeroing in on Florida's west coast, but across the panhandle the east coast won't emerge unscathed. The National Weather Service in Melbourne said the storm is likely to have Category 1 hurricane strength when it rolls over the area. The service warned Wednesday that Milton is “likely to result in a rare and historic event for parts of the area” and the region’s residents could face “devastating impacts from hurricane winds and gusts,” including major flooding.\n\nStorm shelters throughout Brevard County, home to Melbourne, opened Wednesday morning ahead of Milton’s arrival on the Space Coast.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver and Michelle Spitzer, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMarco Island resident will ride out the storm\n\nMARCO ISLAND, Fla − On Wednesday morning in Marco Island, 180 miles south of Tampa, increasing winds began whipping palm trees Wednesday. Cars pulled into the city’s last open gas station, its windows covered with plywood and its owner manning the till because his workers didn’t feel safe to coming to work.\n\nOutside, Tim McCoy, 72, filled a supply of gas canisters. McCoy, who owns the island’s Sandbar restaurant that was full of revelers the night before, said he’d been through nearly 20 years of hurricanes including Hurricane Ian in 2022, when the island lost power and an 8-foot storm surge flooded hundreds of buildings and vehicles.\n\nHe was planning to stay for Milton because his home is on elevated ground. He was most worried about losing electricity.\n\n“We don’t have to worry about the flood, we just have to worry about power,” McCoy said, adding that \"if it was a direct hit, I’d probably be out of here.”\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nMilton forces cancellation of thousands of flights\n\nSeveral Central Florida airports have closed. More than 1,700 U.S. flights have been canceled for Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. The same goes for Thursday.\n\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines had added seats and extra flights Monday and Tuesday to help people evacuate the area. Now those airlines along with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have issued waivers that allow travelers going to or from some Florida airports to change their tickets for no extra charge. Customers can check their airline’s website for specific details on travel advisories.\n\nIf a flight gets canceled for any reason, customers are entitled to a refund, according to Department of Transportation rules.\n\n− Eve Chen, Zach Wichter, Nathan Diller and Kathleen Wong\n\nHurricane Milton travel impact:What to know about flights, cruises, hotels and theme parks across Florida\n\nMost people have left this retirement town\n\nMuch of the coastal retirement community of Venice is under an evacuation order, including some areas hosting emergency shelters. Mayor Nick Pachota said officials believe those shelters will be safe enough for people to ride out the storm in, but that most people have left already.\n\nHelene hit Venice’s coastal areas hardest with storm surge, but Milton is expected to bring high winds and rain, along with a storm surge twice that of Helene. Venice, with a population of about 27,000, is about 70 miles south of Tampa.He said a significant concern are the piles of debris left by Helen, which are expected to be thrown around by Milton’s wind.Because so many elderly people retire there − the city’s median age is 68 years old, compared to 38 for the U.S as a whole − officials worked closely with their state counterparts to evacuate nursing home residents and others who could not move themselves.“We made a very big push to get everybody out of here and most of our facilities heeded that request,” Pachota said.\n\nWatch Hurricane Milton live cameras:Storm approaching Florida\n\nIs there a hurricane after Milton?\n\nWith more than seven weeks left in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, there's a good chance that catastrophic Hurricane Milton won't be the last storm to impact the U.S. this year.\n\nIn fact, forecasters are continuing to watch several other systems across the Atlantic basin, including one east of Florida that could become Tropical Storm Nadine later Wednesday.\n\nIf the system becomes Nadine, it would be the 14th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. A typical season – which lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30 – has 14 storms. Read more here.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nMilton's size could mean more than wind speed\n\nMilton may wobble between a Category 3 and Cat 5 hurricane, but forecasters say that ranking doesn't capture the storm's true potential. The scale that ranks hurricanes – officially known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale – is a rating based on maximum sustained wind speed, which ranges from 74 to 157 mph, or higher. The scale does not take into account potentially deadly hurricane hazards such as storm surge, rainfall, river flooding and tornadoes.\n\nIn Milton's case, experts are focusing their concerns on the storm's growing size and potential for massive storm surge along populated areas − two of the things that don't factor into category rankings. The situation was slightly different with recent Hurricane Helene, where the storm's winds were a bigger concern as it made landfall in a less populated area with lots of trees and vulnerable structures.\n\nMilton winds peaked Monday evening as one of the top 5 strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with sustained winds of 180 mph. Though the winds have eased modestly, the storm has grown in size.\n\n\"Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,\" the National Hurricane Center warned.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nFEMA warns: 'Avoid spreading false information'\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the agency is \"prepared to respond and stands ready to support\" Florida with resources requests.\n\n\"Hundreds of FEMA staff are on the ground in Florida supporting Helene recovery and coordinating with the state to prepare people for the next storm,\" the agency said in a news release.\n\nWhat category is Hurricane Milton?Florida has bigger worries than that.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushed back against Trump’s claims about Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, saying she was disappointed in the misinformation he was spreading. FEMA was forced to address misinformation on its webpage and social media platforms after Trump spread claims about hurricane relief efforts, including allegations that there are “no helicopters, no rescue” in North Carolina and that the federal government is only giving $750 to those who have lost their homes.\n\n— Saman Shafiq\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2012/10/28/hurricane-sandy-frankenstorm/1663341/", "title": "Millions on East Coast brace for Sandy", "text": "Carolyn Pesce\n\nMajor storm could wreak havoc as it makes landfall Monday\n\nAlmost 9,000 East Coast flights already canceled\n\nAt least 66 dead in Haiti, Cuba and the Bahamas\n\nHurricane Sandy gained strength Monday as it moved north along the Eastern Seaboard, forcing the shutdown of mass transit, schools and financial markets, sending coastal residents fleeing, and threatening a dangerous mix of high winds, soaking rain and a surging wall of water up to 11 feet tall.\n\nThe monster storm's impact on some 50 million residents was fueling both apprehension and urgency.\n\nAs of 11:00 a.m. ET, maximum sustained winds were measured at 90 mph, which is a strong Category 1 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. Wind gusts were reported as high as 115 mph.\n\nSandy was finally making the long-promised and unusual turn to the northwest toward the mid-Atlantic, as predicted by weather models almost a week ago. The center of the storm is forecast to make landfall along the New Jersey coast late Monday night or very early Tuesday morning.\n\nSandy remains a massive storm as tropical-storm-force winds of at least 39-73 mph are being felt all the way from southern Maine to the Outer Banks of North Carolina.\n\n\n\nThe storm is on a collision course with two other weather systems that would create a superstorm with the potential for havoc over 800 miles from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. About 2 to 3 feet of snow were forecast for mountainous parts of West Virginia.\n\nThe worst of the storm surge could be in the northern part of New Jersey and in New York City and on Long Island. Higher tides brought by a full moon compounded the threat to the metropolitan area of about 20 million people.\n\n\"This is the worst-case scenario,\" said Louis Uccellini, environmental prediction chief for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced 2 p.m. shutdowns of the Holland Tunnel that links lower Manhattan to New Jersey and the Hugh L. Carey Brooklyn Battery Tunnel that links Manhattan and Brooklyn. Cuomo said he made the decision because both tunnels are prone to flooding during heavy storms.\n\n\n\nThe New York City storm surge from Hurricane Sandy is already at the level of the surge during Hurricane Irene last year, even though Sandy is still hundreds of miles away, Cuomo said.\n\n\"The worst is still coming,\" he said during a morning news conference at which he urged New Yorkers to stay home and away from highways and the coastline. \"You do not need to be going to the beach to take pictures.\"\n\nReginaldo Machado, 38, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., in Westchester County was at\n\nHarbor Island Park taking photographs of the flooding that was swallowing park benches at about 10:15 a.m. He said he plans to stay home with his wife\n\nand two daughters.\n\n\"I'm a little bit scared,\" he said.\n\nEarly Monday the Coast Guard rescued 14 of at least 16 people aboard a vessel approximately 90 miles southeast of Hatteras N.C. Two people remain missing. The replica of the tall ship made famous in the film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" eventually sunk, officials said. Survivors managed to get on two lifeboats.\n\nSandy's storm had already surge pushed tides over seven feet in New York City Monday shortly before the arrival of the morning's high tide, the National Weather Service said. The surge added roughly three feet to the high tide, which was already higher than normal as a result of the full moon, said meteorologist Jeff Tongue.\n\n\n\n\"We think the peak of the surge will be as Sandy comes ashore tonight,\" with a roughly six-foot surge added to the nighttime high tide, he said.\n\n\n\n\"It's a once in a lifetime storm,\" Tongue said. \"I've been doing this for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\n\n\nThe storm is expected to bring 50 to 75 mph winds, up to 10 inches of rain and potential snowfall of up to two feet over 14 states beginning late Monday afternoon or early evening.\n\nCraig Fugate, administrator for the federal Emergency Management Agency, said Monday the agency has stationed teams from North Carolina to Maine and in states as far inland as West Virginia.\n\n\"We've been moving generators, basic supplies, we would need after the storm,\" he said.\n\nFugate said he was worried about people evacuating ahead of storm surges.\n\nFirst there will be the coastal impact, then the wind knocking out power and then heavy rain and flash flooding, he said, adding \"we don't want people to think it's not that bad when it comes ashore.\"\n\n\n\nPredicted storm surges of up to 11 feet prompted mandatory weekend evacuations in low-lying parts of New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. High-wind watches and flood warnings are in effect for all the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New England, where Sandy was expected to barrel through Wednesday.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange reversed course and dropped its plan to have electronic trading Monday as Hurricane Sandy churned closer to New York City. Exchange officials also said the market might also close on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\"We support the consensus of the markets and the regulatory community that the dangerous conditions developing as a result of Hurricane Sandy will make it extremely difficult to ensure the safety of our people and communities, and safety must be our first priority\" the stock exchange said in a formal announcement. \"We will work with the industry to determine the next steps in restoring trading as soon as the situation permits.\"\n\nA number of major U.S. companies postponed quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\n\nAt least 9,000 airline flights had been canceled by Monday because of the storm, according to the FlightAware flight-tracking service. That number -- 8,962 as of 9 a.m. ET -- appears certain to grow over the next 24 hours as Sandy moves onshore.\n\nOnce Tuesday's cancellation tally is included, it's possible the total could soar over 10,000 and possibly approach the 14,000 Hurricane Irene-related flight cancellations that were reported over a four-day period in August 2011.\n\nTwo cold fronts to the west and north were on a collision course with Sandy, threatening to turn the massive storm system into a nor'easter, ushering in freezing temperatures in some regions and blanketing areas of West Virginia and other states with knee-deep snow.\n\nPresident Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney canceled any election stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida to monitor the storm.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered evacuations for an estimated 375,000 people in some low lying areas starting Sunday at 7 p.m. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the city's transit service to suspend bus, subway and commuter rail service. The city's mass transit system is the nation's largest — the subway alone has a daily ridership of more than 5 million.\n\nObama warned residents of the region to the storm \"very seriously.\" His visit to FEMA included a conference call with governors and mayors of vulnerable states and cities. \"Anything they need, we will be there,\" Obama said. \"And we're going to cut through red tape.\"\n\nGovernors from North Carolina to Connecticut declared states of emergency.\n\n— In Virginia, where several colleges and school districts canceled classes through Tuesday, Gov. Bob McDonnell authorized up to 750 National Guard members to assist with the storm. In Delaware, Gov. Jack Markell ordered mandatory evacuations for an estimated 50,000 residents of coastal communities. Collin O'Mara, secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, said Sandy could unleash record waves and tidal flooding along the coast.\"The potential on this is greater than the defenses that we have in most places,\" O'Mara said.\n\n— New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency and ordered Atlantic City casinos evacuated - just the fourth time the city's 12 casinos had been shut since legalized gambling began 34 years ago. Christie warned state residents to be prepared for several days without electricity.\n\n— Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy warned that storm surges could be the worst the state has seen in almost 75 years and urged residents along the shorelines of several cities and towns to heed evacuation orders.\n\nSTORM:NYC braces for storm\n\nMost airlines planned to cancel all flights into and out of the three major New York City area airports Sunday night and not resume service until Tuesday. Most carriers were also suspending all flights into and out of Philadelphia as well as Washington D.C's Reagan National and Dulles International airports Sunday evening. Amtrak was canceling train service to parts of the East Coast, including between Washington, D.C., and New York.\n\nThe storm's landfall along the Mid-Atlantic coast \"would likely be a billion-dollar disaster,\" Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters said. He also noted that the full moon will occur Monday, which means astronomical tides will be at their peak for the month, increasing potential storm surge flooding.\n\nWith just a few days left in what's shaped up as a tight election, Sandy was forcing Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to adjust campaign plans. In battleground states where the hurricane is likely to collide with a cold front to form a freak hybrid storm, Sandy \"will throw havoc into the race, said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner.\n\nObama canceled campaign stops Monday in Virginia and Tuesday in Colorado to monitor the storm but planned to go forward with other events Monday in Florida and Ohio. Romney canceled three scheduled Sunday stops in Virginia on Sunday, opting instead to campaign in Ohio before heading Monday to Wisconsin.\n\nVexing both candidates: bad weather that could hinder early voting. efforts throughout the East Coast. \"Obviously, we want unfettered access the polls, because we think the more people that come out, the better we're going to do,\" said Obama adviser David Axelrod. \"To the extent that it makes it harder, that's a source of concern.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the American Red Cross was readying shelters, volunteers and supplies to help coastal areas from Virginia to New England. \"We want to make sure we're ready to spring into action as soon as we're needed,\" spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego says.\n\nFEMA also sent liaison officers to emergency-operations centers in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe Defense Department has sent officers to deploy with the FEMA teams to coordinate possible search-and-rescue missions.\n\nStorm surge remains one of the biggest threats from the storm: Data from CoreLogic show that more than 261,000 homes are at risk.\n\n\"This will be a long-lasting event, with two to three days of impact,\" says James Franklin, branch chief of the National Hurricane Center. \"Wind damage, widespread power outages, inland flooding and storm surge are all likely.\"\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice; Charisse Jones; John Bacon; Kevin McCoy; Beth Belton; Oren Dorell; Rick Hampson; Jeff Montgomery, The (Wilmington, Del.)

Our movie experts ...", "text": "Who cares if it's the most predictable Oscar lineup in forever? We're still going to fight about it.\n\nOut of the 10 pretty great films vying to join the best picture canon at this Sunday's 96th Academy Awards (ABC, 7 p.m. EDT/4 PDT), \"Oppenheimer\" arrives with the most momentum as a clear front-runner. It not winning would be an upset akin to \"How Green Was My Valley\" beating \"Citizen Kane\" at the 1942 ceremony. (Never heard of the former? Our point exactly.) But Oscar voters ranking their favorites via preferential ballot at least allows for the possibility of a surprise.\n\nAnd speaking of preferences, USA TODAY's movie experts have their own when it comes to this year's Oscar crop. Sure, \"Oppenheimer\" looms large in the mix, but the members of this film-loving fight club are here to explain why each nominee is worthy of a best picture win:\n\n'American Fiction'\n\nAs a curmudgeonly, flame-throwing literature professor, Jeffrey Wright is at the height of his considerable powers in Cord Jefferson’s refreshingly sharp meta satire exploring race and modern culture. Wright’s Monk Ellison has had it with publishers wanting “Black books” so he decides to write one himself, offensive stereotypes and all, and finds unexpected success. Sterling K. Brown is also amazing as Monk’s gay brother amid the movie’s relatable secret sauce: a dysfunctional family unit that’s there for you, even when your life goes somewhat off the rails. – Brian Truitt\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Anatomy of a Fall'\n\nThe hip pick of this year’s Oscar crop, “Anatomy” is “Law & Order” by way of the French Alps. Sit anyone down to watch Justine Triet’s ambiguous courtroom drama, and they’ll quickly be hooked by its hot lawyer, scene-stealing canine and unspeakably catchy steel-drum cover of 50 Cent. Sandra Hüller gives an acting masterclass as an inscrutable writer accused of murdering her husband, while the brilliant script sparks infinite debate over whether she did it. Fifteen-year-old Milo Machado-Graner, as her skeptical son, is also an undeniable star in the making. – Patrick Ryan\n\n'Anatomy of a Fall':How a 50 Cent song became the 'earworm' of Oscar season\n\n'Barbie'\n\nOn paper, making a movie about a plastic doll seems like a sure way to get drummed out of Hollywood, where the only bets made are on sure bets. But you take the creative genius of Greta Gerwig, the arch loveliness of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the incisive songwriting of Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell and one fiery monologue by America Ferrera, and suddenly “Barbie” blossoms into a pop culture phenomenon that may well be unrepeatable (please, no “Ken’s Adventure” sequel, folks). Barbie may not be one of a kind, but “Barbie” is. – Marco della Cava\n\n'The Holdovers'\n\nLike a bountiful holiday stocking, Alexander Payne’s wise and world-weary film is the gift that keeps on giving. What starts like a retread of “Dead Poets Society” soon becomes something far more interesting (and for our money, better), as Paul Giamatti’s tetchy teacher gets stuck over Christmas with a boarding school reprobate (newcomer Dominic Sessa). The movie sneaks up on you with its crushing meditations on unrealized dreams and not being defined by your past. And Da’Vine Joy Randolph gives one of the decade’s best performances as a mom stifled by grief. – Ryan\n\n'What a funny career':Paul Giamatti on his journey to 'The Holdovers' and Oscars\n\n'Killers of the Flower Moon'\n\nIn the last decade, Martin Scorsese has made some of the most vital films of his nearly 60-year career, although “Silence” and “The Irishman” both went home empty-handed on Oscar night. In a just world, “Flower Moon” will buck that trend: Scorsese unmasks the worst of humanity over three harrowing hours, forcing us to reckon with our collective complicity in Native American genocide. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro deliver career-best work, while should-be-best actress winner Lily Gladstone is a bastion of quiet resolve in the face of unfathomable tragedy. – Ryan\n\n'I'm not going to be the last':Lily Gladstone is 'amazed' by historic Oscar nomination\n\n'Maestro'\n\nYou don’t have to be a fan of classical music to enjoy Bradley Cooper conducting an orchestra for six breathtaking minutes – but it helps! Cooper’s directorial follow-up to “A Star Is Born” transforms the best actor nominee into Leonard Bernstein for a biopic that follows the legendary composer from his big break to his later years, through the lens of his marriage to Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). Cooper presents a flawed man responsible for some of our greatest musical works, and through it gives us a new view of the filmmaker’s own artistic soul. – Truitt\n\n'Oppenheimer'\n\nMass death and destruction are a challenging topic for any medium. Yet filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s childhood preoccupation with a coming nuclear conflagration has been marinating so long that it’s no surprise the result is a tour de force that leads the Oscar pack with 13 nominations. Is it long? Yes, three hours of mostly psychological mayhem. Is it dark? Decidedly, from its world-in-the-balance narrative to its depiction of women. Is it all worth it? No doubt. History this huge should never be forgotten, which is why Nolan has done our future service by starkly reviving the past. – della Cava\n\n'Past Lives'\n\nWithout a talking plastic doll or a nuclear blast in sight, “Past Lives” might seem like the most conventional best picture nominee of the bunch. But director Celine Song’s quietly devastating tale of two Korean childhood friends (Greta Lee and Teo Yoo) with an unshakable bond goes right for the gut, uprooting complicated feelings about love, fate and the road not taken. By the time it’s all laid bare in one incredibly uncomfortable bar scene − in which an onlooker wonders, “Who do you think they are to each other?” − you, too, will be left weeping. – Kim Willis\n\n'Poor Things'\n\nImagine “Frankenstein” but with more Portuguese tarts, zippy one-liners and rampant intercourse. Emma Stone plays the “creature” brought back to life in Yorgos Lanthimos’ darkly comic Victorian-era quirk-fest, as her Bella Baxter matures from infantile episodes to brothel sex. She becomes an independent woman with a second chance at freedom, though Bella gets no help with that from Mark Ruffalo's hilariously dim and despicable lawyer love interest. Watching Stone dance wildly, wolf down desserts and, most importantly, find her way in the world is a delicious delight indeed. – Truitt\n\n'The Zone of Interest'\n\nDirector Jonathan Glazer creates an unforgettable Holocaust movie depicting the obscene \"dream life\" flourishing just beyond the walls of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) and their five children block out the unspeakable horrors taking place just over the high wall, hearing only occasional shots and plaintive screams and seeing the crematorium's unmistakable glow at night. Watching their banal existence, including Höss' nonchalant living room discussion of cutting-edge gas chambers, slides under your skin in a chilling way that signals indefinite occupation. – Bryan Alexander", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/03/10/full-oscar-winners-list-2024/72873145007/", "title": "Oscars 2024 winners: See the complete list", "text": "We came for the fashion, the jokes and a performance from Ken (Ryan Gosling), but we stayed to see all the winners.\n\nThe 96th Academy Awards were full of songs, emotional speeches and surprises — including some nudity courtesy of John Cena.

This was the case in 2022, when I wrote a column headlined, \"Will Smith and Regina Hall turned the Oscars into a slap in the face in a night of cringe.\"\n\nSince January, however, the awards shows have stayed on track with no spectacular crashes. So Sunday night I settled in with the family to watch the 96th Oscars ceremony, ready to enjoy the finale of a not-so-newsy awards season.\n\nAnd guess what? Not only do I not have bad news, but the extraordinary moments out of the more than three hours were so good that I thought it's only fair to recognize what went spectacularly right with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences this year.\n\nOverlooked at the Oscars:There were many movies and performances that were tragically overlooked Sunday night and during the whole awards season\n\nHere are my favorite acceptance speeches, celebrations of unsung heroes and Oscar show performances. They chilled me, as I thought of where we are in history. Yet, they also made me cheer the academy for giving them a global platform:\n\n'20 Days in Mariupol'\n\nIn accepting the best documentary award for \"20 Days in Mariupol,\" about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov wishes that the events that led to his Oscar win had never occurred: \"I'm honored. But probably I will be the first director on this stage who will say I wish I'd never made this film.\n\n\"I wish to be able to exchange this to Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities. I wish to give all the recognition (for) Russia not killing tens of thousands of my fellow Ukrainians. I wish for them to release all the hostages. ... But I cannot change the history, cannot change the past. But we all together ... can make sure that the history record is set straight, and that the truth will prevail, and that the people of Mariupol and those who have given their lives will never be forgotten.\n\n\"Because cinema forms memories, and memories form history.\"\n\n'The Zone of Interest'\n\nAccepting the best international film Oscar for \"The Zone of Interest,\" a Holocaust movie set just outside Auschwitz at a villa where real-life Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss (played by Christian Friedel) lived with his wife, Hedwig (Sandra Hüller), and their kids, director and co-writer Jonathan Glazer said: \"Our film shows where dehumanization leads, at its worst. ...\n\n\"Right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people. Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel, or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims, this dehumanization, how do we resist?\"\n\nIsrael-Hamas war:With no cease-fire in Gaza, Muslims like me struggle with guilt and rage this Ramadan\n\nThe camera panned to the applauding audience, among them a crying Hüller, who was nominated for best actress for her role in best-picture nominee \"Anatomy of a Fall.\"\n\nIf you haven't seen either film, what are you waiting for? Her stunning work in both outstanding movies should have earned Hüller an Oscar.\n\nThe invisible heroes behind the Hollywood stars\n\nKudos to host Jimmy Kimmel for closing out his opening monologue by inviting on stage all the unseen crew members, from the lighting specialists to the sound technicians. Then he called for a \"very well deserved round of applause for the people who work behind the scenes.\"\n\nWho help make Oscar winners?It's past time Academy Awards let casting directors win, too.\n\nAnd good for the academy to show a montage celebrating stuntmen and stuntwomen. How about adding a category to let them win, too? Like you just did for casting directors.\n\nOsage Singers and Ryan Gosling rocked the Oscars\n\nAnother extraordinary academy recognition was the Osage Singers performing their nominated original song, \"Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People).\" As USA TODAY's national music reporter Melissa Ruggieri wrote in her review: \"With a deep orange sunset as the backdrop, (Scott) George and the Osage Singers engaged in drum pounding and chanting as dancers in traditional clothing circled them and a ring of female singers.\n\n\"The song, featured in the closing dance scene of Martin Scorsese’s 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' was an educational moment for Oscars viewers and an appreciated detour from the usual lineup.\"\n\nBut what topped Ruggieri's review of best song performances was Ryan Gosling and more than 60 dancers bringing down the house with \"I'm Just Ken,\" accompanied by Slash and Wolfgang Van Halen.\n\nWhen Gosling announced he would sing at the Oscars, I groaned. \"I'm Just Ken\" is a cartoon song fitting for a doll. But the pinked-out Gosling camped like the pink Marilyn Monroe from \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" and delivered an epic performance that managed to be both moody and celebratory.\n\nI'm glad Gosling proved me wrong. His Kenergy was more than enough!\n\n'You're my Kim':How I landed a Hollywood movie and gained a 'Heaven and Earth' family\n\nThuan Le Elston, a USA TODAY Opinion editor, is the author of \"Rendezvous at the Altar: From Vietnam to Virginia.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/01/23/oscar-nominations-2024-list/72307759007/", "title": "2024 Oscar nominations are out: Here's who made the list", "text": "Christopher Nolan's atomic bomb biopic \"Oppenheimer\" cemented itself as an awards-season powerhouse Tuesday morning, scoring 13 nominations for the 96th Academy Awards.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" is up for best picture as well as best actor (Cillian Murphy), supporting actor (Robert Downey Jr.) and supporting actress (Emily Blunt) at this year's Oscars ceremony (airing live at 7 p.m. EST/4 PT March 10 on ABC).

Like Murphy's win, the victory marked Nolan's first Oscar.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" took home the biggest prize of the night when it won best picture at the ceremony, beating out top films such as \"Barbie,\" \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" \"The Holdovers\" and \"Poor Things.\" The film won seven awards in total.\n\nContributing: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/03/10/oscars-2024-live-updates-winners/72865686007/", "title": "Oscars 2024: 'Oppenheimer' wins 7 awards, including best picture", "text": "Awards-season behemoth \"Oppenheimer\" didn't steamroll the Oscars but racked up big wins and did take home the night's biggest prize.\n\nChristopher Nolan's acclaimed atomic-bomb thriller nabbed seven honors including best picture at Sunday's 96th Academy Awards. \"Oppenheimer\" also won best director, actor (Cillian Murphy), supporting actor (Robert Downey Jr.), film editing, score and cinematography, while Yorgos Lanthimos' dark comic fantasy \"Poor Things\" took home four Oscars, including best actress for Emma Stone. Best supporting actress went to Da'Vine Joy Randolph (\"The Holdovers\").\n\nHere are all the highlights – including naked John Cena and a rockin' Ryan Gosling – and major winners from Hollywood's biggest night:\n\n'Oppenheimer' unsurprisingly wins best picture (but at least Al Pacino makes it interesting)\n\nOscar-winning film legend Al Pacino comes out to reveal the winner of best picture, opens the envelope and says in overly nonchalant fashion, \"My eyes see 'Oppenheimer.' \" To the point, a little confusing but it works: \"Oppenheimer\" wins! Kimmel gets in one last Nolan crack – \"If only Christopher Nolan had a way to text his family about his win,\" a reference to the director's aversion to smartphones – and ends the show with a nod to his \"nemesis\" Matt Damon, with a shot of \"Anatomy of a Fall\" dog Messi cocking his leg to pee on Damon's Walk of Fame star.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Donald Trump's review of his hosting: 'Isn't it past your jail time?'\n\nSometime during the Oscar show, Donald Trump posted his \"review\" on the social-media site Truth Social: \"Has there ever been a worse host than Jimmy Kimmel at the Oscars? His opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something he's not, and never can be.\" (Trump also suggests they replace him with \"George Slopanopolous,\" which we're going to assume is referring to George Stephanopoulos, but who really knows.)\n\nHaving an extra minute before the end of the show, Kimmel referenced the post and offered a swift and brutal response: \"Well, thank you, President Trump. Thank you for watching. Isn't it past your jail time?\"\n\nEmma Stone wins best actress for 'Poor Things,' quotes Taylor Swift in thanking her daughter\n\nShe might have missed the earlier categories \"Poor Things\" won, but Emma Stone made it to the stage in time to accept best actress. \"My dress is broken. I think it happened during 'I'm Just Ken,' \" Stone says. \"The women in this category ... I'm in awe of you.\" She thanks director Yorgos Lanthimos for the character of Bella Baxter, \"the gift of my life,\" and also her daughter, Louise, who's turning 3 in three days. \"I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl,\" she says, invoking lyrics by Stone's pal Taylor Swift. It's a little bit of a surprise, given nominee Lily Gladstone's Screen Actors Guild win, but Stone powers \"Poor Things\" to its great heights so not a complete shock.\n\nCillian Murphy, Christopher Nolan take Oscar victory laps for 'Oppenheimer'\n\nCillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan ran roughshod over awards season, so why not Oscars, too? Murphy takes best actor and Christopher Nolan is named best director for \"Oppenheimer,\" running the historical epic's awards total to six. \"I'm a little overwhelmed,\" Murphy says. \"I'm a very proud Irishman standing here tonight. We made a film about the man who created the atomic bomb, and for better or for worse we're all living in Oppenheimer's world. So I dedicate this to the peacemakers.\"\n\nBillie Eilish and brother Finneas O'Connell (obviously) win best song for 'Barbie' hit 'What Was I Made For?'\n\nAnnnnnnd our dreams are dashed. \"Oppenheimer\" takes original score and, as expected, Billie Eilish and brother Finneas O'Connell win best song for \"What Was I Made For?\" \"I had a nightmare about this last night,\" Eilish says. \"I just didn't think this would happen.\" (She must have been the only one.) Fun Oscar fact: At 22, Eilish is now the youngest person in Academy Awards history to win two honors.\n\nRyan Gosling rocks just Kenough with 'I'm Just Ken' performance\n\nA pink and extremely bedazzled Gosling starts his energizing (or Kenergizing) best song Oscar performance of \"I'm Just Ken\" singing to co-star Margot Robbie, and somehow it gets better from there: Wielding sunglasses and karate chops, Gosling goes full rock star with a whole bunch of Kens – including Simu Liu and, yes, guitarist Slash – and even lets Greta Gerwig and Emma Stone sing into his mic during an all-out spectacle. Yeah, Billie Eilish is still winning the Academy Award but we're keeping the Ken hopes alive.\n\nSome fun 411 from backstage: The 64 dancing Kens in Gosling's performance rehearsed outside the auditorium right up until the final moments before going on. Afterward, they all came out screaming with their arms in the air and gathered in an ecstatic circle jumping and yelling, “Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!” As you do.\n\nEmma Stone misses 'Poor Things' categories, bursts into tears in lobby\n\n\"Godzilla Minus One\" wins for visual effects (yes!!!!!!), \"Oppenheimer\" conquers the film editing category, but more importantly, we need to catch up with the backstage shenanigans – like \"Poor Things\" star Emma Stone leaving the auditorium just as her film started going on an Oscar tear. “Oh my God, oh my God, we won and I was not sitting down,” Stone exclaimed, running up to the lobby monitor after \"Things\" garnered its first win for makeup and hairstyling. Her eyes were tearful and her hand was on her head. “Sorry, we went to the bathroom and missed this. We can’t go in right now. They won’t let us, right?” But as \"Poor Things\" won the Oscar for production design, there were more screams of happiness as she jumped off the ground. Her husband Dave McCary brought her a glass of champagne as they celebrated.\n\nBy now Florence Pugh had joined the crew with Eva Longoria behind them, as Pugh laughed about a naked John Cena onstage. But Emma is beside herself. “I’m so (expletive) excited,” she shouted. She wiped away tears from her nose, red from crying before more joyful screams erupt after a win for costume design. Thankfully, another break came so Stone could grab her husband's hand and sprint back into the auditorium.\n\nRobert Downey Jr., come on down! 'Oppenheimer' star finally gets his Oscar\n\nIt may come as a surprise to some that Downey, Marvel's erstwhile Iron Man, didn't already have an Academy Award. Welp, that changed tonight because Downey just won his first Oscar, for best supporting actor for \"Oppenheimer.\" (As good as he was in \"Tropic Thunder,\" 2009 was the late Heath Ledger's year.) \"I would like to thank my terrible childhood and the Academy, in that order,\" Downey says, also shouting out his wife Susan. \"She found me a snarling rescue pet and loved me back to life.\"\n\nOf \"Oppenheimer,\" he adds, \"Here’s my little secret, I needed this job more than it needed me. It was fantastic and I stand here a better man because of it.\" And one fun note for the Marvel movie fans: Downey, aka Tony Stark, was presented the Oscar by Sam Rockwell, who played Stark nemesis Justin Hammer in \"Iron Man 2.\"\n\n'The Zone of Interest' gets an Oscar win, and it also should snag a place on your to-watch list\n\nFrench courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Fall\" was the best international movie of last year but it didn't make the Oscar cut because another film was entered into the Academy Awards by its home country. (See also: \"RRR\" from India last year.) But Holocaust drama \"The Zone of Interest\" winning the international film honor was a terrific choice: Jonathan Glazer's hard-to-watch movie about a German family living next to a concentration camp impacts your heart, your mind and all your senses. It's not comfortable but it is, in its own way, essential.\n\nNaked John Cena wears nothing but an Oscar envelope: 'I wrestle in jorts'\n\n\"Costumes are so important. Maybe the most important thing there is,\" says a naked John Cena, wearing only an Oscar envelope alongside host Jimmy Kimmel to hand out the Academy Award for costume design. (\"Poor Things\" wins that as well as production design and makeup/hairstyling.) Cena started out the bit not wanting to come out. \"The male body is not a joke,\" Cena quips. When Kimmel says he wrestles naked, Cena corrects him. \"I don't wrestle naked. I wrestle in jorts.\" Kimmel's retort: \"Jorts are worse than naked.\"\n\nBillie Eilish pours on the emotion with 'Barbie' song 'What Was I Made For?'\n\nAs much as we're rooting for \"I'm Just Ken\" to take the best song Oscar, this is why its fellow \"Barbie\" tune is a more likely winner: With brother Finneas O'Connell, Billie Eilish unleashes quietly powerful emotions in an endearing version of \"What Was I Made For?\" that's the first of the live song performances. We'll have to wait a bit, but these two siblings better start thinking about where they're putting the new hardware alongside their first Oscar and multiple Grammys.\n\n'Anatomy of a Fall,' 'American Fiction' rightfully take Oscar screenplay prizes\n\nJimmy Kimmel is rolling out the dad jokes for the screenplay awards: \"When is a screenplay old enough when you can say it's adapted?\" While we've already had one early head-scratching winner – how the heck does \"The Boy and the Heron\" take best animated feature over the fantastic \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\"? – Oscar voters get it right with original screenplay, which goes to Justine Triet's divine courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Fall.\"\n\nAnother nice surprise! Cord Jefferson's sharp satire \"American Fiction\" conquers powerhouses \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" for adapted screenplay. \"I just feel so much joy being here, making this, and I want so many other people to feel this joy,\" says a humble Jefferson.\n\nGood news! Da'Vine Joy Randolph takes home supporting actress\n\nOscar night is starting off well, with Da'Vine Joy Randolph getting a supporting actress Oscar for her amazing performance in \"The Holdovers.\" \"God is so good,\" Randolph says in her speech. \"I didn't think I was supposed to be doing this as a career.\" She started as an aspiring opera singer and her mom told her to go the theater department because \"there's something for you there,\" but a tearful Randolph really hits home for us when she thanks those folks who've been in her corner: \"For so long I’ve always wanted to be different, and now I realize I just need to be myself. I thank you for seeing me.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel's monologue shouts out 'Barbie' director Greta Gerwig, the 'Oppenheimer' crew and, yes, Messi's Oscar appearance\n\nHost Jimmy Kimmel opens the show with a riff on \"Barbie,\" putting himself into the scene where Margot Robbie's plastic doll tells the elderly women she's \"so beautiful.\" Kimmel's in-scene response: \"I know. I was just thinking that. I'm so hungry, I haven't eaten in three weeks.\" The host then hits the stage, opening with a shot at superhero bomb \"Madame Web\" and a shoutout to \"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig. \"You're clapping but you're the ones who didn't vote for her,\" says Kimmel, a reference to her missing out on a best directing nomination.\n\nThen Kimmel takes on the Oppenhomies, calling out \"Oppenheimer\" director Christopher Nolan's lack of a smartphone, the pronunciation of Cillian Murphy's name and Robert Downey Jr. on \"one of the highest moments of his career\" – a riff on Downey's well-publicized past drug issues. (Oooof.) But Downey takes it in stride, motioning to his nose in knowing fashion from the crowd. Kimmel replies, \"Was it too on the nose or was that a drug motion you made?\"\n\nOther topics of jest: The lengthy runtime of \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" \"Taxi Driver\" co-stars Jodie Foster and Robert De Niro (specifically, his tendency to date younger women), wonder dog Messi in the crowd, his \"Anatomy of a Fall\" co-star Sandra Hüller's foreign films, and whether Steven Spielberg is nominated or if he has Oscar \"season tickets.\"\n\nMessi Watch 2024: No Oscar dogs in sight yet but 'Anatomy of a Fall' folks grab some last-minute snacks\n\nThere's no sign yet of Oscar dog ju jour Messi, but the rest of Team “Anatomy of a Fall” is posted up by the food table, where guests can snag cups of charcuterie and snack mix bags to bring inside the theater. Mid-conversation with Swann Arlaud (aka “Hot Lawyer”), Milo Machado-Graner asks a server for a mini burger.\n\nBut it does get confusing a little as folks go from recharging on a couch with chips to the nerves of showtime. Following her red carpet walk, Tamsin Egerton joined her husband, \"Oppenheimer\" star Josh Hartnett, as they got ready to leave the bar area and get their seats. However, they slowly starting walking out of the Dolby before they were stopped by an usher. A smiling Hartnett turned around and led his wife to the correct exit.\n\nTed Danson's 'Good Place'? His seat at the Academy Awards. For Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons, it's cocktail hour\n\nAbout a half hour before the show starts, the bar scene is still happening. Kirsten Dunst and her husband, “Killers of the Flower Moon” star Jesse Plemons, are sipping cocktails and smiling as they chat with Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the filmmaking duo behind last year’s best picture winner “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”\n\nFolks are beginning to file in to the theater. “The Good Place” star Ted Danson guided his wife Mary Steenburgen to their seats in the orchestra, followed a few minutes later by “Barbie” actor Simu Liu and his date, girlfriend Allison Hsu.\n\nBrendan Fraser among those hitting up the Oscars' exclusive bar\n\nThings are starting to get busy inside the Dolby Theatre. \"American Fiction\" actress Erika Alexander and \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" star Brandon Fraser were among the first to arrive in the fancy (and very exclusive) downstairs bar, which is serving cocktails, salmon pizza, Kobe beef sliders and – mmm, mmm, MMMM – mini tacos. (Chef Wolfgang Puck was spotted wandering out from the kitchen in white Nike slippers and a big grin to hobnob as trays of his hors d'oeuvres were passed around.) Arriving with his longtime partner Jeanne Moore, Fraser met Marlee Matlin and they had an animated discussion through a sign-language translator and took a selfie together. Then Fraser sauntered through an exit to the backstage area: Last year's Oscar best actor winner is a presenter tonight.\n\nDominic Sessa was also seen enjoying a glass of white wine but it's totally cool, though: Although he plays a teenager in \"The Holdovers,\" he's of drinking age at 21.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war protesters, attendees with red lapel pins make their statements at the Academy Awards\n\nJust as the Oscars red carpet was opening, protesters rallied for a Gaza cease-fire and snarled traffic near the Dolby Theatre, site of the Academy Awards. “No red carpet during genocide,” read one sign among dozens speaking out about the Israel-Hamas war. They waved Palestinian flags, set off red smoke bombs and chanted as a smaller group of demonstrators waved signs that read “Fear God.” They were demonstrating at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, just about a block from the red carpet in Hollywood.\n\nPolitical statements also are making their way into the Oscars themselves: Some attendees including Billie Eilish and Ramy Youssef are wearing red lapel pins to represent a call for increased humanitarian aid and the release of hostages.\n\nVanessa Hudgens reveals pregnancy on Oscars red carpet\n\nIt's still early but there's already some news coming from the carpet: Vanessa Hudgens, 35, revealed her pregnancy ahead of Sunday's telecast. The co-host of ABC's red-carpet special, who's expecting her first child with Seattle Mariners shortstop Cole Tucker, arrived and turned heads in a black gown as she held her belly. USA TODAY has reached out to Hudgens' and Tucker's representatives for comment, but in the meantime ... congrats, y'all!\n\nAre you a fashionista? Red carpet coverage is coming\n\nAfter trying to make the \"champagne carpet\" happen last year – like \"fetch,\" it didn't – we're back to red for the latest parade of A-listers in their Sunday best. (Keep an eye out for fashion maven/best actor nominee Colman Domingo: He tells a different story every carpet.) E!'s \"Live From the Red Carpet\" kicks off at 4 p.m. ET/1 PT while ABC starts its pre-show coverage at 6:30 ET/3:30 PT hosted by Disney favorites Vanessa Hudgens (\"High School Musical\" represent!) and Julianne Hough.

Earlier in the evening, away from TV cameras, Stone was also left stranded in the lobby bar of the Dolby Theatre when her film went on an awards-winning streak – taking three major awards without the star applauding from her front-row auditorium seat.\n\nBut that's live TV showbiz. And it proves once again that what you don't see during the live TV Oscars broadcast is often as fascinating as the drama on stage.\n\nUSA TODAY had eyes and ears in the audience, the backstage pressroom, and yes, in the Dolby Theatre lobby bar. Here's what happened behind the scenes at the Oscars as \"Oppenheimer\" rolled to seven Oscar wins including best picture and Ryan Gosling sang an immortal \"I'm Just Ken.\"\n\nEmma Stone wins:Second Oscar for best actress, with a slight wardrobe malfunction\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Oh my God!' Emma Stone can't believe she missed three 'Poor Thing' Oscar wins\n\nAlas, Emma, left her theater seat at the exact wrong time. Stone was elated when \"Poor Thing\" won its first Oscar for best make-up and hairstyling, sprinting to the lobby TV screen with wide eyes. But the actress was also horrified she wasn't present.\n\n“Oh my God, Oh my God, we won, and I was not sitting down,” Stone bemoaned at the lobby monitor, her eyes tearful and her hand on her head. She explained to no one in particular: “Sorry, we went to the bathroom and missed this. We can’t go in right now. They won’t let us, right?”\n\nNo, she couldn't reenter the theater during the live broadcast. So, Stone literally jumped off the ground in joy as \"Poor Things\" won another category, for production design. Her husband Dave McCary brought sparkling wine over and the two clinked in celebration. Florence Pugh also joined the growing crew with Eva Longoria standing behind. Pugh laughed loudly about the nearly nude John Cena on stage presenting for best costume.\n\nBut Stone was laser-focused on the Oscar wins. “I’m so (expletive) excited,” she shouted.\n\n“Oh my God, and they are doing costumes,” she added, wiping away tears, her nose red from crying. More screams of joy ensued as \"Poor Things\" won for costume design as well. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” Stone exclaimed.\n\nWhen the commercial break finally arrived, Stone grabbed her husband's hands and full-on heel-sprinted back into the auditorium, fully pushing the confines of the gown's mermaid bottom.\n\nEmma Stone explains her wardrobe malfunction (Blame Ryan Gosling)\n\nSpeaking of Stone, the actress remarked backstage about her near wardrobe difficulties in which she begged the audience, during her best actress acceptance speech, not to look at the back of her dress. Stone continued to blame the tear on her cheering during Gosling's \"I'm Just Ken\" show performance.\n\n“They sewed me back in,” Stone said. “I genuinely do think I busted it during ‘I’m just Ken.’ I was so amazed by Ryan and what he was doing and that number blew my mind. I was right there, and I was going for it, and things happen.”\n\nDuring the commercial break before winning her award, Stone ran over to \"Poor Things\" director Yorgos Lanthimos, kneeling in front of his seat for an impassioned chat. When they stood up, he attempted to fix the dress. Lanthimos wasn't entirely successful, but they shared a long hug and Stone blew kisses to Lanthimos as she walked away.\n\nMargot Robbie, Greta Gerwig go crazy for Gosling's Ken-tastic performance\n\nIf you watched from home, you saw the epic – and, dare we say, Oscar historic – performance of “I’m Just Ken” by Gosling and many dancing Kens.\n\nWe knew it was going to be special when watching the dancing Kens practicing their moves right outside the auditorium up to the moment they stepped on stage, clad in their Ken-tastic cowboy hats. After the stunning performance, the 64 dancers got rowdy outside the auditorium, their arms pumping. They gathered in an ecstatic circle, jumping and yelling, “Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!”\n\nThe Ken-ergy was even greater in the audience. Stars whipped out their smartphones and leaped to their feet for Gosling's raucous number. Afterward, Gosling’s sister Mandi danced in the aisle to Icona Pop’s “I Love It” with her new black cowboy hat. \"Barbie\" star Margot Robbie debriefed with director Greta Gerwig, jaw-dropped and beaming as they held each others’ hands in total awe over what they just saw on stage.\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph explains nod to grandmother that made her sob\n\nBefore her win for best supporting actress, Da’Vine Joy Randolph burst into tears on TV as Lupita Nyong’o introduced her as a nominee in the category, noting that Randolph incorporated her late grandmother’s glasses into her “The Holdovers” performance.\n\nRandolph opened up about what those spectacles mean to her, calling the glasses a “crucial” touch to her performance in the backstage pressroom.\n\nIn the auditorium, the crowd instantly jumped to its feet when Randolph’s name was called, while her friend Nyong’o danced gleefully in place on stage. Nominee America Ferrera clearly had no hard feelings about her loss to “The Holdovers” star. Ferrera was all big smiles huddling with “Barbie” director Gerwig and co-star Robbie during the commercial break immediately afterward.\n\nAriana Grande is the last to sit, first to leave\n\nLeave it to \"Wicked\" star Ariana Grande to book-end the Oscars. Grande was the last star to sit at the show's beginning, plopping into her seat with her flowing pink Giambattista Valli couture dress just as the giant onstage clock showed four seconds until broadcast.\n\nGrande was also the first star to leave the show, sliding out a VIP exit just before the final award. The \"Thank U, Next\" singer spoke to one lobby fan while exiting, but then hiked up her gown and high-tailed it to a special elevator for that car ride out.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/01/23/oscar-nominations-2024-lily-gladstone-best-actress-killers-of-the-flower-moon/72285706007/", "title": "'Killers of the Flower Moon' gets 10 Oscar nominations", "text": "Martin Scorsese's made-in-Oklahoma epic \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture.\n\nLily Gladstone, the fact-based drama's Native American star, earned an Oscar nomination for best actress as she continues to make cinematic history this awards season: Gladstone is the first Native American to be nominated for best actress in the nearly 100-year history of the Academy Awards.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/03/07/2024-oscar-predictions/72836651007/", "title": "2024 Oscar predictions: Who will win best picture, actor and actress?", "text": "It's not a question of if \"Oppenheimer\" will win an Academy Award on Sunday.

At least best actress could be interesting, with previous winner Emma Stone (\"Poor Things\") vs. newcomer Lily Gladstone (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\") for all the marbles.\n\nWhile we root for enough chaos to keep the night interesting, here are our predictions for all the major categories:\n\nBest picture\n\n\"American Fiction\"\n\nNeed a break?

So barring one of the biggest Oscar upsets ever, \"Oppy\" has this in the bag − although the Oscars' preferential ballot, where voters rank their top choices, at least presents the possibility for a surprise. And if \"Barbie\" has a chance, we're going for it, because while \"Oppenheimer\" is definitely a filmmaking feat, Greta Gerwig's fun, pink-washed phenomenon feels more of our time with its gender dynamics and existential themes.\n\nBest actress\n\nAnnette Bening, \"Nyad\"\n\nLily Gladstone, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nSandra Hüller, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nCarey Mulligan, \"Maestro\"\n\nEmma Stone, \"Poor Things\"\n\nWill win: Gladstone\n\nShould win: Hüller\n\nQuality wins by Stone and Gladstone throughout this awards season have made this somewhat of a toss-up: Both snagged Golden Globes, Stone was victorious at Critics Choice and BAFTA (where Gladstone wasn't in the race), but Gladstone has the Oscar edge, given her recent Screen Actors Guild trophy. (The Oscar winner has differed from the SAG victor only three times in the past 13 years.) Both are terrific, though instead of zigging, let's secretly hope for a big zag because Hüller powers every scene of courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Fall\" with mystery and magnetism.\n\nBest actor\n\nBradley Cooper, \"Maestro\"\n\nColman Domingo, \"Rustin\"\n\nPaul Giamatti, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nCillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nJeffrey Wright, \"American Fiction\"\n\nWill win: Murphy\n\nShould win: Wright\n\nAs the intriguing man behind the bomb, Murphy has rolled through Oscar season and there's no stopping him now, between a searingly great, complex performance and heavy-duty \"Oppenheimer\" momentum. Fellow first-timer Wright will no doubt be back in the hunt at some point, but his \"Fiction\" role just suits everything he does well. As a fiery academic dealing with unsuspecting success, Wright out-curmudgeons the mighty Giamatti, gives an irascible grump a big heart, and, as one of our great character actors, makes the most of his spotlight.\n\nBest supporting actress\n\nEmily Blunt, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nDanielle Brooks, \"The Color Purple\"\n\nAmerica Ferrera, \"Barbie\"\n\nJodie Foster, \"Nyad\"\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nWill win/should win: Randolph\n\nRandolph has run the table toward the Oscars, and she'll be grabbing the glory on Sunday night too. As well she should for such a stunning turn. Following appearances in \"Dolemite Is My Name\" and \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday,\" Randolph is both entertaining and heartbreaking as Mary Lamb. She's the tough-love head cook of a boarding school who forms a mini-family with a crusty professor (Giamatti) and rebellious student (Dominic Sessa) while also navigating the absolute grief of the first Christmas without her beloved son.\n\nBest supporting actor\n\nSterling K.

That changes Sunday, when he'll clean up at one last awards show and (hopefully) say something interesting with a live mic. He's deserving from a career \"attaboy\" sense but also from the fact that, after playing a superhero for more than a decade, Downey proved he's great at being an antagonist. As Lewis Strauss, he puts Murphy's J. Robert Oppenheimer through a stressful wringer born of power and pettiness, and in a movie that leans bleak, it's satisfying to witness the ultimate comeuppance.\n\nBest director\n\nJustine Triet, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nMartin Scorsese, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nChristopher Nolan, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, \"Poor Things\"\n\nJonathan Glazer, \"The Zone of Interest\"\n\nWill win/should win: Nolan\n\nAkin to Scorsese's 2007 win for \"The Departed,\" it's just Nolan's time.

But he's carved out an excellent populist filmography for himself, from \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Memento\" to \"Inception\" and \"Interstellar,\" and it's an achievement in itself to create a blockbuster hit out of a dense, three-hour drama about scientists.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}]}

For the latest news on the investigation into the suspect, follow our live updates on the probe for Monday, Sept. 16.\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. ― Investigators on Sunday were probing what appears to be an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the second one in two months. The Republican presidential candidate was safe following gunshots near his golf course in Florida, his campaign and U.S. Secret Service announced.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said Sunday that it is investigating \"what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.\" The incident took place at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach where the former president was golfing shortly before 2 p.m., according to officials.\n\nAuthorities said a man stuck the barrel of a rifle through the fence at the edge of the golf course while the former president was golfing. Secret Service agents on the course spotted the weapon and opened fire on the man, who fled.\n\nAuthorities later said they identified the vehicle, a black Nissan, thanks to a bystander's photograph, and soon traced it to neighboring Martin County to the north. David Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that the suspect in custody is Ryan Routh, 58.\n\nThe incident occurred on the same day that the Republican nominee posted \"I hate Taylor Swift\" on his Truth Social platform and his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, admitted that he had \"no regrets\" for propagating fake stories about Haitian migrants that led to multiple threats in the town of Springfield, Ohio.\n\nFollowing Sunday's assassination attempt, President Joe Biden vowed to make sure the Secret Service has \"every resource\" for Trump's safety, adding that \"there is no place for political violence.\"\n\n\"I am relieved that the former President is unharmed,\" Biden said. \"There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened. As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.\"\n\nExperts say Secret Service handled situation properly\n\nThe Secret Service had an elevated presence around former President Donald Trump when he was golfing on Sunday and thwarted an alleged assassination attempt after an agent in front of him spotted a rifle through the shrubbery.\n\nExperts say agents in West Palm Beach appeared to have handled the situation properly two months after the Secret Service was heavily criticized about an earlier assassination attempt in which a gunman with an AR-style rifle shot at the GOP nominee from about 150 yards away.\n\nBut the recent incident at one of Trump's golf clubs in Florida underscores the challenges in protecting a presidential candidate who likes to keep a high public profile – including hitting the links and holding outdoor rallies, those experts told USA TODAY.\n\n“Generally, even for a sitting president, they will operate in the way that they did here,” said A.T. Smith, the deputy director of the Secret Service from 2012 to 2015. That means having agents do the best they can to accommodate other golfers, Smith said, while discreetly scouring the terrain for potential threats as Trump and his party continued playing.

Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nWho is suspect Ryan Routh?\n\nDavid Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that the suspect in custody is Ryan Routh, 58. He said his prosecutors were preparing an arrest warrant and pretrial detention for Routh when federal prosecutors told him they were taking over the case, so he backed off.\n\nAronberg also said an AK-47 rifle believed to belong to Routh was recovered at the scene. Aronberg said Routh appeared to be at least partly motivated by his strong support for Ukraine and its war against Russia. “He’s someone who obviously has some issues,” he said. \"Normal people don’t commit crimes like this.\"\n\nPublic records indicate a man of that age named Ryan Routh lived in Hawaii, but voting records showed the same man as a longtime voter in North Carolina. State voting records show him casting ballots in general and municipal elections going back many cycles, including 2008 and 2012 − though not in 2016, when Trump first ran.\n\nThe same records show Routh voted most recently in the March primary election this year in Guilford County, North Carolina. A registered Democrat, he voted in person.

As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,\" Harris said. \"I am thankful that former President Trump is safe. I commend the U.S. Secret Service and law enforcement partners for their vigilance.\"\n\nHarris' statement came on the heels of a similar statement President Joe Biden made earlier in the day.\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nGun experts scrutinize gunman’s Soviet-style rifle\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw showed photos from the scene of what he said was an assassination attempt depicting a rifle, backpack, and GoPro camera.\n\nHe described the firearm as an AK-style rifle — a ubiquitous semi-automatic rifle designed with a curved detachable 30-round magazine. Firearms experts were quick Sunday to point out some of the features in the grainy photo suggest the rifle is a Soviet cousin to the AK, the SKS. It was designed in the 1940s by another famous Russian designer, Sergey Simonov.\n\nThe SKS was a slightly older rifle than the AKs with replicas sold worldwide in the civilian market. Traditionally, the SKS came with a 10-round \"fixed magazine\" a distinguishing feature from the detachable, curved 30-round magazines on AKs.\n\nThe wooded scene photos showed a black \"sporterized\" modern SKS, with a detachable magazine. It had a scope added for longer-range shooting and appeared to have a \"Monte Carlo\" stock to fit better to a shooter’s cheek.\n\nFirearms experts at The Military Wire called the weapon a 7.62x39mm SKS rifle with black synthetic stock. That’s the same ammunition as most AKs.\n\nNotably, an SKS was used in the 2017 Congressional baseball game shooting that wounded U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a police officer, aide, and lobbyist.\n\nSome firearms experts called the weapon an \"eclectic\" and odd choice. Other gun lobby groups pointed out Sunday the weapon would not be covered by a so-called assault weapons ban since it had no foregrip, pistol grip, or detachable stock which have been targeted by the proposal as distinguishing features.\n\n-- Nick Penzenstadler\n\nTrump campaign sends email about assassination attempt with fundraising link\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign sent an email Sunday evening touching on the assassination attempt against the former president earlier in the day. The message includes a link that takes supporters to a site where they can donate to the Trump campaign.\n\n“My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life!” Trump says in the email. “I will never slow down. I will never give up. I WILL NEVER SURRENDER!”\n\nThe email includes two large red “MAGA” buttons. Clicking on them takes supporters to the site where they can donate. The site includes another message from Trump.\n\nThe message included suggested donation amounts up to $3,300.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nDeSantis opening investigation into Trump assassination attempt\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote on social media Sunday that his state will be “conducting its own investigation” into what authorities are describing as an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\n“The people deserve the truth about the would-be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee,” DeSantis wrote.\n\n-- Zac Anderson\n\nBomb squad examined vehicle driven by suspect in attempted Trump assassination\n\nMartin County, Florida deputies intercepted the suspect at State Road 714 on I-95. The vehicle was described as a black, mid-size SUV.\n\nMartin County deputies held the man until the FBI and Secret Service arrived and took him away. While he was detained, the St. Lucie bomb squad examined the suspect’s vehicle. Three counties in the region all use the St. Lucie bomb squad.\n\n\"He picked the wrong county to drive through if he was planning on getting away,\" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told reporters.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nBiden on new Trump assassination attempt: 'No place for political violence'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Sunday evening “there is no place for political violence” in the U.S. following the second assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, in a written statement, said he has been briefed by his team regarding what federal law enforcement officials are investigating as a possible assassination attempt against Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nBiden commended the work of the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners “for their vigilance and their efforts to keep the former President and those around him safe.”\n\n“I am relieved that the former President is unharmed. There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened,” Biden said. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.”\n\nBiden said he has directed the federal government to continue to ensure the Secret Service has “every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety.”\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nSpeaker speaks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) posted on X, that he and his wife met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate this afternoon.\n\n“We just spent a few hours with President Trump and are thanking God for protecting him today — once again. No leader in American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable,” Johnson said. He attached a photo of them with Trump.\n\nOther Hill leaders have said they were briefed by Secret Service about the incident. Johnson is the first to say he has spoken directly with Trump.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire\n\nSchumer: Suspect 'must be prosecuted'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was briefed by the acting director of the Secret Service about the shooting.\n\nHe applauded the agency's quick response, and reiterated Harris' point earlier in the day that there is no place for political violence in the U.S. before saying, \"the perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nEx-White House press secretary: Secret Service should expand Trump perimeter\n\nAs the Palm Beach sheriff explained at Sunday's news conference, the golf course would have been \"surrounded\" by law enforcement if Trump were the sitting president, but because he's a candidate that area is much smaller.\n\nSome are already saying that needs to change amid a hotly contested election defined by divisive rhetoric.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the Secret Service should change its policy and treat Trump like he's an incumbent with a larger protective perimeter around him. \"Stop being bureaucratic,\" he said on X. \"Do what’s necessary.\"\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nTrump running mate: 'Hugging my kids extra tight'\n\nSen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who is Trump's running mate in the 2024 election, said he spoke with him before news about the shooting was made public.\n\nTrump, \"was, amazingly, in good spirits,\" he said in a post on X.\n\n\"Still much we don't know, but I'll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude,\" Vance added.\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nHow was this able to happen?\n\nAsked by reporters how this incident could occur, especially given the previous attempt on Trump's life, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw described the golf course as being \"surrounded by shrubbery\" with a limited perimeter.\n\n\"When somebody gets into the shrubbery, they're pretty much out of sight,\" he said.\n\nBecause Trump is not a sitting president, Bradshaw said, \"security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible,\" but that will likely change in the future.\n\n\"I would imagine the next time he comes at a golf course, there'll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter, but the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done. They provided exactly what the protection should have been, and their agent did a fantastic job.\"\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nFlorida lawmaker wants Secret Service to brief Congress this week\n\nA member of the bipartisan congressional assassination task force is calling on the U.S. Secret Service to brief lawmakers this week after a second assassination attempt at Trump in as many months.\n\n“As I’ve said before, the July 13 assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,\" Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Florida, said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe panel, which consists of six Democrats and seven Republicans, was established to look into the attempted assassination in Pennsylvania.\n\n-- Phillip Bailey\n\nCounty sheriff: Secret Service 'provided exactly what the protection should have been' for Trump\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the Secret Service had less protection at the golf course for Donald Trump because he was a former President and not a current one – but that the agency did everything it was supposed to do to protect him.\n\n“You got to understand, the golf course is surrounded by shrubbery, so when somebody gets into the shrubbery, they're pretty much out of sight, and at this level that he is at right now, he's not the sitting present,” Bradshaw said at the news conference. “If he was, we would have had this entire golf course surrounded.”\n\n“But because he's not, the security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible,” Bradshaw said. “So I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there'll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter.”\n\n“But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done,” Bradshaw told reporters. “They provided exactly what the protection should have been, and their agent did a fantastic job” in responding to the suspect.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nFlorida lawmaker wants Secret Service to brief Congress this week\n\nA member of the bipartisan congressional assassination task force is calling on the U.S. Secret Service to brief lawmakers this week after a second assassination attempt at Trump in as many months.\n\n“As I’ve said before, the July 13 assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,\" Rep.

That's how we got the guy.”\n\n“We started out with ‘We don't know anything’ to where we had a tag, we had a vehicle description, and we got an area where we saw the person,” Bradshaw said. “So be proud. Be proud of your law enforcement.”\n\n--Josh Meyer\n\nOfficials: Secret Service engaged gunman, AK-47 style weapon found\n\nU.S. Secret Service agents opened fire on a gunman located near the property line of the golf source after seeing a rifle, according to law enforcement officials who spoke at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\nAgents found an AK-47 styled rifle, a scope, backpack and a GoPro camera on the scene, officials said. Trump was on the golf course at the time, and was roughly 400 to 500 yards away from where the would-be assailant was.\n\nThe suspect is now in custody, officials said.\n\nWitness: 'I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag'\n\nA witness saw the alleged gunman running from the golf course bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s quick apprehension, the Palm Beach County sheriff said at Sunday's news conference.\n\n“We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\n\nAs a result, they were able to alert the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, who detained the suspect. The witness also was able to then identify the alleged gunman.\n\nWho was Trump golfing with?\n\nBefore the shooting began Trump was golfing with longtime friend and real estate baron Steven Witkoff, according to multiple reports.\n\nWitkoff gave a heartfelt speech about Trump at the Republican convention in Milwaukee back in August. He said he reached out to the former president after the assassination attempt in July, and was surprised when Trump picked up.\n\n\"I know this man very well,\" Witkoff said. \"President Trump is as kind and compassionate a man as I've ever met my lifetime.\"\n\nTrump: 'I am safe and well'\n\nIn a fundraising email sent out roughly an hour after the incident, Trump said there were gunshots in his vicinity, \"but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I am safe and well!\"\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity has developed a close relationship with Trump and conveyed having a brief conversation with the GOP nominee on Sunday. He joined a live broadcast after speaking with the former president.\n\nTrump checked to see if others were OK, Hannity said, but then joked about wanting to finish the round.\n\n\"I guess in typical, 'fight, fight, fight' fashion Trump said... 'I really wanted to finish the hole,'\" Hannity said.\n\nWhen was Donald Trump last attacked?\n\nThis incident occurred two months after the former president was injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on July 13. That incident sparked an investigation and caused the resignation of then Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who had led the agency since 2022.\n\nIn the subsequent weeks, Trump has increased security at his events with him often speaking behind bulletproof glass at outdoor rallies.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/16/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-investigation-live-updates/75243425007/", "title": "Trump assassination attempt live updates: Suspect being investigated", "text": "An apparent assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course was fueling an intensive investigation Monday into how an armed threat could once again reach within a few hundred yards of Trump, two months after he was nearly killed at an event in Pennsylvania.\n\nSuspect Ryan Routh, who appeared in federal court Monday, never fired a shot, authorities said. He was being held on charges of possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.\n\nTrump was at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday afternoon when Secret Service agents walking the course ahead of him spotted a gun barrel in bushes. When they opened fire, the suspect fled in a black Nissan SUV, leaving behind a loaded, SKS-style assault rifle, a backpack, two bags, a digital camera and some food, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nRouth, 58, was detained a short time later, and a witness who saw the suspect fleeing the golf course identified Routh, the complaint says. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Routh had been about 300-500 yards from Trump and that Routh's rifle and scope put him within range.\n\nTrump thanked the Secret Service and local authorities for their efforts. But he said President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris motivated the incident.\n\n\"He (Routh) believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at.\"\n\nIt was the second assassination attempt he has survived. In July, Trump's ear was grazed when a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Martin County Sheriff's Office released body cam video showing Routh being taken into custody.\n\n∎ A detention hearing has been scheduled for Routh on Sept. 23 and an arraignment for Sept. 30.\n\n∎ President Joe Biden said Monday that the Secret Service needed more resources, and he encouraged Congress to provide them. “One thing I want to make clear (is) the Service needs more help. I think Congress should respond to their needs,\" Biden told reporters as he left the White House.\n\nTrump: 'Perhaps it's God'\n\nIn an interview on the social media site X, Trump offered a possible spiritual reason for surviving two assassination attempts in two months.\n\n\"There's something going on,\" he said. \"I mean, perhaps it's God wanting me to be president to save this country. Nobody knows.\"\n\nThe former president also continued to blame the anti-Trump \"rhetoric\" of Harris and Biden during the X Spaces program devoted mostly to the launch of a new cryptocurrency project to be led by his two eldest sons.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nRouth owned a small business, collaborated with local government in Hawaii\n\nRouth moved to Hawaii in 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile. He registered his company, Camp Box Honolulu, which specializes in building small storage structures, as a Hawaii business in January 2019, according to state records. However, the business registration expired this past January.\n\nIn 2019, Routh was featured in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, where he pledged to build tiny homes for the homeless in East Oahu. This initiative was part of Hawaii's Kauhale program, a collaborative effort between the state government and HomeAid Hawaii, a non-profit focused on developing housing solutions for individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n\nAccording to organization Executive Director Kim Carvalho, the nonprofit did not use Routh's services after 2020.\n\n\"Ryan Routh volunteered with HomeAid Hawaii from 2018 to 2020, offering his company’s services in roofing and flooring for tiny home construction,” Carvalho said in a written statement. “He was not compensated, and no complaints were recorded during his time with us under HomeAid Hawaii's previous leadership.\"\n\nYesterday, investigators visited Routh's Kaaawa home, which is listed as his business address. Public records indicate that the home is owned by a woman who has previously shared addresses with Routh.\n\n– Jeremy Yurow\n\nBiden shares ‘cordial’ call with Trump\n\nBiden spoke with Trump on Monday evening and the president expressed his relief that the former president is safe, the White House said.\n\nThe White House said the two shared a “cordial conversation” and Trump thanked Biden for the call.\n\nBiden initially did not get Trump on the phone, the president told reporters when heading back to the White House after a trip to Philadelphia, according to the pool. Biden earlier on Monday told reporters “Thank God the president is OK.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nGolf excursion was not on Trump's schedule\n\nTrump's Sunday afternoon golfing excursion wasn't on his official schedule, according to Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr., who said he doesn't currently know if Routh knew Trump would be there.\n\n\"This was an off-the-record movement,\" Rowe said at a Monday news conference. \"So there was no posting up of it because he wasn't supposed to have gone there in the first place.\"\n\nRowe added that the investigation is active.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRouth 'did not have line of sight to the former president': Secret Service\n\nRouth \"did not have line of sight to the former president\" at the time he was shot at and fled the scene, according to Rowe, who spoke at a news conference on the investigation into the apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nRowe said Routh was on the public side of a fence near the sixth green of the golf course as Trump was moving through the fifth fairway, \"across the course and out of sight of the sixth green.\"\n\nA secret service agent who was visually sweeping the area saw Routh \"armed with what he perceived to be a rifle, and immediately discharged his firearm,\" according to Rowe. Routh then fled the scene, without firing any gunshots himself, and Trump was immediately evacuated to a safe location.\n\n\"The agent's hypervigilance and the detailed swift action was textbook,\" Rowe said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSecret Service chief praises agents' quick response but acknowledges need for more resources\n\nRowe praised his agents Monday for thwarting what authorities say was a second assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and dismissed questions about whether they could have done more to stop a gunman who was allegedly lying in wait for Trump for more than 12 hours.\n\nBut Rowe, who flew from Washington to Florida to visit the golf course where his agents opened fire on the suspect, acknowledged that the protective agency needs more resources in the current hyperpolitical threat environment.\n\nHe praised local authorities for capturing the suspected gunman, Routh, after he allegedly fled from his hiding place in the bushes at the edge of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.\n\n“But what was critical to this was the quick reaction, the response, the hyper vigilance of the men and women of the United States Secret Service, who since July 13th have been rising to meet an unprecedented and hyperdynamic threat environment,” Rowe said at an afternoon news conference.\n\nRowe later said that he has been talking to Congress about the need for more resources to meet the threat posed by the current presidential race between Trump and Harris – and several dozen other protectees that it is responsible for safeguarding.\n\n“What I can tell you is that we have immediate needs right now, and we have great support, not only from President Biden” but also members of Congress about increasing funding for an agency has “done more with less for decades,” Rowe said.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nRouth wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight for Ukraine: FBI\n\nRouth wanted to recruit Afghan soldiers as well as others to fight for Ukraine, said FBI special agent Jeffrey B. Veltri at a Monday news conference.\n\nInvestigators are combing through Routh's online presence, including his search history, as they seek to uncover more about his possible motive and planning, according to Veltri. They have reached out to companies to get access to Routh's phone and social media accounts.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFBI analyzing Routh's rifle, electronics, DNA\n\nVeltri said the bureau's headquarters and Quantico lab are analyzing various pieces of evidence collected through the investigation, including the rifle, scope, bags, electronics, and ceramic tiles that were collected from the scene.\n\nLaw enforcement has also collected DNA from the obtained items that is being sent to the Quantico lab for testing, and it plans to examine Routh's car, Veltri said.\n\nThe FBI is also planning to compile Routh's movements in the days and months leading up to the apparent planned attack, according to Veltri, who confirmed Routh was in the vicinity of the golf course for about 12 hours before the Secret Service engaged with him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRouth invoked right to lawyer, but family is being interviewed: FBI\n\nFBI agents attempted to interview Routh, but he invoked his constitutional right to a lawyer, according to Veltri, who provided an update at a news conference. Law enforcement has interviewed seven witnesses from the scene of the apparent assassination attempt on Trump, Veltri said.\n\nFBI field offices in Honolulu, Hawaii and Charlotte, North Carolina have also started interviewing Routh's family members, friends, and former colleagues, Veltri said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMar-a-Lago security level 'highest it can possibly be'\n\nSpeaking at an afternoon news conference, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the security level at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club \"is the highest it can possibly be.\"\n\nBradshaw said road closures and checkpoints are in place, and his office would provide the Secret Service with \"every possible resource\" it needs.\n\nBradshaw said he spoke to Trump last night and Trump feels safe.\n\n\"That's important because he is, and what we did yesterday proves that the system can work,\" Bradshaw said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLaw enforcement news conference to livestream\n\nFederal and local law enforcement plan to hold a joint news conference at 4 p.m. edt Monday to provide updates on the investigation into the apparent assassination attempt, according to the Justice Department.\n\nRead more and watch live here.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump to go on X spaces\n\nDonald Trump will presumably discuss the attempted assassination Monday night on X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform. \"Join me live from Mar-A-Lago at 8:00PM Eastern, tonight on X Spaces,\" Trump said on the website. \"Set a reminder and be sure to tune in!\" No word on whether Musk will join Trump, as he did for a glitch-filled interview in August.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nSecret Service chief lands in Florida as questions swirl\n\nRowe landed in Florida Monday amid questions about how a convicted criminal allegedly pointing an assault-style rifle was able to get within 500 yards of former President Donald Trump before being fired upon by Secret Service agents the day before.\n\nRowe was meeting with local and federal law enforcement officials and doing a walkthrough of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, a Secret Service spokesman said.\n\nThe Secret Service official declined to provide more details about Rowe’s visit, including whether he is in town to oversee an investigation into the agency’s handling of the incident.\n\nBut his trip comes as Democrats and Republicans in Washington called for a probe − even as the Secret Service is still facing criticism for its handling of the shooting at a Trump Pennsylvania campaign rally in July that killed one attendee and injured two others.\n\nThe Secret Service was initially praised Sunday for its quick response to the shooting. In a post on his TruthSocial social media platform, Trump thanked the agency and local law enforcement “for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me … SAFE.”\n\nBut some former Secret Service officials questioned whether more resources, including aerial surveillance drones, could have detected the gunman earlier. And an FBI affidavit released Monday alleged that based on cellphone records, Routh’s mobile phone was at the golf course location for nearly 12 hours, starting at 1:59 a.m.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nMerrick Garland pledges to 'work tirelessly to ensure accountability'\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged in a statement Monday that the Justice Department \"will work tirelessly to ensure accountability\" and \"will bring every available resource to bear\" as it investigates the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nGarland released the statement soon after federal officials' criminal complaint against Routh was made public. Routh is charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and with possessing a firearm that has an obliterated serial number.\n\nThe entire Justice Department – including the FBI, the National Security Division, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida – is working closely with law enforcement partners who are on the ground, Garland said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSuspect Ryan Routh fired no shots\n\nDavid Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that Routh did not fire any shots while perched just outside the Trump International Golf Course. No shell casings were found at the site, he said. Prosecutors in his office were developing a motion for pretrial detention with no bail until federal officials informed him they would be taking over the case, Aronberg said.\n\n“We deemed him as a threat to the community,” he said. “We did not want him to slip away.”\n\nAronberg said his office was more concerned about Routh being a danger to the community than a flight risk. “He had an AK-47 style rifle and the allegation was he was pointing it at a law enforcement officer,” he said.\n\n− Rick Jervis\n\nVideo of Routh arrest released\n\nWhen Routh was pulled over by local law enforcement at about 2:14 p.m. Sunday, he was asked whether he knew why he was being stopped and he responded that he did, according to FBI special agent Mark Thomas, who signed an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against Routh. Video of the stop can be seen here.\n\nThe license plate on the Nissan was registered to a 2012 white Ford truck that had been reported stolen, according to Thomas. A witness who reportedly saw Routh speed off from the Trump golf club area was brought to the scene where Routh was captured and identified him.\n\nRouth's cellphone records indicate he was in the vicinity of the golf course tree line for almost 12 hours Sunday − from 1:59 a.m. until approximately 1:31 p.m.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHours after incident, Trump lobbies donors\n\nDonald Trump has sent another aggressive fund-raising solicitation based on this second assassination attempt, urging supporters to \"fight\" on his behalf.\n\n\"There are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us,\" Trump said after assuring donors that \"I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God!\"\n\n\"I will not stop fighting for you,\" Trump said. \"I will Never Surrender!\"\n\nTrump posted the fundraising pitch on his Truth Social account with the headline \"Fight, Fight, Fight!!!!!\" Those were the words he used right after the first assassination attempt in July.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nRouth spent itme in Ukraine, wrote book\n\nIn a 291-page self-published book Routh produced in February 2023 on Amazon, titled “Ukraine's Unwinnable War,” Routh unspooled pages of discontent over America’s involvement – or lack thereof – in the Russian-Ukrainian war, as well as urging more military intervention in Taiwan, North Korea and other places. In the book, available only in Kindle version for $2.99, he wrote about traveling to Ukraine in 2022 and how the Ukrainian government refused to let him fight. Instead, according to his account, he set up a protest booth in Kyiv and tried to recruit volunteers to the frontlines.\n\n“It is insanity for many great nations to sit on vast militaries and do nothing as people are killed in countless countries around the globe,” Routh wrote.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Routh's links to Ukraine showed that \"playing with fire\" had consequences, a reference to U.S. support for Ukraine since Russia's invasion.\n\nRouth only makes a few passing references to Trump in the book, criticizing his role in the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol or praising him for trying to spark a relationship with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un. But he harshly criticizes the former president for dismantling the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, taking partial blame for Trump's 2016 election.\n\nSpeaking to Iran's leader, he writes, \"You are free to assassinate Trump as well as me for that error in judgement and the dismantling of the deal.\"\n\n−Rick Jervis\n\nRouth was 'relaxed' when pulled over, taken into custody\n\nThe vehicle Routh was driving was stopped minutes after the incident. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told CNN Routh was so calm it was “perplexing.\"\n\n“His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Snyder said. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.”\n\nHe was arrested amid a phalanx of law enforcement, including a SWAT team and helicopter. Interstate 95 was briefly shut down, and a bomb dog was brought in. Amid the commotion, Routh said little and never asked why he was pulled over, Snyder said.\n\n“He was just calm, really, as if he was going for dinner,” the sheriff said.\n\nTrump: ‘It was certainly an interesting day!’\n\nThe former president’s first public comment on the incident came in an 11:36 p.m. Truth Social post thanking supporters and praising the Secret Service and law enforcement.\n\n“I would like to thank everyone for your concern and well wishes - It was certainly an interesting day!” He added: “Most importantly, I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE. THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!”\n\nSunday's incident comes as the political atmosphere grows more divisive ahead of the November election. Earlier Sunday, Trump posted \"I hate Taylor Swift\" on his Truth Social platform. And running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, doubled down on a controversial statements about immigrants, saying he had \"no regrets\" for propagating fake stories about Haitians that led to multiple threats against them in the town of Springfield, Ohio\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat we know about Ryan Routh\n\nRouth was arrested Sunday and had his first court appearance Monday. He appears to be an impassioned supporter of Ukraine in its fight against a Russian invasion and also appeared to have an extensive history of business troubles and court filings.\n\nRouth's social media posts and media interviews form the picture of an impulsive person who said he was willing to risk his life for his ideals – and who made claims that sometimes tested credulity. Besides being a builder and entrepreneur, Routh had told several major media outlets that he worked to recruit soldiers to foreign wars he believed in. A New York Times story in March 2023 that described Routh as a \"former construction worker from Greensboro, N.C.\" said Routh was recruiting Afghan soldiers − who had fled the Taliban − to fight in Ukraine.\n\nOn a phone number associated with Routh, the voicemail greeting as of Sunday identified the number's owner as \"Ryan in Hawaii,\" working with the \"National Volunteer Center, sending soldiers to Ukraine, as well as Taiwan.\" He urged callers to send him a message through WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram or Facebook. Phone calls placed to him were not returned Sunday. Read more here.\n\n− Rick Jervis and Will Carless\n\nHouse panel to set hearing on latest assassination attempt\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., chair and ranking member of the task force created to investigate the July assassination attempt on Trump's life, said in a joint statement they have requested a briefing with the Secret Service \"about what happened and how security responded\" to Sunday's incident.\n\n\"We are thankful that the former president was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms,\" they said. \"The Task Force will share updates as we learn more.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on X that he and his wife spent a few hours with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the apparent assassination attempt. \"No leader in American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient,\" he said. \"He is unstoppable.\" Read more here.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy sends best wishes to Trump\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced political violence and sent his best wishes to Trump following a second assassination attempt on the former president. Zelenskyy's comments come as suspect Routh has been identified as an outspoken supporter of Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nIn a post on social media site X early Monday, Zelenskyy said: \"I am glad that (Donald Trump) is safe and unharmed. My best wishes to him and his family.\" Read more here.\n\n− Eric Lagatta\n\nHow did the assassination attempt happen?\n\nAsked by reporters how this incident could have happened given the previous attempt on Trump's life, Bradshaw described the golf course as being \"surrounded by shrubbery\" with a limited perimeter.\n\n“When somebody gets into the shrubbery, they're pretty much out of sight,\" he said.\n\nBecause Trump is not a sitting president, Bradshaw said, \"security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible,\" but that will likely change in the future.\n\n\"I would imagine the next time he comes at a golf course, there'll probably be a little bit more people around the perimeter, but the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done,\" Bradshaw said. \"They provided exactly what the protection should have been, and their agent did a fantastic job.\"\n\n– Phillip Bailey\n\nSecret Service challenged by outdoor events\n\nThe Secret Service had an elevated presence around Trump when he was golfing on Sunday and thwarted the alleged assassination attempt after an agent in front of him spotted a rifle through the shrubbery. Experts say agents in West Palm Beach appeared to have handled the situation properly two months after the Secret Service was heavily criticized following an assassination attempt at an outdoor rally in July, when a gunman with an AR-style rifle shot at the GOP nominee from about 150 yards away.\n\nBut the recent incident at one of Trump's golf clubs in Florida underscores the challenges in protecting a presidential candidate who likes to keep a high public profile – including hitting the links and holding outdoor rallies, those experts told USA TODAY. Read more here.\n\nBiden commends Secret Service\n\nBiden said \"there is no place for political violence\" following Sunday's incident vowing to make sure the Secret Service has \"every resource\" for Trump's safety. Biden, in a written statement Sunday evening, said his team has briefed him on what the FBI is investigating as an apparent assassination attempt against Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nBiden commended the work of the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners \"for their vigilance and their efforts to keep the former president and those around him safe.\"\n\n\"I am relieved that the former president is unharmed,\" Biden said. \"There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened. As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country.\"\n\nFirst assassination attempt ended in death for shooter\n\nThe first attempt on Trump's life took pace July 13. A lone gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, opened fire at a crowded rally in Western Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump's ear and he was rushed off stage by U.S. Secret Service after at least six shots rang out. One spectator was killed and two others were critically wounded. Crooks, perched on the roof of an adjoining warehouse, was killed by a Secret Service sniper returning fire.\n\nThe incident drew a firestorm of criticism and questions, including how Crooks managed to get within about 150 yards of Trump despite Secret Service protection. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned 10 days after the shooting.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/09/21/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-charges/75250489007/", "title": "Why Trump's second assassination suspect only faces gun charges ...", "text": "The suspect in the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump is only facing gun charges so far, but former federal prosecutors said stiffer charges may be coming.\n\nRyan Routh was apprehended Sunday after a Secret Service agent saw him holding a rifle through the Trump International Golf Club's fence as the Republican presidential nominee was playing on the green about a hole behind Routh's location, according to law enforcement. By Monday, Routh was criminally charged with illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.\n\nWhile the two firearm charges carry a combined maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, they don't match the severity of the \"apparent assassination attempt\" that U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said the FBI is investigating. At a press conference Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he wants a statewide prosecutor to charge Routh with attempted murder under state law because the federal charges are too shallow.\n\n\"I think it's really important for the people of Florida, but also for our country, that we pursue the most serious charges that are on the books to hold this guy accountable,\" DeSantis, a Republican, said. \"And to say you're gonna do a couple gun charges, that is not going to be sufficient to do it.\"\n\nHowever, there is actually a federal statute that criminalizes assassination attempts against major presidential candidates, and several former federal prosecutors said the Justice Department is likely considering it. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nSuspects can't be legally held for lengthy periods without charges, so prosecutors have an incentive to start out with the easiest charges to secure.\n\n\"When you have somebody like Mr. Routh, who presents a threat to public safety and to the presidential candidate, you want to neutralize it, so you pick them up on whatever the simplest thing it is to hold him on,\" Steven Ward, a former terrorism prosecutor at the Justice Department, told USA TODAY. The Justice Department is \"clearly looking\" at a more severe charge, he said.\n\nLawyers for Routh didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nRouth is currently charged through a criminal complaint, which doesn't require prosecutors to convince a grand jury to indict him on the charges. However, Routh can't be convicted unless he is first charged through a grand jury indictment.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. DeSantis' office didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nProving 'attempt' when Routh didn't shoot\n\nA key question for federal prosecutors who want to bring the presidential-candidate-assassination-attempt charge will be whether they can build the evidence to prove Routh's alleged actions amounted to an attempt on Trump's life, even if he never pulled the trigger.\n\nMatthew Schneider, a former US attorney in Michigan, told USA TODAY he expects prosecutors will be able to build that case based on what he knows so far.\n\n\"I mean, he wasn't in the woods at the golf course with this rifle and scope for no reason,\" Schneider said. \"The jurors are instructed to use their common sense – that's a standard jury instruction – and common sense indicates that that's what was going on,\" Schneider said.\n\nLaw enforcement is continuing to investigate, but has already said evidence and testimony indicates Routh lay in wait for 12 hours, pointed a gun through the fence as Trump was about one hole behind, and speedily fled the scene after being shot at. Routh also had a history of using inflammatory political rhetoric on the Internet.\n\nMimi Rocah, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor and New York state district attorney, said on the the CAFE Insider podcast that the question is whether the defendant did enough to show an attempt took place.\n\n\"In my office we used to call it, you know, 'How far (from) 'boom' was the defendant?'\" she said.\n\nIn this case, Rocah said she would be looking for whether Routh told anyone he planned to try to kill Trump, and for how far his preparation had gone.\n\n\"If the only thing that was left was for him to wait for Trump to show up and then take the shot, we may see a prosecution,\" she said.\n\nRocah added, however, that some past court rulings have required a significant bar to prove an attempt took place, and if Routh didn't actually line up for or take a shot at Trump, that may give prosecutors pause.\n\nOther charges Routh could face\n\nThe attempted assassination of a major political candidate isn't the only escalated federal charge Routh could face.\n\nWard pointed to a potential charge for attempting to murder someone who was formerly a federal officer when the attempt was meant to retaliate based on how that person performed official duties. That charge, which has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, might be brought on the theory that Trump was being retaliated against for how he performed official duties as president.\n\nIf Routh pointed the weapon at a Secret Service agent, Schneider said he might also be charged with attempting to kill a U.S. officer who was performing official duties, which also carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.\n\n\"I think it will depend on the testimony of one or more Secret Service agents,\" Preet Bharara, a former Manhattan U.S. attorney, said on the Cafe Insider podcast. \"Did it appear that the gunman was lining up to aim to shoot one of the agents or not?\"\n\nFederal prosecutors may also be considering charging Routh with providing material support for terrorism, a statute that explicitly states it can sometimes be applied to attempted assassinations of major presidential candidates. It comes with a maximum 15-year prison sentence.\n\nThe theory for that potential charge, Ward said, could be that Routh provided himself and his marksmanship to assist in an assassination attempt.\n\nJeffrey Breinholt, a George Washington University law lecturer who worked on counterterrorism at the Justice Department for 25 years, told USA TODAY he thought a terrorism charge is likely.\n\n\"In terrorism cases, you'll typically charge them with something less than the full extent of what we know about their conduct if it has an effect of keeping them in custody,\" he said. That way, prosecutors may have the benefit of talking to suspects after their arrest and the ultimate indictment \"can be informed by the full panoply of what they say.\"\n\nFBI special agent Jeffrey B. Veltri said at a Monday news conference that agents attempted to interview Routh but he invoked his right to a lawyer. Law enforcement interviewed several witnesses from the scene of Sunday's events and were combing through Routh's online presence as well as interviewing his family and friends.\n\nIn addition to those possible charges, federal prosecutors could seek a sentencing enhancement based on the circumstances. Schneider noted there is a potential sentencing enhancement for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.\n\n\"Attempting to kill a presidential candidate – that's a crime of violence,\" he said.\n\nWhy hefty federal charge could hamper DeSantis plans\n\nAt his Tuesday press conference, DeSantis announced an executive order directing a statewide prosecution office \"to ensure that charges are brought for all violations of state law.\"\n\nDeSantis said the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction to bring an attempted murder charge. The Florida governor may have been unaware of the federal statute criminalizing assassination attempts against major presidential candidates.\n\nAs with the Florida state charge for attempted murder, the potential federal sentence for attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate is life in prison.\n\nIf federal officials bring that charge, they could throw a wrench in DeSantis' plans to take the lead on the most serious potential offense. The federal statute on trying to kill a major presidential candidate blocks states from acting while a federal investigation or prosecution is ongoing.\n\nWard said there is \"no doubt\" that provision is meant to give the federal government exclusive power over investigating and prosecuting the attempted murder of a major presidential candidate, although he was less certain how the provision could be enforced.\n\n\"I suspect that were Routh charged by Florida with attempted murder, the defense would move to dismiss the charges,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/13/donald-trump-rushed-off-stage-secret-service-rally/74396110007/", "title": "Donald Trump shot in assassination attempt at rally; gunman killed", "text": "USA TODAY Network staff\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFormer President Donald Trump survived a brazen assassination attempt Saturday evening as a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on a campaign rally, injuring Trump's right ear and killing a spectator, officials said.\n\nTrump was rushed off stage with blood dripping on his face after gunshots rang out at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the sniper, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was killed by Secret Service agents.

The sentencing had been scheduled for Wednesday, July 18.\n\nEarlier this month, however, the judge delayed sentencing until after Election Day, which is Nov. 5.\n\nA 9/11 national monument\n\nIn discussing New York issues, Trump paid tribute to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack and honored the police force, fire departments, and emergency personnel who responded.\n\nTrump said if he is elected he plans to designate Ground Zero - the former site of the destroyed World Trade Center - as an official national monument to be maintained by the U.S. government.\n\n\"So that hallowed ground - and the memory of those who perished there - will be preserved for all time, preserved forever,\" Trump said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/05/trump-assassination-attempt-campaign-butler/75514805007/", "title": "Trump leans into assassination attempt stories on campaign trail", "text": "If history is any indication, surviving an assassination attempt doesn't actually offer much political benefit, but that isn't stopping former President Donald Trump from leaning hard on his near-death experience in the home stretch of his third White House bid.\n\nTrump returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday to hold a rally in the swing-state community where he was shot in the ear by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was quickly killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rally is intended to be a triumphant moment for the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, symbolizing his perseverance and his fighting spirit. Former President Theodore Roosevelt tried something similar when he was shot during a trip to Milwaukee on Oct. 14, 1912, at the height of his third-party campaign to regain the presidency.\n\nRoosevelt insisted on delivering his speech that night, despite a bloodied shirt and what biographer Edmund Morris called a \"dime-sized hole, bleeding slowly, about an inch below and to the right of his right nipple.\" He lost the race anyway.\n\nNo candidate has made surviving an assassination attempt a campaign issue to the extent Trump has.\n\nMore:As Donald Trump returns to Butler, Pa., there’s one name he never mentions: Thomas Crooks\n\nFour days after being shot, Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and declared he had a story to tell, and only would tell it once because it was so traumatic.\n\nTrump hasn’t stopped talking about the shooting, though.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis found that Trump held at least 51 public events since the shooting and mentioned it at 31 of them.\n\nOnce deemed too painful to discuss, the attempt on Trump’s life in Butler has become a central aspect of his campaign and part of the growing lore around him, mythologized and celebrated by the MAGA faithful.\n\nShooting imagery – most notably the picture of Trump pumping his fist on stage moments after being shot, blood smeared across his face – has become part of the MAGA movement’s iconography, reproduced on everything from shirts to flags and Christmas ornaments.\n\nTrump's return to Butler will cement the narrative he tells about the shooting, its role in his campaign and its significance to his supporters.\n\n“President Trump looks forward to returning to Butler, Pennsylvania to honor the victims from that tragic day,” Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told USA TODAY. “The willingness of Pennsylvanians to join President Trump in his return to Butler represents the strength and resiliency of the American people.”\n\nTrump’s Butler story is about heroes and courage under fire, where the actual villain who shot him is ignored and replaced with political opponents, despite no public evidence that Democratic rhetoric motivated the shooter.\n\nTrump has blamed Democrats for the two assassination plots against him, adding to what he claims is a historic level of persecution that extends to the legal cases against him, his two impeachments and a special counsel investigation into his 2016 campaign’s ties with Russia.\n\nShooting alters campaign, but not for long\n\nCrooks opened fire on Trump on Saturday, July 13, just two days before the Republican National Convention was set to begin in the largest city of the 2024 swing state of Wisconsin.\n\nTrump already was looking strong heading into the convention after President Joe Biden’s debate performance a few weeks earlier.\n\nPolls showed Trump ahead of Biden in the key swing states, and there were growing calls for the incumbent 81-year old Democratic president to drop out of the race.\n\nSurviving an assassination attempt rallied support around Trump and gave his campaign a feeling of inevitability. Among the MAGA base, Trump was elevated to near martyr status. Many people in the convention crowd wore white ear bandages in solidarity with Trump, who gave his nomination acceptance speech with a bandaged ear.\n\nYet, within a few days, everything had changed.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race on July 21 and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly secured the Democratic nomination. She has been running much stronger than Biden, and polls indicate the race is now essentially a toss up.\n\nThat Trump hasn't politically benefited much from his brush with death is in line with historical precedent.\n\nJohn A. Tures, a professor of political science at LaGrange College in Georgia who has written about Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who also was shot while running for president in 1972 and survived, said it's a \"myth\" to think that surviving an assassination attempt helps candidates politically. He pointed out that Wallace won more states in the Democratic primaries before the shooting - four - than afterward (three).\n\n\"There’s no evidence of anything more than a slight blip in the polls after any assassination attempt,\" Tures said.\n\n\"I don't see it turning the election any direction\"\n\nLike Trump, Roosevelt incorporated his shooting into his campaign. It didn't help.\n\nRunning as the nominee of the Progressive Party, Roosevelt invoked the group's nickname in his post-shooting speech by saying \"it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.\"\n\nRoosevelt, who left the Republican Party to run against former ally and President William Howard Taft, wound up splitting the Republican vote and clearing the way for victory by Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\n\nWallace's shooting on May 17, 1972, left the then-segregationist in a wheelchair and effectively ended his already longshot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThree presidents eligible for re-election have also survived assassination attempts in the past 75 years, but there were no signs that their political fortunes were affected.\n\nOn Nov. 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists attacked Blair House, where President Harry Truman was staying while the White House underwent renovation. One was killed and the other captured before they could get to the president.\n\nAt the time, historians said, there was some talk that the attack might help Truman revive his sagging political fortunes. It did not, and the incumbent Democratic president didn't even run for re-election in 1952.\n\nAs with other survivors of attempted assassinations, \"it didn't change in any fundamental way his political trajectory,\" said historian Matthew Dallek, who is working on a book about failed presidential assassination attempts and political violence in the 20th century.\n\nTwo decades later, Gerald Ford became the first sitting president to survive two assassination attempts, both in September of 1975.\n\nMonths later, Ford faced a tough Republican primary challenge from Ronald Reagan. Ford held off Reagan but wound up losing the general election to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n\nReagan is the last sitting president to survive an assassination attempt, shot after giving a speech at the Washington Hilton on March 30, 1981.\n\nThat shooting did appear to help Reagan, at least in the short term. His bonhomie after being shot - “I hope you are all Republicans,\" he cracked to surgeons - boosted his standing with the public and likely helped him push Congress to pass a major economic package featuring tax cuts.\n\nBut the public goodwill felt toward Reagan didn't help his party, which suffered a massive defeat in the 1982 congressional elections, amid a raging recession. Two years later, a booming economy fueled Reagan's landslide re-election.\n\nOther factors are likely to decide this year's election as well.\n\n\"Elections are about the fundamentals,\" said David Head, a historian at the University of Central Florida who has studied assassination attempts.\n\nAs for the Trump assassination attempts, Head said: \"I don't see it turning the election any direction, one way or the other.\"\n\nTrump's campaign narrative\n\nTrump has incorporated the attempt on his life into a broader campaign narrative. Returning to Butler could help him drive home that message.\n\n\"I could be having a nice life right now. Nobody would be shooting at me,” Trump said at an Oct. 1 event in Wisconsin.\n\nIn Michigan, a few days earlier, Trump said the only presidents who have “shots fired at them” are “consequential” ones. “I’ve got a lot of enemies,” he added.\n\nRunning for president is a “tough life” Trump said in early September at a Wisconsin rally, adding: “It’s not the easiest. You get shot at.”\n\nFormer Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton, now a regular critic of his one-time boss, said the former president’s response to the Butler shooting is “vintage Trump.”\n\n“The thing that he likes to talk about most is Trump,” Bolton said, adding: “He wants to try to appear as a heroic figure, and he may to some people, in this case he’s not making it up.”\n\nObsessed with strength\n\nBarbara Res worked for Trump in the 1980s and 1990s as executive vice president of the Trump Organization and said he wanted people to think he is “all powerful.”\n\nHis narrative around the shooting is designed to highlight his strength, Res said, while also playing up his constant refrain that a vast array of forces are out to get him.\n\n“Whatever he had to gain was sympathy, strength, how great he handled it,\" Res said. \"Look at the world: They’re after Trump.\"\n\nBolton said Trump benefits more politically from casting the attack as part of a larger plot to get him, rather than focusing on a specific individual.\n\nTrump often tells his supporters that his adversaries are coming to get them, and they’re only going after him because he’s standing in the way. He is tying the Butler shooting into the “vast ‘they’ that are after him,” Bolton said.\n\n“It’s worked for Trump… always being the victim,” Bolton said, adding: “It worked at least once to make him president, and may work again.”\n\nTrump never mentioned Crooks in his 51 public appearances since the shooting that USA TODAY analyzed.\n\nCrooks, 20, remains an enigma. FBI Director Christopher Wray described Trump's would-be assassin as a “loner” who had little interaction “face to face or digitally with a lot of people.” He liked video games and was a “fairly avid shooting hobbyist,” Wray said. Crooks was a registered Republican who donated $15 to a liberal cause.\n\nInstead of focusing on Crooks, Trump has pointed to Democratic rhetoric.\n\n“I took the bullet for democracy,” Trump said in West Palm Beach on July 26, adding: “I might have taken it because of their rhetoric,” referring to Democrats.\n\nTrump supporters rally around him\n\nMany of Trump's supporters believe the shooting is part of a persecution pattern against Trump. Returning to Butler could be a seminal moment for them.\n\nProminent supporters such as Lee Greenwood, whose song “God Bless the USA” opens every Trump rally, and Elon Musk will be in attendance.\n\nMusk endorsed Trump on the day of the shooting, sharing a video showing Trump standing up after being hit, pumping his fist, and yelling “fight, fight, fight.”\n\nThat image and those words have become iconic. The Republican National Convention crowd this summer even broke into chants of “fight, fight, fight.\"\n\n“I believe it’s inspiring to the American people to have a candidate who literally was shot and immediately stands up and says: ‘fight, fight, fight,” said Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. “It’s patriotic. It’s the type of leadership you want.”\n\n(This story has been updated with a link to a live video feed.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/17/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-jd-vance-remarks-rhetoric/75266487007/", "title": "JD Vance: Assassination attempt of Trump shows need to check ...", "text": "SPARTA, Mich. — Just two days after a thwarted assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump rocked a campaign that had already faced political violence, U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio said it's time for everyone — but namely Democratic politicians and campaigns — to check their rhetoric ahead of the Nov. 5 election before further violence takes place.\n\nVance, Trump's running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, spoke to supporters in Michigan Tuesday afternoon about the latest assassination attempt on Trump. The former president was at Trump International Golf Club in Florida Sunday afternoon when Secret Service agents walking the course ahead of him spotted a gun barrel in bushes. Agents opened fire, causing the suspect to flee before he was arrested later that day.\n\n\"Two assassination attempts in as many months, and I think that it's time to say to the Democrats, to the media, to everybody who's been attacking this man and trying to censor this man for going on ten years, cut it out or you're going to get somebody killed,\" Vance said at a campaign event in west Michigan.\n\nSuspect Ryan Routh, who appeared in federal court Monday, never fired a shot, authorities said. He was being held on charges of possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, USA Today reported.\n\nThe events Sunday marked the second time Trump has faced an assassination attempt this year — in July, a gunman fired at Trump, grazing him on the ear, during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. It also intensified scrutiny on the Secret Service, which was already facing questions about how a person with a gun could get so close to Trump in light of the Pennsylvania shooting.\n\nA White House official said Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris called Trump Tuesday to express directly to him that she is grateful that he is safe. The conversation was cordial and brief, the official said.\n\nVance called for Trump to have the same level of security detail as President Joe Biden, telling supporters that \"assassinations destroy the social fabric of this country.\" Biden said Monday that the Secret Service needed more resources, and he encouraged Congress to provide them.\n\nVance said he felt comfortable with the level of security detail he personally receives on the campaign trail, but reiterated a need for less heated rhetoric while campaigning.\n\n\"We want to make it so we cut out the ridiculous rhetoric that I think has put a giant target on Donald Trump's back,\" he said. \"All of us, whether we're Republicans, Democrats, or anything else, all of us can do a better job at showing respect and trying to debate our differences without going into personal attacks.\"\n\nHe said mainstream media has \"both sided\" the assassination attempts against Trump.\n\n\"Do I think the rhetoric is all one-sided? Of course not, there are absolutely people on our side who say things that I think are ridiculous and they shouldn't say,\" Vance said. \"But what is one-sided is that our guy is the one who keeps getting shot at. That's what's one-sided.\n\n\"If people had taken an attempt on Kamala Harris' life, I would be looking in the mirror and saying 'how can we do a lot better?' But here we are, two people have now tried to assassinate Donald Trump, and all the media can talk about is we need more censorship? And they're still talking about Donald Trump like he's a threat that needs to be eliminated? They haven't learned a damn thing, and they're going to get somebody killed.\"\n\nVance was delivering remarks to a few hundred supporters in Sparta, a community of about 4,200 residents around ten miles north of Grand Rapids.\n\nIt was Vance's first public campaign event since the Sunday assassination attempt. Trump also was slated to be in Michigan later Tuesday to hold a town hall discussion in Flint, also his first public campaign event since the most-recent assassination attempt.\n\nVance delivered remarks and took questions from local media in a program that lasted around 45 minutes.\n\nPresidential campaigns have routinely visited Michigan in recent weeks and months, as the state is once again expected to be a key battleground to decide who wins the presidential election between Harris and Trump this November. Opinion polling of voters in Michigan currently shows a near deadlock between Trump and Harris — the RealClearPolling average has Harris leading by 0.7 percentage points.\n\nSparta is also located in Kent County, which once represented a reliable Republican stronghold but has become increasingly competitive in recent presidential elections. Top-of-ticket Democrats have carried the county in statewide elections dating back to 2018, but Trump won Kent County in his first presidential run in 2016 when he went on to win Michigan.\n\nAlong with his comments on the assassination attempt against Trump, Vance continued to criticize Harris for inflation and crossings at the U.S. southern border with Mexico. The topics have been repeatedly raised by Republicans ahead of the fall election.\n\nThe Harris campaign derided Vance's visit to Michigan on Tuesday, and noted that Vance was among the Republican senators who voted against a bill that would have allocated additional resources to border security. The campaign issued a statement from U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, saying in part \"The only candidate in this race who understands working families is Vice President Harris, who has a plan to lower costs, bring good-paying manufacturing jobs back home, and ensure Michigan workers continue to lead the world in auto manufacturing.\"\n\nHarris is expected to be in Michigan this week, as well, joining TV host Oprah Winfrey for a livestreamed broadcast from Michigan Thursday evening.\n\nUSA TODAY contributed.\n\nContact Arpan Lobo: alobo@freepress.com\n\nLooking for more on Michigan’s elections this year?

That shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was killed by the Secret Service.\n\nHere is what happened Sunday and who the suspect is.\n\nWhat happened to Trump? Did Trump get shot?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was not injured when gunshots rang out while he was playing golf at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach Sunday, just minutes away from his Mar-A-Lago home.\n\nU.S Secret Service agents opened fire at a man that was reportedly pointing an AK-47 rifle with a scope from behind a fence, approximately 300 to 500 yards from the former president. The person then took off in a black Nissan, leaving behind the gun, two bags and a GoPro camera.\n\nA witness was able to provide details that were used to locate the vehicle on Interstate 95, and led to the arrest of the suspected gunman, Routh.\n\nTump's campaign later released a statement from him, \"There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” He also posted on his social media to \"thank everyone for your concern and well wishes,\" and wrote, \"It was certainly an interesting day!\"\n\nTrump was not shot or hurt during the incident. \"Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\" the former president said.\n\nWho is Ryan Wesley Routh?\n\nRyan Routh, 58, appeared in federal court Monday and has been charged with two firearm counts.\n\nWhat is known of Routh so far is that he lived in North Carolina for most of his life and moved to Kaaawa, Hawaii in 2018, where he and his son operated a construction company that built sheds.\n\nWhile no motive has been confirmed, it appears through his social media accounts and posts, that Routh may have been motivated by his frustration with the U.S policy on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Routh was in Kyiv's Independence Square two months after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nOther social media posts show Routh as a Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, but changing his position during the 2020 cycle writing, in part, “it seems you are getting worse and devolving,” in the summer of 2020.\n\nMaria Francis is a Pennsylvania-based journalist.

It comes days after Secret Service agents apparently stopped an assassination attempt at his Florida golf course.\n\nThe incident marked the second attempt on Trump's life this summer: He was injured in a shooting at a Pennsylvania rally just days before the Republican convention, and one attendee was killed in the attack.\n\nTrump called campaigning, particularly as a former president, a \"dangerous business\" as he took the stage. He described how law enforcement officials tracked down the suspect in the assassination attempt before turning to issues ranging from the economy to the border and the spread of illegal drugs in the United States. The former president offered few specifics on most of his stances, though he did cite some tariffs he would enact on foreign countries.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's live coverage.\n\nTrump describes woman who helped identify suspect in assassination attempt\n\nTrump on Tuesday again applauded the Secret Service's response to the assassination attempt against him on Sunday. But he told town hall attendees that a woman was driving near the golf course at the time of the incident, and she saw the suspect running and followed him in her car. When he arrived at his vehicle, Trump said she started taking pictures of his license plate and sent it to local authorities.\n\n\"She saw something in this guy that was bad,\" Trump said about the woman, whom he did not name. He joked that \"Women are smarter than men.\"\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump again calls for mass deportations, death penalty for drug dealers\n\nAs Trump addressed the Biden administration's handling of the southern border, he called again for massive deportations and shutting down the border on the first day of a potential second term.\n\nHe also criticized the transportation of illegal drugs over the southern border, calling the death penalty for people who sell the drugs. It's a policy he's often proposed on the campaign trail.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump targets foreign countries' nuclear capabilities, American trade deals as he addresses auto industry challenges\n\nTrump was asked by an auto worker identified as Isaiah about what he feels are the largest threats to autoworking jobs. However, the former president addressed nuclear weapons as the \"single biggest threat\" to the world.\n\nAs he turned back to the auto industry, he again vowed to institute tariffs on foreign made goods, particularly cars, if he's elected to a second term. He called on America to institute the same tariffs on imports that other countries implement on American goods.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump knocks Biden, Harris over Afghanistan, economy\n\nTrump spent much of his introduction at the town hall event targeting the Biden administration's handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. He spoke specifically about the 13 soldiers who were killed in a bombing at an airport in 2021.\n\nHe also spoke about the economy, blaming the Biden administration for steep inflation rates in recent years over its energy policy. It's not clear a shift in energy policy would have prevented an increase in prices.\n\nTrump also mistakenly said Bagram Airfield was in Alaska, the comment coming after he talked about the airfield's presence in Afghanistan.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump quickly turns to issues after addressing thwarted assassination attempt\n\nTrump didn't spend much time talking about the thwarted assassination attempt over the weekend as he gave an introduction to voters. He quickly turned to talking about the economy, with a particular focus on the automobile industry for the Michigan event.\n\nTrump said that, if elected, he'd put a 200% tariff on some foreign-made cars. However, he didn't entirely ignore the shocking incident over the weekend.\n\n\"And then you wonder why I get shot at, right? You know, only consequential presidents get shot at,\" Trump said.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump says he spoke to Biden, Harris after assassination attempt\n\nThe former president said he has spoken to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, his 2024 rival, in the aftermath of the assassination attempt over the weekend.\n\n\"We had a very nice conversation. I appreciated that he called,\" Trump said of Biden. He added that he got a \"very nice call from Kamala.\"\n\n\"It was very nice. We appreciate that,\" Trump said. The former president later added that, regardless of their calls, he feels he still must criticize their leadership.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump's supporters wait hours for town hall event\n\nOutside, some Trump supporters waited many hours to see him at the Dort Financial Center, which seats about 4,000 people for hockey and about 6,000 for concerts and was rapidly filling ahead of Trump's scheduled 7 p.m. appearance.\n\nJudy Tidball of the village of Genesee and Linda Bain of Davison, both retired nurses, weren't sure they would make it to the front of line after arriving shortly before 4 p.m. They said they are huge Trump fans and were anxious to see him speak in person.\n\nBain said thought Trump did a great job as president and she would have great fears for the future of the nation if Harris was elected president. Tidball said she's been hurt by high grocery prices since Biden took office and is also concerned about the border. \"I'm all for immigration, but it has to be legal,\" Tidball said.\n\n– Paul Egan\n\nWhere is Trump's town hall tonight?\n\nTrump is returning to the campaign trail on Tuesday for the first time since the thwarted assassination attempt at one of his Florida golf courses. His campaign is holding a town hall-style event, rallying GOP voters in a pivotal swing state.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWas Trump shot at again?\n\nNo, Ronald Rowe, the acting director of the Secret Service, confirmed that the suspect never had Trump in his line of sight, and he didn't fire any shots.\n\nStill, the incident came after a gunman fired at one of Trump's rallies in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this year. One attendee was killed, and Trump himself was injured, seen with blood dripping down his face as Secret Service removed him from the stage.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nRhetoric 'put a giant target' on Trump, Vance says after second assassination attempt\n\nJust two days after a thwarted assassination attempt against Trump rocked a campaign that had already faced political violence, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, said it's time for everyone – but namely Democratic politicians and campaigns – to check their rhetoric ahead of the Nov. 5 election before further violence takes place.\n\nVance, Trump's running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, spoke to supporters in Michigan Tuesday afternoon about the thwarted assassination attempt on Trump. However, there is no evidence that comments from prominent Democrats inspired the incident.\n\n– Arpan Lobo\n\nWho tried to assassinate Trump? Suspect never had former president in line of sight, Secret Service acting director says\n\nThe suspect never had Trump in his line of sight and did not fire any shots, said Ronald Rowe, acting director of the Secret Service. Trump's visit to his golf course in West Palm Beach was not on his public schedule, Rowe noted, adding that it was not clear whether the suspect knew Trump would be there.\n\n– John Bacon\n\nSuspect appeared in court\n\nSuspect Ryan Routh, who appeared in federal court Monday, never fired a shot, authorities said. He was being held on charges of possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.\n\n– John Bacon\n\nTrump thanks Florida officers who pulled over suspect\n\nTrump held a Mar-a-Lago ceremony for members of the Martin County Sheriff's Office involved in the traffic stop of assassination suspect Ryan Routh.\n\n\"I'm still here,\" Trump joked to the delegation as he thanked deputies for their service, according to video provided by the ex-president's office.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHouse panel demands FBI hearing by end of week\n\nThe House's bipartisan Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald Trump is requesting a briefing with FBI officials about Sunday's apparent assassination attempt before the end of the week, the panel said Tuesday.\n\nIt has also requested a wide-ranging set of documents and interviews with witnesses related to the July 13 assassination attempt, including all related information from the Secret Service, state and local law enforcement, the Trump campaign, and the shooter's family.\n\nThe panel is hoping to expand the scope of its inquiry from investigating the July shooting to investigating both. Its report about the first shooting attempt is expected to be released in mid-December.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nPolice analyzing movements, DNA:Trump assassination attempt suspect probed\n\nKamala Harris calls Trump after assassination attempt\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris spoke Tuesday with Donald Trump following the latest assassination attempt against him.\n\nA White House official said the vice president called the former president and current Republican presidential nominee to express directly to him that she is grateful that he is safe. The conversation was cordial and brief, the official said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke with Trump on Monday. Trump was thankful that Biden called to check on him, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nRouth had explosive device in 2002\n\nNewly released North Carolina court documents reveal more information about the 2002 charge against Ryan Routh involving the “weapon of mass destruction” referenced by his new criminal complaint that made him a felon.\n\nThe document shows Greensboro Police found Routh with a “binary explosive with a 10-inch detonation cord and a blasting cap” in April 2002. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives defines these types of material − such as an oxidizer like ammonium nitrate and a fuel such as aluminum − as legal when separate, but regulated once combined.\n\nThat charge stemmed from the incident depicted in news reports and other court documents where he barricaded himself in his roofing business armed with a machine gun.\n\nA judge sentenced him to 60 months’ probation, substance abuse assessment and treatment.\n\n-Nick Penzenstadler\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre: Biden thinks Secret Service needs more resources\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday reiterated President Biden's belief that the Secret Service should have more resources and said that the Biden administration has raised the issue since August. She said that the president has confidence in Secret Service leadership.\n\nIn response to a question Trump blaming the president and vice president, Jean-Pierre said both have always forcefully condemned political violence.\n\n\"We certainly have never encouraged violence in any way,\" she told reporters.\n\nThey believe that there should be a conversation about the issues, just as there was at last week's debate, Jean Pierre said.\n\n\"It is not the time to tear Americans apart,\" she added. And while they will call that out, they have and will continue to forcefully condemn violence.\n\n\"It is important to bring down the temperature,\" she added.\n\nLater, referring to Jan. 6, the White House press secretary said that the president has to call out \"any type of refusal on the outcome of the election, any type of violent rhetoric\" and that the administration has a \"responsibility\" to be honest with the American people about those threats\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump thanks Secret Service agents, says detail should be expanded\n\nTrump also said his Secret Service detail needs to be expanded. But he lauded the agent who fired shots at the suspect and the agent who whisked Trump and his golfing partners to safety in a golf cart. And he praised the civilian who took photos of the suspect's license plate as he drove away.

On Tuesday, the former president used his Truth Social account to repost an earlier statement in which he said that \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\"\n\nTrump posted the same \"CEASE & DESIST\" claim on the night of Sept. 7, repeating unproved claims that Democrats have engaged in \"cheating\" and \"skullduggery.\" Trump's opponents said he is lying again about the 2020 election and trying to intimidate Democratic voters this time around.\n\n\"He's cracking,\" said an X post from the anti-Trump group The Lincoln Project.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nUkraine ex-soldier: Routh was 'delusional'\n\nRouth, a vocal supporter of Ukraine, was seen as a liability by some soldiers and volunteers there, a former soldier says. Evelyn Aschenbrenner, also an American citizen, told Reuters they served together in and administrative role with Ukraine's International Legion, claiming Routh \"was delusional ... he had this idea that he was the only one who knew how to help Ukraine.\"\n\nReuters reported seeing documents confirming Aschenbrenner's Ukrainian military service. Ukraine has said Routh never actually fought in the war. Routh did spend time in Kyiv and sought to recruit Afghans into the Ukrainian military.\n\n\"There are hundreds of millions of people in the United States who support Ukraine and clearly they are a diverse group of individuals,\" Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said Tuesday. \"We urge everyone to refrain from artificially linking the suspect's actions to Ukraine.\"\n\nGolfing partner lauds 'courageous' Trump, 'heroic' agents\n\nTrump's immediate reaction to Sunday's apparent assassination attempt was an inspiration, Trump friend and golfing partner Steve Witkoff says. Witkoff told Fox News he was playing golf with Trump on Sunday afternoon when shots rang out and the former president was evacuated from the golf course.\n\n\"It was terrible,\" Witkoff said. \"But I got to see... a man who was stoic, courageous, cared about his friends' safety first before his own life.\"\n\nWitkoff said the Secret Service reaction was \"exceptional.\" He said agents \"secured\" Trump after the first gunshot, and by the time the final shot rang out, the president was on his way out of the area. All the shots were fired by the Secret Service in the direction of the suspect, who fled without shooting.\n\n\"It was as if they had practiced it 500 times before. It was pretty awesome to watch them,\" Witkoff said. \"They were heroic because their lives were on the line.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis questions objectivity of federal agencies, says state will investigate\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that he does not have confidence the federal government can conduct a transparent, thorough and impartial probe of Sunday's apparent assassination attempt. DeSantis questioned how agencies attempting to prosecute Trump could also oversee the probe.\n\nHe said he would appoint a statewide prosecutor, under the supervision of the state attorney general, because the case crossed several Florida jurisdictions.\n\n\"I do think that there's a lot of concern about how these (federal) agencies have operated,\" DeSantis said at a briefing Tuesday, adding that the state has jurisdiction over \"the most serious, straightforward offense, which is attempted murder.\"\n\n'We will spare no resource': Merrick Garland commits to probe of incident\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday morning that the FBI is continuing to investigate the apparent assassination attempt against Trump and is working closely with federal and state law enforcement partners.\n\n\"We will all work together to tirelessly determine accountability in this matter,\" Garland said. \"We will spare no resource in this investigation.\"\n\nGarland was speaking at an anniversary event for a Justice Department office that supports trust-building efforts between local police and communities.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSecret Service again scrutinized\n\nThe Secret Service didn’t discover a gunman hiding in the bushes of a West Palm Beach golf course Sunday until Trump was 500 yards away from him, raising additional questions about whether the embattled agency is up to the task of safeguarding the GOP nominee. Rowe praised his agents Monday for thwarting what authorities said was the second assassination attempt against Trump in as many months. Rowe called it a “textbook” example of how his agents were able to identify and neutralize an armed threat to Trump.\n\nRowe said the Secret Service has significantly beefed up its security measures for Trump since he was shot and wounded in the ear in a July 13 assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Days after that shooting, Rowe told lawmakers he was \"ashamed\" of security lapses at the rally.\n\nFlorida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said he was launching a state probe of the Sunday incident.\n\n“The people deserve the truth about the would-be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards,” DeSantis said in a social media post.

A.T. Smith, the deputy director of the Secret Service from 2012 to 2015, said agents do the best they can to accommodate other golfers while discreetly scouring the terrain for potential threats as Trump and his party continued playing. Trump's protective bubble of agents covers a range of three to five holes ahead of and behind him, using high-tech tools for any sign of a potential assailant, Smith said.\n\n“It looks like we did the same thing we've been doing all along,” former Secret Service Director John Magaw said.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/07/16/trump-shooting-assassination-attempt-facts-details/74431164007/", "title": "Facts about Trump assassination attempt: What's real, what's not ...", "text": "The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump comes in an election cycle inundated with questions about what's real.\n\nWe've seen a fake Joe Biden robocall, fabricated Trump statements, fake election filings and all manner of AI and deep fake images and videos. Not to mention the expected array of misleading posts about the presidential race.\n\nThis environment has spurred many to question reality – whether the scenes displayed nationwide by media outlets and on social media really reflect what happened.\n\nBut let's be clear. The shooting was real. Though the investigation is ongoing and some details remain unknown, there is extensive evidence showing what happened at Trump's July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nHere's what we know and how we know it.\n\nFact check roundup: False claims about Trump rally shooting spread online\n\nWas there really an assassination attempt on Trump?\n\nClaims that major news events are staged are hardly original. We saw the same trope after the Hamas attack on Israel, the Baltimore bridge collapse, the 2023 Ohio train derailment, the 2023 Nashville school shooting and many more. This narrative is as wrong now as it was in each of those cases.\n\nAn investigation led by the FBI found that Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, fired multiple shots toward the stage where Trump was speaking to a crowd of his supporters, according to statements released by the FBI and Secret Service. Crooks fired an AR-15-style rifle from a roof about 150 yards away and was killed by Secret Service agents moments after opening fire.\n\nVideos published by multiple news outlets, including USA TODAY, show Trump abruptly reaching for his right ear, looking at his bloody hand and then dropping down behind the podium. People nearby can be heard saying, \"Shots, shots, shots.\" A moment later, Secret Service agents surround Trump and escort him off the stage.\n\nShortly before Crooks opened fire, several rally attendees tried to get the attention of police after witnessing a suspicious man on a roof. Footage they took shows a man with long, light brown hair dressed in a beige shirt and pants can be seen lying down on the upward-slanting roof.\n\n“Someone’s on top of the roof,” a man says in a video posted on social media the next day, while Trump speaks in the background. “Officer! Officer!\" a man yells. “He’s on the roof!” a woman adds.\n\nA July 15 statement from the FBI says it's investigating the incident \"as an assassination attempt … and as potential domestic terrorism.\" It also indicates the bureau has done nearly 100 interviews with \"law enforcement personnel, event attendees and other witnesses.\"\n\nWere shots really fired at Trump rally?\n\nMultiple shots were fired during the incident, contrary to various online claims that the shooting was \"fake\" or \"staged.\"\n\nIn a July 14 statement, the Pennsylvania State Police identified three rally attendees who were \"shot during the attempted assassination of former President Trump at yesterday’s rally in Butler County.\" Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter and father of two, was killed. Two others, David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured.\n\nTrump said in a Truth Social post that he was struck by a bullet in the upper part of his right ear. A photo taken by New York Times photographer Doug Mills shows what appears to be a bullet streaking by Trump's head during the rally.\n\nFact check: Post wrongly claims nothing hit in Trump rally shooting\n\nWas Trump shot?\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump said he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\"\n\n\"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,\" he wrote.\n\nThe statements released by the FBI are not as direct about the cause of Trump's injury, only indicating that the \"shooting incident\" led to \"one victim's death and injuries to former President Trump and other spectators.\"\n\nWho was behind the Trump rally shooting?\n\nAs of July 16, the investigation indicated that Crooks acted alone, according to the FBI, which also noted it \"continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.\"\n\nCrooks, who was not known to the FBI before the incident, worked at a nursing home as a dietary aid, a job that generally involves food preparation. He doesn't have a criminal record in Pennsylvania, according to state court records. No record of him shows up in federal court databases either.\n\nSome former classmates described Crooks as a loner who kept to himself and had few friends. Crooks also appears to have had an affinity for guns. He and his father were members of the Clairton Sportsmen’s Club, a nearby 180-acre complex with rifle, pistol, archery and competition ranges, among other amenities.\n\nThe National Security Council hasn't identified any ties between the assassination attempt and any foreign officials. However, it is still tracking threats by Iran against former Trump administration officials, Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the agency, said in a statement.\n\nFact check: Man pretended he was Trump rally shooter in a viral video\n\nWas the Trump shooter a Republican? Antifa?\n\nVarious unproven claims about the Trump shooter have circulated online, but the little we know about his politics right now is somewhat conflicting.\n\nCrooks is registered to vote as a Republican in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, according to county voter records. His voter registration status has been active since 2021. However, he also made a $15 donation in January 2021 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a group working to increase voter turnout for Democrats, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThe bureau has yet to identify a motive for the shooting, but it has searched Crooks' residence and vehicle, and it also gained access to his phone. However, CNN reported that investigators have not found evidence of a political or ideological impetus and that Crooks' search history did not show he had researched homemade explosives.\n\nFact check: Officials identified Trump shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, not Mark Violets", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/16"}]}

Bill Belichick has no soul. Tom Brady is too perfect – and he wears Uggs. And let’s not even start on how New England has come to look at the Super Bowl as its party, a second Patriots Day if you will.\n\nSo when the Patriots play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, it’s pretty obvious who the favorite is going to be.\n\n“Patriots.”\n\n“Patriots.”\n\n“I’m a Brady fan.”\n\n“Patriots.”\n\n“New England.”\n\n“I don’t really care who wins but I’d probably pick the Patriots.”\n\nWait, what? Where’s all the animosity? The angst? The smoldering resentment? According to the annual survey by Public Policy Polling, the Patriots are the most hated team in the NFL for a second year in a row. Just 27% want to see them win the Super Bowl while 53% are rooting for Atlanta.\n\nBut ask fans wearing jerseys of teams other than the Patriots or Falcons here this week and you find that the whole “Patriots as the Evil Empire” thing might be a tad overblown.\n\n“I kind of want Brady to solidify his legacy and win his fifth ring,” said Colby Dukes, who lives in Houston and is a Chargers fan the other 51 weeks of the year.\n\nMORE SUPER BOWL LI COVERAGE:\n\nSecretive anti-Trump protests to erupt Super Bowl weekend in Houston\n\nIs greed slowing the NFL's growth?\n\nAdmiration for Brady was a recurring theme among those who said they’re supporting the Patriots. After all, a win over the Falcons would make him the first quarterback with five Super Bowl rings, and might provide a definitive answer to the question of whether he is the greatest of in NFL history.\n\nThis will be Brady’s seventh Super Bowl appearance. Given that Sunday’s is No. 51 – LI for you Roman numeral fans -- that means the Patriots quarterback has played in almost 14% of all Super Bowls. He also ranks in the top four on the career list in touchdowns, yards passing and QB rating.\n\nNot bad for a sixth-round pick out of Michigan.\n\n“I’ll root for Brady and the Patriots. I want to witness greatness,” said Stan Kristynik, whose brother Clayton described the two as “born and raised to bleed (Cowboys) blue.”\n\nRod Rickett has been watching – and rooting – for Brady since his days at Michigan.

While there is something impressive about witnessing a dynasty -- see the Chicago Bulls during the Jordan Era, UCLA in the Wooden years or the Montreal Canadiens juggernaut from the early 1950s through the late 1970s – it also can get a little, how shall I put this? Boring.\n\n“The Patriots have so many rings,” said Antonio Gonzalez, a Houston Texans fan.\n\nThe Patriots don’t always make themselves easy to love, either. The players come off as buttoned-down and boring, and Belichick acts as if he’s being asked to give away state secrets anytime he’s asked, well, anything.\n\nIt’s like watching a Fortune 500 company operate – only on the football field.\n\nAnd then there are the scandals. Spygate, Deflategate. If there’s a way to bend – or break -- the rules, it seems as if Belichick and the Patriots find it.\n\n“They’re cheaters.

But who will be the top player in next year's draft class?\n\nOdds are out for who will be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft, and early indications point to one of two stars on the Colorado Buffaloes. Which player it will be will depend heavily on which team ends up securing the top pick in the draft.\n\nThe Panthers and the Giants are two of the nine teams in the NFL with only two wins through the first half of the 2024 season. As a result, they're a couple of top contenders for the most coveted pick in the draft. Something will have to give when the two teams face off in Germany in Week 10 for the NFL's fifth and final international game of the year.\n\nWill Carolina be the worst team in the NFL for a second year in a row? Or will New York hold that distinction for the first time in the Super Bowl era?\n\nNFL draft 2025: Odds for No. 1 pick\n\nThe following players top BetMGM's latest odds for the No. 1 overall pick in next year's draft. With four weeks remaining in the college football season and nine weeks left in the NFL, plenty of change can and will occur with these odds.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n1. Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado: +300\n\nThe son of Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders is the current favorite to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft according to BetMGM.\n\nThrough eight games, Sanders has attempted exactly 300 passes. He's eighth in the nation with his 2,591 passing yards, his 21 touchdown passes are tied for third-most and his 73.3% completion rate is tied for second-best. The Colorado quarterback has also thrown six interceptions this year, which is tied with several other top quarterback prospects: Texas' Quinn Ewers, Miami's Cam Ward and Alabama's Jalen Milroe.\n\nSanders is an accurate passer with good arm strength, ball placement and field vision, and he's been able to do it all behind a poorly rated offensive line. For many talent evaluators, the 22-year-old is the top quarterback in the 2025 class.\n\n2. Cam Ward, QB, Miami (FL): +450\n\nSanders' biggest competitor for the top quarterback spot in next year's draft is Ward, the Miami (FL) quarterback and Washington State transfer.\n\nWard is one of the flashiest quarterbacks in college football this year with an ability to consistently generate explosive plays thanks to a strong arm and excellent touch. It's part of the reason he leads FBS quarterbacks with 29 touchdown passes and has the second-most passing yards (3,146) of the bunch.\n\nThe Hurricanes starter is capable of improvising and extending plays with his solid vision in the pocket and ability to throw from a variety of arm angles. However, he's also capable of major, crushing mistakes. Ward can be susceptible to bad interceptions when he tries to make something out of nothing rather than throwing the ball away for a harmless incompletion.\n\n3. Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado: +750\n\nHunter is just ahead of Ward on BetMGM for odds to win this year's Heisman Trophy, and with good reason. The Colorado two-way star is a legitimate contributor on both sides of the ball and is a good part of the reason why the Buffaloes have won six games in a season for the first time since 2016.\n\nAs a wide receiver, Hunter is 17th of all FBS players with 757 receiving yards, a number that also makes him the third-most productive pass-catcher in the Big 12. His 60 receptions this year are 10th-most of any receiver this year and his eight touchdowns are tied for ninth. Hunter can line up on the inside or outside of the formation, is a plus route-runner with his fluidity in and out of breaks and has excellent acceleration and speed to extend his yards before and after the catch.\n\nAs a cornerback, the 21-year-old is also a legitimate difference-maker. He is tied for 19th among FBS defensive backs with seven pass defenses, which tops the Big 12. He's also pulled in two interceptions and forced a fumble this season, the latter of which came at the goal line to give Colorado a conference win over Baylor in late September.\n\nAt this point, it's unclear where teams would rather have Hunter play, or whether he'll continue to play on both sides of the ball. But given that there are several teams with poor records that aren't in need of a quarterback (see: Patriots, Jaguars), Hunter has a real shot at being the top pick in next year's draft.\n\n4. Carson Beck, QB, Georgia: +1200\n\nWhen the 2024 college football season began, Beck was the favorite to be the top pick in the 2025 NFL draft. Even though his odds have dipped, the Georgia quarterback is not completely out of the conversation.\n\nBeck is 15th among FBS quarterbacks with his 2,302 passing yards, including multiple games with over 400 passing yards this season. However, his recent play has raised concerns for his decision-making and NFL future with eight interceptions in his last three games, raising his total to 11 so far this season.\n\n5. Will Campbell, OT, LSU: +1400\n\nCampbell had been considered a top prospect at his position for two full years before the 2024 season even began.\n\nThe LSU tackle earned second-team All-SEC honors in 2022 and first-team All-SEC recognition last year. Pro Football Focus (PFF) rated Campbell as the second-best pass blocker in the country as a freshman in 2022 behind only Northwestern's Peter Skoronski, who was the No. 11 overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft. In 2023, PFF gave Campbell the fifth-highest run block rating in college football.\n\nCampbell will be another option for teams that are both set at quarterback and in contention for the top pick in the 2025 NFL draft.\n\nNFL draft 2025: Draft order after Week 9", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/01/03/jaguars-josh-allen-ross-matiscik-make-2024-pro-bowl-games/72100374007/", "title": "Jaguars Pro Bowlers for 2024: Josh Allen, Ross Matiscik", "text": "Jacksonville Jaguars outside linebacker Josh Allen and long snapper Ross Matiscik were voted to the 2024 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL announced as part of their Pro Bowl roster reveal show Wednesday night.\n\nThis marks the second year in a row that the NFL has utilized the \"Pro Bowl Games\" rather than the classic Pro Bowl game that was played for years in the past.\n\nThe event this year consists of skill competitions and non-contact flag football games. The first block of skills competition will take place on Feb. 1 and other events are scheduled for Feb. 4 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando.\n\nLast year, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and return specialist/receiver Jamal Agnew made the games.\n\nAs a rookie in 2019, Allen made the Pro Bowl as an alternate. This year, he's enjoying the best season of his career, posting 16.5 sacks through 16 games. He's currently second in the league in pressures with 94, according to ESPN.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nAllen's 16.5 sacks are the most in a single season in team history. He broke former teammate Calais Campbell's record of 14.5 this past Sunday against the Panthers with a three-sack performance.\n\nHe's totaled 61 tackles, 16 tackles for loss and 31 quarterback hits, two forced fumbles and an interception this season.\n\nCurrently, Dallas Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons leads the league with 98 total pressures and Pittsburgh Steelers pass rusher T.J. Watt and Cincinnati Bengals pass rusher Trey Hendrickson lead the league in sacks with 17.\n\nSince being drafted with the seventh-overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, Allen has quickly become the team's most productive pass rusher. He's accounted for 44 sacks across 73 games played. Allen's 44 sacks are the second-most in a career in team history.\n\nHe's totaled 246 tackles, 101 quarterback hits and 52 tackles for loss in his career.\n\nMatiscik, who signed with the Jaguars as an undrafted free agent in 2020, will enjoy his first Pro Bowl Games appearance this year. He signed a five-year, $5.965 contract before the 2022 season.\n\nHe has accounted for eight special teams tackles this year, the most in the league among long snappers. He leads all Jaguars in special teams tackles this year ahead of safety Daniel Thomas. In Week 11, Matiscik forced a fumble and recovered it, giving the team momentum to win against the Tennessee Titans.\n\n\"The good thing about our guy, Ross (Matiscik), his snaps, to the average person isn’t a big deal, but his ability to snap with velocity, keep the laces away where Logan [Cooke] rarely has to turn them, that’s huge, so that kicker gets to look at that ball without seeing the laces, no spins, just nicely in a good position,\" Jaguars special teams coordinator Heath Farwell said just before the 2023 season when asked about his long snapper.\n\n\"His ability to block, his protection, his ability to move his feet, get in front, his strength, pad level is fantastic. He was our leading tackler in the preseason on special teams, so his ability to go down the field, a former linebacker, to go down and be a factor is something other teams have to be aware of and potentially have to account for him.”\n\nTrevor Lawrence headlines Jaguars Pro Bowl alternates list\n\nWhile they didn't make it on the initial list, seven other Jaguars could have their names called if other players drop out after being named alternates.\n\nJaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence leads the list, being named an alternate for a second-straight year. Return specialist Jamal Agnew also was named as an alternate for a second-straight year. Both players ultimately made the Pro Bowl last year after others dropped out.\n\nAlong with Lawrence and Agnew, punter Logan Cooke, tight end Evan Engram, RB Travis Etienne, LB Foye Oluokun and CB Darious Williams were named as alternates, the Jaguars announced Thursday.\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

Blockade in Israel-Hamas war ...", "text": "The Israeli military called for the evacuation of Gaza City Friday ahead of an expected ground invasion against Hamas, which controls the territory. Israel’s order calls for people living in north Gaza to move south of the Wadi Gaza area, located in the middle of the Gaza strip. Hamas, which launched the deadly incursion into Israel on Oct. 7, told residents to remain in place.\n\nThe United Nations has called for Israel to rescind the order to avoid what it calls a “horrendous” humanitarian crisis. The order would effectively give more than 1 million Palestinians, many of them impoverished, a day to flee their homes. Israel says it’s ordered the evacuation to spare civilians ahead of a ground invasion?\n\n“This will only lead to unprecedented levels of misery and further push people in Gaza into the abyss,” the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said in a statement Friday.\n\nLive updates:Some flee northern Gaza after Israeli evacuation order\n\nWhat is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza is central to the Israel-Hamas conflict. The 139-square-mile strip borders Israeli territory on its northeastern and southeastern sides and Egypt to its southwest. The Mediterranean Sea is to the west. It is one of two Palestinian territories and home to at least 2.23 million people.\n\nTo understand more about the long history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, read our full explainer.\n\nHamas -- a Palestinian Islamist political and military organization -- has controlled Gaza since 2007. After winning the 2006 parliamentary elections in the region, Hamas seized control from the Palestinian Authority, a governing body that oversees parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nHamas staged a brutal surprise attack on Israel nearly a week ago and has fired thousands of rockets since. Israel has responded with a heavy aerial bombardment and has sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping all entry of food, water, medicine and fuel. At least 2,800 people have died on both sides.\n\nWhy can't people leave Gaza?\n\nThe U.N. says the mass evacuation orders will affect more than a million people. A total evacuation would mean the entire 2.23 million population of Gaza would have to squeeze into the southern half of the strip. Gaza, which is only 25 miles long in its entirety and just over twice the size of Washington, D.C., is the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world.\n\nMany are also voicing uncertainty about safety anywhere in the strip if they leave their homes.\n\nGaza is surrounded by blockades imposed by Israel and Egypt, which restrict movement. Israel prevents access to and from Gaza by sea and air. Land movement is restricted to three crossings: the Egypt-controlled Rafah crossing and Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings, which Israel controls.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza perimeter consists of barbed wire fences, underground concrete walls to prevent tunneling and a 325-foot no-go and high-risk zone. You can view USA TODAY’s illustration of this area here.\n\nHamas operates a network of tunnels, which it has used to smuggle in goods and weapons and to launch attacks into Israel. Israeli Defense Forces indicated the tunnels, some beneath homes, sheltered militants and would be a focus of their offensive. They urged Gazans to flee.\n\nWhat role does Egypt, which borders Gaza, play?\n\nThere are just two ways to leave Gaza: through Israel, and through Egypt, which is strongly opposed to allowing people from Gaza to cross into its territory. Egypt fears being drawn deeper into the crisis. Gazans \"must stay steadfast and remain on their land,\" Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said this week.\n\nEgypt’s Rafah crossing is the main exit point from Gaza not under Israeli control, but it’s been closed since Tuesday after being hit by Israeli strikes. Egypt is discussing plans with the U.S. to provide humanitarian aid through the border but will not take in refugees fleeing the strip, Al Jazeera reports.\n\nEgyptian officials have historically encouraged Palestinians to remain in Gaza, in part because accepting refugees could widen the conflict.\n\nAccording to the U.N. humanitarian office, more than 400,000 people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip. Even before the October conflict began, about 81% of the Gaza population was living in poverty and 63% of Gaza residents were food insecure.\n\nThe U.S. government has been able to help U.S. citizens to leave parts of Israel, but Gaza departures remain difficult.\n\nWhy is Gaza under blockade?\n\nThe 16-year-old blockade began after Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael says its economic and physical blockade is necessary to isolate Hamas. Backed by Egypt, the Israeli government has restricted the import of goods they say could be used for weaponry and blocked many Palestinians from leaving Gaza. The result has been a starved economy, astronomically high unemployment, and a buckling hospital system.\n\n“Israel, with Egypt’s help, has turned Gaza into an open-air prison,” Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at the non-government organization Human Rights Watch has said.\n\nEgypt’s participation in the blockade – and subsequent border closing – stems in part from a fear that the conflict will spill outside of Israel.\n\n“Egypt will not allow the Palestinian cause to be settled at the expense of other parties,” Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said Tuesday, according to The New York Times.\n\nIsrael-Hamas War newsletter:Get the latest news and analysis on the conflict in your inbox\n\nWhere do Gaza refugees go?\n\nRight now, many displaced Gazans are taking shelter in U.N. schools. There are eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip with some of the highest population densities in the world, the U.N. states.\n\nAmerican officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, are turning up the pressure on Egypt to allow Gazans to leave through Egypt’s Rafah crossing point.\n\nContributing: Anna Kaufman, Thao Nguyen, Trevor Hughes, Jeanine Santucci, Josh Meyer, Tom Vanden Brook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/12/06/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/71822499007/", "title": "Israel Hamas updates: Freed hostages feared being killed by bombs", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet were assailed by released hostages and the families of those still being held by Hamas, who shared the horror of their experiences and questioned the government’s efforts to free the nearly 140 who remain in captivity.\n\nIn a heated meeting Tuesday, Netanyahu and his colleagues argued that the only way to obtain concessions from Hamas is through a military campaign, and some relatives of hostages shouted “shame’’ at the prime minister when he raised the question of how to get the rest of the captives back.\n\n“This entire performance was ugly, insulting, messy,’’ Dani Miran, the father of a male hostage, told Israel's Channel 13, according to Reuters. Miran said he was so upset, he walked out midway through the meeting.\n\nIsrael’s Ynet News published portions of audio from the session, in which a hostage who had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz tells about her ordeal. She was released along with more than 100 other captives during the weeklong truce that ended Friday and said she feared for her life because of the Israeli airstrikes.\n\n“We were in tunnels, terrified that it would not be Hamas but Israel that would kill us, and then they would say Hamas killed you,’’ she said. “So I strongly urge that the prisoner exchange begins as soon as possible and everyone needs to return home.’’\n\nAnother former hostage who was freed with her daughters but not her husband questioned how much the Israeli government knows about what Hamas is doing and raised the alarm about plans to flush out its fighters from the tunnels under Gaza.\n\n\"We felt as though no one was doing anything for us. The reality is that I was in a hideout that was bombed and we became wounded refugees,\" she said. \"My husband was separated from us three days before we returned to Israel and was taken to the tunnels. And you're talking about flooding the tunnels with seawater?\"\n\nSome families of hostages have accused Netanyahu of prioritizing the destruction of Hamas above freeing the hostages. He argued that it wasn’t until the Israel Defense Forces launched their ground attack that Hamas was willing to negotiate their release.\n\n“The second matter you raised, which is distressing, is hearing about the ordeals you endured with our bombings and military operations, those of the IDF, and it continues. It’s true,’’ Netanyahu said. “I find it deeply saddening. I can assure you that it’s not just saddening, as my colleagues will affirm, it also influences their operational considerations. And if you intended to convey this message, you have succeeded.’’\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Yehya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader in Gaza, and military chief Mohammed Deif grew up in a refugee camp in Khan Younis, the southern city Israel is now attacking. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Sinwar is “not above ground, he is underground,” adding, ”Our job is to find Sinwar and kill him.”\n\n∎ Some women in Gaza have been seeking increasingly scarce menstrual pads through social media. “For women and girls, the suffering is double,” said a Palestinian woman who identified herself as Umm Ahmed. “It’s more humiliation.”\n\n∎ Netanyahu said a \"minimal amount'' of fuel will be allowed into the southern Gaza Strip occasionally to prevent a humanitarian crisis and the spread of disease. Israel has mostly blocked fuel supplies from entering the territory since the war started, saying Hamas takes it for military purposes.\n\n∎ With the border city of Rafah swelling to more than twice its usual population of 280,000 because of incoming refugees, Egypt has deployed thousands of troops and erected earthen barriers to prevent a mass influx of Palestinians. Egypt says such migration would undermine its decades-old peace treaty with Israel.\n\n∎ The Gaza Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 16,200, and more than 42,000 people have been wounded. The ministry said 70% of the dead were women and children. Israel has not disputed the counts but says it has killed more than 5,000 militants and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\n\n'In the heart of Khan Younis':Israel sweeps into major city in south Gaza\n\n'The worst of all wars': Hungry Palestinians fighting over food\n\nPalestinians at shelters in Gaza's second-largest city were fighting each other over food Wednesday while the urban combat outside intensified, as Israeli ground forces clashed with Hamas militants in the center of Khan Younis.\n\nThe United Nations says the fighting and road closures have made it impossible to distribute humanitarian aid to almost all of Gaza's southern half, where the vast majority of the enclave's 1.87 million displaced people − more than 80% of the population − have fled.\n\nThe scarcity of sustenance has led to skirmishes in U.N.-run shelters, said Nawraz Abu Libdeh, a shelter resident who has been displaced six times. “The hunger war has started,” he said. “This is the worst of all wars.”\n\nMore than 1,200 Palestinians were killed − 70% of them women and children − in the first five days since hostilities resumed Friday after a weeklong truce, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe city of Rafah in the far south remains one of the few spots in Gaza that offers relative safety and distribution of essentials like food and water, so tens of thousands of displaced people have trekked there in recent days, creating massive overcrowding. Shelters are beyond capacity and many of the new arrivals are sleeping on the streets, some in tents, others under the stars.\n\n“You find displaced people in the streets, in schools, in mosques, in hospitals … everywhere,” said Hamza Abu Mustafa, a teacher who lives near a school-turned-shelter in Rafah and is hosting three families.\n\nThey're not certain to remain safe. On Wednesday evening, an Israeli strike in the Shaboura district knocked down a home and sent several injured people to a hospital, including at least six children.\n\nAt least 10 hostages were sexually assaulted or abused, physician says\n\nAt least 10 men and women among the 110 released hostages were sexually assaulted or abused, a physician who treated some freed captives told the Associated Press. The doctor declined to provide more details and spoke on condition of anonymity to protect the hostages’ identities.\n\nHamas leaders issued a statement Wednesday dismissing the claims as \"echoing baseless accusations of the Zionist propaganda to justify the atrocious killing of children, women and civilians in Gaza.\"\n\nFifteen women are believed to be among the more than 130 people still being held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, the Israeli military says. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the army is “absolutely” concerned about sexual violence against female hostages. President Joe Biden called the reports of sexual violence “appalling” and urged the world to condemn “horrific accounts of unimaginable cruelty.”\n\nFreed Israeli girl says her dog a 'huge help' in captivity\n\nFreed Israeli hostage Mia Leimberg, who took her dog with her when she was seized by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, says Bella was a “huge help” while in captivity.\n\nMia, 17, was released along with her mother a week ago. She says in a video posted Wednesday on social media that she believes her captors didn’t take Bella away because the puppy was quiet and went unnoticed.\n\n“It was quite a journey for both of us,” Mia says. “Overall, she was a huge help to me. She kept me be busy. She was moral support.”\n\nMia, who lives in Jerusalem, was kidnapped with several other family members from a safe room in her aunt’s home in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed and at least 240 were taken hostage that day.\n\nWhile in Gaza, she said she fed leftovers to Bella, a Shih Tzu, and tried to keep her from “exploring too much” around the area where they were held.\n\n“I am so happy that I managed to do this journey with her,” Mia said. “I think honestly if it was a louder dog, if they had seen her as a bother, I think they would not have let me keep her.”\n\nMia said she feels fine physically, does not feel traumatized mentally and is able to sleep. But she says it was a difficult experience and that “it will take quite a while to sink in.”\n\nTurkish leaders warn Israel not to kill Hamas beyond Gaza\n\nIsrael will pay a “heavy price” if it expands its war on Hamas to assassinate militant leaders living in Turkey or elsewhere outside the Gaza Strip, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.\n\nHamas leaders have routinely sought safe havens in Qatar, Lebanon, Iran, Russia and Turkey. Israel has generally refrained from pursuing them to avoid diplomatic upheaval. But since the murderous foray into Israel on Oct. 7, Israel has warned that no place will be safe for Hamas leaders. Netanyahu recently said he instructed the Israeli spy agency Mossad to \"act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are.\"\n\nErdogan warned that Israel would find Turkish intelligence and security agencies a powerful adversary.\n\n“If they dare to take such a step against Turkey and Turkish people, they will be doomed to pay a price which they cannot recover from,” Erdogan told Turkey's Anadolu News Agency. “Those who attempt such a thing should not forget that the consequences can be extremely serious.\"\n\nBlinken discusses Gaza with top Chinese diplomat\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday discussed recent U.S. diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the war. Blinken reiterated the imperative of all parties working to prevent the conflict from spreading, the State Department said in a statement.\n\nFront and center was a discussion of the recent Houthi attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea. Blinken said the attacks posed an unacceptable threat to maritime security and international law \"that all nations have an obligation to uphold.\"\n\nThe two sides are mostly in agreement on Gaza, and both governments support a two-state solution. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed the need for an immediate cease-fire, ensuring the humanitarian corridors are safe and unimpeded, and preventing the expansion of the conflict.\n\nCritical Gaza hospital on life support as war rages on\n\nFuel and medical supplies have reached critically low levels at Al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip because of road closures despite the hundreds of patients needing emergency treatment after the Israeli bombardment, Doctors Without Borders warned. The hospital has been receiving on average 150 to 200 war-wounded patients daily. Without electricity, ventilators would cease to function, blood donations would have to stop and the sterilization of surgical instruments would be impossible, the group said.\n\n“There are 700 patients admitted in the hospital now, with new patients arriving all the time,\" said Marie-Aure Perreaut Revial, the group's emergency coordinator. \"We are running out of essential supplies to treat them.”\n\n85% of Gaza residents driven from their homes by war\n\nAlmost 1.9 million people, or 85% of the Gaza Strip population, have been forced from their homes since the war began two months ago, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees says. About 1.2 million of them are living in United Nations-provided shelters, the agency says. The death toll of UNRWA workers has climbed to 130.\n\n“Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said at a news conference in Geneva, calling for a cease-fire. “My humanitarian colleagues have described the situation as apocalyptic.”\n\nUS Navy ship battles in Red Seaagainst Houthi militants: How it unfolded\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/05/muslim-americans-struggle-for-understanding-the-excerpt/73548008007/", "title": "As the Israel-Hamas war unfolds, Muslim Americans struggle for ...", "text": "On today's episode of The Excerpt podcast: It's now been nearly seven months since Hamas attacked Israel, killing nearly 1200 Israelis and taking over 200 hostage.

In this episode, we are featuring an interview with Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. For a different perspective, we invite you to also listen to last Sunday's episode, which featured Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization. Now on to today's show.\n\nIt's now been nearly seven months since Hamas attacked Israel killing nearly 1200 Israelis and taking over 200 hostage. Since then, the Israeli Defense Forces or IDF have executed a devastating bombing campaign and sent in ground forces to, quote, unquote, \"eradicate Hamas.\" The death toll in the Palestinian enclave is staggering with more than 34,000 killed according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The majority of those killed are women and children, the health ministry says. The sheer scale of the tragedy unfolding in Gaza is unprecedented. The UN estimates that more than 70% of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been displaced. Food and medical supplies aren't nearly enough to meet the needs. Meanwhile, here at home, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim incidents have surged. I'm now joined by Nihad Awad, co-founder and national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations or CAIR, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy non-profit. Thanks for being on The Excerpt, Nihad.\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nThank you for having me, Dana.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nLet's start with the pro-Palestinian protests, which are still active and growing across the country. These demonstrations have led to some Jewish students being harassed and feeling unsafe on campus. The Anti-Defamation League or ADL has come out pretty strongly against the protests. On a recent episode of Morning Joe on MSNBC, its president Jonathan Greenblatt said about them, \"Iran has their military proxies like Hezbollah, and Iran has their campus proxies like these groups like SJP and JVP.\" SJP stands for the Students for Justice in Palestine, and JVP, the Jewish Voice for Peace. And there are two student-led groups that are key stakeholders in organizing and encouraging these campus protests. You called for MSNBC to ban Greenblatt from the network following this statement. Why do you think he made this accusation?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nI think that question has to be asked to him, why did he accuse American legitimate voices who uphold the tradition of free speech and they are reviving the tradition of protests and objecting to our universities being part and parcel in the investment and perpetuating of genocide by doing business with states like the State of Israel. These students have to be applauded for awakening our society and reminding it to living up to our ideas of being fair and being respectful and protecting the rights of all people, whether here at home or around the globe. That's why people look up to America. And when we look at our history, we applaud those students. Even Columbia University itself on its website they applaud the students of the 1968 who stood up to the university itself and the administration who were supporting the Vietnam War. So those voices are critical to our mission as a society.\n\nProtests or protest is as American as apple pie, so we have to revive this tradition because it led to important social change and important policy change from school segregation to child labor, to improved environmental standards, too many things, and it was uncomfortable. To accuse those people of being foreign agents and accusing even Jewish students of being Jewish agents to foreign countries, I think it's an insult to the intelligence of people. And people in responsible position, they have to watch those statements.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWell, emotions are running hot right now on both sides and both the ADL and CAIR have said things that the other side finds incendiary. Do you think that community leaders like yourself, like Greenblatt deserve some grace for statements made in the moment right now? How do you engage with the substance of this very important conversation without adding fuel to the fire?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nAbsolutely. We all have to be responsible and we all have to be genuine in not only what we say, but what we actually do. And that's leadership. Leadership is not about just saying words about taking action. And those students, let's remember why they are putting everything on the line. Their education, their safety, their prospect careers, not only them but also faculty members. And these are very diverse. They're not Palestinian or Muslim, they are Jewish, they are Christian, they are people of different backgrounds. You just look at their faces. These people put it all on the line to protest the genocide, the onslaught that's taking place in Gaza at the hands of the Israeli government supported by our government and some of our universities.\n\nSo these people are the beacon of hope that we should come around and listen to them. And all, if we are genuine in our advocacy and our personal and professional work, we have to make our society better. We have to make the world a better place. And today the world is watching what's taking place in Gaza and while the global community is up in arms supporting the Palestinians, demanding action, demanding the end of the genocide. Unfortunately, university officials like at the University of Columbia and other universities, our elected representatives including the White House, are turning not only a blind eye, they are aiding, abetting the oppressor with our tax dollar dollars and also with our war machines. I mean, this is incredibly disheartening for all of us, but especially for me.\n\nThis is personal for me. I'm an American Palestinian. I was born and raised in a refugee camp as a result of my parents being ethnically cleansed from their own town in historic Palestine just because they were not Jewish. As a result, we have been dispersed around the world, and some of our family members still live in refugee camps in Palestine. To me, it's not only personal, I feel that I have the obligation to clear not only the misunderstanding, the historic misinformation about our people who have been dehumanized, who have been blamed for their own suffering. So we all have to work together to uphold the values of justice for all.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWe had a recent report released by CAIR citing a surge in complaint, citing anti-Muslim speech, Islamophobia, and other threatening incidents in 2023 with a clear surge following October 7th. Tell me what American Muslims have been saying about their experiences since October 7th, and please share what CAIR's reporting and vetting processes in these incidences.\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nOur organization has been fighting for social justice and for the civil rights and human rights of American Muslims ever since we started in 1994. And we started documenting and issuing an annual report, the first and only of its kind that highlights the status of Muslim civil rights in the country. And since then we have been meticulous in receiving reports and not only receiving reports, vetting them, investigating each and every single report and complaint that we receive. And this vetting process, they have been handled by professional attorneys with paralegals and case intake officers nationwide. We have 30 some offices in major cities and states, and ever since 1996 in particular, CAIR started to issue a regular report. The feeling of anti-Muslim incidents hits home to many members of our community. In fact, we've conducted numerous surveys consistently. The majority of American Muslims more than 53% believe that in their lifetime they have suffered one form of Islamophobia with either physical harm, discrimination, or any form of anti-Muslim sentiments in their professional or private lives.\n\nIn the past, last year 2023, our current report, which is the 2024 report, we cited a massive wave of increase of Islamophobia. We reported 8,061 cases, the majority of which happened between October and end of December. And that is a 56% jump over the previous year surpassed even the period following the Trump era when he imposed the Muslim ban. That increase and the 8,061 cases is the highest recorded by our organization ever since we started this process. And obviously, the categories include immigration cases, asylum cases, workplace discrimination, hate crimes, and violence. And I'm sure our media highlighted some of these very tragic cases, including the stabbing to death of a Palestinian child, six-year-old Wadea Al Fayoume in the suburb of Chicago, who was stabbed about 26 times to death, and his mother was choked and stabbed by the landlord where they live.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThere has also been a surge in anti-Semitism here in the U.S. since the Hamas attacks with dozens of physical assaults and hundreds of acts of vandalism. In addition, American Jews have experienced an alarming increase in hate speech that have left them feeling genuinely frightened and unsure of their place in America. Something that was brought up at the recent House committee hearing at which Columbia University President Minouche Shafik testified that is also frequently chanted at pro-Palestinian protests is the phrase, \"From the river to the sea. Palestine will be free.\" Many Jews experience this language as an existential threat in that from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea includes land that is currently part of the State of Israel. Do you support this use of language, and if so, why?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nWell, look, to me and to all of us, anti-Semitism is no different than Islamophobia. It's a form of unacceptable hate, prejudice against Jews because of who they are. Any form of prejudice, Jews, or action against any people because of their background, because of their faith, should completely be rejected and condemned by all people, period. No question there. And we have a long, long tradition of condemning anti-Semitism and being at the forefront of condemning this phenomenon and calling for the protection of our Jewish sisters and brothers in the communities. We have a long history as Jews and Christian and Muslim of coexistence in America and around the world.\n\nIf people chant from the river to the sea, it depends on what they mean. If I hear this, I would like to see Palestine, free of discrimination, free of apartheid, free of double standards for both population. I would like to see in the same thing that happened to the South African society. When people worked and fought against apartheid, they were not calling for the destruction of the white people, they were seeking equal justice under the law. That's what I see when we would like to see the historic Palestine free of prejudice, free of oppression where Jews, Muslims, and Christians can live with equal rights, with dignity and respect for all.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nTurning to Gaza, circumstances for innocent women and children there are now dire and there is a very real risk of famine, especially in the north. Meanwhile, there's also been a surge in settler violence, including some involving the IDF against Palestinians in the West Bank. Many Palestinian Americans, including yourself, have family in these places. What's your experience and what have you been hearing from others since October 7th about what is happening abroad?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nIt's hard to take your mind off the daily news looking at your phone to see are you going to receive messages from your family members that someone was killed, someone's house was bombed, or injured. Children have been orphaned. I am in constant contact with my family. I have family members and extended family members who live in Gaza who have been also killed, and their houses have been bombed. I have family members who live as refugees in their home like in Ramallah, West Bank, and I know many, many friends. All the friends I know from Gaza, American Palestinians, they have numerous family members who have been killed and their houses have been leveled to the ground in a massive carpet bombing that even President Biden himself accused the prime minister of Israel of indiscriminately bombing civilians. Although our administration has been supplying arms and politically defending the State of Israel, they recognize and admit that Israel has been committing war crimes and violating international humanitarian and also U.S. laws like the Leahy Law, for example.\n\nAnd Israeli units have been accused of gross violation of Palestinian human rights even according to the State Department. Yet, our government continues to send arms to be used to kill people, to kill relatives of American Palestinians. And even they don't have to be relatives of us they are human beings. And I wonder why on earth our country, our government continues to fund a genocide in broad daylight when the international community is condemning this and saying, you stop it. The only person, the only government that can stop the genocide, not only Israel itself, but I believe our administration, especially President Biden. If he wants to end this genocide, he can end it as soon as he decides to, and unfortunately, he decided not to do so until now.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nNihad, as you know, some organizations here in the U.S. have called into question the number of civilian casualties being reported in Gaza. They've said among other things that if Hamas can't even determine how many Israeli hostages are still alive, how can the Hamas-run health ministry possibly keep track of tens of thousands of casualties? They've also pointed out that apart from children, because Hamas fighters don't wear uniforms, it's impossible to tell who is a civilian and who is a fighter. What's CAIR's perspective here?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nWell, I would like people to Google credible international humanitarian organizations to get to the facts, and even American officials privately and publicly stated that the numbers that come from Gaza are accurate and historically have been proven to be accurate. It doesn't take a rocket scientist when you see hundreds of casualties and everybody has been saying that the majority of those who are injured and killed are women and children. These people have nothing to do with Hamas. The other number can be disputed, but we are talking about tens of thousands of people. I mean, imagine 10,000 people are not known, which means they are under the rubble. I mean, we're talking about human man-made catastrophe by the State of Israel supplied with our tax dollars and weapons manufactured mainly in the U.S. and continue to go to the State of Israel.\n\nI would like people to have some humanity to recognize that if you're not a Palestinian, you don't have to be a Palestinian to recognize this genocide, you have to be a human and you have to have the heart and compassion. This is not about politics, it's about our conscience, what we are doing and saying when our children are watching. They are watching this generation because this is the most documented genocide in human history. People see it live, they see it on social media. And they don't see it only through the mainstream media who has over generations framed the issue and formed the opinion instead of informing the public.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI want to give you an opportunity to respond to some of the criticism against CAIR that's out there. I understand that CAIR has unequivocally condemned the Hamas attacks of October 7th. Both the U.S. and the European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization and both have condemned Hamas for its use of hospitals and civilians as, quote, unquote, \"human shields.\" Does CAIR agree that Hamas is in fact a terrorist group?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nWe have stated numerous times that we as Muslims and CAIR, we condemn any attack on any civilian anywhere any time. And this statement doesn't set the rule and give a clear answer where we stand on the issues then I think people have to look at their own bias. Dana, I would like you as a journalist to have asked questions to the other side or even any supporter of the State of Israel or American Jewish organization to condemn the atrocities that Israel has been committing against the Palestinians and have been condemned by the international community. When even all international and national human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and even the biggest Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem declared Israel as a system that is using apartheid to oppress the Palestinians.\n\nThe statements that came from the prime minister of Israel, the president of Israel, the ministers of Israel, key leaders of Israel, dehumanizing the Palestinians and calling for genocide of the Palestinians. Has any of these people or their representatives or their supporters in the United States, have they ever been asked to condemn the State of Israel? If yes, I haven't seen it. If not, why the double standard? Why do we ask Palestinians to condemn their people? Are there two sets of rules, one for the Palestinian and one for the Israelis?\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI have one more question on this topic. CAIR has been accused over the years by federal agencies, by various branches of government, by states of having direct links to Hamas. In a 2007 case involving the Holy Land Foundation, CAIR was in fact named an unindicted co-conspirator alongside several other Muslim American organizations in what was then the biggest American terrorism money laundering case to date. Speaking plainly and directly for our audience, does CAIR currently have any ties, political, financial, or otherwise to Hamas?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nCAIR is an independent American organization for the past 30 years. We since our founding, we never had any interaction with any foreign groups that are listed by the United States government as terrorist organization and the government never has and will never be able to document otherwise. What the U.S. government has done is what they have been doing to the American Muslim community, silencing their voices, smearing them in a major campaign after 9/11, and they have not been proven to be right and including they have listed about 1.9 million Muslims on the terror watchlist unjustly without any due process. So we as American Muslims, we have been at the receiving end of the illegal and unconstitutional government practices over the years, I think is just one of the biggest forms of Islamophobia that the U.S. government has been dealing with the Muslim community. And we have not seen the U.S. government cracking down on Jewish American organizations who support settler activities, who have been financing and fighting and killing innocent Palestinians using American weapons. This double standard must end.\n\nAgain to the media, the media, including USA Today, has a major, major responsibility to reframe the issue and refrain from casting the American Muslim community and American Muslim organizations in a false light. This does not help the mission of journalism and it does not help informing the public. The USA Today in this question is really forming the public, not informing the public because these questions were not asked to the ADL about its history of spying on anti-apartheid protests where the ADL offices were even raided by the FBI and hold them accountable. That history somehow has been forgotten. CAIR was never raided, CAIR was never taken to court. And if we go to court, we are looking for our day in court to clear our name. None of this happened. Pro-Israel organizations' offices have been raided by the FBI for violating people's rights. We never violated anyone's rights. We never violated any law. So I think why American Muslims and American Muslim organizations are held to another standard, but not everyone else.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThank you for addressing that here. Final question, Nihad, if there was one thing you wanted people listening to this interview to walk away with something about the Muslim American experience at this very difficult time, what would that be?\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nIslam has been part of this country even before its founding. The slaves who were brought against their own will, big percentage of them were Muslim and they kept the faith, the tradition of Islam. And American Muslims have fought in all the wars that led to where America is today, and also they as a minority, they have been suffering discrimination, stereotypes because of their faith. And American Muslims is now a growing and vibrant community, and American Muslims are an important part of the American fabric today. American Muslims serve in the military, they serve in Congress, they serve in schools, they serve in IT. They're cab drivers, they are your neighbors. Take advantage of getting to know an American Muslim and make America and American freedom and democracy work for all.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThank you so much for joining me, Nihad.\n\nNihad Awad:\n\nThank you.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThanks to our senior producers, Shannon Rae Green and Bradley Glanzrock for their production assistance.

Three miles north, at least 13 people were killed when Israeli jets hit a house near a school at the Bureij camp, according to an Associated Press report that cited Al-Aqsa Hospital workers for the death toll.\n\nLast week, Israel caused dozens of casualties when it twice bombed the Jabaliya refugee camp, calling it a Hamas 'stronghold.' Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and has accused the group of using civilians as human shields. Critics say the strikes are fueling a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nBlinken met Sunday in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and they discussed putting a stop to the attacks by Iran-backed militias on U.S. and coalition military facilities in Iraq and neighboring Syria, which have surged to 32 assaults since Oct. 17.\n\nAmid protests earlier in the day, Blinken made a surprise visit to Ramallah in the central West Bank, where he and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas talked about maintaining stability in that territory, improving conditions in Gaza and the governing body's role in Palestinians' future.\n\nBlinken's latest Middle East trip began Friday with a plea for humanitarian pauses to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vows to oppose them until Hamas releases all the hostages it took during its brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel border communities.\n\nBlinken also traveled to Jordan for talks Saturday with the foreign ministers of the host country, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, who pressed him for at least a temporary halt to the war.\n\n\"Everyone would welcome humanitarian pauses,'' Blinken said. \"It could advance things that we're all trying to accomplish, including getting hostages back, including getting a lot more assistance into Gaza, including getting people out of Gaza, citizens from other countries who seek to leave.''\n\nIsraeli strike kills civilians;:Gaza shelter, hospital hit; Blinken in Jordan: Updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Abbas said the Palestinian Authority would only assume control of Gaza as part of a \"comprehensive political solution\" establishing an independent state that would also take in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, lands Israel seized in the 1967 war. Abbas has no authority in Gaza since Hamas took over in 2007.\n\n∎ For the third time since the start of the war, Gaza was left incommunicado to the outside world Sunday. Palestinian communications company Paltel said all of its \"communication and internet services\" were down once again.\n\n∎ The Palestinian death toll in the war has topped 9,700, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, more than 140 Palestinians have been killed in settler violence and Israeli raids. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, says 72 of its staff members have been killed.\n\n∎ More than 1,400 people in Israel have died, most in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that ignited the war, and 242 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza by the militant group.\n\n∎ About 1,100 people have left the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing since Wednesday. That includes more than 300 American citizens, permanent residents, and their relatives, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nIsrael says strip split in half, eyes incursion into Gaza City\n\nThe Israeli military, which proclaimed last week it had surrounded Gaza City, said Sunday that the war-torn territory has been split into two.\n\n“Today there is north Gaza and south Gaza,” spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said, calling it a “significant stage” in Israel’s war against Hamas. Israeli media reported that troops are expected to enter Gaza City within 48 hours. Strong explosions were seen in the northern Gaza Strip after nightfall.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly urged Gaza residents to leave the north, where much of the Hamas infrastructure and weaponry is believed to be located, and seek refuge in the strip's south. However, Israeli forces have attacked the southern half as well.\n\nStrike on refugee camp called 'a true massacre'\n\nIsraeli airstrikes slammed the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza early Sunday. An Associated Press reporter at a nearby hospital saw eight dead children, including a baby, who had been brought in after the strike.\n\nThe camp is located in the evacuation zone where Israel’s military had urged Palestinian civilians in Gaza to seek refuge as it targets its military offensive in the north.\n\nArafat Abu Mashaia, who lives in the camp, said the strike flattened multi-story homes where people were sheltering. “It was a true massacre,” he said. “All here are peaceful people. I challenge anyone who says there were resistance (fighters) here.”\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nFellow Democrats assail Rep. Tlaib for defending chant\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers from her state after she defended a pro-Palestinian rallying cry that some Israel supporters say calls for the targeting of Jews.\n\nTlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, posted a video to X on Friday accusing President Joe Biden of supporting \"the genocide of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe video also showed clips of demonstrators chanting, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\" The first part of the chant refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israeli territory, and according to the Anti-Defamation League, it is \"an antisemitic slogan commonly featured in anti-Israel campaigns.\"\n\nTlaib commented: \"From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.\"\n\nMichigan State Sen. Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish, posted a sharp response on X: \"This is not how Jews view the phrase 'from the river to the sea.' This is not how Hamas views the phrase 'from the river to the sea.' ... \"Hamas uses it as a rallying cry. And they don’t simply want to displace Jews in Israel. They want Jews dead.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAs shelves empty, search for food in Gaza is daunting\n\nPalestinians in Gaza say it has become increasingly difficult to find food. Aid being carried through the Rafah crossing can't keep up with the demand at supermarkets. Bakeries have also been damaged by airstrikes, and many are closed because of fuel and water shortages.\n\nSome residents say much of the food coming through the Rafah crossing in Egypt has already expired or will expire before it can reach people. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesperson for the Rafah crossing, said that in recent days the trucks have contained more body bags than canned food. Recently delivered biscuits had expired and were inedible, he said.\n\nLynn Hastings, a senior U.N. official based in Jerusalem, said she was aware of the reports of expired food but could not independently confirm them as the World Food Program’s food shipments of date bars wouldn’t expire for another month.\n\nWHO: Women and children bearing brunt of war\n\nWomen, children, and newborns are disproportionately bearing the impact of the war in Gaza both as casualties and in reduced access to health care, the World Health Organization and multiple United Nations agencies said in a statement.\n\nAs of Friday, 2326 women and 3760 children have been killed in the Gaza Strip, representing 67% of all casualties, according to Ministry of Health data.\n\nThe agency said bombardments, displacements, and restricted access to food and medicine have severely disrupted maternal, newborn, and child health services. There are an estimated 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, with more than 180 giving birth every day, according to WHO. Fifteen percent of them are likely to experience pregnancy or birth-related complications, the agency said.\n\nAccording to WHO, 14 hospitals and 45 primary health centers are closed and some women have given birth in their homes, in shelters, or in the streets among the rubble. Maternal deaths are expected to increase due to lack of adequate care.\n\nMore than half the population of Gaza is sheltered in facilities operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, according to WHO. The conditions are dire, the agency said, with shelterers lacking sufficient water and food.\n\nAccording to initial assessments by UNRWA, 4,600 displaced pregnant women and about 380 newborns living in the shelters require medical attention.\n\nBereaved fathers resist urge for vengeance\n\nRami Elhanan, an Israeli, and Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian, were once united by their anger and grief.\n\nElhanan lost his 14-year-old daughter Smadar when she was killed in a Palestinian suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 1997. She had been out shopping with friends to buy books ahead of the new school year.\n\nAramin's daughter Abir was 10 when she was shot in the head and killed in 2007 by a bullet fired by an Israeli soldier as she stood outside her school with classmates.\n\nNow the two fathers are close friends, refer to one another as \"my brother\" and share the belief that no amount of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians will lead to peace, just more killing in a \"circle of blood.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nTiny Qatar playing a big role in Mideast crisis\n\nA tiny Persian Gulf nation with an abundance of natural gas reserves and a desire for prestige on the world stage has become a pivotal player in the fate of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nQatar has taken on the role of intermediary in negotiations aiming to secure the release of more than 200 hostages captured in Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Four already have been freed. The Israeli military rescued another last week.\n\nQatari mediators also helped broker a deal that has allowed limited evacuations of foreign passport holders and some critically injured people from the Gaza Strip, which Israel has been pummeling with air strikes since the Hamas attack last month.\n\nRead more here.\n\nProtesters rally for a cease-fire in the US and globally\n\nDemonstrators demanding a cease-fire in the war rallied in cities in the U.S. and across the globe on Saturday. In Washington, D.C, protesters converged on Freedom Plaza, a short distance from the White House.\n\n\"The main goal of everyone right now is a cease-fire,\" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told USA TODAY. \"You can't do anything without a cease-fire − you can't do humanitarian aid, you can't treat the wounded, you can't even remove bodies until there's a cease-fire.\"\n\nThe speeches in the nation's capital were full of grief over the destruction of Gaza and anger about the war, but no one who took the stage condemned Hamas or its attack on Israel, said Meredith Weisel, capital region director of the Anti-Defamation League. \"There was zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering,\" Weisel said, \"and a lot of legitimizing and justification for violence against Israelis.\"\n\nProtesters in New York, London, Berlin, Istanbul and Paris also took to the streets Saturday. In Paris, Wahid Barek, a 66-year-old retiree, told Reuters he opposed the killing of both Israelis and Palestinians. \"I deplore civilian deaths on both sides. Civilians have nothing to do with these actions. It really is shameful,\" he said.\n\n− Minnah Arshad, Dan Morrison\n\nUN staff, facilities injured along Gaza Strip\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees announced on Sunday that five more staffers died within the last two days. In total, 79 UNRWA workers were killed and at least 24 have been injured since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\nThe agency said a UNRWA school in Jabalia camp, north of Gaza, was directly hit by strikes on Saturday, killing 15 people and injuring 70 others who were sheltering in the facility. Eleven others were injured in a bombing at a school in Nuseirat camp.\n\nNearly 1.5 million people have been displaced on the Gaza Strip, and about half of them, 710,000, are sheltering in 149 UNRWA facilities. Since the war began, 48 of those facilities have been damaged, the agency said.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement. The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel. The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations. The political wing of Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2007.\n\nIt was founded by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization with ties to Egypt. Iran provides Hamas with financial, material and logistical support. Hamas also cooperates with Lebanon-based Hezbollah, another Iran-backed group the U.S. considers a terrorist organization.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/11/gaza-strip-map-size-history-israel-conflict/71128174007/", "title": "The Gaza Strip: Mapping the territory at center of Israeli war", "text": "The Gaza Strip, one of the smallest territories in the world, may soon become a bloody battleground as Israeli Defense Forces strike back against Hamas for its brutal, hostage-taking attack on Israel.\n\nGaza is at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian hostility, which has existed since the creation of Israel in 1948. The confrontation going on now is another in a long history of Middle Eastern disputes among Israelis, Palestinians, and others.\n\nUSA TODAY looks at this tiny Palestinian enclave, its people, and its place in the ongoing conflict.\n\nWhat is Gaza, also known as the Gaza Strip?\n\nThe Gaza Strip comprises just under 140 square miles of relatively flat coastal plain bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It is central to the conflict involving Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian territories and various regional actors. Urban areas, refugee camps, border crossings and high-risk areas as defined by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs can be seen in the map above.\n\nUnable to view our graphics?Click here to see them.\n\nHow big is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza's area is slightly greater than twice the size of Washington, D.C. It is home to 2.3 million people in 139 square miles, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nWhere is Gaza? What countries border the territory?\n\nGaza borders Israeli territory on its northeastern and southeastern sides and Egypt to its southwest. To its west, Gaza abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho lives in Gaza? How many people live in the Gaza Strip?\n\nAt least 2.23 million people live in the Gaza Strip, according to the U.N., many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during its War of Independence and subsequent conflicts. Gaza is often described as one of the world's most densely populated areas, but population density varies across the territory. There are roughly an even number of women and men living there.\n\nWith 42,059 people per square mile, Gaza City is the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world. At least eight Palestinian refugee camps lie in the Gaza Strip and have some of the highest population densities in the world, according to the U.N.\n\nWho controls Gaza?\n\nHamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting. It was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.\n\nWhat does it mean when people say Gaza is blockaded, or under siege? What is it like to live there?\n\nAccording to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the socioeconomic situation in Gaza has been in steady decline for more than a decade. Longstanding restrictions on the movement of people and goods to and from Gaza have made living conditions extremely difficult. Israel prevents all access to and from the Gaza Strip by sea and air. Movement of people and goods is restricted to three crossings: Rafah crossing, controlled by Eqypt, and Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings, controlled by Israel.\n\nSixty-three percent of the population of Gaza is considered food-insecure, and 81% are living in poverty. Access to clean water and electricity were at crisis levels even before this month's hostilities. The U.N. secretary-general says the blockade and related restrictions contravene international humanitarian law because they target and impose hardship on the civilian population, effectively penalizing them for acts they have not committed.\n\nSources: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA OPT Information Management Unit, Jewish Virtual Library, The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, USA TODAY research\n\nKeep up with developments from Gaza:Sign up for USA TODAY's Israel-Hamas War newsletter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/02/16/israel-hamas-war-families-officials-cease-fire-newark-nj/72589254007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war: Families implore officials for a cease fire", "text": "Mohammed Abosheriah was ordered to evacuate his city in northern Gaza to a “safe zone” with his family three months ago.\n\nWhile on the evacuation route with his parents, wife and nine children, he was pulled aside by Israeli forces, stripped and handcuffed. His family pleaded for soldiers to let him go. They told the family to wait for him at the next checkpoint.\n\nAbosheriah never returned.\n\n“My family has contacted the Red Cross and other organizations to give us any kind so news — whether he is alive or dead,” said his cousin, Adam Abosheriah, of Springfield. “Everybody fears if you have a family member abducted they will be dead.”\n\nAbosheriah stood with other Palestinian Americans on Thursday afternoon in Newark to publicly implore elected officials to call for a cease-fire and end the bombardment of Gaza. Many of their loved ones have been killed. Others are starving or sheltering in “safe zones” that are no longer safe, where bombs have struck and new evacuation orders are expected.\n\nThey pleaded for help as the situation grows more desperate. Cease-fire negotiations have stalled again as Israel warns of a ground invasion in Rafah, the city in southern Gaza where more than a million displaced people fled to avoid fighting.\n\nFamilies on the brink of starvation\n\nNajla Khass of Piscataway said her family is on the brink of starvation as Israel blocks most aid from entering the Gaza Strip. \"They are not letting enough food trucks into Gaza and my family is living on one meal a day,” she said.\n\nThey also cannot access needed medications, said Khass, adding that 40 of her family members have died so far in bombings. She and others said family members were eating grass and animal fodder to survive, or had one sandwich to fill their day.\n\nIsrael has said it limits aid to prevent Hamas from diverting it for military purposes, but humanitarian organizations say the restrictions amount to collective punishment against a civilian population.\n\nKhass' uncle, 85, is living in a tent on the street in Rafah, the southern city where about 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering — many of whom have been evacuated from northern cities. While Americans watched the Super Bowl on Sunday, she watched videos of bombs in Rafah. People fear more violence as Israeli leaders warn of a ground invasion in the crowded city.\n\n“How can they expect the injured, the disabled, the elderly, to evacuate again?” Khass said.\n\nA ground invasion is needed to root out Hamas militants hiding in Rafah, according to Israel. The United States and aid organizations have warned that an invasion could result in a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked security officials to draft plans to evacuate civilians Rafah before expanding military operations there. It remains unclear where they can go.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza Strip:Mapping the devastation\n\nAbosheriah said his family was also huddled in tents in Rafah, afraid to enter buildings that could tumble on top of them during airstrikes. In total, 104 members of his family, including his father, mother and brother, have been killed in Gaza, he said.\n\nNow, his surviving family hopes that they will hear from his cousin and several other relatives who have been detained. Israel has said that mass detention of men in Gaza was needed to determine if any of them were connected to Hamas. Images of groups of men stripped, handcuffed and kneeling have sparked outrage, while rights groups raise concerns about arbitrary detention and beatings.\n\nAbosheriah said he had reached out to his congressman, Rep. Thomas Kean Jr., about 10 times to talk about his family's plight and a cease-fire. He said he had not gotten a response.\n\nLook through 'a lens of humanity'\n\nThe current fighting was triggered Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a surprise attack in southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people, while another 240 were taken hostage. Nearly 30,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to health authorities, with thousands more missing under the rubble.\n\nCease-fire negotiations in Cairo halted on Wednesday. Israel pulled its delegation, blaming Hamas for a lack of new proposals. The talks were aimed at halting fighting in Gaza and freeing the more than 100 remaining hostages.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have disagreed on release of imprisoned Palestinians and on the length of a cease-fire, the Associated Press reported.\n\nLocal:In Tenafly, weekly march keeps focus on Edan Alexander and other Hamas hostages\n\nSelaedin Maksut, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, urged people to think about the Palestinians who have been killed not just as statistics, but through a lens of humanity.\n\n“These are real people, mothers who are losing their children, fathers who are being taken away from families, children who are dying under the rubble,” he said. “Each of these stories impact people here in New Jersey and across the country. These are Palestinian Americans, residents of New Jersey, who are calling on our elected officials to demand that action be taken immediately.”\n\n“A cease-fire now is necessary to save lives that are remaining in Gaza.

What some may not be aware of is how this has affected some of our fellow Cincinnatians.\n\nAs one of the organizers of the Dec. 17 Interfaith Peace Vigil for Gaza, I heard from local Palestinians who spoke about family members being killed by the Israeli military, some children. One speaker said \"Israel killed my dearest sister Reham, her husband Zaki and her beautiful children − Khalid, Amal, and baby Zain, who had only lived two days before he was murdered. Israel killed them in their sleep, in the 'safety' of a house that sheltered them after they fled their home.\"\n\nI heard from a Jewish grandson of Holocaust survivors, who has been calling for a ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation and apartheid of Palestinians. He and many others have the heart, the bravery and compassion to speak against these atrocities. Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism.\n\nPrior to Oct. 7, Gaza has been under a violent blockade for 16 years under Israeli occupation. Gazans can’t leave the Gaza Strip. Ninety-six percent of the water is undrinkable. Electricity is only available sporadically. Hospitals are consistently out of 40% of the medical supplies necessary to treat patients.\n\nSince Oct. 7, about two million Gazans have been displaced. The total number of Palestinian deaths in the Gaza Strip is 21,124, including 8,697 children and 4,410 women as well as those missing and trapped under the rubble. The number of injured people is 56,122. More than half of Gazans are at risk of starvation and disease.\n\nOn a never-before-seen scale, Israel’s extensive bombing campaign has targeted both displaced civilians, residential infrastructures, hospitals, refugee camps, UN-run schools, mosques, churches, bakeries, water tanks and ambulances. Amputations are being done on children without anesthesia.\n\nOver 101 journalists, 300 health care workers and 135 United Nations workers have been killed (the highest in the history of the UN). These deaths weren’t a result of combat.\n\nSeveral Human Rights organizations are calling for a ceasefire. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the United Nations and B’Tselem (The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights) are calling these war crimes.\n\nWith American tax dollars, Israel has dropped the equivalent of two nuclear bombs on Gaza, where half the population are children. Let that sink in. America is complicit. These are American bombs, artillery, helicopters, planes. Where is precision bombing for one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world? Some of the accounts of freed Israeli hostages said they feared the Israeli bombing more than Hamas. This was documented in Israeli newspapers. The Israeli hostages who were killed by the Israeli army were waving white flags.\n\nThis is not representative of what most Americans want. This brutal war is harming our legitimacy as a first-world power. As an American citizen, I feel shame knowing that our government is supporting this through billions of dollars of aid to Israel. President Joe Biden bypassed our Congress to provide aid to Israel’s military. Europe and Arab countries could put tremendous pressure on Israel through sanctions, pressuring them to allow for humanitarian aid.\n\nIf we can’t solve this political crisis, the least we can do is save lives. Humanity is our common cause. Collectively, we have the freedom to uphold and safeguard people’s humanity. Challenge your local and state leaders by calling for a ceasefire, frequently.

For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our live updates file on the war for Wednesday March 20.\n\nIsrael was not particularly helpful in getting humanitarian assistance into battered northern Gaza in the first half of March, facilitating only 11 of the 24 aid missions the United Nations planned, the agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe other 13 aid convoys were either denied by Israel or postponed, U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq told reporters, adding that “truck convoys are frequently turned back, even after long waits at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint” in the central part of the enclave. Some aid trucks have also been looted by desperately hungry people, he said.\n\nA new report says 70% of the 300,000 Palestinians remaining in northern Gaza are in danger of \"catastrophic hunger,'' and nearly half the territory's 2.3 million people face starvation.\n\nHaq said satisfying Gaza's basic food needs would require at least 300 daily trucks, well below the 500 that regularly went in before the war. The number of aid trucks has fluctuated considerably, but the February average was just 95, though it has increased to 160 this month.\n\nThat's still about half the number needed, and Haq said the U.N. humanitarian office keeps asking the Israeli military “to guarantee safe, sustained and unhindered access across Gaza – and to open up all possible entry points into Gaza.”\n\nGaza facing 'catastrophic hunger':US also says Israel killed Hamas' No. 3\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, speaking to Italian lawmakers ahead of an EU Council meeting later this week, joined the chorus of international leaders voicing opposition to Israel's proposed ground invasion of Rafah. Meloni said such an offensive \"could have yet more catastrophic consequences on the civilians massed in that area.\"\n\n∎ The entire population of Gaza is experiencing “severe levels of acute food insecurity,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday, expanding on starvation warnings issued by the U.N. a day earlier. Blinken is in the Philippines ahead of his latest in a series of trips to the Middle East.\n\n∎ The Israeli military said Tuesday that troops have killed more than 50 Hamas militants and arrested 180 more during an ongoing raid at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Israeli forces launched the raid Monday on Gaza’s largest hospital compound, where Palestinian officials say tens of thousands of people have been sheltering. Hamas accused the Israelis of targeting the compound with \"indifference to the patients, medical crews and displaced\" Palestinians living there.\n\n∎ U.S. Central Command said it destroyed seven anti-ship missiles, three drones and three weapons storage containers belonging to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who said Tuesday they have continued their attacks on commercial vessels, most recently targeting the carrier Mado in both the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nGroups, leaders call out Donald Trump:'Defamatory and antisemitic' comments about Jewish voters blasted\n\nUN official says Israel may be using starvation as a weapon of war\n\nFor the second day in a row a high-level international official is warning Israel against using hunger as a weapon of war as virtually all of Gaza’s population grapples with crisis levels of food insecurity and 1.1 million face starvation.\n\nVolker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said Tuesday that immediate efforts must be made to prevent the projected imminent famine in Gaza, starting with Israel allowing more humanitarian aid in.\n\n“The extent of Israel’s continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime,” Türk said, calling on the international community to intervene.\n\nOn Monday, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also asked Israel to make it easier for aid to enter Gaza, and said, “Hunger can’t be used as a weapon of war. … We urge Israel to allow free, unimpeded, safe humanitarian access.”\n\nIsraeli officials have pushed back, saying Hamas is stealing the food for its fighters, and that the U.N. and other aid organizations are to blame for failing to distribute the supplies brought in.\n\nUS may not restore UNRWA funding for another year, report says\n\nThe U.S. would cut off money for UNRWA, the embattled U.N. agency for Palestinian aid, until March 2025 as part of a deal between Congress and the White House to fund government programs including the military, Reuters reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Biden administration is already withholding financial backing for UNRWA amid an investigation into Israeli charges that at least 12 of the agency's 13,000 workers participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks. More than 10 other countries and entities also paused their funding, but the U.S. decision has had the biggest impact because it donates more than any other nation, $300-400 million a year.\n\nUNRWA officials, who fired the 12 employees, have said they won't be able to continue providing critical aid and services in war-ravaged Gaza without the funding, and a handful of countries have vowed to restore it. The U.S. has explored alternative ways of supplying assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, Reuters reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said Israel barred him from going into Gaza as part of a delegation the previous day, and he challenged the explanation that his entry application contained mistakes.\n\nOnly way to destroy Hamas is invading Rafah, Netanyahu says\n\nIsrael will listen to Biden administration alternatives to a ground invasion of Rafah \"out of respect for the president,\" but there is no other way to ensure the complete destruction of Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said Netanyahu, in a call Monday with President Joe Biden, agreed to send a \"senior interagency team\" of military, intelligence and humanitarian officials to Washington to discuss Israel's plans for Rafah. The White House said Tuesday that meeting will probably take place early next week.\n\nNetanyahu's determination to storm the southern Gaza city, packed with more than 1 million refugees who fled other areas of Gaza, has drawn fierce opposition from regional and global leaders.\n\n“I made it as clear as possible to the president that we are determined to complete the elimination of these battalions in Rafah, and there is no way to do this without a ground incursion,” Netanyahu told a Knesset committee Tuesday in a translation provided by Israeli News.\n\nSullivan, in a briefing Monday, said Biden stressed that Palestinians taking refuge in Rafah \"have nowhere else to go (because) Gaza’s other major cities have largely been destroyed.\" Invading the city, a primary entry point for humanitarian assistance into Gaza from Egypt, would further complicate efforts to provide food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians, Sullivan said. An invasion also could damage already strained Israeli-Egyptian relations, he added.\n\n\"A major ground operation there would be a mistake. It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza, and further isolate Israel internationally,\" Sullivan said. \"Most importantly, the key goals Israel wants to achieve in Rafah can be done by other means.\"\n\nQatar official 'optimistic' as cease-fire talks continue\n\nQatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari expressed cautious optimism that talks underway in Doha would lead to a cease-fire and release of some or all hostages. Mossad chief David Barnea, lead negotiator for Israel, returned home Tuesday, but an Israeli technical negotiating team remained in Doha, Ansari said in a briefing. He said a proposal could be sent to Hamas within days.\n\nA previous proposal believed to provide a six-week truce in return for release of at least 40 of the over 100 captives still held by militants was reportedly rejected by Hamas leaders. Hamas has been pressing for an end to the war and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops.\n\nAnsari also stressed Qatar's position \"is very clear\" that an Israeli ground assault in Rafah would be a humanitarian catastrophe. A humanitarian aid plane from Qatari arrived Tuesday in Egypt, loaded with food and other vital supplies bound for Gaza.\n\n\"The negotiations are (ongoing) and that’s what gives us optimism right now,\" Ansari said. \"We hope that we can continue building (a deal) in the next days.\"\n\nTrump: A Jewish person who votes for Democrats 'hates their religion'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump again used an offensive stereotype about Jewish Americans, prompting immediate backlash from Jewish groups and leaders. \"Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion,” Trump said in an interview with Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide. “They hate everything about Israel, and they should be ashamed of themselves because Israel will be destroyed.”\n\nTrump singled out Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., during the interview posted Monday. Schumer is the nation's highest-ranking Jewish elected official and a longtime supporter of Israel. The New York lawmaker in a Monday post on X, formerly Twitter, accused the ex-president of again using \"highly partisan and hateful rants.\"\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement to USA TODAY that \"accusing Jews of hating their religion because they might vote for a particular party is defamatory and patently false. Serious leaders who care about the historic U.S.-Israel alliance should focus on strengthening, rather than unraveling, bipartisan support for the State of Israel.\" Read more here.\n\n− David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nSecond aid ship from Cyprus delayed by bad weather\n\nA second ship is loaded and ready to bring about 240 tons of food supplies to the starving residents of Gaza. Now it's a matter of waiting for the weather to cooperate.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, the charity founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres, said poor conditions are holding up the departure of the vessel at the Cyprus port of Larnaca. The ship, named Jennifer, will transport beans, carrots, canned tuna, chickpeas, dates, flour and oil among other items to help feed a population the U.N. says is facing \"catastrophic hunger.''\n\nThe first such attempt at using a sea route to carry humanitarian aid into Gaza was successful last week when a ship from the Spanish aid group Open Arms docked in a makeshift jetty assembled by WCK off the Gaza coast with 200 tons of food. The ship left Cyprus on Tuesday and arrived in the Palestinians territory Friday. WCK said those provisions were delivered to devastated north Gaza with a U.N. World Food Program convoy Tuesday.\n\nFinding a maritime route to bring in supplies has become necessary because of restrictions Israel has placed on taking them in by land, which is much more efficient.\n\nAntisemitism protest:Professor slept in his office. He's not the only one.\n\nIs language barrier damaging Israel's image?\n\nNetanyahu reportedly told a Knesset committee that Israel’s international image suffers because so few officials speak English well. Channel 12, reporting from a closed-door meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said Netanyahu was asked whether Israel's viewpoint on the war was suffering because of a lack of promotional funding. Netanyahu reportedly responded that money wasn't the only problem, but that the government needs to find spokespeople sufficiently fluent in English, the first or second language across much of the world.\n\nThe buzz drew a response Tuesday from Netanyahu’s office to the Times of Israel, saying the prime minister “deeply values the work of his team and of the Public Diplomacy Directorate that operates under him, and he said this to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.”\n\nProfessors protest antisemitism, Islamophobia with sleep-ins\n\nA growing number of college professors in California will sleep in their offices overnight this week to protest their school administrations' response to a growing trend of antisemitism on their campuses fueled by the war in Gaza. They’re joining Ron Hassner, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been staying in his office for nearly two weeks in response to what he sees as inaction on the part of school administrators.\n\nHe says they've failed to act on a list of demands he presented after recent incidents on campus. Hassner wants staff to receive training on curbing antisemitism and Islamophobia. He also requested that if invited speakers are disrupted by protesters and cannot finish their presentations, they be asked back to campus to speak again.\n\n“Everybody in the Berkeley leadership is deeply embarrassed by professors and students who speak out of line and behave in unprofessional ways,” he told USA TODAY.

Since then, arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances has been a hallmark of the regime.\n\nYet now, some Palestinians are \"self-silencing\" how they really view Hamas − and what they reveal about living under the U.S. and European Union-designated terror group in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd according to more than a dozen Palestinians inside and outside Gaza interviewed for this story, being candid about what they truly think about Hamas is more fraught than ever.\n\nGazans fear retribution from Hamas; they fear Israel's bombings, too\n\nFear of reprisals is part of it.\n\nBut they are more concerned that doing so could detract from highlighting Israel's relentless bombings − its response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack − in the seaside enclave that have pulverized civilian infrastructure and caused mass Palestinian casualties.\n\nFor the last 17 years, Hamas − whose 1988 founding charter called for the destruction of Israel to make way for a Palestinian state − has been accused by western governments, human rights organizations and some Palestinians in Gaza of corruption, restricting freedom of expression, and other abuses.\n\n'Circle of blood':The club no Israeli or Palestinian wants to be in\n\n'I won't condemn Hamas':Some Palestinians find it hard to denounce attacks on Israel\n\nIsrael’s Cabinet announced a cease-fire deal with Hamas early Wednesday that would bring a temporary halt to the conflict and release dozens of hostages in a prisoner swap between the two sides.\n\nStill, as Lara Friedman, president of the U.S.-based Foundation for Middle East Peace, which advocates for rapprochement between Israelis and Palestinians, recently pointed out, Hamas won a parliamentary majority in what turned out to be Gaza's last election − in 2006 − not on an incendiary platform to \"kill the Jews,\" but as the \"party of change & reform.\"\n\nAfter years of rule by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' widely unpopular and potentially corrupt Fatah party, \"a vote for Hamas was a vote against Fatah,\" she said. Fatah and Abbas, with whom Hamas fought a short civil war after the 2006 vote, still control the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory.\n\nSurveys show most Gazans before Oct. 7 Hamas attacks favored a peace deal with Israel\n\nMost people in Gaza, where roughly half the 2.2 million population are under 18, were either not yet born or children the last time there was an opportunity to express a political will.\n\nAnd while some hardline pro-Israel voices have branded all Gazans as supporters of Hamas, surveys taken before the war showed that most Gazans had a poor opinion of how Hamas handled things they valued the most: access to food, education, healthcare, living conditions, and jobs.\n\nThese surveys, conducted by Arab Barometer, a non-partisan network of U.S.-based researchers working with local partners across the West Bank and Gaza, revealed that the majority of Gazans − 68% − believed that they had no way to safely participate in peaceful protests against Hamas' rule. They were also more likely to blame Hamas leadership than Israel for material shortages in their lives despite a nearly two-decade blockade from Israel and Egypt that has affected every aspect of life for Palestinians in Gaza − from where they can live and study, to where they can travel and what health care they can access. Israel and Egypt say the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas and other enemies from smuggling weapons into Gaza.\n\nHamas attacks:Here is how police and military are trying to find the gunmen\n\nSome 73% of Gazans, according to the Arab Barometer survey, favored a peace deal with Israel.\n\nMost Gazans 'just want to be able to do their jobs'. But support for Oct. 7 attacks has grown.\n\n\"Basically (most Gazans) just want to be able to do their job and have enough money to spend time with their family,\" said Michael Robbins, one of the authors of the survey along with Amaney Jamal, a professor of international affairs at Princeton and Stanford.\n\nRobbins added that the survey showed that there was a correlation between Hamas supporters − who support armed resistance to Israel − and Gazans who were better off financially.\n\n\"You can think of that as some of the (Hamas) corruption issues, access to food and money and other things from the government itself. ... (Hamas) rewarding its own people,\" he said.\n\nRobbins said that Arab Barometer has not been able, because of the war, to do any surveys asking Gazans how they view Hamas now; since the revelations about its atrocities in Israel and the massive bombing campaign and ground operation that's come in its wake.\n\nHowever, he suspected that in keeping with past periods of violence between Israel and Palestinians, many in Gaza would likely \"rally around the flag\" and that \"support for Hamas has probably gone up,\" at least in the short term, amid all the Palestinian suffering.\n\nIn fact, a clear majority of Palestinians said in a poll carried out after the attacks by the Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development that they either \"strongly supported\" (59%) or \"supported to some extent\" (16%) the Oct. 7 attacks carried by Hamas.\n\nSome Palestinians ask themselves what's worse: Hamas or Israel?\n\nSome Palestinians say they are torn between being critical of Hamas and of Israel, which is killing Palestinians on a far larger scale than Hamas ever has.\n\n\"In this super-charged moment, the first question asked of every Palestinian is: Do you condemn the Hamas attacks?\" said Omar Rahman, a U.S.-based fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, a think tank headquartered in Doha, Qatar.\n\n\"They are offended by that. They think it misses the point. ... It's an objective fact that Hamas does not represent the majority of Palestinians. That doesn't mean it doesn't have a basis of support or isn't part of the political landscape. ... Not everyone agrees with its agenda or tactics.\"\n\nRahman said that Hamas runs Gaza like its own \"personal fiefdom\" and that Palestinians there have \"no say, no agency over Hamas decision-making at a governmental level, at a political level, at a strategic level in terms of its engagement or resistance against Israel.\"\n\nLet's talk about your peace plan:Rep. Rashida Tlaib's grandmother to Donald Trump\n\n\"When Israel is killing children and even whole families in this way there is no place to talk about Hamas. No place at all,\" said one Palestinian, who like the others interviewed for this story did not want her identity published over concerns her comments could be misinterpreted or used against her by both Palestinian and Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Nobody in Gaza is thinking about Hamas. They are busy surviving,\" this Palestinian said.\n\n\"The most important thing now is not Hamas. It's that Israel stops killing us,\" said another. \"How can the international community see all these children dying in Gaza and not do anything?\"\n\nFights in bread lines, despair in shelters, and Hamas extorting money from Gazans\n\nAs Gaza has become more cut off from the outside world and aid agencies have warned its on the verge of collapse, there have been rare public shows of discontent in Gaza with Hamas.\n\nFights have broken out in lines at bakeries, while waiting for water and in overcrowded shelters. There have been reports of outbursts and insults shouted at Hamas officials.\n\nBefore the war, Israeli media published stories of Gazans who had fled the enclave because of threats they faced from Hamas for participating in protests, because they didn't support its approach to Israel or for challenging the way it spent financing from Qatar on rockets and tunnels rather than schools or other infrastructure.\n\nA Gazan worker USA TODAY met in the West Bank last month said that he was not able to return home because Hamas officials were trying to extort money from him.\n\n'No funeral cars, no ambulances':In Israel-Hamas war, a struggle to bury the dead\n\nSeven weeks into the war, more than half of Gaza's population has been displaced. Gazan officials say that more than 50% of housing units in the territory have been destroyed, damaged or left completely uninhabitable since Oct. 7. The U.N. says water is running low and starvation is a real risk. Reports say scabies, a skin infection caused by mites; diarrhea; and respiratory infections are spreading quickly.\n\nAdeeb Ziadeh, a West Bank-born international affairs expert who researches Hamas and now teaches at Qatar University, in Doha, said that when it comes down to it most Palestinians in Gaza are not ideological. They don’t necessary evaluate Hamas based on its beliefs and actions as much as they judge it upon the quality of life it can provide for them and their families.\n\n\"One of the main drivers for Hamas to do what it did in Israel on Oct. 7 may have been it felt it had nothing to provide for the people in Gaza any longer,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe it believed the patience of people in Gaza with Hamas had run out. Maybe it felt it had nothing to lose when it was no longer able to help them with their needs.\"\n\nHamas says it 'will do it again and again'\n\nAccording to Ghazi Hamad, a senior member of Hamas, the attack on Israel the group engineered on Oct. 7 was about \"teaching Israel a lesson\" and it \"will do it again and again.\"\n\n\"We are the victims of the occupation. Period,\" Hamad said in an interview with Lebanese TV channel LBC on Oct. 24. ''Therefore, nobody should blame us for the things we do.\"\n\nBut many Palestinians do blame Hamas for some things.\n\nI'm not Hamas, and I will never be\n\n\"After Oct. 7 we all in Gaza have been (accused of being) Hamas supporters. In fact, I am not. And I will never be,\" said Tareq Hajjaj, a Gazan journalist, in rare public comments about Hamas.\n\nHajjaj said he knows many Gazans with strong feelings about Hamas who won't speak publicly about it.\n\n'Did we die?'A week in the life of a journalist in the Gaza Strip\n\nOne Palestinian, a women's rights advocate, said that in Gaza she has \"always been in opposition with Hamas.\" She said that because she has called for gender equality, freedom of speech and is opposed to girls under 18 getting married this made her a target for Hamas and other militant Islamist groups in Gaza. She said she had written books about these topics, briefly used in schools and by social workers in Gaza, but they had since been withdrawn by the authorities.\n\nLGBTQ communities in both Gaza and the West Bank face threats, repression and violence from Hamas and Fatah authorities.\n\n'Hamas used to attack me because they were against feminist organizations'\n\n\"Hamas used to (verbally) attack me all the time, because they are against feminist organizations and they think, or don't just think, they claim that we (the women's rights organization she works for) are funded by the West to ruin the Palestinian society,\" she said.\n\nBut she said she never felt physically threatened by Hamas. Her frustration was more at not being able to promote ideas − human rights − that allow people to live in dignity and with equality.\n\nFor others, especially foreign visitors to Gaza, Hamas is an enigma.\n\nOne American who runs a large aid organization that has been involved in building infrastructure projects in Gaza said he's always struggled, before Oct. 7, to account for how \"normal\" every day life in Hamas-run Gaza can appear.\n\nHe didn't want his identity published because of his ongoing work in Gaza.\n\n'It was shockingly comfortable'\n\n\"In terms of security and comfort, I would say to people all the time it was 'shockingly comfortable.' I would say, literally and honestly, that it felt more dangerous (and likely) in my (U.S.) neighborhood that you'd get shot with a stray bullet than in Gaza. I would walk from the hotel to a fish restaurant down the block, or a few blocks away, and think: 'You know, it'd be nicer if there were some better sidewalks and nicer lighting, but I don't actually feel scared.'\"\n\nThe American aid worker said he recognized his impressions of Gaza may reflect his visits as a foreigner rather than some deeper truth about what life is like. More than 80% of Gaza's population lives in poverty, according to the U.N. And while Hamas has received hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid and cash injections from Iran, Qatar and others, Israel, experts and western governments have questioned whether money meant for civilian use ends up used by Hamas for its military operations.\n\nYet he felt it was important to point out that Gaza is more than Hamas.\n\nOnce,he traveled to Gaza with a board member of his aid organization. He described this board member as \"well connected\" in Washington, attuned to its political scene and an expert on the Middle East.\n\n\"She kept saying to me: 'Where are these guys? Where are they?' She was expecting to see Hamas everywhere.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/16/israel-hamas-gaza-war-live-updates/71602781007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war live updates: Hostage's body found near Gaza ...", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nThe body of one of the approximately 240 people kidnapped in Israel during the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage was recovered in a building near Gaza City's Al Shifa Hospital, the Israeli military said Thursday.\n\nYehudit Weiss was abducted from the Be’eri kibbutz, Israel said on the platform X, when Hamas launched the brutal attack that killed about 1,200 people and provoked Israel's reprisal seeking to dislodge the militant group from Gaza. No cause of Weiss' death was given. She was 65 and her husband, Shmulik Weiss, was killed in the Hamas assault.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces tweeted that Weiss' cadaver was identified by forensic experts and her family was notified. In the same building her body was discovered, Israeli troops also found military equipment and weapons that included rocket-propelled grenades, the IDF said.\n\n\"The national mission before our eyes is to locate the missing and return the abducted home,'' the IDF said, according to a translation of its tweet. \"The IDF works closely and in full coordination with the relevant national and security bodies in order to meet these tasks, and will not let up until they are completed.''\n\nHamas has released four hostages, and another one was rescued by Israeli forces. Weiss is the second hostage from the war known to have died. On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old female soldier captured Oct. 7, had perished, but did not say how. Hamas said she died in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza.\n\nHamas at hospital:Israel says weapons on video 'totally confirm' Gaza hospital was Hamas fortress\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ On the second day of searching through the sprawling Al Shifa Hospital complex, Israeli troops displayed what they said were a tunnel entrance and weapons found in a pickup truck at the compound. The IDF has yet to show evidence of a Hamas command center Israel has said is hidden under the facility, which Hamas and hospital staff deny.\n\n∎ Shifa Hospital has not had electricity for nearly a week, and staff say they have been struggling to keep alive 36 premature babies and 45 dialysis patients without functional equipment. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, died before the raid after the emergency generator ran out of fuel on Saturday.\n\n∎ Laptops seized by Israeli troops during their raid of Gaza's Shifa Hospital included photos and videos of some of the more than 240 hostages taken by militants, the Israeli military told a BBC News crew provided access to the hospital.\n\n∎ At least 80 protesters were arrested Thursday after blocking traffic for hours on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, demanding President Joe Biden call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n∎ Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government isn't functioning and urged him to resign: “Netanyahu needs to go now during the fighting.”\n\n∎ Israel seized control of the Gaza harbor from Hamas, which had used it as a training facility for naval commando forces, the Israeli military said. Ten tunnel shafts and four structures \"used for terror\" were destroyed and 10 militants were killed, the military said.\n\nIsrael to show UN 'horrors' of Oct. 7 rampage\n\nIsrael will play footage from the Hamas rampage into Israel for U.N. envoys in New York next week as the isolated Middle East country attempts to rally support for its war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan said Thursday that he has invited ambassadors, U.N. officials and representatives of the Jewish community in New York to view the “horrors of the massacre” committed by Hamas.\n\n“The U.N. has not yet condemned Hamas,” Erdan said in a statement. “I hope that, following the screening of the film, some of the ambassadors and U.N. officials will understand what moral distortion they are complicit in.”\n\nErdan said Mosab Hasan Yosef, the disowned eldest son of a Hamas co-founder, will also address the gathering. Yosef, a Palestinian, worked undercover for Israel’s internal security service for a decade and has frequently spoken out against the militant group.\n\nIsrael has faced severe global scrutiny for its assault on Gaza, which the U.N. says has forced internal displacement of more than 1.5 million Palestinians. They remain trapped in a 140-square mile territory where much of the infrastructure has been bombed into submission since Israel began its offensive right after the brutal Oct. 7 attack by Hamas ravaged Israeli border communities and stunned the world.\n\nIsrael says more than 1,200 were killed that day and 240 taken hostage by militants. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed since.\n\nFuel shortage shuts down communications across Gaza\n\nAll communications across the Gaza Strip shut down Thursday because of a lack of fuel, the Palestinian telecommunications company Paltel announced.\n\n\"Dear people in our beloved homeland, we regret to announce a complete interruption of communications services (fixed, cellular and Internet) in the Gaza Strip,\" Paltel said on social media. The company said it had been unable to obtain fuel and that backup energy sources to operate the network had been exhausted.\n\nAbsent means of communications, humanitarian aid deliveries won't take place Friday, said the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNWRA. The agency said almost every person in Gaza lacks enough food, and more than two out of every three don’t have clean drinking water.\n\n“Children are pleading for a sip of water and a piece of bread” at the 153 UNRWA facilities now jammed with 800,000 displaced Palestinians, said Juliette Touma, UNRWA communications director.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the agency's commissioner-general, confirmed the \"total communication blackout\" at a press conference in Geneva, the Times of Israel reported. Lazzarini has been warning for days that the entire aid mission would soon \"grind to a halt\" unless Israel eased its blockade and allowed more fuel into Gaza. Israel partially lifted the embargo this week, but officials say the amount of available fuel is not nearly enough.\n\nIran general says Israel won't 'reach its dirty goals' in war\n\nIran, which sponsors Hamas and other militant groups, won’t let Israel “reach its dirty goals’’ in the current war, according to a letter from the head of the Iranian Quds Force, a branch of the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nGen. Esmail Ghaani doesn’t say in the letter that Iranian forces will join Hamas in battle, but tells its military commander Mohammed Deif that, along with other allies, Tehran “will carry out all our duties in this historic battle.”\n\nHamas fighters invaded Israeli territory Oct. 7 and claimed 1,200 lives in a stunning assault, but Israel has since pulverized large parts of Gaza with its aerial campaign, emptying out much of north Gaza and taking control of the strip’s half considered the Hamas power base.\n\nStill, Ghaani praises the Hamas invasion and tells Deif that Israel is “weaker than a spider’s web” in the letter, published by Iran’s state news agency, IRNA.\n\nDepartment of Education probes campuses over antisemitism, Islamophobia\n\nAs tensions boil over at campuses across the nation, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced Thursday it is launching investigations into six colleges and one school district over complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia.\n\nThe department is looking at the Maize Unified School District in Kansas, Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, Cornell University and Columbia University in New York, Wellesley College in Massachusetts, the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York, and the University of Pennsylvania. Five of the complaints allege antisemitism, and two allege Islamophobia.\n\n\"Hate has no place in our schools, period. When students are targeted because they are—or are perceived to be—Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Sikh, or any other ethnicity or shared ancestry, schools must act to ensure safe and inclusive educational environments where everyone is free to learn,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.\n\nThe investigations were launched under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin – including harassment based on a person’s shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics – in programs and activities receiving federal funds. Schools that violate the law can lose money or face other disciplinary action.\n\nSuspect arrested in death of Jewish protester outside LA\n\nA suspect in the death of a Jewish counter-protester was arrested Thursday in a Los Angeles suburb.\n\nThe Ventura County Sheriff's Office said in a statement it had detained Loay Abdelfattah Alnaji on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter \"for the death of Paul Kessler,'' and his bail would be set at $1 million.\n\nAlnaji, 50, teaches computer science at Moorpark College in Ventura County and has expressed support for the Palestinian cause on social media, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nKessler, 69, was part of a group protesting a pro-Palestinian rally Nov. 5 in Thousand Oaks, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles, when the sides clashed. Kessler fell backward in a confrontation with a demonstrator and hit his head against the ground, causing a bloody injury. He died in a hospital several hours later.\n\nIsrael bombs home of Hamas political leader\n\nIsraeli jets bombed the Gaza home of Hamas political bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh, the Israeli military said. The military shared a video of fighter jets bombing the building, which Israel says was part of the Hamas military infrastructure and a meeting place for Hamas’ senior leaders to direct terrorist attacks against Israel. The fate of Haniyeh, one of the highest-ranking officials in Hamas, was not immediately revealed.\n\nIsrael warns Palestinians in some parts of southern Gaza to flee\n\nMany Palestinians who fled northern Gaza on orders from the Israeli military were being warned to evacuate parts of southern Gaza, a turn in the war threatening to aggravate the severe humanitarian crisis already unfolding in the embattled enclave.\n\nResidents and journalists said the Israeli military was dropping leaflets near the southern town of Khan Younis warning people to evacuate and that anyone found near Hamas militants was \"putting his life in danger.\" Similar leaflets were dropped across northern Gaza in the weeks prior to the start of Israel's ground attack.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled the battering in northern Gaza have packed homes and U.N.-run shelters in the south.\n\nThe Israeli military has called on people to move to a “safe zone” in Al-Mawasi, a town on the Mediterranean coast where humanitarian aid could be delivered. Al-Mawasi is less than one mile wide and 9 miles long.\n\nThe heads of 18 U.N. agencies and international charities on Thursday rejected the creation of a safe zone, saying that concentrating civilians in one area while hostilities continue was too dangerous. They called for a cease-fire and unimpeded entry of humanitarian aid and fuel for Gaza’s population.\n\nHolocaust survivor says he was bullied off TikTok by antisemitism\n\nAn 88-year-old Holocaust survivor using TikTok to make sure a new generation does not forget says he’s being bullied off the social media platform by resurging antisemitism and Holocaust denial. Gidon Lev, a TikTok celebrity with nearly half a million followers, plans to deactivate his account after the flood of hateful comments and messages after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks made him fear for his safety. Lev, a retired dairy farmer who for years lived on the Gaza border, says he’s taking refuge from TikTok on Instagram.\n\n“A survivor of the Holocaust had to leave TikTok after the worst massacre against the Jews since the Holocaust. Imagine that,” his partner Julie Gray told USA TODAY.

The resulting 600,000 gallons of water daily could provide for about 300,000 people, the UAE Defense Ministry said, but did not say when the plants would come online.\n\nThe announcement came the same day the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics issued a report warning that Gaza faces a severe water crisis. Israeli bombings have left much of Gaza's infrastructure, including the water system, in ruin. The bureau said 55% of Gaza's water supply systems are in urgent need of repair.\n\nMuslim, Arab leaders discuss rise in Islamophobia with Biden administration officials\n\nSecretary of Education Miguel Cardona and other senior Biden administration officials met Wednesday with national Muslim, Arab and Sikh organization leaders to discuss efforts to counter an uptick in instances of Islamophobia, antisemitism and hate-fueled threats in schools and on college campuses. Earlier this month, the White House announced that the administration will develop the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/16"}]}

Here is what could be coming next:\n\nMore:If President Joe Biden steps down, is America ready for President Kamala Harris?\n\nDid Joe Biden drop out of the presidential race?\n\nBiden has announced he's withdrawn from the 2024 election.\n\nTop of mind for Democrats is who to put forward as a new presidential candidate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, 59, is the most logical replacement, and Biden in making his decision to drop out of the race also endorsed her. Many Democrats have resisted rallying behind Harris as the alternative.\n\nThese other leaders have been commonly named as other possible replacements:\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\nLook back:Who ran for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nAll eyes on Democratic National Committee to nominate new candidate\n\nAlthough the Democratic National Convention is scheduled for Aug 19., it still remains to be seen how the nomination will happen.\n\nThe nomination date has already been a pain point for the party.\n\nWhile the roll-call process of delegates formally casting their votes typically happens at the convention, the DNC Convention Rules Committee has been trying to hold a virtual nomination ahead of the convention. This push came after a legal challenge from a Republican Secretary of State in Ohio threatened to keep Biden off the ballot because of electoral deadlines in the state. The committee co-chairs say similar challenges may arise in several other states.\n\nWhen exactly this roll-call vote will occur has been a moving target, especially once the movement to replace Biden on the ticket began gathering momentum.\n\nIf the virtual nomination does not happen, Democrats could be looking at an open convention in August.\n\nIf no nomination, open convention decides party candidate\n\nThe convention, scheduled for Aug. 19-22, is taking place in Chicago, where the party also held a disastrous convention in 1968 after incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson opted to not seek reelection earlier in the year. Amid anti-war protests and a divided Democratic party, the convention is thought to have significantly damaged the party's campaign that year.\n\nThat year was also the last time the Democratic Party had an open convention. Unlike most modern conventions where delegates cast votes for the presumed nominee based on their state contests, open conventions happen without a presumed nominee. That means the party representatives from across the country would be able to cast their votes for whoever emerged to nominate a presidential candidate.\n\nWhat about all the campaign money?\n\nAs Biden has been running for reelection since April 2023, he has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds. That money is spread across a few fundraising committees.\n\nHarris could inherit a substantial amount of that as her name is on campaign documents, but this unprecedented change has yet to be tested against campaign finance laws.\n\nThe DNC also has a substantial campaign war chest, and they could likely use that money for whoever the nominee is.\n\nThe joint fundraising committees and the super PACs funding Biden's campaigns would have handle changes in where their donations are allocated within their organizations.\n\nContributing: Sam Woodward, Erin Mansfield, Phillip M.

The news came amid growing political divides over the Vietnam War and falling approval ratings.\n\nSince then, no incumbent president eligible to run again has stepped away from seeking a second term – until Sunday.\n\nThat day, President Joe Biden announced that he would drop out of the race, following months of gathering Democratic concerns about his age and chances of defeating Donald Trump.\n\nMost Americans alive today have never seen such a development. Before Johnson, in February 1952, Harry Truman decided to step aside from another term he could have sought. Calvin Coolidge, James Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford Hayes and Theodore Roosevelt also declined to seek another term when eligible.\n\nYet no president in the modern era has dropped out of the race so close to the election, especially after winning the primaries, presidential historians and political scientists told USA TODAY.\n\n“It’s unprecedented,” said Barbara Perry, a presidential studies scholar at the University of Virginia.\n\nPressure for Biden to step aside grew after a disastrous debate with his opponent, former President Trump, helped lead to his decision just 107 days before voters go to the polls. Biden’s decision comes months later in the process than the nearest 20th-century precedents.\n\n“We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before,” said Shannon B. O'Brien, a University of Texas professor who studies the American presidency, who also noted the possibility it will lead to a rare open convention for Democrats.\n\nBiden’s decision came just eight days after Trump survived a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally, further roiling what was already one of America’s most fraught presidential elections in decades.\n\nWhile circumstances and times differed greatly for past incumbents who stepped aside, historians note that after both Truman and Johnson decided to not to seek re-election, the opposing parties won the following presidential election.\n\nMore:As President Joe Biden steps aside, would America be ready for President Kamala Harris?\n\nJohnson took over the presidency after the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He won a full term a year later in 1964. But by 1968, the Vietnam War had fueled division in America and his popularity had plummeted.\n\nJohnson’s wife, “Lady Bird” Johnson, told presidential historian Michael Beschloss that “he felt so torn that he wasn't sure whether he'd stay in (the) Presidential race or withdraw right down to the moment he started his Oval Office TV speech March 31, 1968,” Beschloss said Sunday on social media.\n\nAfter Johnson announced he would not seek re-election, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Robert F. Kennedy emerged in a close contest for the nomination. But Kennedy was assassinated after winning the California primary, and the convention arrived with tensions running high. Protesters outside clashed with Chicago police as delegates inside nominated Humphrey. It was a choice made through the support of party leaders, and discord over the process helped cement the system of choosing candidates by primary.\n\nYet Johnson had stepped aside as the presidential race was in an earlier stage, not near the end of the nominating process, said Philip J. Crowley, a former professor at George Washington University and former Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. State Department.\n\nThat meant there was more time for selecting another candidate than there is now, said Susan Liebell, a political science professor at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia.\n\nDespite that time, Humphrey lost to Richard Nixon that fall.\n\nThe next most recent example was President Truman. He took over from Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945. His ailments would lead to his death soon after. Truman won the election in 1948 and could have run for another full term in 1952. But by then his ratings had fallen for a range of reasons including challenges of the Korean War.\n\nOn March 29, 1952, Truman made his announcement that he wouldn’t run. Instead, Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson ran and lost to Dwight Eisenhower, the celebrated World War II general.\n\nAlong with presidents Coolidge, Polk, Buchanan and Hayes, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both declined to run for a third time – long before 1951, when the 22nd Amendment added a two-term limit.\n\nHistorians say Biden’s place in history must be seen through the lens of today’s unprecedented political landscape, one rife with deep division and spiking worries about American democracy and fears the nation will slide toward autocracy.\n\nDespite the uncertainty that Biden’s decision creates, some experts said it was a likely painful and difficult one made against Biden’s own self-interests and instincts.\n\n“I think the country should take a moment and realize the magnitude of the decision that President Biden made for the good of his country,” Jon Meacham, the presidential historian, said on MSNBC, who said he knows Biden personally but is not a Democrat.\n\nStill, it has left Democrats scrambling to figure out next steps ahead of their own convention. Democrats have gone through 15 brokered conventions, but only six of these have resulted in a presidential win, according to Laura Ellyn Smith, a presidential historian at University of Oxford.\n\n“Before 2024, the significance of debates and national conventions were in question,” she said. Now, “for the first time since the tumultuous summer of 1968, America faces a Democratic convention without a candidate tested and victorious through the primary system.”\n\nShe added: “We will have to see what the Democratic convention brings.”\n\nThat convention begins in a month.

Trump faces over 90 charges in four indictments from New York to Florida. The former president and his businesses also face a number of civil lawsuits.\n\nFor Biden, age has been a concern among voters heading into the election, but a recent report from the Justice Department special counsel investigating his handling of classified documents thrust the issue into the spotlight after portraying Biden as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities\" and memory loss.\n\nIf elected, each candidate would top the list for oldest-serving presidents at the end of their terms. Biden would be 86 years old at the end of his second term, while Trump would be 82.\n\nWith Trump's legal proceedings as well as both candidates' ages, what would happen in a hypothetical situation where either nominee drops out of the race because they become incapacitated, convicted of charges or end up in jail?\n\nThe answer largely matters when.\n\n\"I think the unprecedented nature of this is you have a former president who's facing 91 indictments on one side and for both likely nominees, they're old,\" Josh Putnam, a political scientist who specializes in delegate selection rules and campaigns, told USA TODAY. \"Actuarially speaking, something could happen to one or both of them and they may not be around through the whole process.\"\n\nHere's how things could play out if Biden or Trump drop out of the 2024 race for the White House:\n\nDuring primary season and before national conventions\n\nExperts told USA TODAY if either candidate drops out before the national conventions − held in July for Republicans and August for Democrats − the path to finding the next nominee becomes more complicated.\n\nWhy are the conventions so important?\n\nThe national party conventions are held every presidential election year to officially select each party's nominee.\n\nAfter states hold their primaries, a certain number of delegates are allocated to a candidate based on the number of votes they received in the respective state. These delegates represent the candidate at each party's convention. The candidate must accumulate a majority of delegate votes to become the official party nominee.\n\nEach state allocates delegates differently depending on their system. In some cases, the candidate who wins the state receives all the state's delegates. In other states, delegates are split based on the percentage of votes a candidate receives.\n\nWhen delegates head to each party's national convention, they are generally tied to a certain candidate through the primary and caucus process in their states.\n\nBut it can get more complicated.\n\nIn some states, Republicans have \"unbound\" delegates who can cast a vote for whichever candidate they choose. Democrats have their own version − \"unpledged\" delegates − who can only participate in the voting process if the first round is contested, meaning no candidate received the majority of votes.\n\nIn the case of a contested election, there is a second (and possibly third, fourth, fifth, etc.) round of votes − similar to the uphill battle former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., faced during the 15 rounds of voting to win the speakership in January 2023.\n\nAnother piece that comes into play is exactly when Biden or Trump would drop out during primary season. If a candidate drops out early on before racking up a large number of delegates, other White House hopefuls may decide they want to try to win the nomination by gaining the remaining delegates.\n\n\"In other words, there's more time for competition,\" DNC member Elaine Kamarck, who is also a founding director and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said.\n\nBut if they drop out toward the end of the primaries, which end in mid-June, the number of delegates a candidate will receive is mostly set in stone.\n\nWhile the primaries establish how many delegate slots a candidate receives, Putnam, who is also the founder of FHQ Strategies, a nonpartisan political consulting venture, emphasized that determining the number of delegate slots does not simultaneously select the actual people who will fill those slots − a process that often lags behind primary election dates.\n\nAnd this process is equally as important, he said, especially in a scenario where a presumptive nominee drops out.\n\n\"The selection of the people there matters as to who's going to be making the decision at the convention as to who the replacement would become,\" Putnam said.\n\nFor example, Putnam said the Trump campaign is working to ensure that any delegate slots Trump is allocated will be filled by loyal supporters who would back the former president regardless of any convictions he could potentially face.\n\nIn a scenario where Biden or Trump drop out before the delegate selection process concludes, Putnam said it becomes more of a \"free for all\" as to how state parties would fill the delegate slots. These delegates would take part in the convention and potentially nominate someone who wasn't on the ballot.\n\nDuring the national conventions\n\nIf a candidate drops out between the last primary and the night of their respective party's nominating convention, each party reverts back to its historic roots.\n\nRepublicans would arrive in Milwaukee and Democrats in Chicago. Delegates would be \"uncommitted,\" meaning they are not in support of a specific candidate and have to decide who the next nominee will be.\n\nIn this scenario, prospective party nominees would visit each state's delegation to convince them for their support.\n\nBut what about Republican candidates who ran during primaries − like former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley − and dropped out, but still accumulated a handful of delegates?\n\nThe idea that Haley could emerge as the alternate at the Republican convention if Trump is toppled by his legal woes is wishful thinking, strategists told USA TODAY. In a situation where Trump is no longer in the picture, the delegates bound to the former president could decide to back someone completely different who never ran a campaign during primary season.\n\nAt this point in the race, it's unlikely Haley would be able to garner more delegates than Trump, specifically after the GOP's rules changed and converted many states to a winner-take-all system for allocating delegates.\n\n\"I think it's going to be hard for her to accumulate any more delegates. I think it's that dire,\" John Fortier, a senior fellow at the center-right think tank the American Enterprise Institute, told USA TODAY.\n\nFortier said if Trump were to drop out of the race before the convention, it is possible other GOP contenders who previously dropped out of the race would reactivate their campaigns in hopes of winning the Republican Party's nomination.\n\nAfter national conventions\n\nThe process varies for the Democratic and Republican national committees if their respective candidate drops out of the race after they've been officially nominated at the party's convention.\n\nPutnam said the national parties do the picking and choosing of who the replacement candidate will be.\n\n\"I think that's probably the least messy version of this,\" he said.\n\nBoth committees will hold special meetings to pick their next candidate.\n\nA similar process happened during the 1972 conventions. Democratic presidential nominee and three-term Sen. George McGovern's vice presidential pick, former Sen. Tom Eagleton, D-Mo., was being treated for mental illness and forced to resign from the ticket.\n\nMcGovern chose a replacement for his running mate, but it needed to be formally ratified by the DNC.\n\nIn this scenario, Kamarck said the chair makes the decision as to when the special meeting is called to order. It's possible the chair will want to hold the meeting quickly to allow the new nominee to campaign against the opposite party, but may also choose to wait a few weeks to see if a different candidate enters the race.\n\nAt this point, it's judgment calls per the party chair, she said.\n\n\"Closer to Election Day, it probably would be pretty smooth,\" Kamarck said. \"Earlier, say the end of August, other people may decide that they want to try and run and get the nomination. ... In other words, there's more time for competition.\"\n\nFortier said the timing of when a chosen party nominee drops out before Election Day could make things tricky when it comes to what name appears on the ballot. Because ballots need to be printed and in some cases sent out 45 days before Election Day, its possible the name of an ex-candidate appears on the ticket.\n\n\"There is a point at which the people you're replacing with could not appear on the ballot that people are actually going to see when they walk into a voting booth or get their absentee ballot,\" he said.\n\nAfter Election Day\n\nIf either candidate drops out between Election Day and Inauguration Day, what happens next depends on whether the electoral college has already met to attest to the election results. These are later sent to the Senate for certification of the ballot.\n\nIn some states, laws require electors to vote for the winning candidate. If the declared winner drops out before the electoral college meets, these legislatures may have to change the rules so the electors' votes bound to the winner would still count for another candidate.\n\nFortier said both parties can urge electors to vote for a certain candidate in the case where the original winner is incapacitated. But the Supreme Court in 2020 ruled that states can require presidential electors to vote for the candidate they pledged to support. If they don't, the elector could be removed and replaced by another.\n\n\"You could tell those electors to vote for somebody ... but maybe that new person hasn't even really faced the American people,\" Fortier said.\n\nIt becomes one of the most unclear scenarios if the president-elect becomes incapacitated in the weeks after the electors vote in mid-December but before Congress certifies the election results, Fortier said.\n\nThe responsibility then falls to Congress to count the votes and it is unclear how Congress would handle counting votes for a certain candidate who is no longer in the picture.\n\n\"It's just harder to see what the outcome is. That's why I say it's a very murky and very confusing period of time for something to happen,\" Fortier said.\n\nDuring the weeks after Congress counts the votes and before Inauguration Day, a winning candidate's running mate becomes the president and will be inaugurated in the case of the president-elect becoming unable to serve.\n\nWhat happens if Trump is convicted?\n\nAs for Trump's legal proceedings, there are no procedures or rules that would legally bar the former president from serving a second term if he is prosecuted, convicted or serving jail time.\n\nUntil recently, the idea that a presidential candidate would be convicted or in prison would be disqualifying among voters, Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University, said. But regardless of the norms, there is nothing illegal about it.\n\n\"We're headed toward this really uncharted situation,\" he said.\n\nIt has happened before. In 1920, socialist candidate Eugene Debs ran for president while serving a 10-year prison sentence for sedition. Debs received nearly 1 million votes.\n\nEdelson said while there is no realistic chance Trump will be in prison in 2025, he could be convicted over the course of the next year.\n\n\"There's plenty of time for a trial to take place,\" he said.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, it's unclear if the delegates bound to the former president are required to vote for him if he doesn't drop out of the race, which he has repeatedly indicated he will not do.\n\nIndividual states may unbind delegates from a candidate, but only if they withdraw from running, according to RNC rules.\n\n\"Whoever the voters choose is the appropriate nominee,\" RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said on CNN’s \"State of the Union\" in November when asked if Trump would be the appropriate nominee for the Republican party if convicted. \"As party chair, I’m going to support who the voters choose. And, yes, if they choose Donald Trump.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/20/were-living-in-an-unprecedented-election-season-sarah-gleason/74531069007/", "title": "We're living in an unprecedented election season | Sarah Gleason", "text": "Hey readers, Sarah here, the 2024 elections reporting fellow in North Carolina.

Had she not heard? Turns out, she and my dad were in a cabin with no internet service, so I guess I broke the news for them. I’m sure they’ll remember exactly where they were on that day too.\n\nIn North Carolina, things got interesting as well ... for a hot second. After Biden endorsed Harris, Gov.

I talked to some county party chairs, and they were excited about the prospect, but of course, those odds plummeted in July when he announced he would not be taking the job.\n\nAlthough I may not have been alive or politically aware for some of America’s most historic political events like the assassination of John F.

For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON − President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race − already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life − into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before. We’re proud to endorse her for president.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden’s viability as a candidate. She praised him for “prioritizing our nation’s needs” and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n“When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,” Bush said.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream. There are so many photos of the president enjoying the classic summer dessert.\n\nThe president's connection to the delightful treat continued Sunday.

Harris is the immediate frontrunner\n\nKamala Harris appears to be the leading candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s nominee in the 2024 election, after the president dropped his reelection bid amid rising concerns about his age following his debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden emphatically endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nIf formally nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman at the top of a major party presidential ticket. She has served as Biden’s vice president for more than three years and before that represented California in the U.S. Senate.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nRead Biden's full statement as he drops out of 2024 presidential race\n\nJoe Biden announced that he's dropping out of the 2024 race in a reflective letter penned to his fellow Americans.

Nov. 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”\n\nJohnson said Biden’s decision to leave the race under pressure from Democrats who feared he would lose to Trump “invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president.”\n\n“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden administration,” he said. “As second in command and a completely inept border czar, Harris has been a gleeful accomplice — not only in the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity, but also in the largest political coverup in U.S. history. She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nPelosi calls Biden 'one of the most consequential Presidents in American history'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race, said Biden is a “patriotic American who has always put his nation first.”\n\n“His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe former House speaker added: “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”\n\nIn recent days, Pelosi had reportedly shared concerns privately to Biden about his grim prospects to defeat Trump and that his candidacy could doom Senate and House Democratic candidates.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nPotential VP nominee Beshear says Biden's decision in “best interest” of country\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Joe Biden’s decision to drop his 2024 reelection bid in the “best interest of the country and party,” in a statement Sunday.\n\n“President Biden will be remembered as a consequential president. Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the January 6th attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,” Beshear wrote.\n\nHe is among a handful of Democratic governors believed to be on the short list to now join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n“Now it’s time for our nation to come together,” Beshear added in the post. “We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise.\"\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nHakeem Jeffries: 'We are forever grateful'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Rep.

Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" he added.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden exits race amid widespread pressure, mounting concerns about his age\n\nBiden's exit came after he received bleak warnings from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that his candidacy could lead to massive losses for Democrats in the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans’ concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n−Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B.

Was it OK?", "text": "An Alabama Supreme Court's ruling has torn open a long-simmering and emotionally charged debate about whether some aspects of in vitro fertilization represent a form of abortion and should be banned under religious principles.\n\nChristian opposition to abortion has long driven the debate over reproductive rights. Abortion opponents say life begins at conception, and even a handful of cells deserves the same legal protections as a person.\n\nIn his concurring opinion last week, Chief Justice Tom Parker, an elected Republican, invoked similar reasoning.\n\n\"In summary, the theologically based view of the sanctity of life adopted by the People of Alabama encompasses the following: (1) God made every person in His image; (2) each person therefore has a value that far exceeds the ability of human beings to calculate; and (3) human life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God, who views the destruction of His image as an affront to Himself.\"\n\nBut legal scholars say invocating religion is an unusual step for a judge. And IVF advocates are concerned about injecting religion into what they see as a medical decision to have a family.\n\n“The substance of the ruling is not a surprise at all. But the language he used, it’s completely out of bounds ‒ unusual to an extreme degree,” said Jennifer Hendricks, a law professor and family law expert at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nIVF has faced religious opposition from some Christians\n\nIt all comes down to a small cluster cells.\n\nOn one side of the battle are millions of Americans who used in-vitro fertilization to have desperately wanted children who could otherwise not have been born.\n\nOn the other are Christian religious conservatives who argue humans should not be playing God in a laboratory, and that life begins at conception. The Catholic Church in particular opposes IVF, though some religions, including Buddhism and Hinduism, have no hesitations about the procedure.\n\nSeveral Alabama facilities, including the provider that was sued in the initial case, announced this week that they are pausing their IVF programs.\n\nAlthough the ruling itself affects only embryos in Alabama, word of the decision has spread quickly across the nation and already is reverberating in Washington. Opinions are highly polarized.\n\nPresident Joe Biden weighed in with a statement Thursday saying voters should re-elect him if they wanted a different approach to reproductive rights. \"The disregard for women’s ability to make these decisions for themselves and their families is outrageous and unacceptable,\" he said. Vice President Kamala Harris also slammed the court's decision, saying it sets a dangerous precedent for \"robbing women of the freedom to decide when and how to build a family.\"\n\nBut Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she agrees with the court's contention that frozen embryos created through IVF are children. “Embryos, to me, are babies,” Haley told NBC News. “That's a life.\"\n\nRuling again pits theology against reproductive rights\n\nSome conservative states have passed laws specifying that life begins at conception, and the Alabama court leaned heavily on Christian faith and the Bible to make its case. The court referred to the embryos as \"embryonic children ... kept alive in a cryogenic nursery.\"\n\nRachel Laser, president and CEO of Washington D.C.-based nonprofit Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said citing the Bible in this manner is like “giving the middle finger to a foundational promise of our country.”\n\nAlabama’s top court ruling on IVF is part of a larger movement to “impose religious theology,\" Laser said, in conflict with the constitutional promise of separating church and state. She saw the verdict in Alabama as part of a larger Christian nationalist movement – the idea that America was created by and for Christians an its laws should reflect that.\n\n“The agenda doesn’t stop with reproductive rights. It’s much, much bigger,” Laser said. “And that should concern every American, because America wouldn’t be America without the separation of church and state.”\n\nLaser noted that moral arguments put forth by lawmakers and judges often impose a singular definition of morality on everyone, including people of other faiths and Christians who don’t align with the same set of values or believe they should be imposed by law.\n\nAlong with jeopardizing access to IVF and abortions, Laser said the ruling could affect access to contraception, as some forms work by blocking embryos from implanting in the uterus.\n\n“That’s what could come next,” she said.\n\nIVF was a polarizing issue from the start\n\nIn 1979, a year after the world's first IVF baby was born, a coalition of anti-abortion groups denounced the new technology as \"morally abhorrent\" and persuaded the federal government to block funding for any research in which embryos were destroyed. But the number of what were then referred to as \"test tube\" babies continued to rise as desperate families turned to IVF to conceive children. Today, about 2% of all babies born in the U.S. annually are conceived through IVF.\n\n\"Over the years, the anti-abortion movement gradually accepted some reproductive technologies, as long as no embryos were destroyed during their use,\" said Margaret Marsh, a historian and professor at Rutgers University. \"But the peace it made with the new technologies was always an uneasy peace.”\n\nMarsh co-wrote a 2019 history of IVF with her sister, a gynecologist.\n\nBecause IVF was developed after Roe became the law of the land in 1973, embryos have typically been treated as private property that donors could implant, give away or have destroyed without consequence. But newly passed \"personhood\" laws pushed by conservatives and some religious groups are changing that.\n\nNationally, about 100,000 births a year involve IVF, an emotionally and physically exhausting process by which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to bring about a pregnancy. In most cases, doctors create more embryos than are implanted, allowing patients to store those embryos in liquid nitrogen at -321 degrees for future use, donation or destruction.\n\nIn the IVF procedure, a three- to five-day-old fertilized egg, known as a blastocyst, is implanted in a woman's uterus. At this point it contains between 70 and 200 cells.\n\nThose tiny clusters of cells can only develop inside a womb, and officials estimate there may be as many as 1 million frozen embryos stored nationwide.\n\nIVF families have often struggled for years to get pregnant and undergoing expensive IVF treatment typically requires the administration of powerful fertility drugs and invasive medical procedures for the chance to have a baby. People turn to IVF for many reasons, including fertility loss after cancer treatments, or military members heading out on long-term deployments who want to delay having children.\n\nIs it OK for a judge to invoke the Bible?\n\nIn a commentary attached to the Alabama ruling, Parker leaned heavily on the religious foundation of American laws, connecting them to longstanding Christian tenets such as the 10 Commandments' prohibition against murder. Parker noted that other countries have adopted IVF policies that reduce the number of unneeded embryos and suggested that IVF regulations in the United States are little better than \"the Wild West.\"\n\n\"The Alabama Constitution's recognition that human life is an endowment from God emphasizes a foundational principle of English common law, which has been expressly incorporated as part of the law of Alabama,\" Parker wrote.\n\n\"All three branches of government are subject to a constitutional mandate to treat each unborn human life with reverence,\" he continued. \"Carving out an exception for the people in this case, small as they were, would be unacceptable to the People of this State, who have required us to treat every human being in accordance with the fear of a holy God who made them in His image.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church in 1987 issued an opinion setting out its opposition to IVF, arguing in part that it was immoral because it \"does violence to human dignity and to the marriage act,\" by replacing the act of conception between a married couple with a procedure by a laboratory worker.\n\n\"Human beings bear the image and likeness of God. They are to be reverenced as sacred. Never are they to be used as a means to an end, not even to satisfy the deepest wishes of an infertile couple,\" the church said. \"The marital act is not a manufacturing process, and children are not products.\"\n\nLael Weinberger, a nonresident fellow at Stanford Law School and attorney who previously clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, appointed by former President Donald Trump said the court's decision did not invoke religion and Parker was simply musing about the history and theology of law in his concurring opinion.\n\n“It can't be the case that the First Amendment prohibits our courts from grappling with the history of law,” Weinberger said.\n\nWeinberger said the new ruling gives the couples who originally sued another chance to file a wrongful death suit. A lower court had dismissed their claims on the basis that embryos were not considered children.\n\nBut Nicole Huberfeld, a law professor at Boston University School of Law, said Parker's opinion stands out because it references Christian beliefs so significantly.\n\n\"The thing is that's unusual is how overtly this concurrence is relying on Christian sanctity of life reasoning,\" she said.\n\nThe First Amendment's Establishment Clause typically limits the role religion can play in government, but the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 changed the longstanding process by which it reviewed conflicts between government and religion. The decision to change that process was written by Justice Gorsuch, who said the court needed to rely more heavily on \"reference to historical practices and understandings.\" Parker, the Alabama judge, specifically referenced Gorsuch in his concurrent opinion.\n\nPast Supreme Courts might have objected to Parker's reliance on religion, but Huberfeld said she's not sure whether the current conservative majority ‒ which overturned the right to abortion two years ago ‒ would find it problematic.\n\n\"Judges are not supposed to rely on religious principles for legal reasoning,\" Huberfeld said. \"The Alabama Constitution does use the word 'God.' But so does the Declaration of Independence.\"\n\nProfessor Ian Farrell of the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law said Parker’s opinion is “certainly problematic” because it invokes cherry-picked portions of the Christian faith.Like other experts, he said the judge’s opinion may run afoul of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause because it so clearly draws from Christian faith to reach a conclusion. “The Bible tells people to do a lot of crazy stuff,” Farrell said. “It doesn’t strike me as legitimate legal reasoning.”\n\nReligion has always affected the way people interpret the law and played a role in the life of Americans, said Hendricks of UC Boulder. But legal standards have typically kept one specific religion, such as Christianity, from imposing its values on everyone.“The concern a lot of people have is that we’re on a path to theocracy here.\"\n\nLindsay Heller, an IVF mom and attorney, said she thanks \"whoever is up there\" every day for her two kids. But she believes IVF decisions should be between families and doctors ‒ not courts and religion.\n\n\"IVF might fall by the wayside if you're going by someone's religious values about how life is created,\" she said. \"A doctor isn't going to put their license on the line to help someone get pregnant.\"\n\nElizabeth Weise contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2024/02/29/joni-ernst-complaining-ivf-alabama/72776896007/", "title": "Letters: Joni Ernst should do her job instead of complaining", "text": "The Register's readers\n\nDes Moines Register\n\nLow pay an important factor in indigent-defense discussions\n\nThe Feb. 25 story on indigent attorney fees in the Register was well worth reading and made a significant point.\n\nIt did disappoint in not identifying a simple fact: that indigent defense attorneys in Iowa are paid too little. For instance, South Dakota pays a much higher rate to private lawyers who do indigent defense. Furthermore, the work often requires doing preparation and facing expenses the state will not repay.\n\nI did this work for many years. It is genuinely worthwhile. It never paid enough to keep my practice going.\n\nTom Graves, Urbandale\n\nProsecutors, judges also have a role in defense costs\n\nThe report in the Feb. 25 Register regarding the financial impact on defendants represented by court appointed counsel touched on a number of factors that inhibit affordably representing indigent defendants. You missed two very important factors: prosecutorial discretion, and proper assessment of costs.\n\nThe prosecutor has wide discretion regarding which transgressions to formally charge and how to resolve such cases. What is the \"value\" of a crime? Does the infraction have such social or economic impact to justify a full-blown prosecution, or can it be resolved through alternative means that reduces or eliminates the need for a defense lawyer?\n\nWill restitution, community service, or an apology serve as sufficient remedy and deterrent? Do we really need to impose a criminal record for minor infractions that will be like toilet paper stuck to a defendant's shoe? Prosecutors have the discretion to weigh the totality of the circumstances.\n\nWhat about assignment of attorney fees on cases that are dismissed? In incidents of illegal behavior by law enforcement, or weak evidence, leading to dismissal, the defendant shouldn't bear the cost of their defense. In these cases, some, or all, of the cost of the prosecution should be borne by the law enforcement agency or the prosecutor's office. Without some financial consequences, there is little incentive not to pursue weak or flawed cases. A case dismissed just prior to trial will have had substantial time invested by defense counsel. The agency (not the state) should pay that expense.\n\nKent Balduchi, Des Moines\n\nToo little attention on education for disabled children\n\nThe Feb. 25 guest essay by state Rep. Josh Turek on Iowans with disabilities was devastating. How did we become a state that does not take care of their disabled citizens? This has to change. We all know families struggling to take care of a physically or mentally disabled family member. Iowans do care about their neighbors and community, but those governing want tax cuts and a surplus.\n\nThis piece did not touch on how we are handling schoolchildren in our state with disabilities. I would like to see the state report on the number of disabled children starting school this year and how they will help schools. The Legislature makes laws affecting special education teachers without any type of research on what teaching methods work best for disabled children. Private schools do not have to accept children with disabilities.\n\nThe citizens of Iowa deserve to know all the facts on who is affected when laws are written and changed. Politics and culture wars are lawmakers’ top priority. They are not supporting those who actually live in our state.\n\nLynn Cannon, Des Moines\n\nIVF debate results from Republicans getting exactly what they wanted\n\nRepublicans have been trying for decades to convince everyone that a group of zygotes (fertilized eggs) barely visible without a microscope, are actually the same as a class of kindergartners. The have also been packing the courts with right wing extremists, including so-called Christian nationalists like the Alabama chief justice.\n\nNow those two efforts have intersected with the Alabama IVF (in vitro fertilization) ruling, and everybody is backpedaling so fast their legs are cramping up.\n\nIf the fertilized egg is a person, and IVF necessarily creates eggs that are discarded, there is no reconciliation of the two. That is unless the Republican politicians decide that they will write the complete book of rules for in vitro fertilization, which I'm sure will be next. That will be fun. A case of unintended consequences.\n\nFrank McCammond, Redfield\n\nOne place you won’t find a mass shooter\n\nThe editorial board’s Feb. 25 piece “To keep Iowa schoolkids safe from guns, look to research, not more guns,” which opposed allowing teachers and other school employees to carry weapons, omitted a valid question: When was the last time a would-be shooter opened fire at a gun show?\n\nTodd Blodgett, Mason City\n\nRepublicans aren’t stopping at abortion limits\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that frozen embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) are considered children and subject to the wrongful death of a minor law, if one is destroyed. Ridiculous, you say? U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra must not think so, as they sponsor the Life At Conception Act, along with over 120 other Republicans.\n\nThe Republican Party has become a patriarchal theocracy. Republicans seek to control a woman’s body. They intend to control our reproductive freedom, our right to abortion, IVF, and soon, contraception. The U.S. Supreme Court is deciding the legality for the distribution of mifepristone, known as the morning-after pill. This is given to women who have been raped, though not in Iowa, as Attorney General Brenna Bird apparently does not believe in it.\n\nIowa women, have you had enough? It is the Republicans who are banning books. It is the Republicans who are rewriting our history. It is the Republicans who control funding for education. It is the Republicans who want to control what they refer to as “recreational sex.” It is Republicans who want to control you.\n\nIt is up to women, and those who support us, to defeat them at the ballot box.\n\nAnn Hart, Waukon\n\nPublic transit deserves investment\n\nI'm amazed that the Des Moines City Council is considering cutting back an already inadequate public transit system. I learned the importance of public transportation during my final 10 years of my working career moving homeless people into \"productive society.\" It can't be done without a good transit system. Most of today's jobs are located where the poor can't afford to live. Most poor folks live a good distance from a grocery store or a doctor.\n\nThis council likes to pass resolutions about the city becoming carbon neutral, but when it comes to funding public transit, it ain’t worth a 2.5% franchise fee. All talk and no hat.\n\nJeff Clingan, Van Meter\n\nOf course laws on auditing are political\n\nI would take issue with state Sen. Michael Bousselot's statement that \"only in politics can hiring an independent … accountant be political.\" The context is reducing the authority of the state auditor. You don't have to be a CPA, which I am, to know that last year the allowing the audited departments to withhold documents would make it impossible to have a complete audit. This year Bousselot wants the departments to hire their own auditors rather than use the state auditor, though that office would be allowed to review the work. Not very economically beneficial.\n\nThese two attempts to reduce the authority of the auditor are political, as the auditor is the only state office not held by the party in power. These provisions are insulting to our intelligence and insulting to the voters who elected the state auditor, and now these limitations are an attempt to overturn that election.\n\nThese same attempts were used to try and limit the authority of Tom Miller. the previous attorney general. No limitations are proposed for the new attorney general.\n\nThis would seem to support the old saying \"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" With these provisions in place, corruption is soon to follow.\n\nRoger Jacobsen, West Des Moines\n\nAre all lives precious?\n\nSo, in Alabama frozen embryos are protected, but the death penalty is in full effect? I’m beyond confused.\n\nMark Mahoney, Urbandale\n\nIowa representatives should force a vote on Ukraine aid\n\nThe United States is in danger of breaking a promise to provide military aid to help Ukraine fight Russian invaders, simply because House Speaker Mike Johnson won’t allow the House to vote on a Senate bill that allocated $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine.\n\nWhile Donald Trump and his devotees play political games, Ukrainian troops are forced to ration ammunition, which puts them at a considerable disadvantage when fighting the Russians. The Ukrainian people are dying every day from Russian bombing and rocket attacks, because Ukraine no longer has the necessary ammunition and equipment to defend its people.\n\nThe only way to bring the Senate bill to a vote without Johnson’s consent is to use one of several arcane parliamentary rules, all of which would require at least four Republicans to vote with Democrats. All four of Iowa’s representatives should take a cue from our senators and put the need to support a democratic ally above the political whims of one man. If we abandon Ukraine now, we will be responsible for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian deaths, not to mention the other depredations inflicted upon them by vengeful Russian conquerors.\n\nJim Whalen, Des Moines\n\nToday’s animal agriculture hurts everybody\n\nMichaelyn Mankel’s Feb. 14 opinion piece about water quality and her work at Food & Water Watch resonates with Iowans. Those of us who grew up on a family farm have seen farming go from a way of life to an extractive, destructive agribusiness industry. The advent of CAFOs has brought about the most significant changes in the history of animal agriculture, to the detriment of all who live here.\n\nThe negative consequences for animal welfare are undeniable. Beach lovers have been impacted, particularly. In the Memorial Day through Labor Day period for Iowa’s 39 public beaches, the Iowa DNR issued 21 beach advisories for microcystin and 111 for E. coli. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Rock Island District issued 19 advisories for E. coli on the six beaches it monitors on Iowa reservoirs. Pine Lake Beach had the most advisories for E. coli, one for every week of the summer monitoring period.\n\nAs Rep. Art Staed said when he introduced House File 2354, “Voluntary approaches have proven that Iowa’s corporate agriculture industry will not regulate itself.” I agree with him. That’s why I’m asking you to urge your Iowa House and Senate representatives to support the Clean Water for Iowa Act.\n\nJan Corderman, Pleasant Hill, member of Iowa Alliance for Responsible Ag steering committee\n\nBiden uses our money to buy votes\n\nRecent polls indicate President Joe Biden is losing the approval of the younger voter. Traditionally, he has been able to count on this voting bloc for support. I find his recent decision to forgive over $1 billion in student loans to be a devious move to purchase votes without the use of campaign funds. Rather, he has used the money from taxpayers like me to underwrite his drive for another term as president.\n\nStu Bassman, West Des Moines\n\nWhy are nursing-care deaths shrugged off?\n\nPlease explain why, when a death in a child day care center occurs, the proprietor is arrested. But when a death in a care center for the elderly occurs, the management receives a fine. How do you justify the discrepancy?\n\nElaine Hood, Humboldt\n\nZach Nunn has voted against Head Start\n\nCongressman Zach Nunn recently wrote to his constituents after he visited a Head Start program in Red Oak.\n\n“Head Start is critical to improving child development,” he wrote, “by providing kids in need with a little extra help before they start kindergarten.” As a nearly 20-year veteran working for Head Start at the Iowa Department of Education, I was thrilled he visited that center. I could not agree more. Head Start is critical.\n\nUnfortunately, Nunn forgot how critical Head Start is for children in the 3rd Congressional District when he voted twice to cut its funding. First to support a Debt Ceiling Bill last spring (HR 2811), and second as part of a Continuing Resolution in September (HR 5525). Research shows that funding for early childhood development returns seven times its original investment in benefits and cost savings. Nunn should either be a real supporter of Head Start and not a phony one, or just admit that he is all right with shortchanging Iowa’s children and spare us his empty praises.\n\nTom Rendon, Des Moines\n\nJoni Ernst should do her job instead of obstructing and complaining\n\nIn her nearly 10 years in the Senate, Joni Ernst has had few public town halls in Polk County, which has over 10% of Iowa's population.\n\nSo, I traveled to Pella recently to see her and follow up with coffee and pastries. I was disappointed in her attitude that it is so hard to get things accomplished in Washington. Especially when she said that changes in the asylum laws won't be accomplished in her lifetime. They missed their shot.\n\nWell, nothing is impossible. And she's not that much older than I am. So the notion of something not being addressed in my lifetime is pathetic.\n\nThat's your job.

The latter item touches on a key theme of this year’s convention due to conflict surrounding a proposed measure to enshrine a ban on women pastors.\n\nCatch up with Monday's SBC news:SBC live updates: Seminary leader condemns Trump verdict, voices opposition to IVF\n\nThe constitutional ban on women pastors — commonly called the “Law Amendment” after its original submitter, Virginia pastor Mike Law — may come up for a vote Tuesday or on Wednesday.\n\nSBC President Bart Barber, a Texas pastor who’s concluding his second and final term as the convention’s highest-elected position, will preside over the business of the annual meeting throughout the next two days. Many important legislative sessions are scheduled for tight windows, requiring brief yet passionate speeches for and against certain legislative proposals.\n\nFollow along for live updates.\n\nSBC presidential results set for Wednesday\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention will announce on Wednesday the results of its presidential election. Six candidates were running to lead the nation's largest Protestant denomination and the top three — Clint Pressley, David Allen, Dan Spencer — moved on to a runoff.\n\nVote on IVF resolution delayed\n\nAs business moved into the evening, the Southern Baptist Convention delayed until Wednesday a debate and vote on a resolution condemning the use of in vitro fertilization.\n\nThe resolution criticizes IVF and calls on Southern Baptists to only support reproductive technologies that affirm the \"unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage.\"\n\nThe resolution was authored by Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Southern seminary professor Andrew Walker. It comes in the wake of an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February. The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate.\n\nPresidential election heads to runoff between top three\n\nA pool of six candidates was cut Tuesday evening in half with the top three vote-getters in the group headed to a runoff for SBC president.\n\nCandidates Clint Pressley, David Allen and Dan Spencer received the most votes in the initial round of voting, sending them onto the next round.\n\nSBC ousts Virginia church over stance on women in ministry\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved the ouster of First Baptist Church Alexandria in Virginia for its egalitarian stance on women in ministry.\n\nA debate over the church's ouster on Tuesday echoed that of last year when the messengers voted overwhelmingly to uphold the ouster of Saddleback Church and Fern Creek Baptist Church from the denomination, which SBC leaders disfellowshipped for having women pastors.\n\nAn expected debate ahead of this week’s annual meeting, FBC Alexandria published information from an SBC committee review into the church’s stances on women in ministry. That committee, called the SBC Credentials Committee, formally recommended the church’s ouster during the Tuesday afternoon business session.\n\n“We take no joy in this recommendation,” said Jonathan Sams, chair of the SBC Credentials Committee. Sams explained the recommendations is primarily based on the committee’s findings that FBC Alexandria holds to an egalitarian view of women in church leadership instead of a complementarian one, which the SBC’s doctrinal statement holds to. Complementarianism refers to a belief that men and women have certain assigned roles.\n\nFBC Alexandria senior pastor Robert Stephens didn’t deny the egalitarianism charge but said it shouldn’t get in the way of a nearly 180-year relationship between the church and the denomination.\n\n“First Baptist Alexandria stands before you as a testament that we can maintain a fruitful partnership with churches that take a different stance on women in ministry,” said Stephens on the floor of the convention. Stephens said FBC Alexandria has ordained three women since 1980.\n\nMessengers voted to disfellowship FBC Alexandria with 91% of voting messengers in favor of the ouster, or 6,700-plus votes.\n\nRelated:What state-level ousters of SBC churches say about the national debate about women pastors\n\nAbuse reform group calls out obstacles on way out\n\nIn its final report to the convention after two years of work, leaders of a temporary abuse reform task force called out fellow Southern Baptists for creating obstacles that hindered the task force’s success.\n\n“Our report basically reflects the fact we took this work as far as we were allowed,” said North Carolina pastor Josh Wester, chair of the SBC Abuse Reform Implementation Task Force, from the platform on Tuesday. “The reality of our system is that any task force is going to be relatively at the mercy of the various apparatus that makes up the SBC.”\n\nWester was responding to a question from Keith Meyer, a messenger from Maryland, who asked a question from the floor about the obstacles the abuse reform task force faced. “To be honest, what you have given us today is not the completion of everything we have asked us for,” Meyer said.\n\nMeyer’s sentiment is shared by many, including among abuse survivors and advocates for reform who attended the SBC annual meeting this year, that the abuse reform task force’s completed work fell far short of the group’s original mandate from the 2022 SBC annual meeting.\n\nThe abuse reform task force was a temporary group that the convention renewed last year but expired after presenting its report on Tuesday afternoon. Wester said during the task force’s presentation the group is on the brink of officially launching a database of abusive ministers with the first 100 names of those convicted in a criminal trial or found liable in a civil case.\n\nThe database, called Ministry Check, was expected to be online already and far more extensive, just one example of many of the task force’s shortcomings. As a testament to the myriad challenges, former and current members of the task force incorporated a nonprofit to manage the database because the SBC’s insurance liability “left no other way,” Wester said Tuesday.\n\nWester also noted challenges with the task force’s ability to receive funding from Send Relief, a collective funding initiative in the SBC that took on the responsibility of funding for abuse reform work two years ago. But Wester said it was far more troublesome to securing those funds.\n\n“The problem that we faced is grappling with the fact that the Southern Baptist Convention…had no meaningful plan to help its churches prevent or respond to sexual abuse,” Wester said in his presentation to the full convention. The convention adopted the abuse reform task force’s recommendations, forwarding on most long-term abuse needs to other SBC channels.\n\nPence addresses abortion, but avoids Christian nationalism and Trump conviction\n\nBefore a room of 400-plus Southern Baptists, former Vice President Mike Pence backed policy ideas that appeal to many religious conservatives but stopped short of explicitly denouncing a far-right religious movement rising amid former President Donald Trump’s candidacy for president in November.\n\n\"There’s also a very healthy debate within my party about whether we’re going to stay on the course…traditional moral values, a right to life, an affirmation of religious liberty or whether we’re going to start to move in a different direction,\" Pence said during a luncheon organized by the SBC’s public policy arm, the Nashville-based Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.\n\nPence warned against a \"different direction\" and spoke to the importance of the GOP emphasizing certain traditional policy positions such as fiscal conservatism and defense spending. Many in the room nodded and murmured in agreement with Pence's analysis.\n\nDuring a panel moderated by Brent Leatherwood, the commission's president, Pence focused on victories for the anti-abortion movement and condemning President Joe Biden.\n\nBut he avoided commenting on Trump’s candidacy or the former president’s recent guilty verdict in a Manhattan hush money trial, which other leading Southern Baptist voices have criticized.\n\nOn Monday, Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, doubled down on his criticism of Trump’s conviction in an address to a crowd of 750-plus mostly Southern Baptists during an event organized by the Danbury Institute.\n\nThe institute is led those in an opposition conservative faction that have sought to pull the SBC further to the right. The same event on Monday featured a prerecorded video message from Trump.\n\nMonday’s event reflected a rising sentiment among conservative Christians that America was founded as a Christian nation, an idea often associated with the Christian nationalism movement.\n\nIn fact, Pence’s remarks about his time serving in the Trump administration were mostly noncombatant.\n\nFor example, he highlighted the administration’s appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court Justices who helped “send Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history,” Pence said during Tuesday’s luncheon.\n\nSBC President Bart Barber emphasizes generosity in final address\n\nFor his last word of encouragement to Southern Baptists, SBC President Bart Barber admonished the convention to embrace a spirit of generosity.\n\n“If our experience of the local church is growing the right kind of heart in our chest, it’s going to be second nature for us to do the right thing here,” Barber, a Texas pastor, said in his address to the convention early into its annual meeting. “Your church and my church would be healthier when we can get the people to see their mission as building people up and growing people.”\n\nDivision within the SBC has harmed the denomination’s reputation before the secular world, Barber said. “People we push out the door and shut it behind them will no longer be influenced by us at all.”\n\nBarber concludes his second and final term as the denomination’s highest-ranking elected official at the end of the Indianapolis gathering, the business of which he presides over.\n\nOriginally elected at the 2022 SBC annual meeting, Barber has earned the fondness of many Southern Baptists for his folksy charm and his stature as a pastor of a small church. In the past couple years, Barber has led the convention during a time of deep conflict and confusion over abuse reform and the debate over the status of women pastors.\n\nBarber was featured in a \"60 Minutes\" segment and was the first SBC president to attend the largest gathering of Christian Native Americans following the convention’s adoption of a resolution on the history of federal Indian boarding schools.\n\nBarber spoke to the more than 10,600 registered messengers and nearly 3,000 registered guests about the convention’s health and longevity.\n\n“We can face all these challenges together if our churches are healthy,” Barber said. “Take the baton. You, the Southern Baptist Convention keeps on going.”\n\nBarber’s message sought to combat a broader narrative of “the great dechurching” and anxiety over declining church membership. He also emphasized the importance of cooperation, a major theme of this year’s annual meeting due to the Law Amendment. Barber appointed the 20-member SBC Cooperation Group, which studied the denomination’s standards for affiliating with churches and is scheduled to present a report later Tuesday.\n\nSix candidates are vying to be the next SBC president, the election for which is scheduled on Tuesday evening. At least one runoff is all but guaranteed.\n\nBarber profile:Bart Barber defied the Conservative Resurgence. How it is now shaping his SBC leadership.\n\nSolidarity for women in ministry ahead of vote on constitution\n\nIf the Southern Baptist Convention enshrines a ban on women pastors, it will be one many Southern Baptists will celebrate. But on Monday night, it was a source of mournfulness during a virtual prayer vigil.\n\n“There’s a lot to grieve, there’s a lot to be angry about,” speaker Jule Tai said in opening the vigil. “It’s a call to protest and it’s a call to demonstration.”\n\nOrganized by Baptist Women in Ministry, a nonprofit with partners across various Baptist denominations, the event aimed to acknowledge the current strife in the SBC and past division. Baptist Women in Ministry staff are also planning a demonstration outside the Indianapolis Convention Center as an act of solidarity with Southern Baptist women in ministry.\n\nRelated:How the Southern Baptist Convention turned 180 degrees on women in leadership in six years\n\nThe present battle in the SBC over women pastors echoes a conflict in the 1980s, which is depicted in a new documentary produced by Baptist Women in Ministry called “Midwives of a Movement.” Some of the women featured in the documentary, which released publicly on Monday, attended the vigil.\n\n“We swallowed our grief when we were told we weren’t ready to lead,” said Angie Hong, co-founder of Kinship Commons, a liturgy company that helped organize the worship for the prayer vigil. “We swallowed our grief when we were told we were too emotional, we were too angry, we were too provocative, we were too much.”\n\n“These untruths and these lies have hurt us,” Hong said. “These lies have wounded us, made us question ourselves and worse, made us question the God who created us in God’s image.”\n\nIn the past couple years, the SBC has disfellowshipped six churches in which women serve as pastors. A couple of those churches — such as Fern Creek Baptist Church in Louisville and Immanuel Baptist Church in Paducah, Kentucky — long cooperated with the SBC and held to beliefs that aligned with most Southern Baptists' conservative ideals.\n\nAnother church might be facing a similar battle this week. First Baptist Church of Alexandria announced it will be the target of an ouster attempt from the floor of the SBC annual meeting because the church employs a woman pastor for children and women.\n\nLiam Adams covers religion for The Tennessean.

Overall, Biden told Americans from coast to coast that \"The state of our union is strong and getting stronger.”\n\nBut as the president seeks another term in office, he also repeatedly hit former President Donald Trump, whom he only referred to as his \"predecessor.\"\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., delivered the Republican response to Biden's remarks after he wrapped up his speech, highlighting conservative priorities during a close election year.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage of the State of the Union.\n\nTakeaways from Biden’s State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden called on Americans to look to \"the future\" and not return to the politics of his predecessor in a State of the Union address that served as the kickoff to a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nHe began his address with an immediate attack on Trump by casting the fight ahead as one to preserve \"freedom and democracy\" − the central theme of his candidacy. Biden made restoring abortion rights a major theme of his speech, blaming Trump for the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 by appointing three justices who tilted the court's conservative majority.\n\nHe also addressed challenges both at home and abroad, getting into a heated confrontation with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., over the border and calling on Israel to “do its part” in sending humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden, Donald Trump troll each other during SOTU speech\n\nHe never mentioned Donald Trump by name. But President Joe Biden was quick to go after his “predecessor” and “the last administration” Thursday during the State of the Union address, hammering Trump on everything from Russia policy to abortion, taxes and the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump started jabbing Biden hours before he entered the House chamber, where he delivered his speech. Trump complained about Biden being late when the event didn’t start on time and kept up his “Play by Play” throughout much of the speech.\n\nFor instance, at one point in the speech, Biden accused Trump of trying to “bury the truth about Jan. 6” to which Trump defended Jan. 6 participants on Truth Social and repeated unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\n-- Zac Anderson and Michael Collins\n\n‘Remember Abbey Gate’ man yelling interrupts SOTU speech\n\nApproximately one hour into the speech, in which Joe Biden drew sharp contrasts between himself and the Republican Party, a person began shouting causing the President to pause briefly. “Remember Abbey Gate! US Marines!” the protester shouted.\n\nAbbey Gate is a reference to a 2021 suicide bombing during the evacuation of Afghanistan.\n\nThe protester was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n-- James Powel, Jeanine Santucci, Tom Vanden Brook, Ken Tran\n\nHouse Republican: Joe Biden's energy was 'high' despite age\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., said he was impressed by Joe Biden's energy on Thursday night, despite his age. The Montana lawmaker remarked that the president's energy was notably \"high.\"\n\nZinke's reaction to his address is a stark contrast to Republicans who have repeatedly attacked Biden, 81, over his age. Prior to Biden's address, several House Republicans joked they wanted to see a \"coherent\" message from the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'We want families to grow'\n\nKatie Britt addressed a number of conservative priorities on Thursday, from addressing inflation to curbing TikTok.\n\nBut the Alabama lawmaker also discussed IVF in the wake of her home state's Supreme Court decision earlier this year.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The decision rocked families and medical providers across the country.\n\n\"We want families to grow\" Britt said of herself and her Republican colleagues. \"It's why we strongly support continued, nationwide access to invitro fertilization. We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt zeroes in on Joe Biden's border policy\n\nKatie Britt on Thursday said the American dream \"has turned into a nightmare for so many families.\"\n\n\"President Biden's border policies are a disgrace. This crisis is despicable. And the truth is, it is almost entirely preventable,\" she said.\n\nBritt told the story of a Texas woman who was trafficked by drug cartels. She also referenced Laken Riley, a Georgia woman who was killed. An undocumented immigrant has been charged following her death.\n\n\"Mr. President, enough is enough. Innocent Americans are dying, and you only have yourself to blame.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt hits Joe Biden in Republican SOTU response\n\nKatie Britt kicked off her response to Joe Biden's State of the Union address by calling the president a \"permanent politician,\" referring to him as \"out of touch.\"\n\n\"Under his administration, families are worse off,\" Britt said.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden addresses concerns about his age\n\nJoe Biden ended his speech by addressing Americans' well-documented concerns about his age, cracking a joke.\n\n“I know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” he quipped.\n\nThe president said he is still up to the task, citing his experience and wisdom. He seemed to draw a direct comparison to his predecessor and opponent, alluding to his belief that he and Donald Trump think different core values define America.\n\n“My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy... Honesty. Decency. Dignity. Equality,” he said. “Now some other people my age see a different story. An American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.”\n\nBiden also highlighted his decades of experience in politics, reminding viewers that there was a time in his career when people told him he was “too young.”\n\n“Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures,” he said. “The very idea of America, that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nStanding up to China\n\nRelations with China have stabilized – for now. But competition with the rival nation remains a top priority for the Biden administration.\n\n“America is rising,” Joe Biden said Thursday. “We’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan straits.”\n\nBiden said Thursday that he had revitalized U.S. alliances in the region and taken steps to protect American investments in advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\n“Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,” Biden said.\n\nMoments later, as Biden said that issues such as the reduction of fentanyl production and trafficking should be bipartisan, he chafed at Republicans seated in the chamber.\n\n“You don’t want to do that huh,” he said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho yelled 'Liar!' at Joe Biden?\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., was the first Republican to accuse Joe Biden of being a 'liar' during the state of the union, according to reports.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Van Orden told USA TODAY in a text message: \"Who?\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nContaining the “threat posed by Iran”\n\nJoe Biden warned Houthi rebels in Yemen that the U.S. will take any means necessary to protect commercial vessels in the Red Sea and minimize disruptions to global trade.\n\nAn attack by the Iranian-backed group on a shipping vessel killed three crew members on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its coalition partners are wary of escalating the conflict. They have responded to previous episodes of violence with limited airstrikes.\n\nBut the president said Thursday, that “containing the threat posed by Iran” is key to achieving stability in the region.\n\n“As commander-in-chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel,” Biden said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden calls for temporary cease-fire in the Middle East\n\nBiden rebuked Israel for the high death toll in Gaza and called for a temporary cease-fire in its war with Hamas.\n\n“Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip,” Biden said. “Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.”\n\nHe added: “As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.”\n\nThe bloody conflict began five months ago, to the day, when Hamas fighters kidnapped, killed and most likely engaged in “sexualized torture” of Israeli civilians, according to a U.N. report, during the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBiden pledged to the families of hostages that he would not rest until their loved ones return home. The commitment drew a standing ovation from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd while the U.S. firmly supports Israel’s right to defend itself, Biden said, the price that innocent Palestinian women and children are paying is too high.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Biden said.\n\nBiden pressed both sides to accept the terms of a six-week ceasefire that would bring about the release of hostages, including an unknown number of Americans, and help get higher amounts of aid into the Gaza strip.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden demands assault weapon ban, touts lower crime rates.\n\nJoe Biden told the joint session that he is demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks.\n\n“None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged Jasmine, whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers at a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Biden said families who lost their children urged him to “do something” to address gun violence.\n\n“Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was president,” he said.\n\nBiden claimed America is safer today than when he took office and touted his American Rescue Plan's investment in public safety.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nProtestor who interrupted Joe Biden handcuffed and arrested\n\nThe protestor who interrupted Joe Biden, yelling about Abbey, Gate was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden interrupted by a protestor\n\nA protestor loudly interrupted Biden's speech from the House gallery overlooking the House floor, yelling about Abbey Gate. It's a reference to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which saw 13 military members killed.\n\nThe protestor was escorted out by security.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says his \"predecessor\" is playing politics with border\n\nJoe Biden talked about introducing a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system, secure the border, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, he said, would be the toughest set of border security reforms and would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers. But Republicans killed the legislation earlier this month, even after GOP lawmakers participated in negotiations.\n\n“But unfortunately, politics have derailed it so far,” he said. “I’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him.\"\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nRepublicans are leaving Biden's State of the Union early\n\nIn a sign of disinterest and disdain at the president's address, a handful of Republicans have slowly been trickling out of the House chamber as Joe Biden has been speaking.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden calls for expanded voting rights\n\nIn recognition of a dark moment in U.S. history, Biden pressed Congress to strengthen voter protections.\n\nHis speech fell on the 59th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when Alabama police clubbed and attacked civil rights advocates with tear gas during a peaceful demonstration.\n\nThe incident was a catalyst for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 several months later, which banned literacy tests and introduced other measures intended to help African Americans exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\nBiden held hands and marched with civil rights activists last year in Selma; Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at this year’s commemorative event.\n\n\"There are forces taking us back in time. Voter suppression. Election subversion. Unlimited dark money. Extreme gerrymandering,\" Biden said Thursday. \"It's time do to more than talk. Pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act!\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden pushes for a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nBiden said he would like to see a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit he approved during the pandemic. The credit enacted as part of his American Rescue Plan was only active in 2021.\n\nThat year, the Child Tax Credit increased from $2,000 to $3,000 per child over six and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under six. It also raised the age limit from 16 to 17. Working families received the full credit if they made less than $150,000 for a couple or $112,500 for families with a single parent.\n\n“Restore the Child Tax Credit because no child should go hungry in this country,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDemocrats to Marjorie Taylor Greene: 'Shut up!'\n\nAs Joe Biden railed against Republicans for killing a bipartisan border and migrant deal earlier this year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene got into a testy back and forth with the president and yelled \"It's about Laken Riley!\"\n\nRiley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nDemocrats immediately stood up to boo at Greene, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was seen yelling at her to \"Shut up!\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n“Strong and getting stronger”\n\nBiden sought to boost confidence in America’s future, saying on Thursday that when the country gets knocked down, it gets back up.\n\n“We keep going. That’s America,” Biden said.\n\nIt’s because of the tenacity of the American people that Biden said he could say in his address, “The state of our union is strong and getting stronger.”\n\nThe line drew loud cheers and applause from Democrats in the chamber, who erupted in chants of “Four more years!” Republicans stayed seated.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublicans jeer as Biden accuses them of cutting Social Security\n\nBiden accused Republicans of supporting cuts to Social Security and vowed to protect the social safety net, provoking jeers and a handful of GOP members yelling \"Liar!\" back at the president.\n\n\"If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them,\" Biden said.\n\nIf the dynamic sounds familiar, that's because it is. Biden made the same point at last year's State of the Union address, and Republicans responded the same way.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vows to lower housing costs\n\nTo address the increasing cost of housing, Joe Biden said he wants to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down.\n\n“I know the cost of housing is so important to you,” he said.\n\nHe said the administration is also eliminating title insurance fees for federally backed mortgages so that when a homeowner refinance their home, they can save you $1,000 or more.\n\nHe also urged Congress to pass his housing plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring rents down.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden: ‘I want to make college more affordable’\n\nBiden pushed for making college more affordable and urged lawmakers to continue increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families.\n\nHe acknowledged Keenan Jones, a public school educator from Minnesota, who was a guest sitting near the first lady Thursday evening.\n\n“While we’re at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise,” he said.\n\nBiden told the joint session that he wants to give every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three and four year olds as well as expand high quality tutoring and summer learning to increase reading levels.\n\n“To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene: 'Tell Hunter to pay his taxes!'\n\nWhen Biden spoke about raising the corporate tax rate, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., interrupted and yelled, \"tell Hunter to pay his taxes!\" referring to the president's son, Hunter Biden and his federal tax evasion charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden calls for Medicare to negotiate lower prices on 500 prescription drugs\n\nJoe Biden touted his administration’s steps to lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs, noting that “for years, people have talked about it, but finally we got it done.”\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022, gave Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices directly with drug companies. As a result, Biden said, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market.\n\nNow it’s time to go further, he said, and give Medicare the authority to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorge Santos, during the State of the Union, announces he's running for reelection\n\nDuring Biden's speech, embattled former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House for his extravagant lies and slate of criminal charges, announced he was running for reelection, challenging his fellow New Yorker, Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.\n\n\"Tonight, I want to announce that I will be returning to the arena of politics and challenging Nick,\" Santos said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIVF and Roe v. Wade take center stage\n\nJoe Biden during his speech highlighted Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision treating embryos as children.\n\n“She was told her dream would have to wait,” Biden said. “Let’s stand up for families like hers,\" said Biden.\n\nHe also pointed to Kate Cox, who was denied an abortion in Texas.\n\n“Here are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need,” said Biden. “Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v.

But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain warms up to Joe Biden\n\nUnited Auto Worker President Shawn Fain mouths \"it's you,\" in response to accolades from Joe Biden.\n\nIt's a big turnaround: Fain and the UAW withheld an endorsement for Biden for months as the United Auto Workers pressured the administration to strengthen union rules. The union openly criticized the administration for failing to tie generous federal funding to strong labor requirements.\n\nThey finally endorsed Biden earlier this year after big contract wins in the fall.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDonald Trump's Truth Social website is down\n\nWhile Joe Biden has attacked Donald Trump at length, the former president has not responded as often as expected.\n\nHis Truth Social website went down shortly after Biden began his speech.\n\nTrump aides are weighing in often on Biden on other social media, but the candidate himself is silenced …. for now.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: ‘My predecessor failed’ handling COVID-19 pandemic\n\nBiden said America is on the comeback from the worst pandemic and economic crisis in the century.\n\n“My predecessor failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people—the duty to care,” Biden said. “I think that’s unforgivable.”\n\nBiden said the COVID-19 pandemic no longer controls our lives. And while the U.S. economy was on the brink, it’s now the “envy of the world.” He cited unemployment at record lows, an increase in small business owners, new manufacturing jobs, a decrease in inflation and increase in exporting American products.\n\n“It doesn’t make news, but in 1,000 cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told,\" he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nJoe Biden condemns Jan. 6 mob attack in SOTU address\n\nWarning that democracy is under assault, Joe Biden cited the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election.\n\n“The insurrectionists were not patriots,” Biden said. “They came to stop the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nLies about the 2020 election and the plot to steal the election posed the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War, Biden said, “but they failed.”\n\nTrump and some Republicans in Congress “seek to bury the truth about Jan. 6,” Biden alleged. “I will not do that.”\n\n“Here’s the truth,” he said. “You can’t love your country only when you win.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Lies!' one House GOP lawmaker yells\n\nAs Joe Biden was speaking, one House Republican interjected and yelled \"Lies!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., instructed GOP members to remain cordial throughout the address, but that message evidently didn't get through to some lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is sitting behind Joe Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., are sitting behind the president on Thursday. It's traditional for the vice president and speaker of the House to sit behind the president during the State of the Union.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden criticizes Donald Trump's attacks on NATO\n\nOne of Biden’s few foreign policy successes since last year: the addition of Sweden to the NATO alliance.\n\nSweden cleared the final obstacle on Tuesday when, after more than a year of delays, the Hungarian government finally approved the nation’s membership. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson submitted the accession paperwork in Washington, D.C. hours before Biden’s evening address.\n\nThe ceremony made it convenient for Kristersson to attend the State of the Union as a guest of the White House. And it gave Biden a ready-made opportunity to juxtapose his support for the alliance that is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary with the position of likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nTrump last month claimed he once told the leader of a NATO nation that Russia can do “whatever the hell” it wants countries to countries that spend less than they should on their national defense.\n\n“We will not walk away. We will not bow down,” Biden said Thursday. “I will not bow down!”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden opens remarks with call to support Ukraine aid\n\nPresident Joe Biden opened his speech by declaring loudly that America stands with Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin continuing to wage war on the sovereign nation.\n\nBiden said he hoped to \"wake up the Congress\" and alert the American people \"this is no ordinary moment\" with democracy under threat in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\"If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not,\" Biden said from the House chamber. “But Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is asking.\"\n\n\"They are not asking for American soldiers,\" Biden said. \"And I'm determined to keep it that way.\"\n\nA national security bill that included assistance for Ukraine cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. Facing potential blowback from conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not brought the bill for a vote.\n\nKyiv’s ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, and a Ukrainian soldier, Andrii Chevozorov, were present for the remarks.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden kicks off speech with a joke\n\nAs Biden reaches the podium, he quips: \"If I were smart I'd go home now.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, standing over Biden's left shoulder, cracks a smile.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDemocrats chant 'four more years'\n\nAs President Joe Biden made his way down the aisle in the House chamber, Democrats erupted in chants of \"four more years!\" dispelling at least any public perception of Democratic concerns about the president's reelection prospects.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, looked on silently.\n\n– Riley Beggin and Ken Tran\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona is SOTU designated survivor\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona is the designated survivor for this year’s State of the Union.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members.

Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden's cabinet has arrived\n\nPresident Joe Biden's cabinet has entered the House floor, to a lot of cheering from Democrats.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the reception wasn't as warm from Republicans, who stood in silence besides the few who did applaud.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden bypasses protesters en route to Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:59 p.m., just 10 minutes after departing the White House.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters blocked parts of Pennsylvania Avenue, a major street that connects the White House to the Capitol and is the route usually taken by the presidential motorcade when heading to the Capitol.\n\nReporters traveling with Biden said the motorcade took a different route that bypassed the protests.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nSCOTUS arrives at State of the Union\n\nThe Supreme Court justices have arrived on the House floor ahead of Joe Biden's speech, to bipartisan applause.\n\nSort of.\n\nNoticeably not as many Democrats opted to cheer compared to Republicans as the justices walked down the aisle. The court's 6-3 conservative majority has been a frequent point of criticism from Democratic lawmakers, especially after the court overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion, in 2022.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden en route to Capitol\n\nJoe Biden’s motorcade departed the White House at 8:49 p.m. for the short ride to the Capitol, where he will deliver his State of the Union address.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGOP lawmaker wears Donald Trump T-shirt\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, one of former President Donald Trump's most outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill, is wearing a T-shirt sporting Trump's booking photo with the caption \"NEVER SURRENDER\" along with a bowtie with an American flag pattern.\n\nTrump took the photo in association with the criminal charges he faces in Georgia. The former president is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from Joe Biden in the Peach State.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nProtestors host “People’s State of the Union”\n\nA group of protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Middle East gathered outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of Biden’s speech for an event dubbed the “People’s State of the Union.”\n\nProtestors attempting to block Biden’s motorcade in Washington chanted “free, free Palestine,” some wearing t-shirts that read “Biden’s legacy = genocide.”\n\nIfNotNow, an organization made up of Jewish American activists, took credit for displaying banners calling for a cease-fire on nearby freeways earlier in the day on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nKamala Harris, senators arrive ahead of Joe Biden's State of the Union\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, joined by senators, have arrived to the House floor after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the lower chamber into order to introduce them.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vs. Donald Trump polls\n\nNow that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are expected to face off in November, where do the rivals stand in the polls?\n\nIn a hypothetical general election match-up, Trump leads Biden by 1.8 percentage points, according to a Real Clear Politics average of nationwide polls. But keep in mind that's within the margin of error of many surveys.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat does SOTU mean?\n\nIf you're keeping up with Joe Biden's State of the Union address tonight, you're probably going to see four letter a lot: SOTU. If you need a primer, SOTU stands for State of the Union.\n\nAnother acronym you might see tonight: POTUS. That stands for president of the United States.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhy are women wearing white at the State of the Union?\n\nIn the House chamber, where Biden is expected to speak in less than an hour, several female House Democratic lawmakers are dressed in all-white to commemorate the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden expected to slam Republicans for rejecting bipartisan border deal\n\nJoe Biden is likely to criticize Republican lawmakers on Thursday for rejecting a bipartisan border security deal that Senate conservatives killed earlier this month.\n\nRepublicans initially demanded that border security policies be attached to additional foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that Biden requested last year. After months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of senators released an agreement that would have significantly restricted asylum and created a new emergency mechanism to stop migrants from illegally entering the country.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump came out against the provisions, and many Republicans followed suit. House leaders declared it “dead on arrival” in their chamber, and Senate Republicans abandoned it when it became clear it wouldn’t get the support of a majority of their conference.\n\nDemocrats have since seized on the turnaround, arguing Republicans aren’t serious about their claims of urgency at the border. Republicans, however, are also expected to bite back: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., is expected to say Biden “invited” the border crisis and describe it as “despicable” and “a disgrace” in prepared remarks of the formal GOP response.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat time does the State of the Union address start?\n\nThe State of the Union address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nJoe Biden will begin addressing lawmakers and Americans across the country after he enters the halls of Congress alongside officials from all three branches of America's government.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden set to address IVF after Alabama Supreme Court ruling\n\nAs Joe Biden addresses the nation Thursday in his State of the Union speech, hopeful parents and medical experts will be looking for signs that access to IVF, or in vitro fertilization is not in jeopardy.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The court’s ruling alarmed prospective parents and IVF clinics, and the real-world consequences were immediate. At least three Alabama medical facilities halted in vitro fertilization treatments.\n\nThe issue is sure to take center stage during Biden's speech. Among the guests joining first lady Jill Biden is Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the court's decision.\n\nThere is a good chance that Biden will emphasis her experience as yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nGeorge Santos is back on Capitol Hill for State of the Union\n\nFormer Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House last year for fabricating his background and his sweeping criminal charges, is back on Capitol Hill today for the State of the Union address.\n\nOne House Republican told USA TODAY that Santos “should stay away.”\n\nBut, the Republican joked, his return is fitting since “he’s already delivered a State of the Union address,” referencing the embattled for lawmaker's lies.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat notable guests are attending the State of the Union?\n\nEvery year, invited guests are an important part of the messaging strategy for the president’s State of the Union speech.

Despite a booming stock market and historically low unemployment, Biden isn't getting credit for an economic rebound. His approval rating, already hovering in the low 40s for two years, dipped even lower in recent weeks.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden housing plan set for State of the Union\n\nTimes are tough for homebuyers and renters. Between high mortgage rates, lack of availability, skyrocketing home prices and dire rental prices, housing costs are devouring the American pocketbook.\n\nWith the dismal housing outlook weighing on family budgets, President Joe Biden will use his State of the Union speech Thursday to showcase plans to help Americans obtain mortgages and to push down monthly rents, according to the White House.\n\nBiden will call on Congress to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide first-time middle-class homebuyers an annual tax credit of $5,000 for two years.\n\nThis would effectively reduce the mortgage rate by more than 1.5 percentage points, the White House said, and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first home over the next two years.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden will address abortion rights, economy in SOTU\n\nAccording to excerpts released ahead of his speech, Biden will highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights against Trump.\n\nAccording to excerpts, Biden will also highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights, vowing to codify abortion rights if given a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\n“Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,” Biden will say. “But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\nBiden will also tout the “greatest story never told” as he talks about the nation’s economic rebound following the pandemic.\n\n“Let’s tell that story here and now,” Biden will say. “America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down, investing in all of America – in all Americans – to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden to reject ‘an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution’ in State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden will say he rejects “an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution” during Thursday’s State of the Union address as he frames a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, according to excerpts released by the White House, will say his life has taught him to “embrace freedom and democracy” and values such as honesty, equality and giving everyone a fair shot.\n\n“Now some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s not me,” Biden is expected to say.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is a designated survivor?\n\nMembers of Joe Biden’s Cabinet are expected to attend tonight’s speech at the U.S. Capitol, but one of them – a “designated survivor” – will be watching from a secret location.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members. The practice ensures that someone in the line of presidential succession is always available to assume the presidency if the worst-case scenario happens.\n\nThe White House hasn’t said who this year’s designated survivor will be. During last year’s address, the designee was Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. In 2022, it was Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTonight's State of the Union is happening later in the year than usual\n\nTonight’s State of the Union address is only the second to take place during March since 1964. The first was Biden’s speech in 2022. Last year, Biden delivered his address on Feb. 7.\n\nPresidents have mostly delivered their State of the Union speeches in January, but some have taken place in February in recent years, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nThis year’s scheduling allows Biden to address the American public two days after winning several state primary elections on Super Tuesday. In contrast, Trump delivered his State of the Union speech a month before Super Tuesday took place in 2020.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHouse Republicans donning badges with Laken Riley's name\n\nAhead of Biden's State of the Union address, House Republicans are wearing pins and badges bearing Laken Riley's name. Riley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are handing out pins and badges to their fellow Republican colleagues as the GOP continues to focus on the crisis on the southern border as a messaging point against Biden.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow long have previous State of the Unions lasted?\n\nState of the Union speeches typically range from about 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes. Biden’s previous addresses each lasted more than an hour. In 2022, he spoke for just over an hour and in 2023 he spoke for an hour and 13 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nFormer President Richard Nixon delivered the shortest State of the Union address in 1972, speaking for under 29 minutes. Former President Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech. During his 1995 and 2000 addresses, he spoke for close to an hour and a half.\n\nBiden is the most talkative president in recent memory in terms of the actual number of words spoken in his speeches.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow can I stream the State of the Union?\n\nThe State of the Union address will be streamed on the USA TODAY YouTube channel and through the USA TODAY channel on your smart television.\n\n– James Powel\n\nState of the Union bingo: Everything you need to play during Joe Biden's speech\n\nIt's time to play State of the Union bingo!

Katie Britt, R-Ala., will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Thursday evening.\n\nBut who is the first-term lawmaker? Britt, 42, is the youngest Republican woman to ever be elected to the upper chamber and is considered a rising star among a party dominated by older men. On Thursday night, she'll also offer a contrast to President Joe Biden, the oldest sitting president in American history.\n\nShe has two children still in middle and high school and said in a statement ahead of the speech that the Republican Party is the party of \"hard-working parents and families.\"\n\nBritt's speech will come just over two weeks after the Supreme Court in her home state issued a decision that rocked families across the country: The Alabama high court determined that frozen embryos used in IVF are children and have legal protections under state law.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden’s State of the Union address to focus on four themes\n\nThe White House briefed Democratic congressional aides on Thursday morning about Joe Biden’s address and outlined key themes of his speech, according to a person in the briefing. A slideshow, shared with USA TODAY, was presented to staffers read out four themes:\n\nProgress and possibility\n\nDefend democracy and freedom\n\nEconomy from middle out, bottom up\n\nMove the country forwards, not backwards\n\nThe presentation also alluded to the presidential election and former President Donald Trump. Another slide in the presentation read that the “key message” after Biden’s address will be that “there’s a clear contrast” and “competing visions for the country.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDonald Trump to prod Joe Biden during State of the Union\n\nRest assured: The 2024 Republican frontrunner will not stay silent during Biden's speech tonight.\n\nDonald Trump says he and his staff will provide running (critical) commentary on social media as Biden delivers the State of the Union.\n\n\"We did this once before to tremendous success,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. The former president on Thursday also put out a \"prebuttal\" video statement, mostly hitting Biden over immigration and border security.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHow long is SOTU?\n\nLast year, President Biden spoke for one hour and 13 minutes according to UC Santa Barbara's \"American Presidency Project.\" The shortest State of the Union address (00:28:55) was given by President Richard Nixon in 1972.

It's also how he looks and sounds to perhaps his biggest TV audience of the year.\n\n− Carli Pierson\n\nWhat is the State of the Union? Why is it important?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nJerry said the State of the Union often provides a spotlight for the president to reference values such as unity or American innovation. She said it also provides a \"unique opportunity for Americans and people around the world to see how this checks and balances system of our government works.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/02/28/alabama-ivf-republicans-gop-abortion-2024/72752600007/", "title": "IVF: Alabama ruling reminds Republicans abortion is the 2024 issue", "text": "Republicans up and down November’s ballot were always going to be on the back foot when it comes to access to abortion and other reproductive health issues.\n\nNow they have to answer questions about in vitro fertilization and access to contraception as well.\n\nA ruling this month by Alabama’s Supreme Court made clear just how treacherous those topics will be for Republicans.\n\nChief Justice Tom Parker declared that embryos frozen during the IVF process have the same legal protections as living children. A cluster of frozen cells accidentally destroyed in a lab, by Parker's reasoning, equals the wrongful death of a person out here in the world.\n\nHis ruling sounded more like a brimstone sermon than clear-eyed jurisprudence, with 40 mentions of God and eight references to the Bible's Book of Genesis.\n\nIt sparked outrage across the country.\n\nAnd many Republicans scrambled to make public displays of support for IVF and the would-be parents who use it and maybe now will think about it as they cast their ballots in November.\n\nWill Republicans seek a national ban next?\n\nBut some conservatives, including some Republicans seeking or holding office or federal judicial posts, have been emboldened by their June 2022 victory, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned constitutional protections for abortion. That decision returned the question of whether to allow or restrict abortion to the states.\n\nThese conservatives want more. Now they want a federal ban on abortion and regulations making it more difficult to obtain contraception.\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. House in 2022 passed the Right To Contraception Act only to see Republicans in the Senate stall that effort.\n\nThat bill was introduced in the House a month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing in that decision that the court should review other precedents, including a 1965 ruling that gave married people the right to use contraception.\n\nBiden and Trump on abortion:Biden refocuses his campaign on abortion rights, reminding voters Trump took Roe away\n\nAdd to that the Alabama ruling, which echoes efforts in Congress for decades that would complicate the already arduous process of IVF by making health care providers treat every embryo as a child.\n\nThat's tactical. Parker's ruling didn't ban IVF, but plenty of doctors in Alabama suspended the practice out of fear of being held responsible for its repercussions.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nBefore Roe was overturned, Republicans in state legislatures heaped regulation upon regulation on abortion providers, sometimes governing them right out of the medical practice.\n\nVoters have been clear on abortion rights. Will IVF make things harder for Republicans?\n\nAbortion has been a losing issue for Republicans since Roe fell. Infringing on IVF and contraception will be more of the same.\n\nA Gallup poll last year found that 66% of Republicans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances. Another Gallup survey last year found that 88% of Americans say birth control is morally acceptable.\n\nOpposing abortion is one thing. But tripping up people when they seek contraception, which can help reduce abortion? Or hindering people who are trying to have children with IVF?\n\nJenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, told me that has been the conservative \"playbook\" for decades.\n\nLawson said creating \"chaos\" in the use of IVF was the point in Alabama. And overturning Roe was just the opening gambit in conservative plans to interfere in how family decisions are made. Her organization is tracking 38 pieces of \"personhood\" legislation in 13 states this year that grant legal rights to fetuses. And now embryos are in the mix.\n\n\"They are using every tool at their disposal,\" Lawson said \"And the Alabama Supreme Court decision is just the latest example of how they are continuing to attack reproductive freedom and restrict access to health care. And it's not going to stop at abortion. It’s going to include IVF. It’s going to include contraception.\"\n\nWhat about my embryo?An embryo that could be my second child is in Alabama. A court just put that in jeopardy.\n\nLawson cited Nikki Haley's stumble on the question of IVF. The long-shot Republican primary contender at first applauded the Alabama ruling but then quickly walked that back.\n\n\"They're coming after everything,\" Lawson said. \"And they know it is unpopular.\"\n\nThen there is the 'Life At Conception Act'\n\nRepublicans in the U.S. House and Senate have introduced every two years for decades two versions of the Life At Conception Act, which says an embryo becomes \"a human person\" at the \"moment of fertilization.\"\n\nIn other words, what Parker just did in Alabama, but for every state.\n\nNineteen Republicans in the U.S. Senate in 2021 sponsored that chamber's last effort, which included a standard carve-out that said it did not apply as a \"prohibition\" on IVF treatments or birth control.\n\nIn the House that same year, 167 Republicans sponsored a nearly identical bill with the same title and language. But each year the House Republicans do not include the carve-outs for IVF and birth control.\n\nTrump and religion:Trump's questionable morality gets a pass from evangelical voters. I decided to ask why.\n\nThese bills go nowhere. Nobody expects them to become law with a Democrat like Joe Biden holding the White House. Creating laws is not the point. Those bills were all about courting the furthest right reaches of the Republican base.\n\nBut now, with elections looming and the Alabama ruling sparking national outrage, Republicans have some explaining to do about why they agree with Parker.\n\nRepublicans rush to support IVF\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has been a consistent sponsor of the House version of the Life At Conception Act. And he previously supported efforts to restrict the use of IVF and birth control.\n\nBut Republicans have to hold the House for Johnson to remain speaker. Guess who declared his support for IVF this week. Well hello Mr. Johnson of Louisiana. That's some political pliability right there.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to elect members of the party to the House, didn't have anything to say when I asked if it takes a position on issues like IVF.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee was quick to point to its chamber's carve-out for IVF and birth control while Congress keeps trying to declare embryos to be actual people. NRSC spokesperson Mike Berg told me that \"every Republican Senate candidate in the country\" strongly supports IVF.\n\nConservative groups agree with Alabama ruling\n\nEmma Waters, who focuses on reproductive technology and its bioethics for the Heritage Foundation, a politically influential conservative think tank, supported Parker's ruling in Alabama and disputed my take that he leaned way too hard on the Bible in his decision.\n\nShe insisted the chief justice was just following that state's law when he extended it from \"unborn children in the womb\" to \"embryonic children\" in the lab.\n\nWaters wrote a column last year headlined \"Babies Aren’t Disposable, at Any Stage\" while advocating against the destruction of any embryo. IVF can produce more embryos than are implanted in the patient. She didn't have a great answer on what to do with those embryos but noted that some other countries place limits on how many can be created.\n\nConservatives usually decry federal regulation. But on occasion they embrace it, if regulation can hinder a practice they oppose.\n\nHeritage has also advocated against hormonal forms of contraception, because that could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine wall, preventing pregnancy.\n\nAnd Heritage compiled the latest 920-page edition of its \"Mandate for Leadership,\" a playbook it hopes former President Donald Trump will use if he wins back the White House. It calls for reinstituting \"religious and moral exemptions\" for some providers to refuse to supply contraception.\n\nNovember is coming, and voters will decide\n\nRepublicans now find themselves caught between public sentiment about reproductive rights and conservative institutions like the Heritage Foundation as they try to hold onto control of the House and take power in the Senate.\n\nPresident Biden's reelection campaign is having a blast, using the attention to remind voters that Trump appointed the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe. The Democratic National Committee is putting up billboards in eight swing states, linking Trump to the IVF controversy.\n\nTrump last week had to say he supports IVF and suggested that Alabama lawmakers fix the problem. But just like he won't get nailed down on whether he'd support a federal ban for abortion, his campaign is avoiding taking any national stance on IVF.\n\nThis was always going to be a challenge for Republicans this year. The Alabama ruling and efforts in Congress to call embryos people mean Republicans are now playing defense on multiple fronts in reproductive rights.\n\nIt's bad policy. And it's bad politics. And they will own it from now till November.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/28"}]}

However, it returned without its two crewmembers who will spend another five months at the station.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft undocked from the space station at about 6:04 p.m. EDT Friday. The Starliner flew up and over the space station before performing its deorbit burn. The thrusters, which had caused concerns about the spacecraft, performed without issue.\n\nJust after midnight Saturday Eastern time, Starliner landed under parachute and airbag at NASA's White Sands Space Harbor facility in New Mexico. Boeing teams began recovering the spacecraft, which will be shipped back to Kennedy Space Center for evaluation.\n\nBoth Boeing and NASA were confident that the Starliner wouldn't encounter any issues – if not quite confident enough for its astronauts to be aboard for its return. Instead, NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain at the orbital outpost until February, when they will return on a SpaceX craft.\n\n“We have confidence in the vehicle,” Steve Stich, the manager of the commercial crew program at NASA, said during a Wednesday news conference. “It’s been a journey to get here, and we’re excited to have Starliner undock and return.\"\n\nDespite the show of confidence, NASA officials determined that the troubled Starliner wasn't quite dependable enough for Williams and Wilmore to ride back to the ground. The safer option, NASA decided, was for the astronauts to remain at the space station and have Starliner undock without them.\n\nWhat was the Boeing Starliner return plan?\n\nNASA's plan, which was successful, was for Starliner to undock at 6:04 p.m. Friday from the space station before landing early Saturday at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.\n\nThruster burns would allow Boeing's spacecraft to autonomously steer itself away from the space laboratory and toward Earth before it would begin its descent into the atmosphere. The uncrewed capsule was expected to land about 12:03 a.m. EDT Saturday, using parachutes to slow its fall.\n\nHad poor weather conditions or technical issues arose and caused a delay, Starliner could instead attempt to return Sept. 10, Sept. 14 or Sept. 18, according to NASA.\n\nStarliner, explained:Starliner astronauts won’t return until 2025\n\nYou can still watch Starliner's return to Earth\n\nThose interested in watching Starliner's undocking and landing can watch archived video on NASA's YouTube channel and get more information on the NASA app and the agency’s website.\n\nA postlanding news conference, streamed at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday, is also available on YouTube.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network, provided live coverage at floridatoday.com/space.\n\nWhat's next for the Starliner crew?\n\nAfter arriving June 6 at the space station for what was to be a 10-day stay, Williams and Wilmore are now looking at eight total months spent in orbit.\n\nThe beleaguered Starliner was besieged with troubles even before it finally managed to launch June 5 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on its inaugural crewed test flight. When the capsule made it to the orbital outpost a day after the launch, engineers discovered a slew of helium leaks and problems with the craft's propulsion system that hampered Starliner's return.\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon craft that is now slated to bring Wilmore and Williams home in February is scheduled to launch Sept. 24 with the Crew-9 mission. But because the Dragon now needs to make room for the pair of Starliner astronauts, Crew-9 will include just two members instead of four, NASA has said.\n\nThe Boeing spacesuits that Wilmore and Williams wore on their way to orbit will return with Starliner. A SpaceX suit is already available for Williams to wear on the return journey, while Crew-9 will launch with an extra suit for Wilmore, Stich said Wednesday.\n\nThe veteran astronauts, who have each been to space twice before, were trained and prepared for the possibility of an extended mission, said Dana Weigel, the program manager for the space station at NASA\n\nDuring their stay, Williams and Wilmore have joined Expedition 71 in conducting more than 40 scientific experiments aboard the station already, Weigel said. Until they return next year, the astronauts will continue to help with scientific research and routine maintenance.\n\n“We had them well prepared to move into this role,” Weigel said. “They’re ready to execute whatever mission we put in front of them.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe mission marked the first crewed demonstration of the spacecraft, which was intended to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX to make routine trips to space on behalf of NASA.\n\nBut the test flight appeared to cause tension between Boeing and NASA officials, who were split on whether Starliner was up to the task of bringing its crew home. When it returns to Earth, it will remain to be seen whether the Starliner could still become certified for crewed NASA operations to the space station.\n\nBoeing will have to run more ground tests on Starliner to prevent future propulsion system problems and prepare it for regular trips to orbit.\n\n\"Their team is going to start looking at what we need to do to get the vehicle fully certified in the future,\" Stich said Wednesday.\n\nWhile Boeing has not put out any recent updates of its own on its website, the company did say in an Aug. 24 post on social media site X that it will execute the mission \"as determined by NASA.\"\n\n\"We continue to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft,\" the company said.\n\nContributing: Brooke Edwards, Mike Snider, USA TODAY Network.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Read the latest here.\n\nBoeing's Starliner has left the International Space Station and is making its way back to Earth for a landing in the New Mexico desert.\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore could do little more than watch from the orbital outpost as the spacecraft that brought them there in June undocked autonomously and departed without them. About two weeks ago, NASA made the call to scuttle the pair of astronauts' return to Earth on Starliner, determining that Boeing's troubled capsule was not reliable enough to bring them home.\n\nInstead, Starliner is now making a journey back to the ground without its crew, who are scheduled to remain at the space station for another five months and return in February aboard a SpaceX vehicle.\n\n\"OK, she's on her way home,\" Williams said on the livestream of the undocking. \"Congratulations to the undock team.\"\n\nDespite NASA's hesitancy to send Williams and Wilmore home on Starliner, agency officials expressed confidence that the spacecraft's landing should go off without a hitch. Ahead of the Starliner is a venture that should last a few hours before an anticipated landing early Saturday using parachutes to slow its fall.\n\n“We have confidence in the vehicle,” Steve Stich, the manager of the commercial crew program at NASA, said during a Wednesday news conference. “It’s been a journey to get here, and we’re excited to have Starliner undock and return.\"\n\nStarliner undocks from space station, heads for Earth\n\nThe uncrewed spacecraft departed from the station at 6:04 p.m. ET in a process that took five minutes to complete. NASA streamed the successful undocking, capturing the light show that appeared as 27 jets fired.\n\nAt 6:11 p.m. ET, all 12 breakout burn firings completed successfully crossing the ISS's Keep Out Sphere as planned.\n\nThe spacecraft is set for perfect trajectory where it drop out of orbit and pass the Pacific Ocean across Baja California before landing at the New Mexico space harbor.\n\nUsing thruster burns, the Boeing capsule autonomously steered itself away from the space laboratory and toward Earth to begin its descent into the atmosphere. The entire trip is expected to take a few hours before the uncrewed vehicle lands around 12:03 a.m. Saturday at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico.\n\nBoeing has work ahead if Starliner is to be certified\n\nThe anticipated landing would bring to a conclusion the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner, which had encountered troubles even before liftoff.\n\nA series of mission scrubs delayed Starliner's launch for about a month until June 5, when it was finally able to take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop an Atlas V rocket. When the capsule made it to the orbital outpost a day after the launch, engineers discovered a slew of helium leaks and problems with the craft's propulsion system that hampered Starliner's return.\n\nBoeing officials had high hopes that a successful mission would be the demonstration needed to win approval from NASA for Starliner to join SpaceX in making routine trips to orbit on behalf of the U.S. space agency.\n\nBut now, Boeing has its work cut out for it to get Starliner up to the task of regularly transporting crews and cargo to the space station. Ahead of the aerospace company are more ground tests and potential modifications to the vehicle to remedy its propulsion system woes and prepare it for routine spaceflight, NASA officials said Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk's SpaceX has already begun reliably transporting astronauts and supplies since 2020 to the space station aboard its Dragon.\n\nNASA shelled out billions of dollars to both Boeing and SpaceX to develop the vehicles as part of its commercial crew program. In recent years, the agency has shifted to paying private companies for missions it once would carry out itself as a way to cut costs.\n\nWilmore, Williams to return with SpaceX in February\n\nAs for Wilmore and Williams, they'll have no choice but to remain at the space station for another five months, barring any changes to NASA's outlined plan.\n\nThat's of course much longer than the 10 days that the pair of astronauts were originally scheduled to be at the space station before they were slated to return aboard the Starliner. But NASA officials have insisted that the veteran astronauts, who have each been to space twice before, were trained and prepared for the possibility of an extended mission.\n\nAs it stands, the plan now is for Wilmore and Williams to return in February on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle that will launch to reach the station as early as Sept. 24. The Dragon, which was initially scheduled to bring a full contingent of four Crew-9 astronauts, will instead bring just two so that the Starliner crew have room to hitch a ride home, NASA has said.\n\nThe Boeing spacesuits that Wilmore and Williams wore on their way to orbit will return with Starliner. A SpaceX suit is already available for Williams to wear on the return journey, while Crew-9 will launch with an extra suit for Wilmore, Stich said Wednesday.\n\nThe Crew-9 astronauts are to relieve the Crew-8 mission to begin a six-month rotation at the space station, which is why Wilmore and Williams cannot return sooner.\n\nDuring their stay, Williams and Wilmore have joined Expedition 71 in conducting more than 40 scientific experiments aboard the station already, said Dana Weigel, the program manager for the space station at NASA.

Originally scheduled for an August launch, the mission had been delayed while NASA and Boeing officials worked to figure out what to do about the troubled Starliner spacecraft taking up the Dragon's docking port.\n\nNow that the Boeing Starliner capsule has returned to Earth intact – albeit, without its crew – the Dragon has been cleared for takeoff in the days ahead as mission operators wait out Hurricane Helene brewing on the state's panhandle.\n\nAnd when the Crew-9 astronauts return from their voyage on the Dragon in February, they won't be alone. Joining them will be Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, the NASA astronauts who in June flew to the station aboard the Starliner for what was supposed to be a 10-day stay.\n\nHere's everything to know about the Crew-9 mission, including the launch and the plans for a return to Earth:\n\nWhen does the SpaceX Crew-9 mission launch?\n\nIn August, NASA had delayed the Crew-9 launch to no earlier than Tuesday amid the scramble to figure out what to do about the Starliner, which encountered multiple problems during its trip to orbit.\n\nNow that the week of the scheduled launch has arrived, it still remains unclear just when the Dragon will be able to takeoff from Florida on top of a Falcon 9 rocket. NASA and SpaceX have postponed the launch three times so far in recent days as a storm with hurricane potential brews off the Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nAs of now, the earliest possible launch opportunity is 1:17 p.m. EDT Saturday, the U.S. space agency said in a Tuesday blog post. The rocket rolled out Tuesday to Space Launch Complex 40 the Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral after the crew arrived Saturday to quarantine.\n\nAfter integrating the rocket and capsule for a launch rehearsal Tuesday night, the vehicle was to move back to the hangar ahead of any potential storm activity, NASA said.\n\nWhat is Crew-9?\n\nThe SpaceX flight represents the ninth crew rotation mission to the station under NASA's commercial crew program as the agency shifts to paying private companies for missions it once would carry out itself.\n\nThe Crew-9 astronauts are to relieve Crew-8, whose team have been at the space station since March.\n\nWhile aboard the orbital laboratory, the Crew-9 astronauts will spend six months conducting experiments, research demonstrations and spacewalks to perform maintenance on the space station. Much of it will be to prepare for human exploration deep into the cosmos.\n\nWhy was the Crew-9 mission delayed?\n\nOriginally scheduled for an Aug. 18 launch, the Crew-9 mission was waylaid when NASA and Boeing encountered a slew of obstacles that delayed the return of the Starliner craft.\n\nBoeing had spent years developing and testing the vehicle ahead of the inaugural crewed test flight, which managed to launch June 5 after a few delays of its own. Hopes were high that the demonstration would pave the way for Starliner to compete with SpaceX carrying cargo and crews to the space station for NASA.\n\nBut when Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6 at the space station, engineers discovered that the Starliner craft had experienced multiple helium leaks and had issues with its propulsion system. The troubles were concerning enough for NASA to first delay Starliner's return flight, and then the SpaceX Crew-9 launch as officials figured out a plan for how the rest of the mission would unfold.\n\nThat decision was made official in late August when NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced that the agency had determined that the vehicle wasn't up to the task of reliably transporting Wilmore and Williams home. Instead, the Starliner capsule undocked Sept. 6 from the space station to make its journey back to the ground without its crew.\n\nNow, Wilmore and Williams are scheduled to remain at the space station for another five months and return in February, hitching a ride on the Dragon when the Crew-9 astronauts complete their six-month shift.\n\nMeet the astronauts of Crew-9\n\nBefore the Starliner woes, the Crew-9 mission was slated to include a full contingent of four astronauts.\n\nBut now that the Starliner astronauts are in need of a ride home, just two Crew-9 astronauts will head to the space station aboard the Dragon to leave room for Wilmore and Williams, NASA said.\n\nThe two astronauts of Crew-9 are:\n\n◾ NASA astronaut Nick Hague, of Belleville, Kansas, will serve as crew commander, making this his third launch and second mission to the space station. Selected as a NASA astronaut in 2013, Hague, also an active-duty colonel in the U.S. Space Force, has spent 203 days in space and conducted three spacewalks.\n\n◾ Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will embark on his first trip to the space station as a mission specialist. The Russian studied engineering at the Moscow Aviation Institute, graduating with a specialty in operating and repairing aircraft before his selection as a cosmonaut in 2018.\n\nNASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson, previously announced as crewmates for the mission, are eligible for reassignment on a future mission, NASA said.\n\nCrew-9, Starliner astronauts to be part of Expedition 72\n\nOnce aboard the space station, Hague and Gorbunov will become members of Expedition 72, as will the Starliner crew.\n\nNASA officials have insisted that Wilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts, who have each been to space twice, were trained and prepared for the possibility of an extended mission. Until they return next year with Crew-9, the astronauts will continue to help with scientific research and routine maintenance.\n\n\"We always miss our families. I miss my two dogs. I miss my friends,\" Williams said recently in a media briefing from the space station. \"There's so many people on Earth that are sending us messages, and it makes you feel just right at home ... everybody understands, and everybody's cheering for us to get back with Crew-9.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

While no decisions have yet been made, the agency indicated that multiple plans exist to get the veteran astronauts back to Earth, including having them even hitch a ride on a Russian Soyuz craft.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of another revelation surrounding the troubled Starliner venture: that SpaceX’s Crew-9 launch would also be delayed as Boeing and NASA figure out a plan for how the rest of the mission will unfold.\n\nStarliner timeline:2 months after Starliner launched, astronauts still haven’t returned\n\nStarliner crew could return on SpaceX Dragon\n\nWhile the primary goal has always been for Wilmore and Williams to return on the Starliner, NASA and Boeing have had contingency plans in place to ensure they get home one way or another.\n\nAmong those mission contingencies is a last-ditch plan involving a return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon. If that were to occur, it wouldn't be until February that Wilmore and Williams finally make it back to Earth along with the members of SpaceX Crew-9, who are slated to head for a six-month stay at the space station.\n\n\"I don't think we're too far away from making that call,\" Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said Wednesday. \"We know at some point we need to bring Butch and Suni home.\"\n\nWhile the return date remains uncertain, the astronauts were only scheduled to stay about a week in orbit when they launched June 5 aboard a Starliner craft perched atop an Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. But a slew of helium leaks and problems with its propulsion system hampered their return as engineers have been troubleshooting issues from the ground.\n\nThe mounting delays have prompted questions of whether Starliner is capable of safely returning the NASA astronauts at all, despite Boeing's insistence that it is.\n\n\"Boeing remains confident in the Starliner spacecraft and its ability to return safely with crew,\" the company said in its latest update on Friday, which outlined a series of tests that have been performed from the ground. \"We continue to support NASA’s requests for additional testing, data, analysis and reviews to affirm the spacecraft’s safe undocking and landing capabilities.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Wilmore and Williams have continued to assist with science experiments and daily maintenance aboard the station, including the unloading of the Cygnus spacecraft that arrived Tuesday.\n\nSpaceX Crew-9 mission delayed\n\nBut NASA officials aren't taking any chances.\n\nAs engineers evaluate testing data and conduct analyses, the U.S. space agency made the call to postpone the launch of SpaceX Crew-9, which had been slated to take off as soon as Aug. 18 for the space station. The routine flight meant to replace the Crew-8 mission that's been aboard the International Space Station since March now won't happen any sooner than Sept. 24, NASA said in a Tuesday news release.\n\nThe four Crew-9 members cannot arrive at the station until a free docking port opens up, meaning Starliner will have to undock by then with or without a crew, said Dana Weigel, manager of the International Space Station program. If the Starliner capsule cannot return home with its astronauts, then a diminished Crew-9 of two spacefarers will instead go to the station to leave room for Wilmore and Williams aboard the Dragon's return journey.\n\nNASA said delaying that launch provides mission managers with more time to finalize a return plan.\n\n\"No decisions have been made regarding Starliner’s return,\" according to a statement from NASA.\n\nWhat is the Boeing Starliner?\n\nBoeing had high hopes that a successful crewed Starliner mission would put it on track to make routine trips to orbit for NASA.\n\nCertifying Boeing for such ventures would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts to the space station as the U.S. space agency pivots to more partnerships with private industry. The agency has forked over billions of dollars to both Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft capable of making trips to the International Space Station on its behalf.\n\nBut while Boeing's project has lagged behind schedule for years, racking up $1.5 billion in unplanned development costs along the way – as reported by Reuters – SpaceX has already begun reliably transporting astronauts and supplies to the space station.\n\nIt was unclear Wednesday whether Starliner could still be certified for crewed rotation missions if the capsule returns without its crew.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Bring Calypso back'. And that's what they did tonight.\"\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who flew to the International Space Station onboard Starliner in June, had watched earlier as their ride, named \"Calypso,\" blazed through the atmosphere without them − live cameras from the International Space Station showing the spacecraft heading back to Earth during the final 10 minutes of its decent. Now, the two astronauts will remain onboard the space station until February, returning home with Crew-9 on a Dragon, the spacecraft built by Boeing's competitor, SpaceX.\n\nWhen is the next Florida launch?Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin rocket launch schedule from Florida\n\n\"All of us fell happy about the successful landing, but then there's a piece of us, all of us, that we wish it would have been the way we had planned it,\" said Stich.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nHe told journalists at the post-landing briefing early Saturday that NASA did not have a way to put the data available into a model that could prove the spacecraft would perform successfully on its return flight − and therefore could not take the risk. \"We planned to have the mission land with Butch and Suni onboard,\" he said.\n\nStarliner touched down at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time at the White Sands Space Harbor at the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\n\"It's important to remember, this was a test mission,\" said NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator Joel Montalbano, during the opening of the post-landing briefing. \"You know, we did learn a lot.\"\n\nStarliner's thrusters reman focus of study for Boeing\n\nWhile Starliner's thrusters did not fail off as feared during the reentry burn, two thrusters exceeded a higher than normal temperature range − which is believed to be the reason for the malfunctions seen during docking to the space station back in June. Teams will look at this data in detail and work towards a solution for Starliner-1.\n\nThere was an additional issue with propulsion observed during the landing.\n\n\"There's 12 thrusters, and one of the up-firing thrusters did not perform at all. We hot fired it twice, and we used two different methods to talk to it ... and we never saw any chamber pressure or any pulses there,\" Stich said.\n\nThese are different than the service module thrusters, which had been the cause of the investigation into Starliner's performance and the reason why it came home without its astronauts. Stich described these others as thrusters with a model propellant system. It consists of a valve that opens, allowing propellant to flow across a bed, which creates thrust. Fortunately, there was backup.\n\nStich noted another issue, which was the loss of signal in Starliner's GPS system. This system determines the velocity and orientation of the spacecraft as it returns to Earth.\n\n\"We had great performance from the GNC system, the guidance navigation control, the Vesta system,\" Stich added. Stich said that the helium leaks previously seen were also checked, and that sufficient helium remained.\n\nOverall, Stich said \"Starliner did really well today.\"\n\n\"On the NASA team and the Boeing team, they've put a lot of heart and soul into this mission over many years, and it's a testament to those people that we got the vehicle back safely today,\" he said.\n\nWhile the service module which contained the malfunctioning thrusters was jettisoned upon reentry, the investigation into Starliner's issues will continue as teams analyze data from the spacecraft. The service module is located beneath the spacecraft, and no longer needed during reentry so it must be jettisoned to expose the heat shield. It is the heat shield which protects the spacecraft from the high temperatures during re-entry.\n\nWhile an exact date is not known, Starliner is expected to return to Kennedy Space Center in the coming weeks.\n\nBoeing focused on next steps for the program\n\nBoeing officials were not present at the post landing briefing.\n\nBut in an email statement to FLORIDA TODAY, Boeing's Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, said, \"I want to recognize the work the Starliner teams did to ensure a successful and safe undocking, deorbit, re-entry and landing. We will review the data and determine the next steps for the program.\"\n\nStarliner and NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nThe decision to not fly crew back on Starliner was a major blow to Boeing and a setback to NASA's plans to have two American options to fly crew into space. Boeing received a fixed contract for $4.82 billion in 2014 to develop Starliner to fly NASA astronauts. Meanwhile SpaceX received a contract for $3.14 billion, and has successfully flown eight NASA missions and multiple private crews with their Dragon spacecraft.\n\nSince the contract with Boeing is fixed, all additional testing to address concerns about Starliner will be on Boeing's dime. For NASA, it means they will have to remain dependent solely on SpaceX for now.\n\nStich mentioned that Starliner-1 is tentatively set for the second half of 2025, yet a lot of work needs to be done before that crewed Starliner flight.\n\nData will be taken from this test flight and run through models on the ground. NASA officials expressed confidence solutions will be found and that Starliner will fly a crew to the space station.\n\n\"It was a great day for the Commercial Crew Program and also for Boeing,\" Stich said as he closed his remarks.\n\nWhat is next for the Starliner astronauts?\n\nRemaining onboard the space station, Williams and Wilmore will be joining the Crew-9 expedition − and returning with them in February of 2025.\n\nThe decision not to risk flying Williams and Wilmore home on Starliner created another issue for NASA, as the Dragon is only certified to carry four astronauts.\n\nNASA had already named its four-person Crew-9 so the agency had to cut two crew members from the original Crew-9 team: NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson. They will instead be assigned to a future flight to the space station.\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will launch to the space station on a SpaceX Dragon no earlier than September 24, bringing along a SpaceX suit for Wilmore. There is already a spare SpaceX suit onboard the space station which happens to fit Williams.\n\nWith the Starliner and Dragon being two different spacecrafts from two separate companies, the Boeing spacesuits are not compatible with the SpaceX Dragon. The Boeing spacesuits were returned to Earth on Starliner Saturday.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore had initially intended to spend just about a week in space but now it won't be February until they're back. Both have flown previous NASA missions and as part of the Crew-9 mission, NASA said they may even get to do a spacewalk.\n\nNASA has stated that Williams and Wilmore continue to remain healthy, noting that astronauts have stayed onboard the space station for up to a year with little impact to health. When the two astronauts return in February, they will have been in space for over eight months.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

The storm, the first known Category 4 storm to ever hit the Big Bend coast, was powerful enough to still send strong winds and heavy rain to the Cape Canaveral area where NASA's Kennedy Space Center is located.\n\nThe two Crew-9 astronauts, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, arrived last Saturday at the space center to begin preparations for the imminent launch, which will take place at the neighboring Space Force Station.\n\nHere's how to watch the Crew-9 takeoff and what to know about the mission.\n\nSpaceX Crew-9:What to know about the mission that will return Starliner astronauts\n\nWhen is the Crew-9 mission scheduled for launch?\n\nThe Dragon is scheduled to launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket no earlier than 1:17 p.m. EDT Saturday from Space Launch Complex-40, NASA officials confirmed Friday during a news conference.\n\nOnce in orbit, the vehicle will separate from the rocket and power on to the International Space Station, where the crew will spent about five months. The mission, which was initially set for Aug. 18, was delayed for more than a month while NASA and Boeing officials worked to figure out what to do about the troubled Starliner spacecraft taking up the Dragon's docking port.\n\nNow that the Boeing Starliner capsule has returned to Earth intact – albeit, without its crew – the Dragon has been cleared for takeoff. But Helene threw a new wrench into the plans, forcing NASA and SpaceX to scuttle the launch another three times this week.\n\nHow to watch the Crew-9 mission launch\n\nNASA will provide coverage of the launch, the subsequent docking and the activities that precede the mission.\n\nOn launch day, coverage begins at 9:10 a.m. EDT on NASA+ and the space agency’s website.\n\nFollowing the ascent, NASA will switch to audio only before coverage resumes at 3:30 p.m. Sunday when the Dragon prepares to dock and the hatch opens to welcome the astronauts aboard the station.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network, will also provide live coverage at floridatoday.com/space.\n\nWhat is the Crew-9 mission?\n\nThe SpaceX flight represents the ninth crew rotation mission to the station under NASA's commercial crew program as the agency shifts to paying private companies for missions it once would carry out itself.\n\nOnce aboard the space station, Hague and Gorbunov will become members of Expedition 72, where they will spend six months conducting experiments, research demonstrations and spacewalks to perform maintenance. Much of it will be to prepare for human exploration deep into the cosmos.\n\nThe Crew-9 astronauts will now not only relieve Crew-8, whose team have been at the space station since March, but will also arrive on the vehicle that will bring home Starliner astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.\n\nThe NASA astronauts flew in June to the station aboard the Boeing Starliner for what was supposed to be a 10-day stay as part of the inaugural crewed test flight of the vehicle.\n\nWhen Williams and Wilmore arrived on June 6 at the space station, engineers discovered that the Starliner craft had experienced multiple helium leaks and had issues with its propulsion system prompting NASA to eventually make the call to send the vehicle back to Earth without its crew.\n\nThe Starliner astronauts will now instead remain at the space station until February, when they will return with the Crew-9 team on the Dragon.\n\nMeet the Crew-9 astronauts\n\nFor that reason, NASA and SpaceX will not be able to send a full contingent of four Crew-9 astronauts.\n\nHere are the two astronauts heading into orbit:\n\nNASA astronaut Nick Hague , of Belleville, Kansas, will serve as crew commander, making this his third launch and second mission to the space station.

Or will the astronauts have no choice but to wait until February to hitch a ride on a SpaceX Dragon?\n\nThat answer may be coming soon as NASA officials appear poised to finally reveal the Starliner's fate.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson is scheduled to appear for a live news conference at 1 p.m. EDT Saturday from the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, the agency said Thursday. The news conference, which will be televised and livestreamed, will take place about one hour after Nelson will meet behind closed doors with officials at both NASA and Boeing for a flight readiness review.\n\nA rare process in the middle of a mission, the additional review became necessary for flight engineers to determine whether the beleaguered Starliner is capable of safely returning astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams to Earth – or whether the spacecraft will have to undock with no humans aboard.\n\n'Stuck' in space?Starliner astronauts aren't 1st with an extended orbital stay; Frank Rubio's delayed return set record\n\nHow to watch NASA news conference\n\nUnlike more recent Starliner news conferences, which have been geared primarily toward the media, Saturday's event will be made widely public and will feature the NASA administrator himself.\n\nThose interested in watching the news conference have a variety of ways to do so.\n\nThe conference will be streamed on NASA+ and broadcast on NASA Television, which the agency will soon phase out. It can also be watched on the NASA app, the agency’s website and its YouTube channel.\n\nWhat is a flight readiness review?\n\nThe Starliner capsule – built with the intention of running crews and deliveries regularly to the station on behalf of NASA – has always been the preferred transportation for Wilmore and Williams when they eventually make the return journey.\n\nHowever, NASA and Boeing have contingency plans in place to ensure the veteran astronauts – both of whom have been to space twice before – get home one way or another.\n\nFlight readiness reviews are required before every NASA mission is able to commence. In special circumstances, NASA scientists may need to revisit that review process mid-mission, Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said at an Aug. 14 media conference.\n\nEngineering and spaceflight specialists from NASA and Boeing have for the past week or so been collecting and analyzing Starliner data in preparation for the flight readiness review, NASA said Thursday in a blogpost about the mission.\n\nThe news conference will follow the review’s conclusion.\n\nBoeing officials have not taken part in recent news conferences with NASA, and the aerospace company has not issued an update of its own since Aug. 2.\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe beleaguered Starliner was besieged with troubles even before it finally managed to launch June 5 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on its inaugural crewed test flight.\n\nWilmore and Williams were only meant to be aboard the International Space Station for little more than a week before heading back to Earth. But when they made it to the orbital outpost a day after the launch, engineers discovered a slew of helium leaks and problems with the craft's propulsion system that have hampered Starliner's return to Earth.\n\nAmid the scramble to figure out what to do about Starliner, NASA previously made the call to postpone the launch of SpaceX Crew-9.\n\nThat mission had been slated to take off earlier in August for the space station in a routine flight to replace the Crew-8 mission that's been at the outpost since March. But because the four Crew-9 members cannot arrive at the station until the docking port occupied by Starliner is available, that mission won't happen any sooner than Sept. 24, NASA has said.\n\nTo stave off any more delays, Starliner will have to undock by then with or without a crew. Whether four astronauts or two astronauts head up to the International Space Station for the six-month Crew-9 rotation depends on whether Wilmore and Williams are on board Starliner when it departs.\n\nIn the event that Starliner leaves empty and returns to Earth autonomously, Wilmore and Williams would need to have room to hitch a ride home on Feb. 25 on the Dragon once the Crew-9 team completes its shift.\n\nIn the meantime, the astronauts have spent their extended stay working alongside the crew of Expedition 71, performing scientific research and helping to do mainteance on the space station, NASA said.\n\nWhat is the mission of Starliner?\n\nStarliner is intended to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX to make routine trips to space on behalf of NASA.\n\nThe partnership marks a shift in recent years for the U.S. space agency, which has pivoted to paying private companies for missions it once would carry out itself as a way to cut costs. Certifying the Starliner for such missions would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts and cargo to the space station after it shelled out billions of dollars to both Boeing and SpaceX to develop the vehicles.\n\nBut Boeing has lagged behind SpaceX, which has already begun reliably transporting astronauts and supplies since 2020 to the space station aboard its Dragon. It remains to be seen whether Starliner could still be certified for crewed rotation missions if the capsule returns without its crew.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The spacewalk that was supposed to happen Monday was canceled following a spacesuit issue. NASA has not yet said how that will impact the planned spacewalk schedule or if it will further delay the astronauts' return.\n\nUSA TODAY contacted Boeing, who referred questions to be asked to NASA. USA TODAY contacted NASA on Monday morning but has not yet received a response.\n\nThe crew is also reviewing some issues with the Starliner spacecraft.\n\n“We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,” Steve Stich, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager, said in the update. “We are letting the data drive our decision making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nStitch also said an \"agency-level review\" would be necessary due to the duration of the mission. He compared it to what was done ahead of NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 return after it spent two months in orbit.\n\nUS spacewalk 90 canceled\n\nAlthough NASA and Boeing moved the Starliner's return to accommodate the spacewalks, U.S. spacewalk 90 was scrapped Monday morning due to \"a water leak in the service and cooling umbilical unit on NASA astronaut Tracy C. Dyson’s spacesuit,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe water leak was noticed after Dyson and astronaut Mike Barratt set their suits to battery power Monday morning, NASA said.\n\nThe spacewalk was initially scheduled for June 14, but that attempt was delayed due to a \"spacesuit discomfort issue.\"\n\nThe spacewalk is planned to \"remove a faulty electronics box from a communications antenna on the starboard truss of the space station,\" NASA said. The astronauts also would have collected samples for analysis to \"understand the ability of microorganisms to survive and reproduce on the exterior of the orbiting laboratory,\" according to the government agency.\n\nAre the astronauts stuck in space?\n\nWhile Wilmore and Williams' return home continues to be delayed, Boeing said plenty of supplies remain for the astronauts and the station's schedule is \"relatively open through mid-August.\" In case of an emergency on the ISS, the Starliner is cleared to leave orbit and return to Earth, the company added.\n\nBoeing added the crew is \"not pressed for time to leave\" as the astronauts continue to help with station operations as needed and are completing NASA's add-on in-flight objectives.\n\n“The crew’s feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they know that every bit of learning we do on the Crew Flight Test will improve and sharpen our experience for future crews,” Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Starliner Program, said in the June 21 release.\n\n“Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station,” Stich said. “We are strategically using the extra time to clear a path for some critical station activities while completing readiness for Butch and Suni’s return on Starliner and gaining valuable insight into the system upgrades we will want to make for post-certification missions.”\n\nBoeing Starliner issues, including helium leaks\n\nHelium leaks and a malfunctioning thruster valve hampered the Starliner's launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida on June 5. These same issues seem to be still affecting the spacecraft weeks later.\n\nThere's been a series of helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system, Stich said during a media teleconference on June 18. So far, five leaks have been found since the Starliner has been docked at the ISS, he added.\n\n\"The path going forward is to continue to look at the helium system to try to understand what's happening, again look at simulations for the remainder of the flight… and then the operational techniques to manage the helium system,\" Stich said.\n\nThe defective thruster valve, which is still offline as of June 15, is another problem but Stich said the crew did not plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The belief is that the valve went offline due to the extreme heat generated while the thruster system was firing \"in rapid succession\" to keep the Starliner on course with the space station, according to Stich.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/13/astronauts-boeing-starliner-iss/75212315007/", "title": "\"We've got a ride home,\" NASA astronauts upbeat about extended ...", "text": "It's things like family. A daughter's senior year in high school. Spouses. Pet dogs. Even just regular exercise routines are missed.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams admitted Friday that, yes, of course, their year did not turn out as they'd expected. When they headed to the International Space Station onboard Starliner on a test flight in June, they thought they'd be returning home just eight days later. Williams referenced fall activities she'd had in mind, including spending time with her mom.\n\nBut that wasn't to be, and both said repeatedly during a video call from the International Space Station with journalists on Friday that they quickly adapted to what will now be an eight-month mission and a return on a spacecraft, the SpaceX Dragon, that they didn't plan traveling on. They're doing well, they said. They love being in space. And as both were previously Navy test pilots and their journey to the station on the troubled Starliner was a test flight, they knew there was always a risk of things going wrong.\n\n\"We always miss our families. I miss my two dogs. I miss my friends,\" said Williams. \"But you know what? Like Butch said, there's so many people on Earth that are sending us messages, and it makes you feel just right at home with everybody − when we're able to have those conversations with our friends and family at home. So I know they understand. I know it's tough on them as well as you know, being away from home, of course, but everybody understands, and everybody's cheering for us to get back with Crew-9.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams floated in front of the camera as activity on the International Space Station took place behind them Friday. Williams sported a white shirt with the NASA logo while Wilmore donned a dark colored shirt with the Navy astronaut wings logo. It was Sept. 7 that the troubled Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing returned to Earth without them − NASA unable to determine its reliability to bring them home safely.\n\n\"That is the nature of every single test flight, especially a first flight of a spacecraft or an aircraft,\" Wilmore said. \"90% of our training is preparing for the unexpected, and sometimes the actual unexpected goes beyond what you even think could happen. And that's just the way it goes sometime because we are pushing the edges of the envelope and everything that we do, and it is not easy.\"\n\nWilliams added: \"I think the up part is, we're here with our friends. We've got a ride home, and, you know, we're looking forward to the next couple months and doing a lot of stuff for the International Space Station.\"\n\nAstronauts left behind by Starliner:Timeline of space saga\n\nStarliner astronauts watch as their Boeing spacecraft returns to Earth without them\n\nAs the duo watched Starliner return to Earth without them on Sept. 7, NASA unable to determine the reliability of the spacecraft's troublesome thrusters, did they feel stuck, journalists wanted to know Friday.\n\n\"Absolutely not. Never entered my mind. I don't think Suni's either. Until you mentioned it,\" answered Wilmore.\n\nFlorida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network, spoke with Emmanuel Urquieta, vice chair of aerospace medicine and associate professor of medicine at the University of Central Florida, on the possibility of mental and physical impacts to the astronauts who will now spend eight months in orbit.\n\n\"I don't think there's any impact to them. These are absolutely professional astronauts,\" said Urquieta. \"You know, (they were) highly selected by NASA when they became astronaut candidates, both from a psychological and medical perspective. They have been in space multiple times.\"\n\nWilliams said when she and Wilmore were preparing to fly Starliner, they talked about it being a test flight and what that might entail. She said they not only trained on the Boeing spacecraft but also for the stay aboard the space station, although it wasn't expected to be this long.\n\n\"Both of us had been up here before, so we have a little bit of experience, and so we could dive right into the International Space Station training. So we are fully qualified crew members, both qualified in spacewalking EVAs and robotics for visiting vehicles. So the transition was not that hard,\" said Williams.\n\nThe two will be joining NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, who are set to launch on a SpaceX Dragon no earlier than Sept. 24, as part of Crew-9. NASA had to make adjustments to Crew-9 to allow two seats for Williams and Wilmore to come home on the Dragon in February. With Dragon only certified to carry four astronauts, astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson, who had originally been part of the Crew-9 mission, will instead be assigned to a future flight.\n\nWhen Hague and Gorbunov arrive, Williams will be named commander of the space station.\n\nUrquieta told Florida Today there's little to worry about in terms of medical impacts on the astronauts. On the space station, exposure to radiation is not drastic, as they are still below the Van Allen radiation belt, and therefore are shielded from the majority of cosmic radiation.\n\n\"They have to do two hours of exercise every day. They have the cupola (window) − they can look at the planet anytime they want. Constantly, there's new resupply vehicles going in and out of the space station to bring new supplies, to take out old supplies. So, you know, they can send them care packages from the families, fresh food. I really don't think there's any any potential impacts to them whatsoever,\" said Urquieta.\n\nUrquieta also noted that it's not new for astronauts to serve long duration missions. Astronauts have lived onboard the space station for over a year. Just last year, Frank Rubio returned from a stay that lasted over a year when debris stuck the Soyuz spacecraft he traveled to the space station on. He and his two Russian cosmonaut crewmates ended up waiting a year to return on another Soyuz − and returned to Earth with no ill effects.\n\nStarliner crew speak on family\n\nWhile Williams mentioned she misses her family, her husband, and two dogs, Wilmore noted he will miss most, his youngest daughter's senior year of high school.\n\n\"We try to teach them the principles that are important, and let them understand that trials, however you judge what a trial might be, makes you stronger,\" said Wilmore. \"In that respect, I'm grateful.\"\n\nBoth said they did believe Starliner could have brought them home, but fully accepted NASA's decision. Williams said she was glad to see Starliner make it back safely.\n\n\"You have to be resilient,\" said Wilmore, adding that he doesn't harp on what could have been. \"It's not what we do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wilmore's teenage daughter, Logan Wilmore, took to social media to assure the public the family is not worried about her dad.\n\nLogan posted a video of her and her father to the social media app TikTok which received more than 3.3 million reactions. The caption reads \"not dead, just stuck in space. I'm not worried at all just miss him!\"\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

According to the organization, Wimore and Williams could stay at the International Space Station (ISS) until later in the summer.\n\nScientists and engineers are working through testing to better understand and resolve problems that occurred during Starliner's launch and flight last month, including some misfiring thrusters and helium leaks. The testing is expected to conclude by the end of the week.\n\n\"I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program. \"I think some of the data suggest optimistically maybe it's by the end of July, but we'll just follow the data each step at a time and at the right time figure out when the right undock opportunity is.\"\n\nThough teams are looking to have Wimore and Williams depart from the space station before a crew turnover in mid-August, Starliner has been deemed safe to return to Earth at any time in an emergency.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams check in from space\n\nSpeaking in a separate news conference Wednesday streaming live from the ISS, Wilmore and Williams said they're \"not complaining\" about spending more time away from Earth.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS,\" Williams said. \"Butch and I have been up here before, and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around, it feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. It's great to be up here, so I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\"\n\nAnd while the idea of being up in space longer than initially planned may sound scary to some, Wilmore and Williams are confident in Starliner, its team and their ability to get back home safely.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident (it'll get us back safe),\" Wilmore said.\n\n'Let's put some fire in this rocket':Crewed Boeing Starliner finally launches from Florida\n\nWhen will the Starliner return to Earth?\n\nStarliner's return to Earth has been repeatedly delayed since its initial planned reentry no later than a week after launch. It was then pushed to no earlier than June 18, then June 22, then June 25.\n\nNow, Starliner and its crew aren't expected back until the end of July at the earliest.\n\nThe changes were partially to better prepare the Starliner crew for the \"long-term goal of having it perform a six-month docked mission at the space station,\" Stich said in an announcement in June. NASA also later mentioned spacewalks, data collection and further testing as reasons for the delay.\n\n“We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,” Stich said in an update June 21. “We are letting the data drive our decision-making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nWhen it is time for Starliner to return, it will land in New Mexico. Starliner will \"descend under parachutes to land in the desert grounds of White Sands,\" according to Boeing. After the ship slows to about 4 mph, airbags attached to the bottom will deploy and soften its landing.\n\n\"The landing will mark the first time an American capsule has touched down on land with astronauts aboard,\" the company said in the release.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with ISS, we could get in our spacecraft and we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said in the virtual conference on Wednesday. \"We've practiced a lot, so I have a feeling, I have a real good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home no problem.\"\n\nWhat is the Starliner crew doing in space?\n\nWhat have the astronauts been doing all that extra time in space? Quite a lot, actually, starting right from launch.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular, I mean truly amazing,\" said Wilmore, noting that the spacecraft performed \"unbelievably well\" and with \"amazing\" precision.\n\nThe second day after launch, Wilmore said, the loss of function in two RCS jets made handling noticeably different, but the pair had practiced and been certified for manual control. They manually took over the ship for about an hour while teams on the ground troubleshot and got the jets back.\n\nOnce arriving at ISS, the two integrated in with the exiting crew. They are fully certified for all aspects of life aboard the space station, said Wilmore, including spacewalks, operating technology and maintenance, which they have done \"a lot of.\"\n\n\"That's part of living here: You've got to keep that space station going,\" Wilmore said.\n\nThe two have also gotten to participate in a lot of scientific experimentation, according to WIlliams. From gene sequencing to using a 3D-printed moon microscope, they are keeping busy as temporary members of the ISS crew. More testing will be done on Starliner's functions and how to optimize them before, during and after undocking as well.\n\nStarliner launches after delays\n\nWilmore and Williams launched into space on June 5 after several last-minute scrubs delayed the plans.\n\nThe inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, meant to compete with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX spacecraft, was waylaid by a series of technical problems. It began on May 6, the original launch date, when trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage forced the mission to be scrubbed.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. That issue caused additional delays until it finally lifted off.\n\nAdditional helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system were found after launch. During a media teleconference in late June, Stich, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, said five leaks had been discovered since Starliner docked at ISS.\n\nThe valve that malfunctioned during launch also did not come back online when the crew test-fired the spacecraft's thrusters. The crew did not try to test-fire the defective valve and they don't plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Stich said.\n\nStill, the craft safely navigated to the space station, docking autonomously the next afternoon on the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Jonathan Limehouse and Natalie Neysa Alund", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/10"}]}

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThen, after running down a laundry list of those accomplishments while placing her alongside Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and Madonna as a pop star, Time explained why this year more than any other year.\n\n\"As a celebrity — who by dint of being a woman is scrutinized for everything from whom she dates to what she wears — she has long commanded constant attention and knows how to use it,\" Time wrote.\n\n\"But this year, something shifted. To discuss her movements felt like discussing politics or the weather — a language spoken so widely it needed no context. She became the main character of the world.\"\n\nBy that point, USA TODAY had hired its own Taylor Swift reporter and Swift had grabbed another first — first billionaire in history with music as the main source of income.\n\nAt 33.\n\nHow the Year of Taylor Swift began in Glendale, Arizona\n\nAnd to think: The Year of Taylor all began in Glendale, which renamed itself Swift City for the weekend in her honor.\n\nA symbolic rebrand, the Swift City storyline played out on digital billboards along freeways and in Glendale's Westgate Entertainment District, where State Farm Stadium is located, welcoming fans to Swift City.\n\nFor what it's worth, we would've gone with Glendale (Taylor's Version).\n\nSwift had launched the Reputation Tour in that same stadium five years earlier.\n\nShe really likes us!\n\nThe Eras Tour is 'a journey through all of my musical eras'\n\nIn announcing the tour, Swift had promised “a journey through all of my musical eras,” which by any reasonable metric, is a lot of ground to cover — 10 hit albums, four of which have been released since the conclusion of the Reputation Tour in late 2018.\n\nAnd she made it look easy, enjoying the journey as much as the Swifties who flocked to the show did while revisiting her catalog one era at a time in a marathon set that ran more than three hours, squeezing in 44 songs before the night was through.\n\nHer earliest eras weren’t as prominently featured in the journey as her recent albums. There was only one song, “Tim McGraw,” from her first album, “Taylor Swift,” and one, “Enchanted,” from her third release, “Speak Now.”\n\nThe early albums she’d already rerecorded in “Taylor’s Version” editions by the time the tour launched were given more time in the spotlight. There were three songs from her second album “Fearless” and four from her fourth album, “Red.”\n\nTaylor Swift | The Eras Tour:5 magic moments at State Farm Stadium that Arizonans saw first\n\nThe Eras Tour favored the eras since the Reputation Tour\n\nIt made sense that Swift would give more stage time to the albums she hadn’t had a chance to tour since being forced to pull the plug on Lover Fest, the tour she had planned in support of 2019’s “Lover,” in response to the pandemic that took everybody off the road in 2020.\n\nNot quite an hour into her performance on Night 1 in Glendale, Swift asked fans, “Is it just me or do we have a lot of things to catch up on?”\n\nNoting that “it’s been a really long time since I’ve been on tour,” she said they’d “added four new members to the family” since that last tour, introducing them by name as “Lover,” “Folklore,” Evermore” and “Midnights,” her latest release, which brought the concert to an end with a seven-song sampler.\n\nIt was a breathtaking journey through 17 years’ worth of musical eras with the artist connecting with at every step along the way.\n\nWhen Taylor dove into a stream and sang 'All Too Well'\n\nThe stage show was designed to reach the back rows of the stadium with a breathtaking blend of artful set design — that “Folklore” cabin was cottagecore gold — and film projected on the massive screen behind the stage.\n\nIt was a concert packed with highlights, the most theatrical of which came at the end of an understated “Tim McGraw,” which Swift performed alone on a satellite stage, accompanying herself on an upright piano. At the song’s conclusion, she stood up and appeared to dive into a stream to swim beneath the runaway to the main stage.\n\nAs entertaining as that was, the full 10-minute version of “All Too Well” from “Red (Taylor’s Version),” the longest song to top the Billboard Hot 100, emerged as the concert’s emotional centerpiece, a heartbreaking triumph that ended in a haunting shower of paper snowflakes.\n\nThat opening-night performance also introduced the concept of “surprise songs,” two unannounced acoustic songs she planned to slip into the set each night just to keep fans guessing in the Era of the Online Setlist, where a quick Google search can reveal all.\n\nThe Era Tour is scheduled to conclude on Dec. 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour Night 1 set list in Glendale, Arizona\n\n“Lover” album:\n\n“Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince.” “Cruel Summer.” “The Man.” “You Need To Calm Down.” “Lover.” “The Archer.”\n\n“Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” album:\n\n“Fearless.” “You Belong With Me.” “Love Story.”\n\n“Evermore” album:\n\n“’Tis The Damn Season.” “Willow.” “Marjorie.” “Champagne Problems.” “Tolerate It.”\n\n“Reputation” album:\n\n“… Ready For It?” “Delicate.” “Don’t Blame Me.” “Look What You Made Me Do.”\n\n“Speak Now” album:\n\n“Enchanted.”\n\n“Red (Taylor’s Version)” album:\n\n“22.” “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” “I Knew You Were Trouble.” “All Too Well (10 Minute Version).”\n\n“Folklore” album:\n\n“Invisible String.” “Betty.” “The Last Great American Dynasty.” “August.” “Illicit Affairs.” “My Tears Ricochet.” “Cardigan.”\n\n“1989” album:\n\n“Style.” “Blank Space.” “Shake It Off.” “Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version).” “Bad Blood.”\n\nSurprise songs:\n\n“Mirrorball.” “Tim McGraw.”\n\n“Midnights” album:\n\n“Lavender Haze.” “Anti-Hero.” “Midnight Rain.” “Vigilante (expletive).” “Bejeweled.” \"Mastermind.\" “Karma.”\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

Invincibility is her mantra.\n\nWho in entertainment could match Swift’s achievements on the “most fun, joyful, exciting, intense, powerful tour” she’s ever done, as she referred to her billion-dollar-earning exhaust-a-thon Eras stadium tour during its final trio of shows in Vancouver?\n\nNot even Michael Jackson or Madonna in their prime circled five continents throughout 21 months, playing 149 shows stocked with 45 songs, including special acoustic “surprises” at every gig. Her epic concerts gift-wrapped fans nearly 3½-hours of heartfelt music, clever lyrics, sparkly costumes, glistening production and, most importantly, unpretentious charm.\n\nSwift has set records in the touring, film and book industries with the highest-grossing tour of all time, highest-grossing concert film ever and fastest-selling book of 2024.\n\nTaylor Swift's ambition is limitless\n\nSunday’s finale at BC Place in Vancouver was a dichotomous bookend: Swift launched the sprawling Eras Tour in March 2023 in the blazing Arizona desert and brought this chapter to its conclusion during damp, chilly winter in Canada.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nDuring the tour’s tenure, she engaged with as many weather elements as she did eras. She performed in soaked costumes in a Nashville downpour, made a joke about her frizzy hair on a humid Singapore night and braved the frigid cold in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nWhile romping through the type of grueling shows that would level mere mortals after nearly two years, Swift, who turns 35 on Friday, earned a trio of Grammys (including a record-breaking fourth album of the year nod with “Midnights”); became a billionaire; landed on the cover of Time with one of her beloved cats, Benjamin Button, as the magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year; and in her spare time, dropped a 30-song album in April, “The Tortured Poets Department,” which is nominated for album of the year at the 2025 Grammys.\n\nSwift is so prolific that she couldn’t even get through a tour without having to add another era.\n\nShe also unwittingly sparked a fringe market for fan-crafted outfits that painstakingly replicate the pastel-speckled leotard she wears during the “Lover” era, her regal and sparkly red coat donned for “All Too Well” and her white Vivienne Westwood dress decorated with song lyrics that is spotlighted during “The Tortured Poets Department” segment, which she added in May.\n\nFriendship bracelets and the art of devotion\n\nHer zealous fans earned their own spotlight in this Eras gallop around the world when they started a grassroots trend by making and swapping friendship bracelets. The braided and beaded trinkets are woven with messages of kindness, song lyrics or inside jokes among her devotees, who cluster in venue aisles and interminable merchandise lines at concerts to trade as part of their own secret society.\n\nInside the last Eras tour show:Taylor Swift ends 'most beloved chapter of my life'\n\nEven Swift marveled at the movement, saying at Saturday’s concert, “I have one line in one song (“You’re On Your Own, Kid”) about a friendship bracelet and you made that idea synonymous with The Eras Tour.”\n\nIt’s but one symbol of the unusual intimacy cultivated among her fans, which span generations and cultures.\n\nKaitlyn Mark, 26, and her mom, Casey, 55, from Blaine, Washington, caught The Eras Tour twice in 2023 and decided to dole out $2,400 for a pair of resale tickets in the 400-level for Saturday’s Vancouver show just to share the experience one final time.\n\n“We saw the second set of dates in Las Vegas in 2023, so I feel like it’s cool for us to share this (at the end of the tour),” Casey said.\n\nKaitlyn, who teaches third grade, is already spreading her love of Swift to her young charges.\n\n“I have a quote on the classroom wall that says ‘You make the whole class shimmer,'” she said, citing a modified lyric from Swift’s song “Bejeweled.” “I’m, like, the Taylor Swift teacher.”\n\nWhen it comes to dedication to Swift, there is seemingly no limit on the amount of money or time her fans will invest.\n\nMolly Menounos, a 5th grade teacher in the Boston area, flew standby Friday after her Thursday flight into Vancouver was canceled.\n\nShe and three friends initially bought $68 presale tickets in November 2023 for Friday’s show. But after the travel snafu, they sold their tickets on StubHub and purchased resale tickets for Saturday in a similar section for $1,300 each. The Swift supporters also split a hotel room within walking distance of the stadium for $4,000 per night.\n\n“She cares so much, and that’s why we have to get there, because we care so much,” Menounos, 24, said of Swift, while on her flight to Vancouver. “Yeah, I’m losing money and I’m only going to be there for a little more than 24 hours, but it’s still worth it.”\n\nMenounos, who had seen Swift on her tours behind the “Red,” “1989” and “Reputation” albums but not yet the Eras spectacle, recalled listening to Swift since she was in eighth grade. Her love of Swift helped forge enduring friendships in high school and among her college roommates and stretches to her family, including her Swiftie dad, who urged her to make the trip after an anxiety-riddled day of travel uncertainty.\n\nThough she was eager to finally witness the Eras marathon, Menounos expected warring emotions when it’s over.\n\n“I know I’m going to cry,” she said. “But I think it will be a catharsis.”\n\nMore:Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" is what we desperately needed. Now what?\n\nTaylor Swift is generating enough money 'to be a small country'\n\nThe money spent by Menounos and her friends is one of literally millions of examples of the Swift effect on the 51 cities she’s played on tour.\n\nBetween boosts to the airline industry – Southwest Airlines used signature numbers in her music to add flights with designations including #1989 and #22 for her fall U.S. dates – and the tourism dollars generated at restaurants and hotels, a Swift weekend of shows produces nearly as much money for a city as a Super Bowl.\n\nA Bank of America study earlier this year compared spending during the Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, and a weekend of Swift shows in Pittsburgh and found similar increases. Fans spent $96 more in restaurants and $74 more in bars for Super Bowl weekend compared to $77 and $56 more, respectively, during an Eras weekend.\n\nIt's an unparalleled phenomenon in the music industry.\n\n“If you look at the global impact of her concerts outside of ticket sales, she’s generating enough money to be a small country at this point,” said Adam Gustafson, associate teaching professor of music at Penn State’s School of Humanities who has given several presentations about Swift. “It’s not even just a regional thing. People have traveled across the world to see her, and multiple times.”\n\nGustafson attributes that devotion and willingness to spend money, whether on concert tickets, T-shirts, coffee table books or movie screenings, to Swift’s genuine rapport with fans.\n\n“There seems to be a real sense of younger people that if the person on the other end is authentic, they’re more than happy to support them. If they feel it’s inauthentic or overly corporate, they’ll get leery. But Taylor’s whole life is out there and there is no way for her to be inauthentic,” Gustafson said.\n\nTaylor Swift's generosity also deserves admiration\n\nSwift’s altruism is frequently tagged as a reason for respect and admiration, even from those with a cursory interest in her.\n\nGustafson notes the $100,000 bonus checks Swift presented to her trucking staff in 2023 as not only an indicator of her generosity, but how it reminds people – as she often does – that this level of success in a fluid live production cannot be achieved alone.\n\n“It draws attention to the dancers in the background, the musicians playing with her, the production crew, all of it, and how she’s often showing people that this is a team effort,” he said.\n\nSwift’s humanity is the reason T’Lene Hayes became a fan – and enough of one to spend $735 each on the obscenely marked-up $13.99 behind-the-stage tickets, which offer fans a view of the screens beside the stage but not the stage itself, Swift released last week.\n\n“Once I saw the positive impact she was having on cities (where she performed) I began to respect her more as a human and then became a fan of her music,” Hayes, 36, said. The Seattle-based nurse and her boyfriend, Adam Carver, 29, bought their tickets to Saturday’s show on the resale market that morning and promptly drove the three hours to Vancouver, listening, of course, to a Spotify playlist of Swift songs.\n\nWhile Hayes now also appreciates Swift’s music – especially “Folklore” and “Evermore” – she’s still most impressed with Swift’s benevolence.\n\n“The donations she made to food banks (on every stop of The Eras Tour) and the bonuses she gave her staff, it just warmed my heart that the people pulling off probably the biggest tour ever were being appreciated,” Hayes said. “She saw those people as humans.”\n\nCarver added that he’s most impressed by Swift’s business savvy.\n\n“She’s such a powerful woman. It’s like witnessing an historical figure, like Alexander the Great or something, in action,” he said.\n\nMore:In 2024's Spotify Wrapped, a defining trend: Female narrators reign supreme\n\nHow Taylor Swift became her own brand\n\nIndeed, even with her 14 Grammy Awards, billions of streams and millions of albums sold, Swift has rocketed her career from admired singer-songwriter to an inescapable brand like a shot of adrenaline to the heart. Only she doesn’t need flashy logos or cutesy names as marketing tools because she is the brand.\n\nAlyse Lancaster, vice dean for Academic Affairs at the University of Miami School of Communication started teaching “The Mastermind of the Taylor Swift Brand” this semester, an idea influenced by her 17-year-old Swift fan daughter.\n\nFor 16 weeks, 189 students pile into an auditorium to discuss and debate Swift’s ascension to billionaire status and how she “created her own economy,” as Lancaster put it.\n\n“It’s not just becoming a billionaire, but how that branding gives back,” Lancaster said. “The way she treats her employees, the handwritten notes, she always puts a personal touch on everything she does and that’s what differentiates her from other celebrities. She never forgets that the fans are the ones who continue to put her where she is.”\n\nSwift’s effect on the NFL, an inadvertent byproduct of her giddily public relationship with Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce – whose already-high profile has escalated to ubiquity – is indisputable.\n\nMenounos said the kids in her class are always asking about the Chiefs, while Lancaster remarked her daughter, who “didn’t even know what a touchdown was before (Swift and Kelce),” has a Chiefs sweatshirt on her holiday gift list.\n\n“Think about the number of advertisers if Kansas City goes back to the Super Bowl, all of the female-centered products like makeup companies that might consider advertising,” Lancaster said. “Taylor has changed the entire marketing strategy even for an event like that.”\n\nLancaster plans to teach her course again in the fall, especially after fully understanding the Swiftian vibe when she caught The Eras Tour with her daughter in October in Miami. Though she had an inkling of what to expect from seeing clips of the show online, she was engulfed by the nearly tangible feeling of togetherness at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\n“Her shows are a beautiful place to be and create that kind of space for women,” Lancaster said. “But for men, too. You see dads who have little girls putting sparkles on their heads and they’re fine with that. My daughter, who is very shy, was walking up to strangers asking if they wanted to trade friendship bracelets. Taylor has created an environment that feels loving and safe.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/09/10/taylor-swift-eras-tour-dates-2024/75109891007/", "title": "End of the Eras Tour: Taylor Swift's final 2024 concert dates", "text": "Taylor Swift brought the Eras Tour to North America for one last victory lap that started with three nights in Miami Gardens, Florida, the weekend of Oct. 18-20.\n\nShe was set to hit five venues on the final leg of a tour she launched at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona – or Swift City as Glendale rebranded itself (albeit symbolically) for the opening weekend — with a 44-song journey through her catalog on March 17, 2023.\n\nThe Eras Tour has since become the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first tour in history to generate more than $1 billion in revenue.\n\nThere’s a concert film, naturally.

It's the final show of the first leg of Taylor Swift's Eras tour, the culmination of a monumental musical odyssey both for the singer and the more than 2 million fans who attended − and one sure to go down in music history.\n\nOver the past five months, Swift has performed her over three-hourlong set of nearly 45 songs despite a Ticketmaster debacle, pouring rain, a rumored break-up, a rumored new relationship and another rumored breakup. She had a heartwarming moment with Kobe Bryant's daughter, gave life-changing $100K bonuses to her truck drivers, set the record for No. 1 albums by a female artist, boosted the economy according to the Federal Reserve, might become the first artist to have a tour gross over $1 billion and perhaps single-handedly brought more sequins to football stadiums across America than any other person in history.\n\nAnd Swift shows no signs of slowing down.

Swifties famously trade the homemade jewelry with each other at concerts.\n\n\"It means the world to me,\" Avalos, who wore a \"Reputation\" shirt, says of the show. \"This is like an asteroid for today's pop culture. ... She's the music industry right now.\"\n\nTelevision writer Katie Lunskis says she got last-minute \"miracle\" tickets two weeks ago thanks to a surprise Ticketmaster email while on the way to the dentist. She couldn't stop smiling − or talking − about the tickets through her appointment, much to her dentist's chagrin.\n\nShe attended with her friend, TV literary agent Melissa Darman, who compared the Eras tour to a musical moment akin to Woodstock or other shows of historic caliber.\n\n\"My dad saw the Beatles (in Boston), and, to me, I still think about that,\" Darman says, noting the Eras tour will be a similar experience for her.\n\nWhat's next for Taylor Swift's Eras tour?\n\nAll good things must eventually come to an end. But, luckily for Swifties, the Eras tour isn't over yet. On Aug. 3, Swift announced more North American dates for late 2024 in a second leg, starting Oct. 18-20 in Miami.

The pop star says in the \"Eras Tour\" book that her team recreated a chessboard during “Mastermind” and “when I signal the dancers to move to different sports on the board, they actually create the exact sequence for checkmate.”\n\nTaylor Swift band, dancers have pre-show Eras Tour ritual that made her cry\n\nThe “Cruel Summer” singer said that she joins her band and dancers before every show, and someone delivers a speech to get them hyped ahead of their performance as seen in the \"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart\" video.\n\n“Whoever went last picks the person to go that night,” she wrote, adding that “we put our hands in the middle and all chant the same thing together.” Then, it’s go time.\n\nSwift also said many of the speeches — which range from motivational in tone to a simple share — have made her cry.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/03/14/taylor-swift-eras-tour-albums-films-since-reputation-tour/11428040002/", "title": "Taylor Swift's Eras tour is almost here.

Swift called the sale to Braun her \"worst-case scenario\" in a dramatic, public back and forth about the sale of the artists' life's work, which Swift said she was not made aware of before the rest of the world found out.\n\nSilver lining: Because Swift writes her music, she still has publishing rights.
