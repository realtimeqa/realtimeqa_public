Several interconnected series also air on Disney+.\n\nThe lawsuit says Lucasfilm also hurt her future work prospects by making “maliciously false” statements about her.\n\nCarano, a former mixed martial artists who played the recurring character Cara Dune on the bounty hunter tale “The Mandarlorian,” deleted the post but it was widely shared online and spurred a trending #FireGinaCarano hashtag.\n\nCarano had previously been criticized for social media posts that mocked mask wearing during the pandemic and made false allegations of voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. She also mocked the use of gender pronouns in profiles, listing “beep/bop/boop” in her social media bio. She said this was not about mocking trans people but a “Star Wars” reference to R2-D2, and the lawsuit calls it “a playful way to defuse all the harassment she had received.” But she alleges the issue led to the company harassing her.\n\nGina Carano says Disney 'bullied' herafter controversial posts: 'I'm going to go down swinging'\n\nThe lawsuit says Carano willingly took part in Zoom meetings with leaders of LGBTQ+ groups at the company’s behest with “very positive” results, but that Lucasfilm demanded a public apology in which she admitted “to mocking or insulting an entire group of people, which Carano had never done” and subjected her to other harassment over the issue.\n\nCarano said on social media Tuesday that X had helped fund the lawsuit. X owner Elon Musk shared her post, adding that anyone else who felt they had been wronged by the company should “let us know if you would like to join the lawsuit against Disney.”\n\nEx-'Mandalorian' star Gina Caranobegins filming first project after controversy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/953705/how-the-2011-london-riots-unfolded", "title": "How the 2011 London riots unfolded | The Week", "text": "Ten years ago this week, riots spread across London and other major English cities, sparked by the death of 29-year-old Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police in Tottenham on 4 August 2011.\n\nThe riots – the biggest in modern English history – lasted for five days and swept the capital, from Wood Green to Woolwich. By 9 August, the unrest had developed nationally, reaching other cities including Birmingham, Manchester and Wolverhampton.\n\nBy the time the unrest subsided on 12 August, the capital had increased the number of police officers on the street from 3,000 to 16,000. During the period of violence, more than 3,000 arrests were made and five people died.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

His death happened during an intervention with officers from Operation Trident, a unit targeting gun crime in London, who were attempting to carry out an arrest, reported the BBC in 2015.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct, later admitted to wrongly giving journalists the impression that shots had been fired by Duggan.\n\nAt first, the shooting drew “little attention”, writes former Downing Street official Craig Oliver in a retrospective of the ensuing events in The Times. “But it turns out there was no gun (though one was found near by)” and Duggan’s relatives and friends were “distraught and incensed”.\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was “shocked and deeply worried” about the incident, and on Saturday 6 August 300 people gathered outside Tottenham police station to protest the shooting, saying they wanted “justice” for Duggan and his family.\n\nPart of the reason for their demonstration was down to the “alleged failure by the IPCC to provide Duggan’s family and the local community with reliable information in the aftermath of his death”, wrote The Guardian at the time.\n\nThe newspaper says “two different portraits were painted” of Duggan that week, a “hardened north London gangster and drug dealer” and a “loving family man who would never seek confrontation”.\n\nA 2014 inquest found the shooting to be lawful but concluded that Duggan did not have a weapon in his hands when confronted by police and had thrown it from the taxi.\n\nDoves are released outside Tottenham police station on 11 January 2014, during a vigil following a jury’s ruling that Mark Duggan was lawfully killed when he was shot dead by police (Image credit: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPeaceful protests turn violent\n\nAccording to the BBC, the protests started peacefully, with the demonstration outside Tottenham police station on 6 August, but a “confrontation between a teenage protester and a police officer” sparked violence, with bottles being thrown at two patrol cars, which were then set alight. Riot officers and police on horseback were “deployed to disperse the crowds”, but “came under attack from bottles, fireworks and other missiles”.\n\nThe peaceful gathering “culminated 12 hours later in a full-scale riot that saw brazen looting spread across north-London suburbs”, reported The Guardian at the time. The protest had been “good-natured”, added the paper, but what became clear over the next four hours was that as tensions “gradually escalated”, the “police made only limited attempts to talk to the demonstrators”.\n\nBy 11pm that evening, a double-decker bus had been set alight, reported The Guardian, and many local shops along the high road had been broken into. Haringey Council said the damage to roads and pavements in Tottenham was in the region of £227,000, according to the Daily Mail in 2011.\n\nBurnt out cars lie in the road after riots in Tottenham on 7 August 2011 (Image credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking on the morning of 7 August, Lammy described the events as a “disgrace”. “What happened here on Thursday night raised huge questions and we need answers”, he said. “The response to that is not to loot and rob… This must stop. This is an attack on Tottenham, on people, on ordinary people.”\n\nUnrest spreads across England\n\nThe day after the Tottenham riots, televisions showed “helicopter shots of rioting across London”, writes Oliver in The Times. “From Hackney to Croydon, Ealing to Bromley, shops [were] on fire or being looted.” It was agreed that Prime Minister David Cameron, who was on a summer holiday in Italy, should fly back as soon as possible. Then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson was criticised for not coming back from his holiday quickly enough.\n\n“These images of rioters driving the police from the streets quickly proved an inspiration to others”, says Matteo Tiratelli, a lecturer in political sociology at University College London, in The Conversation. Over the next five nights, roughly 15,000 people took to the streets in towns and cities across England. “Hundreds of police officers were injured and £250m worth of damage was done to shops and businesses in London alone.”\n\nRiot police walk along Clarence Road in Hackney, east London, on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nOn the evening of 8 August, the riots claimed two lives: Trevor Ellis, 26, was found with bullet wounds in a car in Croydon and Richard Bowes, 68, was critically injured trying to put out a fire. He later died from his injuries.\n\nTwo days later, on 10 August, Haroon Jahan, 21, Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were killed when a car hit them in Winson Green, Birmingham. According to witnesses, they had been protecting their community and local businesses from looting and destruction.\n\nHours after finding his dying son in the street, Jahan’s father called for calm: “Black, white, Asians – we all live in the same community... step forward if you want to lose your son. Otherwise, calm down and go home – please”, he said.\n\nTariq Jahan, Haroon’s father, gives a statement to the media near to where his son and two other men were hit by a car and killed in Birmingham on 10 August 2011 (Image credit: CARL DE SOUZA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAn extra 1,700 police officers were deployed in London and more than 400 people were arrested. “The Met was stretched beyond belief in a way that it has never experienced before,” Stephen Kavanagh, the Met deputy assistant commissioner at the time, told BBC Breakfast. It is thought that social media networks including Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger played a key role in fuelling the unrest.\n\nAlthough protests over Duggan’s death had sparked the original Tottenham riots, many seemed to agree that the unrest was “a long time coming” and not just a reaction to the shooting, The Telegraph said. One woman told the paper: “You had a tinder box that was waiting and that was just the match… It's frustration by young people who have been pushed to the wall.”\n\nHow did the riots end?\n\nBy 11 August, the total number of arrests in London had reached 1,009 and of those, 464 people had been charged. One hundred families had been made homeless as a result of the unrest, five people had died and 26 police officers were injured. The situation was reaching a tipping point and, by the fourth night of the riots, London increased its number of police to 16,000 by pulling in officers from other forces across the country.\n\nA damaged Currys store is pictured in Brixton on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThis greater police presence on the streets was the major factor in persuading people to stay at home, according to the Reading the Riots study, which interviewed 270 people involved in the events.\n\n“I think the 16,000 police was a deterrent for everyone; they thought: ‘You know what, we’ve done enough, we’ve done what we had to do… Leave it’,” said one of the people interviewed, a 23-year-old unemployed man from Newham, east London.\n\nOther explanations for the riots ending included a lack of excitement and there being nothing left to loot. Some of those involved in the report said they were impacted by Jahan’s father’s moving speech. “When I [saw his] interview I did stop like, because that did hit me quite hard”, one interviewee said.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nThe IPCC’s investigation into Duggan’s death continued, but in September 2011 Duggan’s brother Shaun Hall said he was “not confident at all” that the watchdog would successfully establish what had happened, the BBC reported.\n\nMembers of Mark Duggan’s family, including his aunt, Carol Duggan, and his half-brother, Shaun, examine a reconstruction of the scene of the shooting on 2 December 2013 (Image credit: Oli Scarff/Getty Images)\n\nThat same month, Scotland Yard apologised to Duggan’s family for failing to inform them directly of his death. A year on from Duggan’s shooting, in 2012, his mother, Pam, said she still had “no answers about why my son died”.\n\nTo this day, questions remain surrounding the events which led to the shooting. In 2015, an IPCC report “found Duggan was probably in the process of throwing away a handgun when he was shot”. However, Forensic Architecture, a human rights research organisation based at Goldsmiths, University of London, has said this conclusion is wrong, according to a detailed report in The Guardian published in 2020.\n\nThe IPCC has called “implausible” a claim that police moved the gun. “There is no sensible reason why they [the police] would have opted to plant the firearm on the grass such a distance away from Mr Duggan thereby giving rise to the various doubts which have inevitably arisen about this matter,” the police watchdog said.\n\nThe penal response to the rioters was “enormous and unprecedented”, says Tiratelli on The Conversation, with cases “pushed from the magistrates’ to the crown courts, ensuring that longer sentences were available and costing minors their right to anonymity in the press”.\n\nThe result was that more than 2,000 people faced jail sentences “which were four and a half times longer than those same offences would normally warrant”.\n\nIn 2011, Cameron agreed to establish the Riots Communities and Victims Panel to investigate the causes of the riots and consider what more could be done to build greater social and economic resilience in communities.\n\nNotes are pinned on a ‘peace wall’ on a boarded-up window of Poundland on Rye Lane, Peckham, in August 2011 (Image credit: John Phillips/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nA decade on\n\nOnly “a handful” of the 63 recommendations in the After the riots report have been implemented, writes David Lammy in The Guardian, which included “calling on the government to provide greater support for families, address youth unemployment, improve school attainment, improve police relations and tackle reoffending by young offenders”.\n\nOver the years, “instead of acting to strengthen the fabric of society’s fire blanket to reduce the risk of riots”, Conservative prime ministers have “decimated police forces, youth services and local authority budgets”, he adds. “I say this with deep regret: by failing to implement the measures designed to tackle society’s dissatisfaction, alienation and fragmentation, Johnson risks letting a spark set fire to the fuel all over again.”\n\nBut writing in The Times, Oliver says he believes that if the country faced a similar situation again, “the police would be quicker off the mark in terms of tightening their grip and making clear actions have consequences”.\n\nHowever, the events of 2011 made it clear that “social order isn’t as stable as we thought”, he adds. “All it takes is for a few thousand people to rebel and, as Yeats famously wrote, ‘Things fall apart... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world’”.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "The Week Uk", "Elliott Goat", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2020/09/24/2020-tv-premieres-summer-television-streaming-shows-dates/3519265001/", "title": "New 2020 TV premieres: Here's when your favorite show returns ...", "text": "Continuing to social distance leaves us with a lot of time on our sanitized hands.

The first engineer to join the team was Allan Alcorn, a University of California graduate who had “never played a video game before”, according to Professor Allison Marsh, writing at IEEE Spectrum.\n\nNolan Bushnell, the creator of Pong (Image credit: Liz Hafalia/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n\nAlcorn was assigned “a kind of warm-up exercise” by Bushnell, said Kotaku’s Smith. In an oral history taken by the Computer History Museum in 2008, Alcorn recalled that he was asked to create Pong – “which we now know was just an exercise” – believing that Atari had been contracted by General Electric to deliver a basic video game.\n\nPong “couldn’t be more simple by today’s standards”, said Smith. A pixelated black and white screen depicts an electronic table tennis table, with a dotted line through the middle marking the net, a small square ball and two rectangular bats on either side.\n\nDuring the game’s development, Alcorn said he “basically had free reign”. Pong was “low-budget to the point of being a one-man operation”, said the New York Post, and Alcorn told the newspaper it took him two months to create it.\n\nKeen to test Pong’s potential, Bushnell installed Alcorn’s creation at “local drinking hole” Andy Capp’s Tavern, said Kyle MacNeill at The Guardian. The “new form of playable, payable game… quickly struck gold”.\n\n‘The game-changer’\n\nIf anything “it was too popular”, said MacNeill. “According to Pong lore, people lined up for their turn to stuff quarters into the machine”, said IEEE Spectrum, until “the manager called Alcorn because the coin box was jammed to overflowing”.\n\nAt the time, Pong machines cost $500 to manufacture, according to the New York Post, and Atari was selling them for $1,000. “The business grew quickly and even spread overseas.”\n\nAtari went on to sell thousands of Pong consoles, and “the sudden success of its first game” saw the company “scrambling to staff up”, said the New York Post. In 1973 Alcorn hired Steve Jobs, then “a young hippie in sandals” who arrived at Atari’s offices “asking for a job”.\n\nAlcorn told the newspaper that Jobs, who would go on to co-found Apple just three years later, was “kind of a pain to work with”, and he had a “real problem with body odour”, which saw him put on the night shifts. “It was better for everyone,” said Alcorn.\n\nThe “real game changer” for Pong came in 1975, said IEEE Spectrum, when Home Pong was released. This at-home console was marketed as being compatible to play on any TV set, and “hundreds of thousands of Pong sets were distributed through the department store Sears”, said the site.\n\nSteve Heighway, left, the former Liverpool footballer, tries out Pong in 1977 (Image credit: SSPL/Getty Images)\n\n“Striking while the silicon was sizzling”, Atari released “a slew of sequels”, said MacNeill in The Guardian, such as Pong Doubles and Quadrapong. But by the end of the 1970s “Pong was overtaken” as new games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders offered “more up-to-date” features and graphics, said MacNeill.\n\nBut it had already made its mark as the video game that “changed the world”.\n\nThe next level\n\nPong “is still a touchstone” in the billion-dollar gaming industry, said Kotaku’s Smith.\n\nAnd the game “still has a place in active research”, said IEEE Spectrum, and is used for “training AI algorithms, strengthening neural networks, and developing the brain-machine interface called Neuralink”. It’s also used to teach children how to code, said MacNeill in The Guardian.\n\nEven “a bundle of lab-grown brain cells” has had a go at playing Pong, said The Guardian. In October, researchers at biological computing start-up Cortical Labs in Melbourne, Australia published a paper in the journal Neuron explaining how a grouping of 800,000 brain cells figured out how to play the game “in five minutes”.\n\nThe mini-brain was “plugged into” the video game, said the BBC, which provided an “external environment” to test brain development. Once play got underway, the cells “often missed the ball” but the “success rate was well above random chance”. The researchers hope the technology could one day be used to trial treatments for neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nIt may be “the most boring video game of all time”, said IEEE, but 50 years since people first started playing it, gamers are still drawn to the “novelty factor” and, of course, its “nostalgia”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Elliott Goat", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Rebekah Evans", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "The Week Staff", "Jamie Timson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/01/09/corrections-clarifications/1821023/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2020", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

If the landing is successful, HAKUTO-R will also become the first commercial spacecraft ever to make a controlled landing on the moon.\n\nThe mission is taking a low energy route to the moon and is due to arrive around April 2023. Once there, the rover will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days on Earth) on the surface, conducting its main operations. It will spend a second lunar day conducting secondary operations, to check whether the rover will survive the moon’s tough nighttime environment, before decommissioning.\n\nScheduled to touch down in the Atlas crater the northeast part of the moon, the rover has been designed to withstand the lunar night, when temperatures can reach as low as -183°C, or -297.4°F.\n\nThe Rashid Rover, named after the late Sheikh Rashid Al Saeed, the former ruler of Dubai, will analyze the plasma on the lunar surface and conduct experiments to understand more about lunar dust. Razor-sharp lunar dust particles can stick to and erode spacesuits and equipment, causing operational problems for astronauts.\n\nThe Rashid Rover was built at Dubai's Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre.

The Gulf state plans to send several vehicles, including rovers and orbiters, to the moon, with a second rover planned to launch as soon as 2025.\n\nConstruction of the 10kg, four-wheel Rashid Rover began in 2017 at the MBRSC. It was designed by an entirely Emirati team. “The team did a great job in starting the mission and designing it,” Hamad Al Marzooqi, project manager of the Emirates Lunar Mission at the MBRSC told CNN.\n\nThe MBRSC is also using the mission to fuel ambitious plans for a Mars colony. It is hoping to build the first human settlement on the Red Planet by 2117. Al Marzooqi hopes that the lunar surface mission will be a stepping stone to Mars.\n\n“We are starting small,” he says, “but we hope that this small step will be eventually the starting point to reach our targets.”", "authors": ["Ollie Macnaughton Nadia Leigh-Hewitson", "Ollie Macnaughton", "Nadia Leigh-Hewitson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/08/07/manhattan-project-scientists-atomic-bomb-hiroshima-nagasaki-column/3305404001/", "title": "Hiroshima, Nagasaki bombing: Meet the scientists who built atom ...", "text": "Stephen P. Kiernan\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThey did not want to build it.\n\nOf the many legends from the creation of the first atomic weapons, 75 years ago, one important truth has been lost. Many scientists involved in the Manhattan Project did not want to build the bomb. They especially did not want it to be used on people. Many military and civilian leaders dismissed these concerns, with repercussions that echo in the world today.\n\nWhenever humanity has invented a new tool of war — the trebuchet, gunpowder, the airplane — our species has not hesitated to use it against enemy armies. Weaponizing the atom was different, because the bomb does not discriminate between soldier and schoolteacher, warrior and infant. It kills everyone in reach.\n\nInitially, many new recruits into the Manhattan Project had no idea what its goal was. Some didn’t even know where they were going. Memoirs by scientists’ wives humanize these unknowns: What kind of house would they live in? (Ramshackle.) Would there be a school for their kids? (An improvised one.) What was their spouse’s job? (If he told, it would be treason.)\n\nRuthlessness of war\n\nGradually the physicists, chemists and others realized what they were building. Almost immediately, they registered concerns. They held debates in the chapel and theater at their lab in Los Alamos, New Mexico. They appealed to project Director Robert Oppenheimer, who conceded that what they were building would be called a “Gadget.” The nickname, which fooled no one, nonetheless stuck all the way to Nagasaki.\n\nSenior scientists began to dissent. Leo Szilard, a physicist who invented the nuclear reactor, the cyclotron and the electron microscope, appealed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to reduce America’s “ruthlessness.”\n\n“Our Air Forces,” he wrote, “striking at Japanese cities, are using the same methods of warfare which were condemned by American public opinion only a few years ago when applied by the Germans to the cities of England. Our use of atomic bombs in this war would carry the world a long way further on this path of ruthlessness.”\n\nJames Franck, a Nobel Prize winner in physics, led a group of scientists whose report declared atomic weapons a civilian policy issue rather than a military one. “We found ourselves … a small group of citizens cognizant of a grave danger for the safety of this country as well as for the future of all the other nations, of which the rest of mankind is unaware.”\n\n75th anniversary:I grew up near the plutonium source for the Nagasaki bomb. Let's end the nuclear nightmare.\n\nArthur Compton, another Nobel laureate, polled 150 project division chiefs. Nearly three-quarters of them supported a public demonstration of the bomb, which they believed would cause Japan to surrender. Only 15% supported direct military use of the bomb.\n\nToward the end of 1944, when it was clear that Germany did not have an atomic bomb, the senior physicist Joseph Rotblat called for an end to the project. Japan had no atomic program worth fearing. His concerns dismissed, he resigned.\n\nEventually, some in the military had qualms. Undersecretary of the Navy Ralph Bard wrote to Secretary of War Henry Stimson: “Japan should have some preliminary warning.”\n\nAnnihilation\n\nThere’s no evidence that this idea influenced Stimson, though he later said that during this period he was afflicted with insomnia. His qualms were not severe enough to delay the Trinity Test in Alamogordo, New Mexico. On July 16, 1945, a few ounces of plutonium proved to have the explosive power of 21,000 tons of TNT.\n\nThe next day, Szilard appealed to President Harry Truman. Using the bomb, he wrote, might bring “an era of devastation on an unimaginable scale.” Dozens of senior researchers co-signed the letter.\n\nTheir petition was moot. The USS Indianapolis had already set sail, bearing the components for Gadgets to be dropped on Japan. That Aug. 6 and 9, the bombs worked as intended. Combined fatality estimates range from 129,000 to 226,000 people.\n\nThe devastation was so thorough and merciless, the world has never used an atomic weapon on people again. Over the years, however, the binary threat between the United States and Russia has multiplied. Could there be a nuclear exchange between Israel and Iran? Might the conflict between India and Pakistan over the region of Kashmir escalate to the ultimate weapons?\n\nRenew the New START treaty:We bombed Hiroshima, Nagasaki 75 years ago. Today, nuclear war still menaces.\n\nInventing the bomb was one of the fastest and greatest scientific achievements in history. By annihilating two cities, the United States saved innumerable lives that would have been lost in battle. But neither argument erases the scientists’ misgivings.\n\nWhat about after the war? Szilard, when diagnosed with bladder cancer, invented cobalt radiation therapy and used it on himself. Successfully.\n\nRotblat founded the Pugwash Conferences. This group began as a quixotic effort to outlaw atomic bombs globally. It evolved into an influential force for weapons negotiations. Contributing to the partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and others, Pugwash has led the efforts to create a safer world. In 1995, Rotblat and Pugwash shared the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nEven Oppenheimer joined the call for an international body to oversee nuclear weapons. For this, he was stripped of his security clearance and found guilty of communist associations.\n\nYet still he deserves the last word, for recognizing that one weapon can create a global challenge. “The time will come,” he predicted, “when mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos and Hiroshima. The peoples of this world must unite or they will perish.”\n\nStephen P.

But it uses compressed air rather than something resembling balloons.\n\nCompressed air used to lift homes\n\nAt first glance, the house doesn't look different from other homes. Except there's an additional foundation underneath, a sensor, and an air compressor.\n\nThe sensor monitors for seismic activity and tremors. Once detected, the sensor will send a signal to an air compressor outside the house, which will flow compressed air between an installed earthquake-proof foundation and the base of the house.\n\nWithin a few seconds, Air Danshin says, the house will rise off the ground up to 1.2 inches, until the tremors have stopped. The air is then slowly released, bringing the house back to the ground.\n\n\"A floating house that is not in contact with the ground will not shake,\" Air Danshin wrote about the house.\n\nFact check: Nikki Haley didn't 'white-wash' her name.

That showed the DNA still had its ability to drive the formation of all cells of the body.\n\nAt the time, the discovery had \"no obvious therapeutic benefit at all,\" Gurdon told reporters in London.\n\n\"It was almost 50 years before the value — the potential value — of that basic scientific research comes to light,\" he said.\n\nIn 1997, the cloning of Dolly the sheep by other scientists showed that the same process Gurdon discovered in frogs would work in mammals.\n\nMore than 40 years after Gurdon's discovery, in 2006, Yamanaka showed that a surprisingly simple recipe could turn mature cells back into primitive cells, which in turn could be prodded into different kinds of mature cells.\n\nBasically, the primitive cells were the equivalent of embryonic stem cells, which had been embroiled in controversy because to get human embryonic cells, human embryos had to be destroyed. Yamanaka's method provided a way to get such primitive cells without destroying embryos.\n\n\"The discoveries of Gurdon and Yamanaka have shown that specialized cells can turn back the developmental clock under certain circumstances,\" the committee said. \"These discoveries have also provided new tools for scientists around the world and led to remarkable progress in many areas of medicine.\"\n\nJust last week, Japanese scientists reported using Yamanaka's approach to turn skin cells from mice into eggs that produced baby mice.\n\nGurdon, 79, has served as a professor of cell biology at Cambridge University's Magdalene College and is currently at the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge, which he founded. Yamanaka, 50, worked at the Gladstone Institute in San Francisco and Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. He is currently at Kyoto University and also affiliated with the Gladstone Institute. Yamanaka is the first Japanese scientist to win the Nobel medicine award since 1987.\n\nYamanaka told Japanese broadcaster NHK that he was at home doing chores on Monday when he got the call from Stockholm.\n\n\"Even though we have received this prize we have not really accomplished what we need to. I feel a deep sense of duty and responsibility,\" Yamanaka said.\n\nChoosing Yamanaka as a Nobel winner just six years after his discovery was unusual. The Nobel committees typically reward research done more than a decade before, to make sure it has stood the test of time.\n\nIn 2010, the Nobel Prize in physics went to two researchers whose discoveries were also published six years earlier. In 2006, two American scientists won the medicine prize eight years after their work was published.\n\nPrize committee member Juleen Zierath said Gurdon and Yamanaka's discoveries, which also earned them a Lasker award for basic research in 2009, could hold \"immense potential,\" including in developing treatments for Parkinson's disease and in making cells that produce insulin. However, she added that therapeutic implications are still far away.\n\nThe idea of reprograming cells has also been put to work in basic research on disease, through an approach sometimes called \"disease in a dish.\"\n\nThe reprogramming allows scientists to create particular kinds of tissue they want to study, like lung tissue for studying cystic fibrosis, or brain tissue for Huntington's disease. By reprogramming cells from patients with a particular disease, they can create new tissue with the same genetic background, and study it in the lab. That can give new insights into the roots of the problem.\n\nIn addition, that approach allows them to screen drugs in the lab for possible new medicines.\n\nExperts welcomed the announcement, praising the duo for their groundbreaking and influential discoveries in a field riddled with ethical debates.\n\n\"Everyone who works on developmental biology and on the understanding of disease mechanisms will applaud these excellent and clear choices for the Nobel Prizes,\" said John Hardy, professor of Neuroscience at University College London. \"Countless labs' work builds on the breakthroughs they have pioneered.\"\n\nYamanaka deserves extra credit for overcoming fierce objections to the creation of embryos for research, reviving the field, said Julian Savulescu, director of Oxford University's Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.\n\n\"Yamanaka has taken people's ethical concerns seriously about embryo research and modified the trajectory of research into a path that is acceptable for all,\" Savulescu said. \"He deserves not only a Nobel Prize for Medicine, but a Nobel Prize for Ethics.\"\n\nGoran Hansson, the secretary of the prize committee, said he had reached both winners by phone before the announcement. He said they were looking forward to coming to Stockholm to collect the award in a ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.\n\nThe medicine award was the first Nobel Prize to be announced this year. The physics award will be announced Tuesday, followed by chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday and the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.\n\nThe economics prize, which was not among the original awards, but was established by the Swedish central bank in 1968, will be announced on Oct. 15.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/26/asia/north-korea-missile-testing-year-end-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "North Korea's record year of missile testing is putting the world on ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nIn 2020, North Korea conducted four missile tests. In 2021, it doubled that number. In 2022, the isolated nation fired more missiles than any other year on record, at one point launching 23 missiles in a single day.\n\nNorth Korea has fired more than 90 cruise and ballistic missiles so far this year, showing off a range of weapons as experts warn of a potential nuclear test on the horizon.\n\nThough the tests themselves aren’t new, their sheer frequency marks a significant escalation that has put the Pacific region on edge.\n\n“The big thing about 2022 is that the word ‘test’ is no longer appropriate to talk about most North Korean missile launches – they are hardly testing missiles these days,” said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Everything we’ve seen this year suggests that Kim Jong Un is dead serious about using nuclear capabilities early in a conflict if necessary.”\n\nThe attention-grabbing tests also threaten to set off an arms race in Asia, with nearby countries building up their militaries, and the United States promising to defend South Korea and Japan by the “full range of capabilities, including nuclear.”\n\nHere’s a look back at a year of weaponry and warnings – and what could come next.\n\nRamping up missile tests\n\nOf the more than 270 missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea since 1984, more than a quarter came this year, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Missile Defense Project.\n\nOf that total, more than three quarters were recorded after Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, reflecting the dictator’s ambitions – of which he made no secret, vowing in April to develop the country’s nuclear forces at the “highest possible” speed.\n\nThat lofty goal was reflected in a flurry of testing, with North Korea firing missiles on 36 days this year, according to a CNN count.\n\n“For missiles, they set daily, monthly and yearly records,” said Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Asian Studies Center.\n\nThe majority of these tests were cruise and ballistic missiles. Cruise missiles stay inside the Earth’s atmosphere and are maneuverable with control surfaces, like an airplane, while ballistic missiles glide through space before reentering the atmosphere.\n\nPyongyang has also fired surface-to-air missiles and hypersonic missiles.\n\n“North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator of large scale missile forces,” said Panda. He pointed to recent instances where North Korea fired missiles in response to military exercises or diplomatic talks by the US and its regional allies, adding: “Anything that the US and South Korea will do, North Korea can proportionately demonstrate that it has capabilities to keep up as well.”\n\nAmong the ballistic missiles tested was the Hwasong-12, which traveled more than 4,500 kilometers (about 2,800 miles) in October – flying over Japan, the first time North Korea had done so in five years. Another notable missile was the Hwasong-14, with an estimated range of more than 10,000 kilometers (more than 6,200 miles).\n\nTo put those distances in context, the US island territory of Guam is just 3,380 kilometers (2,100 miles) from North Korea.\n\nBut one particular weapon has drawn international attention: the Hwasong-17, North Korea’s most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to date. It could theoretically reach the US mainland – but there are still a lot of unknowns about the missile’s ability to deliver a nuclear payload on target.\n\nNorth Korea claimed to have successfully launched the Hwasong-17 in March for the first time. However, South Korea and US experts believe the test may have actually been an older and less advanced missile.\n\nThe Hwasong-17 was tested again in November, according to North Korean state media, with Kim warning afterward that the country would take “more offensive” action in response to “enemies seeking to destroy peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and region.”\n\nNuclear fears\n\nSince early this year, the US and international observers have been warning that North Korea appears to be preparing for an underground nuclear test – which would be its first since 2017.\n\nSatellite imagery has shown new activity at North Korea’s nuclear test site, where the country has previously conducted six underground nuclear tests. It claimed its most recent test was a hydrogen bomb, the most powerful weapon Pyongyang has ever tested.\n\nThat 2017 nuclear test had an estimated yield of 160 kilotons, a measure for how much energy the explosion releases.\n\nFor comparison, the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in Japan, yielded just 15 and 21 kilotons respectively. The US and Russia have performed the most explosive tests in history, yielding upwards of 10,000 kilotons.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly how many nuclear weapons North Korea possesses. Experts at Federation of American Scientists estimate it may have assembled 20 to 30 nuclear warheads – but its ability to detonate them accurately on the battlefield is unproven.\n\nRising tensions\n\nThough there had once been hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough in 2019 after landmark meetings between Kim and then-US President Donald Trump, those were dashed after both leaders walked away without having struck any formal denuclearization agreements.\n\nUS-North Korea relations have nosedived since then, with Kim in 2021 announcing a sweeping five-year plan for modernizing the North’s military, including developing hypersonic weapons and a nuclear-powered submarine.\n\nThis year is an extension of that vision, with North Korea working toward developing its own strategic nuclear deterrent as well as nuclear options in any conflict on the Korea Peninsula.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons why this year has been so active. Some experts say Kim could have felt empowered to act while the West was preoccupied with the war in Ukraine. Panda, the nuclear expert, added that tensions tend to flare when South Korea has a conservative government – which has been the case since May.\n\nNorth Korea’s aggressive acceleration in weapons testing has sparked alarm in the region, pushing its exposed neighbors – Japan and South Korea – closer to Western partners.\n\nThe US, South Korea and Japan have held a number of joint exercises and fired their own missiles in response to Pyongyang’s tests. The US stepped up its presence in the region, redeploying an aircraft carrier into waters near the peninsula, and sending top-of-the-line stealth fighter aircraft to South Korea for training. Meanwhile, the Quad countries – a grouping of the US, India, Japan and Australia – have deepened military cooperation, with their leaders meeting in May.\n\nA Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force Kawasaki P-1 patrol aircraft fires flares during an International Fleet Review commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force at Sagami Bay on November 6 off Yokosuka, Japan. Issei Katto/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIndividual governments have also taken dramatic action, with Japan saying it will double its defense spending, the pacifist nation’s biggest military buildup since World War II.\n\nBut experts have warned that this rapid militarization could fuel instability across the region. And there’s no clear end in sight; the US and South Korea have more joint exercises planned in the spring, which could propel North Korea to continue firing tests “just to show their displeasure,” said Klingner.\n\nHe added that negotiations are unlikely until Kim has further developed his weapons, when “in his mind, he’d be coming back to the table in a position of strength.”\n\n“Each of the lanes of the road, they’ve been improving their capabilities, both nuclear and missile,” he said. “It’s all very, very worrisome.”", "authors": ["Carlotta Dotto Brad Lendon Jessie Yeung", "Carlotta Dotto", "Brad Lendon", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/energy/2017/11/01/tokamaks-infinite-clean-energy-near/814839001/", "title": "Tokamaks: Is infinite clean energy near?", "text": "Haley Zaremba\n\nOilprice.com\n\nAfter decades of research and planning, a group of scientists in France are attempting to achieve the impossible: harnessing the heavens.\n\nThey are building a tokamak, a donut-shaped, man-made, artificial star that has the potential to bring the universe down to earth and provide millions of years of clean energy. Is this the dawn of a new era, in which we dominate nuclear fusion and solve the energy dilemma for millennia, or is it just a crackpot pipe dream? Every year we seem to be getting closer to the former.\n\nWhile it once seemed impossible that we would be able to create, control, and confine plasma hotter than the sun, the development of tokamaks has created, for the first time, a viable avenue for nuclear fusion. Scientists have already been able to create plasma at the necessary ultra-hot temperatures necessary. Now they just need to refine the process until they can create more energy than is consumed by the process to create the reactions—something that has never yet been achieved, but is growing closer to becoming a reality each year, thanks to international projects like the one currently taking place in France.\n\nThe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the massive tokamak fusion reactor under construction in Southern France, has been internationally funded with $14 billion (a number that will continue to rise) in capital. It’s a combined effort by many nations in the European Union along with the United States, Russia, China, India, Japan and South Korea. The scientists involved anticipate that the groundbreaking machine will make its inaugural run in 2025, 40 years after its inception, which was initiated after a fateful handshake between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985.\n\nMore:Puerto Rico power restoration: Why it is taking so long\n\nMore:Puerto Rico power restoration: Why it is taking so long\n\nMore:Analysts raise oil price forecasts on possibility of supply restriction\n\nThere is a concern, however, that with the new administration in the United States, their annual $400 million contribution may be slashed or stopped altogether thanks to budget cuts and an aversion to investing in renewables. The Energy Collective has reported that President Trump has allotted $63 million for ITER, however, the Senate’s official budget does not publicly account for ITER funding at all.\n\nDespite a new reluctance from the federal government, under past administrations, the U.S. has been on the cutting edge of the technology that could help make the tokamak-based nuclear fusion a reality. Just this month the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have completed new simulations to study the behavior of these plasma bubbles and blobs, giving us a great understanding of how the heat moves and changes within the tokamak.\n\nIn order to fuse hydrogen atoms into helium, tokamaks must maintain the astronomical level of heat of the plasma (the hottest state of matter) they control. This is a particular challenge due to the percolating bubbles that arise and release this vital heat (think of boiling water). In order to function, a tokamak needs to maintain a temperature of around 100 million degrees Celsius.\n\nIn future simulations, the PPPL also plans to study how this behavior changes according to the shape of the tokamak, as well as the effects of density, temperature, and electromagnetic force affect the behavior of the blobs, crucial information in the development of the ITER.\n\nThe UK is also gunning to be a major player in the development of nuclear fusion, and is currently working on designs for their own nuclear fusion power plant. Just this month it was announced that Atkins will partner with Tokamak Energy to create what they hope will be the world’s first fusion facility (although it will be completed more or less at the same time as France’s internationally-funded model) that generates more energy than it consumes. They aim to generate the first electricity by 2025 (the same year as ITER) and commercially viable fusion power by 2030.\n\nDespite our tricky history with nuclear power, fusion holds the most promising (if not the only) viable future for clean and renewable energy worldwide. Despite popular belief, fusion actually holds little danger relative to traditional nuclear power, producing no long-lasting radioactive waste. Working as a complement to wind and solar, nuclear fusion would bring us much, much closer to creating a carbon-neutral planet, a goal that has never been more urgent.\n\nOilprice.com is a USA TODAY content partner offering energy industry news and commentary.

In 1947 the biggest of those was nuclear war. Since then the bulletin has added others, including climate change, bioterrorism, artificial intelligence and the damage done by mis- and disinformation.\n\nWhy is the Doomsday Clock so prominent?\n\nOver the years the clock has been referenced by the White House, the Kremlin and the leadership of many other nations. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein were on the bulletin's Board of Sponsors, and John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon wrote pieces for the magazine.\n\nThough not everyone agrees with the clock's settings, it is generally respected for the questions it asks and for its science-based stance.\n\nDoes the Doomsday Clock always go forward?\n\nThe setting of the clock has jumped forward and back over the past 75 years, depending on world events.\n\nThe furthest from midnight it has ever been was in 1991, when it was set at 17 minutes to midnight after the U.S. and the Soviet Union signed the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, followed by the dissolution of the USSR.\n\n\"People would go to sleep every night worried about were they going to wake up,\" said Daniel Holz, a professor of physics at the University of Chicago and co-chair of the Bulletin's Science and Security Board. \"That threat was definitely reduced at the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe most pessimistic years have been 2021 and 2022, when it was set at 100 seconds to midnight, in part because of global nuclear and political tensions, COVID-19, climate change and the threat of biological weapons.\n\nThe first clock, announced in 1947, was set at 7 minutes to midnight.\n\nWhat will the Doomsday Clock be set to on Jan. 24, 2023?\n\nThe Doomsday Clock will be reset Jan. 24 at 10 a.m. EST in an announcement that will be livestreamed on the bulletin's website.\n\nExactly what time the scientists who make up the board have chosen is a closely held secret.

Nine countries now have nuclear weapons, with the United States and Russia possessing about 90% of the world’s nearly 13,000 weapons.\n\nAt the same time, China’s nuclear arsenal is rapidly increasing, potentially to 1,500 warheads by 2035 (Beijing currently has more than 400). Diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted. U.S.-China relations are at a historic low. Tensions between India and Pakistan – both nuclear-armed countries – and India and China continue to simmer. And North Korea’s nuclear program is advancing.\n\nUnfortunately, public awareness of all these steadily increasing threats is very low, which is why many nuclear experts fear we could be sleepwalking into a nuclear disaster.\n\nToday's nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's nukes\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer played a critical role in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. Two of those weapons were used against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, obliterating both cities and killing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWho was J. Robert Oppenheimer?What to know about atomic bomb physicist's life, career, death\n\nOppenheimer was shaken by the destruction brought by the weapons and the potential for them to inflict even greater destruction in the future. After seeing the first-ever nuclear detonation in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, he reflected that he “knew the world would not be the same” and then recited a line from Hindu scripture: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”\n\nA few years after the end of World War II, Oppenheimer opposed the U.S. government’s plan to develop even larger nuclear weapons called hydrogen bombs, which were created anyway. Today, these kinds of weapons still exist in modern arsenals that include nuclear weapons 80 times more powerful compared with the bomb detonated over Hiroshima, and they have more accurate and survivable delivery systems (missiles, not just bombers) that can fly faster than the speed of sound.\n\nRussia has plans to deploy even more powerful nuclear weapons soon. Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that a strategy of nuclear competition would cause an arms race, and he was right.\n\nUS shouldn't send Ukraine cluster bombs:Biden is wrong to send cluster bombs to Ukraine. 50 years later, they're still killing in Laos.\n\nNo such thing as 'small scale': Nuclear war would impact the entire world\n\nYou might be tempted to think you would be safe if nuclear weapons were used halfway across the globe from your location. Sure, you would be able to avoid the immediate blast effects, but you would experience the after-effects. There is significant evidence that the entire globe could be impacted by even a small-scale nuclear war.\n\nFor example, one study assessed the global effects of a “limited” nuclear war between India and Pakistan, revealing that the fires produced in the conflict would send so much soot into the atmosphere that the sun’s rays would be diminished for years. This would result in reduced global temperatures, which in turn would cause widespread crop failures and worldwide famine, potentially affecting billions of people.\n\nFor many decades, scientists have been warning about this phenomenon, often referred to as “nuclear autumn” or “nuclear winter.”\n\nNo, Christopher Nolan did not detonate a nuclear weapon for 'Oppenheimer'\n\nEven the best in Hollywood wouldn’t have the scientific and technical capabilities to develop, let alone detonate, a real nuclear weapon. But even if they somehow did, it would be illegal.\n\nIn 1963, President John F. Kennedy signed an agreement to ban aboveground and underwater nuclear tests as part of an effort to prevent additional countries from developing nuclear weapons. That agreement is still in effect.\n\nThe United States is also a signatory to a global test ban treaty that, once in full effect, would ban all nuclear explosions anywhere on earth.\n\nSo, no, director Nolan did not detonate a real nuclear weapon in the making of \"Oppenheimer.\" He did not use computer-generated images, either. Instead, he simulated a nuclear explosion using conventional explosives.\n\nThere are many reasons to be grateful that a real nuclear weapon couldn’t be used for the film. Victims of nuclear testing in New Mexico and in native communities across the Southwest and U.S. island territories are still seeking compensation for the very real harm caused by the lasting effects of the Manhattan Project and nuclear testing.\n\nWhen will Ukraine join NATO?Russian military fortifications may hold the answer.\n\nIt is possible to eliminate nuclear weapons once and for all\n\nIn a recent interview with Wired, Nolan stated that those lucky enough to preview his film have been left “devastated” and that the film is almost part of the “horror” genre.\n\nWhile progress on nuclear disarmament has stalled, the world has made significant gains in reducing global stockpiles of nuclear weapons. At their peak, the United States and Russia (then the Soviet Union) had more than 60,000 nuclear weapons between them. Today, they have about 11,000.\n\nObviously, that’s a huge reduction. But we have a long way to go. From Oppenheimer to Barack Obama to Henry Kissinger, politicians and experts from all political persuasions have been convinced that we should fully eliminate nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to humanity.\n\nToday, we have the capability to monitor and control nuclear weapons technologies that didn’t yet exist in Oppenheimer’s time. It’s now possible to create the international control system that Oppenheimer and others advocated for in 1945.\n\nThe first step to elimination is raising public awareness about nuclear threats. We hope that’s exactly what \"Oppenheimer\" will do, and we call on those motivated to speak out after seeing the film to demand that our leaders work toward building a safer, nuclear weapons-free world – now and for future generations.\n\nJoan Rohlfing is the president and COO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit, nonpartisan global security organization focused on reducing nuclear and biological threats.

We look forward to sharing our lessons learned and operations experience with the private sector to help them develop safe, reliable, and cost-effective destinations in space,” said Phil McAlister, director of commercial space at NASA Headquarters in a statement.\n\n“The report we have delivered to Congress describes, in detail, our comprehensive plan for ensuring a smooth transition to commercial destinations after retirement of the International Space Station in 2030.”\n\nSpace graveyard\n\nIn the International Space Station Transition Report, NASA said the plan was for the ISS to fall to Earth in an area known as the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area – also known as Point Nemo. The report said that its budget estimate assumed that the deorbit would happen in January 2031.\n\nNamed after the submarine sailor in Jules Verne’s novel “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,” Point Nemo is the point in the ocean that is farthest from land and has been a watery grave for many other spacecraft.\n\nThe area is approximately 3,000 miles off of New Zealand’s eastern coast and 2,000 miles north of Antarctica and it’s estimated that space-faring nations such as the US, Russia, Japan and European countries have sunk more than 263 pieces of space debris there since 1971.\n\nThe report said the ISS would perform thrusting maneuvers that would ensure “safe atmospheric entry.”\n\nThird decade\n\nThe ISS won’t rest on its laurels for the next eight years. NASA said goals for the next decade including using the ISS as “analog for a Mars transit mission,” according to the report.\n\n“The International Space Station is entering its third and most productive decade as a groundbreaking scientific platform in microgravity,” said Robyn Gatens, director of the International Space Station at NASA Headquarters, said in the statement.\n\n“This third decade is one of results, building on our successful global partnership to verify exploration and human research technologies to support deep space exploration, continue to return medical and environmental benefits to humanity, and lay the groundwork for a commercial future in low-Earth orbit.”\n\n“We look forward to maximizing these returns from the space station through 2030 while planning for transition to commercial space destinations that will follow.”\n\nThe space station has been home to many scientific firsts. The first item to be 3D-printed on the space station occurred in 2014. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA in space for the first time in 2016. And the fifth state of matter, called a Bose-Einstein condensate, was produced in space by NASA’s Cold Atom Lab on the station in 2018.\n\nAstronauts have learned how to grow lettuces and leafy greens in space. The first space-grown salad was sampled by astronauts in 2015. Now, they’re even growing radishes and chilis on the station. This could be used to one day help astronauts grow their own food on deep space missions.\n\nChina, whose astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, launched the first module of its planned space station last year. While not as large as the ISS, the Chinese space station is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year.\n\nRussia has said it will leave the ISS project in 2025 and plans to build its own space station that could launch in 2030.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}]}

He promised not to move toward unifying the two sides of the Taiwan Strait if elected.\n\nA third candidate in the race, Ko Wen-je of the smaller Taiwan People’s Party, or TPP, had drawn the support particularly of young people wanting an alternative to the KMT and DPP, Taiwan’s traditional opposing parties, which have largely taken turns governing since the 1990s. Ko also stated he wanted to speak with Beijing, and that his bottom line would be that Taiwan needs to remain democratic and free.\n\nThe United States, which is bound by its laws to provide Taiwan with the weapons needed to defend itself, pledged support for whichever government emerges, reinforced by the Biden administration’s plans to send an unofficial delegation made up of former senior officials to the island shortly after the election.\n\nBeside the China tensions, domestic issues such as the dearth of affordable housing and stagnating wages have dominated the campaign.\n\nFor Tony Chen, a 74-year-old retiree who voted in Taipei in the hour before the polls closed, the election boiled down to a choice between communism and democracy.\n\n“I hope democracy wins,” he said. He added that more Taiwanese were open to China’s model of governance decades ago, when the Chinese economy was growing by double digits annually, but are repulsed by the crackdown on civil liberties that has occurred under current Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nStacy Chen, 43, said she has always voted for DPP because “Taiwan is an independent country.” She said she wanted her son to grow up in a country that is separate from China.\n\nFor Ben Wang, 44, the vote was more about altering the dynamic between Taiwan’s main opposing parties, the DPP and the KMT. A potential attack by China could not be pre-empted by anything Taiwan would do, he said.\n\nTaiwan’s election is seen as having “real and lasting influence on the geopolitical landscape,” said Gabrielle Reid, associate director with the global intelligence consultancy S-RM.\n\n“The outcome of the vote will ultimately determine the nature of ties with China relative to the West and will have strong bearing on the state of play in the South China Sea,” she said.\n\nBeside the China tensions, domestic issues dominated the campaign, particularly an economy that was estimated to have grown just 1.4% last year.

Olsen\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark − Denmark’s prime minister proclaimed Frederik X as king on Sunday after his mother Queen Margrethe II formally signed her abdication as massive crowds turned out to rejoice in the throne passing from a beloved monarch to her popular son.\n\nMargrethe, 83, is the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Many thousands of people gathered outside the palace where the royal succession was taking place, the mood jubilant as the Nordic nation experienced in first royal succession in more than a half-century, and one not caused by the death of a monarch.\n\nWearing a magenta outfit, Margrethe signed her abdication during a meeting with the Danish Cabinet at the Christiansborg Palace, a vast complex in Copenhagen that houses the Royal Reception Rooms and Royal Stables as well as the Danish Parliament, the prime minister’s office and the Supreme Court.\n\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen next proclaimed Frederik king from the balcony of the palace before thousands of people.\n\nAbdication leaves Denmark with two queens\n\nThe abdication document was presented to Margrethe as she sat at a massive table covered in red cloth around which royals and members of the Danish government were seated. Frederik, who was in a ceremonial military uniform adorned with medals, sat beside her.\n\nAfter signing the document, Margrethe rose and gestured to Frederik to take her place. “God save the king,” she said as she left the room.\n\nThe abdication leaves Denmark with two queens: Margrethe keeps her title while Frederik’s Australian-born wife becomes Queen Mary. Frederik and Mary’s eldest son Christian, 18, has become crown prince and heir to the throne.\n\nChristian handed Margrethe her walking stick as she departed her abdication ceremony.\n\nCiting health issues, Margrethe announced on New Year’s Eve that she would step down, stunning a nation that had expected her to live out her days on the throne, as is tradition in the Danish monarchy. Margrethe underwent major back surgery last February and didn’t return to work until April.\n\nMargrethe's abdication came as a surprise\n\nEven the prime minister was unaware of the queen’s intentions until right before the announcement. Margrethe had informed Frederik and his younger brother Joachim just three days earlier, the Berlingske newspaper wrote, citing the royal palace.\n\nPeople from across Denmark gathered outside parliament. Many swarmed streets decorated with red and white Danish flags. Several shops hung photos of the queen and king-to-be, while city buses were adorned with smaller Danish flags as is customary during royal events. Many others across the kingdom of nearly 6 million people followed a live television broadcast of the historic event.\n\nThe royal guards’ music band made their daily parade through downtown Copenhagen but wore red jackets, instead of their usual black, to mark major events.\n\nCopenhagen resident Rene Jensen, wearing a replica of a royal robe and a bejeweled purple crown on his head, said that he expected Frederik to be “a king for the nation, representing us everywhere.”\n\nThe last time a Danish monarch voluntarily resigned was in 1146 when King Erik III Lam stepped down to enter a monastery. Margrethe abdicated on the same day she ascended the throne following the death of her father, King Frederik IX.\n\nDenmark’s monarchy traces its origins to 10th-century Viking king Gorm the Old, making it the oldest in Europe and one of the oldest in the world. Today the royal family’s duties are largely ceremonial.\n\nAustralians also turned out on the streets of Copenhagen to celebrate one of their own becoming queen.\n\n“I think it’s good that she’s not from royalty and has a normal Australian background. We can relate more to that, because she’s from a middle-class background, and we are, too,” said Judy Langtree, who made the long journey from Brisbane with her daughter to witness the royal event.\n\nA survey − commissioned by Denmark’s public broadcaster DR −published Friday showed that 79% of the 1,037 people polled by the Epinion polling institute said that they believed Frederik was prepared to take the reigns and 83% said they thought his wife Mary was ready to become queen.

It's not totally unusual for icebergs to spin, as two smaller but still massive icebergs had done so similarly on their path north, the British Antarctic Survey said Wednesday.\n\nBut A23a – it's four times the size of New York City, according to Earth.com – began to rotate a bit sooner than other bergs. The iceberg began moving in December, breaking free from the floor of the Weddell Sea near northwestern Antarctica. It had broken off the continent's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, but got stuck on the ocean floor for many years.\n\nMedal mettle:This country has won more than twice as many Olympic medals as any other nation.\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey scientists described A23a's maneuvers as part of its \"spinning era … These dance moves down ‘iceberg alley’ are part of the iceberg’s long, melty journey into warmer waters,\" the team wrote on Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nWhat do we know about the A23a iceberg?\n\nThe iceberg is more than twice the size of Greater London, measuring about 1,500 square miles (about 4,000 square kilometers). It had been apparently drifting for the past year and began picking up speed in late 2023, Andrew Fleming, a remote sensing expert from the British Antarctic Survey, told the BBC in November.\n\n“I asked a couple of colleagues about this, wondering if there was any possible change in shelf water temperatures that might have provoked it, but the consensus is the time had just come,” Fleming told the BBC.\n\nThe iceberg is currently doing its spin \"in a stretch of water between Elephant Island and the South Orkney Islands – small parcels of land at the tip\" of the Antarctic Peninsula, the BBC reported.\n\nOcean and wind currents moved it into the Southern Ocean, and it is expected to continue to move northeast at about 30 miles per hour into “iceberg alley,” toward the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.\n\nAssessing A23a using imagery from NASA satellites using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), the British Antarctic Survey posted that \"there’s not been any major changes to the shape of the berg (though a few smaller fragments are running ahead to the North East).\"\n\nA British research team on the RRS Sir David Attenborough caught up with the iceberg on the way to Antarctica in December 2023. They collected seawater samples around the iceberg’s route to help determine what life could form around it and how the iceberg and others like it impact carbon in the ocean, Laura Taylor, a scientist working on the ship, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"We know that these giant icebergs can provide nutrients to the waters they pass through, creating thriving ecosystems in otherwise less productive areas. What we don’t know is what difference particular icebergs, their scale, and their origins can make to that process,” she said.\n\nSuch research offers not only information about icebergs but also broader global climate implications, Earth.com reported. \"The story of A23a is intrinsically linked to the narrative of global warming. The increasing rate of iceberg calving in Antarctica raises concerns about the stability of ice shelves and the potential for accelerated sea-level rise,\" wrote the site's founder Eric Ralls.\n\nRsearchers: Mega iceberg shows signs of erosion\n\nLast month, EYOS Expeditions arrived at iceberg A23a and used a drone to capture video and found significant erosion and transformation, expedition leader Ian Strachan told Earth.com. \"We saw waves, a good three meters or four meters high, smashing into the berg… These were creating cascades of ice – a constant state of erosion,\" he said.\n\nThe drone footage and images showed how the iceberg was being reshaped with caves and arches, by waves hitting it. Eventually, the top layers will collapse.\n\nMore icebergs\n\nPrevious record-holding icebergs include A68, which measured about 2,240 square miles and broke off northwest Antarctica in July 2017, according to Earth.com. And A76, which measured 1,670 square miles and broke off the Weddell Sea ice shelf in May 2021, but subsequently broke into three pieces, the site said.\n\nThe largest iceberg ever recorded with satellite imagery is B15, which broke from southern Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000, and was 25 miles long and covered 4,250 square miles, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nAs for A23a, the iceberg \"stands as a stark reminder of the Earth’s changing climate and the urgent need to understand and protect our planet’s polar regions,\" Ralls wrote. \"In summary, the story of A23a is not just about a massive chunk of ice. The takeaway here is the interconnectedness of our global environment and the shared responsibility we hold in safeguarding it for future generations.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, an LGBTQ-centered Catholic ministry, told USA TODAY: \"This is the strongest statement of acceptance of LGBTQ people that a church official has made.\"\n\n\"In the church, change happens step by step, and as Catholics around the world become more used to supporting lesbian and gay couples, they and their leaders will soon see that it makes no sense not to recognize and bless these relationships in church.\"\n\nBut he also acknowledges that the Pope could go farther in his support — and, in doing so, could have far-reaching implications beyond the Church.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Catholic view on LGBT people?\n\nFor LGBTQ advocates, Pope Francis' message was not just an endorsement of same-sex civil unions — a stance that he has, indeed, tacitly taken before. It's also approval of same-sex parents having the privilege of raising families.\n\nAlphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement that the Pope is \"making clear that LGBTQ people have a right to their own families.\"\n\nNotably, DeBernardo points out, the Pope used the word \"family\" in his statement — a broader sentiment than just permitting same-sex civil unions and relationships\n\n\"In using the word 'family,' the pope knows he is talking about more than just a couple,\" said DeBernardo, \"otherwise he would have just said 'couple.'\"\n\nThat said, while the Pope supports civil union laws for LGBTQ couples, it is not necessarily an endorsement of same-sex marriage and the rights that come with marriage.\n\nWhat is the difference between a civil union and a marriage?\n\nIn the United States, the key difference between civil unions and marriages is that civil unions are mostly limited to state-level protections.\n\nPrior to Obergefell v. Hodges, which in 2015, guaranteed same-sex marriage nationwide, states that did offer same-sex civil unions — such as Vermont, which was the first state to approve same-sex civil unions in 2000 — generally offered similar legal protections as marriages.\n\nBut their legal rights were significantly restricted at the federal level due to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which ran from 1996 to 2013 when parts of it were declared unconstitutional. For instance, same-sex couples in civil unions were not always able to access the same Social Security or disability benefits as married couple. Legal rights did not always carry over across state lines, either, until the dissolution of DOMA.\n\nWhat has Pope Francis previously said about same-sex couples?\n\nFrancis has a complicated history with the LGBTQ community, specifically on the issue of same-sex marriage. While he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he previously endorsed civil unions for gay couples in lieu of same-sex marriages. Months into his papacy, he was famously quoted as saying: “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?”\n\nHowever, Francis has repeatedly condemned same-sex marriage during his time as Pope — emphasizing the Catholic dictum of marriage remaining between a man and a woman in multiple statements.\n\nHe has supported anti-marriage equality laws in Slovenia and Slovakia, per New Ways. Last year, the Catholic Church issued a document essentially condemning transgender identities and non-heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhat could this mean for LGBTQ legal rights in America?\n\nThe timing of his statement arrives at a critical juncture for LGBTQ rights in the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, two Supreme Court Justices vehemently condemned same-sex marriage in a rebuke of Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nUSA TODAY interview:Both sides of Obergefell v. Hodges join forces to oppose Amy Coney Barrett's nomination\n\nBoth the plaintiff and defendant in that case condemned the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, who has repeatedly been criticized by LGBTQ rights groups as hostile in her dealing with issues pertaining to gay marriage and protections of transgender people.\n\nThe 19th:A more conservative Supreme Court could bring drastic changes for LGBTQ+ Americans\n\n\"We cannot allow her to represent President Trump’s bigotry and bullying at the Supreme Court for decades to come,\" said GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis in a September statement.\n\nCurrently, DeBernardo points out, Fulton vs. City of Philadelphia is on the Supreme Court's docket and will be heard in November.\n\nThe case, focusing on a Catholic foster care agency that receives government funding and was required to serve a gay couple looking to foster a child, will decide whether agencies can discriminate on the basis of religion.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/21"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961388/the-power-of-estonias-same-sex-marriage-law", "title": "The power of Estonia's same-sex marriage law | The Week", "text": "The decision by Estonia’s parliament to legalise same-sex marriage has been hailed as a monumental step forward, finally overcoming a series of obstacles and delays that have hampered progress on the issue.\n\n“Same-sex couples have been able to enter a civil union in Estonia since 2014,” said Al Jazeera. But it has taken until now to close “legal loopholes” to allow gay and lesbian couples the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nLegislation to permit same-sex marriages was passed by 55 votes to 34 in the 101-seat parliament. Despite the closeness of the vote, Estonia has become the first former Soviet country to get such a law over the line – and it will come into effect on 1 January 2024.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought the former Soviet states’ Europe-leaning cultures into sharp focus.\n\nHowever, the road to marriage equality in Estonia has not been a smooth one. When it comes to the rights of LGBTQ+ people, the Baltic states have often been “in Russia’s shadow”, said NBC News.\n\nEstonia is often heralded as a liberal nation, but it still remains “in the lower half of the ranking in legal protections for queer people”, according to LGBTQ+ advocacy group ILGA-Europe, the broadcaster added.\n\nWhile same-sex marriage is “legal in 19 European countries”, said BBC Newsround – with Estonia set to bring this to 20 – this is not the case “in central European countries which were once under communist rule and members of the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact alliance”, Reuters reported.\n\nCritics say Estonia is a nation rooted in its anti-LGBTQ+ past and struggling to move on from the Soviet era. Same-sex relationships were a criminal act, “punishable by up to ten years in prison”, until the law was revoked in May 1992, less than a year after the country declared independence from the collapsing Soviet Union.\n\nEven after this, same-sex couples were subject to discrimination, viewed as “second-class citizens” or “beaten up” due to their orientation, said Estonia World’s Sten Hankewitz.\n\nThis reputation has been difficult for Estonia to shrug off, and there remains resistance to same-sex marriage from some factions of Estonian society, namely those with religious or socially conservative views.\n\nIn May, a conservative think tank backed by 59 public figures asked “the parliament not to change the concept of marriage”, ERR News reported. The petitioners suggested “there is no overriding support for such a change”.\n\nThe Estonian Orthodox Church condemned the decision, saying that “those who claim they are championing ‘freedom and love’ are in fact destroying it”, said Orthodox Christianity.\n\nThe tension does not only apply in Estonia. Its Baltic neighbours Latvia and Lithuania also have same-sex partnership bills currently stuck in their parliaments.\n\nThere has also been backlash across Europe regarding same-sex partnerships, marriage and families. Under Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government in Italy a “crackdown” is taking place, The Times reported. Lesbian mothers raising families in the country “risk being erased from official records and ordered to change the surnames of their children”, said the newspaper.\n\nPoland remains “the worst country to be gay in the EU”, Politico added, “behind Romania and Bulgaria” in the latest ILGA-Europe rankings for rights.\n\nCloser to Estonia, Russia is notorious for its anti-LGBTQ+ stance, and has recently expanded a so-called “gay propaganda law” in place since 2013, which “outlaws all mention of LGBTIQ-related topics in the media”, said openDemocracy.\n\nSome have suggested the latest law change in Estonia could be a reaction to developments in Russia. Social Democrat MP Eduard Odinets said: “Same-sex marriage makes it clear to the Russians that we are not on their side,” CNE News reported.\n\nMore than half (53%) of Estonians support same-sex marriage, according to a recent report from the Estonian Human Rights Centre. This is 6 percentage points higher than it was in 2021, while only 34% of Estonians supported marriage equality in 2012.\n\n“My message [to central European countries] is that it’s a difficult fight,” Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, told Reuters, “but marriage and love is something that you have to promote.”\n\n“It’s like the state is finally accepting me,” Annely Lepamaa, a 46-year-old lesbian, told Reuters. “Until now, I needed to fight for everything. Now, I’m a human with rights.”", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Becca Stanek", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/01/04/mexican-authorities-rescue-abducted-migrants-us-border/72104678007/", "title": "Mexican authorities rescue 31 abducted migrants near US border", "text": "Mexican authorities rescued 31 migrants who were abducted near the U.S. border over the weekend, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nMexican Interior Minister Luisa Alcalde said the migrants were \"rescued safely\" in a post on X, and thanked \"state authorities, the national guard and the armed forces.\"\n\nJesús Ramírez Cuevas, a spokesperson for the Mexican president’s office, confirmed that the 31 migrants who were kidnapped on Saturday in the northern town of Tamaulipas had been rescued.\n\n\"They are already in the hands of the authorities and are undergoing the appropriate medical examinations,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\nPhotos attached to the spokesman's post showed several of the migrants, including woman and children.

On Monday, Fernandez gave the new pope a mate gourd and straw, to hold the traditional Argentine tea that Francis loves, and he gave her a kiss.\n\n\"Never in my life has a pope kissed me!\" Fernandez said afterward.\n\nFernandez called on the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires at his temporary home, the Vatican hotel on the edge of the Vatican gardens, and the two later had lunch together, a day before she and other world leaders attend his installation Mass in St. Peter's Square that some estimates say could bring 1 million people to Rome.\n\nThe Vatican on Monday released details of the Mass, saying it would be a simplified version of the 2005 installation Mass that brought Pope Benedict XVI to the papacy, with many gestures to Eastern rite Catholics and Orthodox Christians in a sign of church unity.\n\nThe Vatican also released details of Francis' coat of arms and official ring, both of which are in keeping with his simple style and harking back to popes past: The coat of arms is the same Jesuit-inspired one he used as archbishop of Buenos Aires, while the ring was once offered to Pope Paul VI, who presided over the second half of the Second Vatican Council, the church meetings that modernized the church.\n\nFrancis will officially receive the ring and the pallium, a woolen stole, during Tuesday's installation Mass, which is drawing six sovereign rulers, 31 heads of state, three princes and 11 heads of government to the Vatican. Fernandez leads the largest delegation with 19 members.\n\nShe and her predecessor and late husband, Nestor Kirchner, defied church teaching to push through a series of measures with popular backing in Argentina, including mandatory sex education in schools, free distribution of contraceptives in public hospitals, and the right for transsexuals to change their official identities on demand. Argentina in 2010 became the first Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriages.\n\nAccording to Francis' authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was politically wise enough to know the church couldn't win a straight-on fight against gay marriage, so he urged his bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead. It wasn't until his proposal was shot down by the bishops' conference that he declared what gay activists called a \"war of God\" on the measure - and the church lost the issue altogether.\n\nFernandez issued a perfunctory message of congratulations when Francis was elected last week, calling the election of the first Latin American pope \"historic\" and saying she hoped that given his namesake, St. Francis of Assisi, the new pope would inspire world leaders to pay greater attention to the poor and pursue dialogue rather than force to resolve disputes.\n\nShe has, however, remained unusually silent about the election on her otherwise prolifically active Twitter account, posting a single tweet on his election day: \"To your Holiness Francis I\" with a link to her letter of congratulations, which wasn't even signed.\n\nTheir chilly relations became crystal clear after the Kirchners several years ago stopped attending the church's annual \"Te Deum\" address challenging society to do better, which is delivered each May 25.\n\nIn last year's address, Bergoglio said Argentina was being harmed by demagoguery, totalitarianism, corruption and efforts to secure unlimited power: a strong message in a country whose president has ruled by decree and left scandals unpunished.\n\nThe Fernandez meeting isn't the only diplomatic dance Francis will be conducting this week as more than 132 government delegations descend on Rome for the Mass formally installing Francis as the 266th leader of the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church.\n\nItalian media say Rome civil protection authorities are planning for upward of 1 million people to attend the Mass, numbers not seen since the beatification of Pope John Paul II in 2011, which drew 1.5 million to St. Peter's and the surrounding streets.\n\nOne significant VIP is the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. His presence at the installation is the first from the Istanbul-based Patriarchate in nearly 1,000 years since the Great Schism divided the church in 1054.\n\nThe Mass will make several gestures toward Eastern rite and Orthodox Christians, with the Gospel being chanted in Greek as opposed to Latin and eastern rite Catholic prelates joining Francis at an initial prayer at the tomb of St. Peter under the basilica's main altar, the Vatican said Monday.\n\nIn all, some 33 Christian delegations will be present, as well as representatives of Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain communities. They will see a simplified Mass compared to the 2005 installation of Pope Benedict XVI, with for example fewer cardinals pledging obedience to the new pope.\n\nAlso arriving in Rome on Monday was Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, a rare European foray for the head of the diplomatically isolated island that underscores the tricky nature of its relations with China and the Vatican.\n\n\"We want to have much better relations with the Vatican and I think we will, thank you,\" Ma said as he arrived. He said Francis was a \"wonderful person. I think he'll do a very good job.\"\n\nTaiwan has full diplomatic relations with only 23 countries, most of them in Latin America, Africa, and the south Pacific. Its only diplomatic ally in Europe is the Vatican, though even that tie remains tenuous.\n\nThe Vatican has long expressed a willingness to transfer its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, which is one of China's conditions. But the real sticking point between the two is who has the authority to appoint bishops. Beijing maintains that right belongs to a Chinese bishops conference, which is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party, while the Vatican insists that authority lies with the pope.\n\nChina has congratulated the new pope on his election, but said that establishing formal relations would depend on the Vatican cutting ties with Taipei and ceasing activities Beijing considers interference in its internal affairs.\n\nZimbabwe President Robert Mugabe also arrived in Rome for the inaugural Mass.\n\nMugabe, 89, is the subject of a travel ban by European nations to protest his human rights record in a decade of political and economic turmoil in his southern African nation, but it does not affect his trips to the Vatican through Italy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/18"}]}

Yet director Sam Mendes believes the 53-year film legacy of James Bond isn’t that different from those of the great characters in history.\n\n“I come from a world where they’ve been doing productions of Richard III for 400 years,” says Mendes, 50. “It doesn’t make the play any less fresh. It’s about the way the world views it and interpreting it for the current generation.”\n\nMendes’ take on the English superspy, and his portrayal by the latest Bond, Daniel Craig, have made 007 more popular than ever. The last Bond film, 2012’s Skyfall, was the first to break $1 billion internationally, and the twosome is back for more with Spectre (in theaters Friday), the next chapter that forges the franchise’s future with a mix of old-school Bond and modern themes.\n\n'Spectre' actresses add spice to spy world\n\nAnd compared to the Bond movies of old — entertaining stand-alone stories with Bond wooing beautiful women, saving the world and looking good doing it — things have gotten downright Shakespearean.\n\nSpectre is the climax of a four-movie saga begun in Craig’s first movie, 2006’s Casino Royale, and continued in 2008's Quantum of Solace. The film digs into Bond’s childhood while having him emotionally affected by the deaths of a love (Eva Green’s Vesper Lynd) as well as a mentor (Judi Dench’s M) and putting him on a collision course with the nefarious organization SPECTRE.\n\nIt’s a rebooted version of the group with an octopus-like sigil that threatened Sean Connery’s Bond in several films starting with 1962’s Dr. No and is headed up by the enigmatic Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz), a mystery man with a chilling confession for Bond: “It was me, James. The author of all your pain.”\n\nCraig, 47, “has been able to unearth some of Bond’s deepest emotional conflicts, and that’s made his portrayal of the character so engaging,” says producer Barbara Broccoli, daughter of original Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli. “He’s brought a lot of humanity to the role, and that’s why the public has responded.”\n\nBond is a global brand but American audiences have embraced the legendary character with gusto, especially in the Craig years, says Rentrak senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Bond is the archetypal guy who “can order the best wine in the house one minute and dispatch many villains in the next,” Dergarabedian says, and the Mendes/Craig duo have done what Christopher Nolan did for Batman, bringing “a certain level of pathos and intelligence that goes beyond this idea of what Bond is and giving him a soul.”\n\nMendes: Bond's 'greater wisdom' in 'Spectre'\n\nPutting aside one-and-done stories and focusing on a continuous narrative that explored Bond’s back story — much of it mined from the Ian Fleming novels of the '50s and '60s — wasn’t an easy choice for Mendes when making Skyfall.\n\n“I was worried the audience would be turned off by the fact that Bond was aging,” the director explains. “There is an acknowledgement of the passing of time, which there had never been in any other Bond movie, really.\n\n“Nobody talks about his age — it’s almost like real time doesn’t exist. They exist in a vacuum, and that’s part of the pleasure of it.”\n\nInstead of finding a resistance from fandom, people got excited “that somewhere buried in an action movie was a meditation on mortality and loss,” Mendes says. Another help: the popularity of the long-form storytelling model on TV and in movies. “You’ve got different chapters of the Bourne story, different chapters of the Dark Knight story, different chapters of the Marvel universe that all interlink, and that that’s not an unusual thing now.”\n\nWhat also needed to mature was Bond himself. The martini-swilling throwback of yesteryear doesn’t work in society anymore, and the tweaking of a sophisticated dinosaur has been the beauty of Craig’s tenure, says Matt Gourley, co-host of the James Bonding podcast.\n\nListen: Sam Smith puts Bond theme in 'Writing'\n\n“Even though this is an action hero, he’s not a role model,” Gourley says. “He’s a sociopath and a horrible misogynist. But at the same time, a lot of the best movies are watching flawed characters. As long as you don’t take it as something you should aspire to be, it’s fun to watch.”\n\nFrench actress Léa Seydoux, who plays Bond’s Spectre love interest, Dr. Madeleine Swann, respects the fact that as 007 fare has gotten darker and dug into the hero’s psychology, “he’s more feminine. He’s more vulnerable and fragile.”\n\nSo her character is also stronger than Bond women of old. Madeleine initially doesn’t want to have anything to do with Bond or his super-secret world, she has no problem yelling at him, and at one point even saves him during a violent train scuffle with monstrous SPECTRE henchman Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista).\n\nHaving Bond pretty much lose a major fight was all Craig’s idea, Bautista says. “He thought it would be great if Bond just for one time gets his (butt) handed to him. It’s something new and different that makes him more interesting. It gives people a reason to root for him.”\n\nMendes wanted to give 007 bigger-picture obstacles to tackle, too. The main plot of Skyfall — which revolved around Britain’s MI6 being attacked and having its secret agents exposed to the world — reflected the real-world presence of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, and Spectre is a post-Edward Snowden movie where a government honcho (Andrew Scott) seeks to dismantle the “double-0” program and instead use drones and high-tech surveillance to spy around the globe.\n\n“We can’t pretend anymore that MI5 and MI6 are unquestionably the good guys in the way that you could when Bond was at the height of the Cold War,” Mendes says. “The general public — myself included — feel that they are actually spying on us, not just people who deserve to be spied on. … Bond is the old-school way of doing things and represents the man who needs to be on the ground and to look someone in the eye before making a life-and-death call.\"\n\nWatch a behind-the-scenes look at all the action in 'Spectre'\n\nIncluding those types of themes are just as important as the escapism and the fantasy, the filmmaker adds. “You’re trying to make it in some way kind of a commentary on a contemporary world at the same time as taking people on a thrilling ride. That is a balance that I feel the best Bond movies are able to strike.”\n\nIt’s certainly a different time than 20 years ago when Broccoli recalls they were about to make Pierce Brosnan’s first Bond film, GoldenEye. “People were saying: ‘The world has changed. It’s a safe place now. The Berlin Wall has crumbled. Is Bond relevant?’ And we sure learned after that that the world is indeed not a safer place and there is an increased need for people like James Bond.”\n\nBond has become a part of so many people’s lives that, in a way, he’s almost like an American president: Sometime during an actor’s tenure, fans start wondering who’ll play 007 next. And everybody has an opinion about it.\n\nIdris Elba, for one, is a favorite to be the next version of the hero in some corners of the Internet, and Bond novelist Anthony Horowitz caused a ruckus in September by saying he’d be “too street.” Craig has caused even more fancasting when he recently said in an interview with the U.K.’s Time Out magazine he’d rather “slit his wrists” than play Bond again. “I’m over it at the moment. All I want to do is move on.”\n\nProducer Michael G. Wilson, who has been a part of every Bond film since 1979’s Moonraker, definitely wants Mendes and Craig back for another but allows that “everybody feels like they own the character because it is part of the culture. They feel they have a personal stake in the decisions that are being made.”\n\nThe 7 shadiest moments from Daniel Craig's 'Spectre' press tour\n\nSeydoux, 30, says that to remain relevant, 007 has to change with the times: “It would be good to have a black Bond or a homosexual Bond.” Dergarabedian agrees: “Bond has never been that revolutionary, but he’s evolutionary. It’s more about staying true to what that character is essentially all about and not a narrow-minded idea about what the casting should be.”\n\nMendes tends to cut himself off from “the white noise” that surrounds the blockbuster franchise. For him, Bond is a torch passed between generations who can go anywhere that someone with an imagination wants to take him.\n\n“Any one actor can play Hamlet, and it will be an exciting and different take, but Hamlet will still survive. One feels that way about Bond,” Mendes says. “That’s not to say that Daniel hasn’t been and isn’t a special and brilliant Bond, but it’s not the only Bond out there.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/09/movie-addict-spectre-mixes-bonds-past-past-bonds/76741718/", "title": "Movie addict: 'Spectre' mixes Bond's past, past Bonds", "text": "Melissa King\n\nmeking@stcloudtimes.com\n\nThe opening sequence of the latest James Bond flick seems to have been taken straight from the playbook of Orson Welles and his famous introductory shot in “A Touch of Evil.”\n\nThe planning and timing required to execute that vision is remarkable, and the unveiling of “Spectre” is no different.\n\nThe phrase “The dead are alive” flashes onscreen, and we’re thrown into a parade in Mexico City. Everyone is in costume, and the floats all have some association with skeletons. There’s drumming and dancing; it’s loud and packed with bodies.\n\nThe camera floats down into the crowd (of 1,500 extras, according to CinemaBlend), weaving its way to one attentive parade-goer and his lady friend, and following the two as they make their way through the horde, into a hotel, up the stairs, onto an elevator and through the doorway of room 327.\n\nAs he slips off his mask, we see it’s Bond (Daniel Craig, crafty and cool as ever) – and it becomes obvious this midday escapade isn’t what it seems.\n\nAnd it’s all one lengthy, fluid take that continues as we follow Bond out the window and along the building’s ledge.\n\nThe camera glides in for close ups and pulls away again, twisting and spinning, showing us the surroundings while always keeping 007 in its flutter-free frame.\n\nHe adjusts his earpiece and readies his carbine conversion Glock 17, and he does it all so naturally and methodically; we understand that he’s no stranger to this mission.\n\nThe narrative progression is effortless and intimate with its flow, and it looks so cool.\n\nI was hoping the entire movie would adhere to the continuous shot approach, a la Alejandro Inarritu’s seemingly seamless “Birdman,” which landed the director Oscar gold.\n\nSeriously, how cool would that be?\n\nBut with the type of action scenes that are synonymous with James Bond and the quick edits necessary to heighten their suspense, there’d just be no way to make it happen. Damn.\n\nAnd a couple of those high-octane series follow on the heels of this opening run, including one unbelievably realistic, epic tussle inside and outside of an airborne helicopter that’ll have your stomach doing flips and your heart pounding out of your chest.\n\nWith scenes like this even before the opening credits — accompanied by the film’s signature tune from Sam Smith — director Sam Mendes surely intends for “Spectre” to pack a bigger punch than its predecessor, 2012’s “Skyfall.”\n\nHere, again, Bond embarks on lavish globetrotting quests — to places such as Italy, Austria, Morocco — on this sort of scavenger hunt, collecting and linking together names and info and hints from his past to uncover a mysterious group — and its historically wicked leader (Christoph Waltz; no one effects devious villainy better, am I right?)\n\nThere’s also a beefy scoundrel, Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista), who meddles in Bond’s affairs — and KICKS. HIS. ASS. Hinx is the giant gnat who’s always one step ahead. Dude utters a single word throughout the entire film, but his actions speak volumes.\n\nBond must do his sniffing around under the table, as it were; M (Ralph Fiennes) has Bond on a short leash after ordering him “grounded… from all operations — indefinitely!” Whoops.\n\nOnce again, Bond’s antics (justified, but that’s irrelevant) have muddied the waters above which the Double-O program is trying to keep its collective head; pesky newcomer Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott) — or “C” as Bond acerbically refers to him — is looking to bring “British Intelligence out of the dark ages — and into the light.”\n\nThat’s code for shutting it down altogether. He and the shiny new Centre for National Security intend to implement a world surveillance plan called Nine Eyes that would negate the need to have human agents in the field.\n\nFortunately, Bond has a couple of people he can trust to help him out while keeping their mouths shut, and it’s nice to see them get meatier roles in this installment.\n\nMoneypenny (Naomie Harris) does the digging as 007’s right-hand woman. I love that she gets him, that she plays his game and can reciprocate his sauciness; that she asks no questions because she knows that whatever it is Bond is up to is legit, and she understands that he’s “just getting started.”\n\nAnd then there’s Q (Ben Whishaw), with his mild-mannered expression, his unsuspecting nature and his whip-smart techie prowess. Poor guy’s always caught in a tug-of-war between M and Bond — his boss and his friend; the only thing trumping his brain is his devout loyalty.\n\nHaving seen the new film a number of times (last count: three) allows for the focus on smaller details beyond plot that hold just as much importance.\n\nThe suspicion in solitude — Bond living in sparse desolation, Q operating out of a cave-like substructure, Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) wasting away in a hidden basement; the inundation of all things black and white — offsetting, playing up or otherwise representing the proverbial good versus evil theme that’s ever-present in these films; the extensive use of shadows to increase mystery, most unmistakable in our introduction to Waltz's character.\n\nAnd the symbolism. Get outta here! The subtle placement of that chess board is no accident. And the single-word title; it’s an acronym in 007 world, sure, but the definition itself? C’mon. That’s probably why all the shadows.\n\nClever.\n\n“Spectre” is the fourth Bond film in which Craig stars; this tetralogy pulls in lots of names and other elements from “Casino Royale,” “Quantum of Solace” and “Skyfall” (if you’re paying attention, you may catch a glimpse of M’s porcelain British bulldog), so at the very least it’d be wise to brush up on the last few Bond films if you’ve forgotten or are unfamiliar. It’ll fill in the blanks and help tie things together.\n\nOr just watch them again because they’re awesome.\n\nThere’s also mention of a certain Persian cat-stroking villain from 007 films that predate Daniel Craig’s reign; however, these Craig-era films supposedly reset both the series and Bond’s background, so this technically should be where it all starts, right? It’s a complex circle that’ll blow your mind.\n\n“Spectre” doesn’t entirely wrap up every loose end, leaving the door open for a potential continuation from here.\n\nI’ll be curious to see if that happens in Craig’s fifth (and final? Sad face) go-round as Bond or if the next film takes a different route altogether — and possibly with a different actor.\n\nThis is the opinion of news assistant and movie addict Melissa King.

The production, starring Spacey as a ruler who out-tyrannizes even Cards' Frank Underwood, then traveled to 12 cities around the world.\n\nThat journey is documented in Now: In the Wings on a World Stage (out Friday at select theaters, and available for download at nowthefilm.com). The film marks the feature debut of Jeremy Whelehan, a frequent assistant director at the Old Vic and an associate producer of Spacey's 2004 Bobby Darin biopic Beyond the Sea.\n\nWhelehan follows Spacey, Mendes and the rest of the company — composed of British and American actors, as part of The Bridge Project, which Mendes and Spacey forged with Brooklyn Academy of Music executive producer Joe Melillo — to nine of their destinations. Venues range from Greece's 2,500-year-old Epidaurus to Beijing's state-of-the-art National Centre for the Performing Arts, and there's footage of the cast and crew in rehearsal and hanging out together.\n\n\"We did become very much a family,\" Spacey notes, discussing the film after a screening at the Juilliard School in Lincoln Center. \"Friendships were made that have lasted. Two of the actors ended up playing roles in House of Cards, actually\" — Nathan Darrow, cast as Secret Service agent Edward Meechum, and Jeremy Bobb, who appeared as journalist Nick Henslow.\n\nThe ensemble also includes noted actors such as Gemma Jones (the Harry Potter film franchise) and Haydn Gwynne (Billy Elliot the Musical). \"I'm very pleased that in the film you get to meet members of the company who aren't famous — journeyman actors who are the heart and blood of living theater,\" says Spacey, 54.\n\nHe adds, \"I suppose that's why I wanted to make the film — for people who would say to me, 'Why (do) theater? Why go to the Old Vic?' The best analogy I seem to have found is comparing it to tennis, If you play tennis eight times a week, yes, it's the same rules, but it's a different game every time you're on that court.

This awards season has spread the love around, giving every major film contender a time to shine and every person in an Oscar pool a chance to chew on his or her nails.\n\nThrowing other wrenches into the works: Best picture is voted on through a preferential ballot, where academy members rank their choices rather than just pick one winner, plus a voting body that is slowly getting younger and more diverse every year.\n\nBest picture:15 films that didn't deserve the Oscar – and the ones that should have won instead\n\nOscar tally: Here are the films and actors leading the race\n\nWhile one movie hasn’t risen to rule them all quite yet, some have been left in the dust. The racing drama \"Ford v Ferrari\" may win some technical awards but that's it, the best chances for coming-of-age adaptation \"Little Women\" and divorce drama \"Marriage Story\" are in the screenplay categories, and the World War II satire \"Jojo Rabbit\" looms as a dark horse with key guild nominations but has yet to make a splash this season.\n\nHere are the five, though, with the right resumes to conquer the best-picture race on Oscar night:\n\n‘1917’\n\nThe closest thing to a favorite is director Sam Mendes’ World War I thriller, about two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) racing to deliver orders in time to save 1,600 fellow military men. The film has had big wins at the Directors Guild Awards and Producers Guild Awards, the latter a strong predictor for the Oscars: The PGA honoree has gone on to win best picture 21 out of 30 times, including the past two years with “The Shape of Water” and “Green Book.” Also in its favor is a Golden Globe victory for best drama and an impressive box office, scoring $104 million with only a few weeks of nationwide release. One troublesome statistic remains: “1917” doesn’t have an acting nomination, and only 11 films in Oscar history – most recently “Slumdog Millionaire” in 2009 – have won best picture without one.\n\n‘Parasite’\n\nThe Oscars have gone 91 years without awarding the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' highest honor to a foreign-language film, so history is not exactly on the side of South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho’s acclaimed black comedy about class and social inequality. There is real love in the industry for “Parasite,” however, evidenced by the crowd eruption when it snagged a surprise win for outstanding ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. With actors being the largest voting bloc in the academy, the victory – plus an honor for best drama given by the American Cinema Editors – gives “Parasite” momentum going forward, though like “1917,” it also has the problem of no Oscar acting nominations.\n\n‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s star-packed Tinseltown fable – one that intertwines the lives of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), his steely stuntman (Brad Pitt) and the Manson Family – has been a favorite among movie lovers ever since its summer release. “Once Upon a Time” won best comedy at the Golden Globes and best picture at the Critics' Choice Awards, it’s a strong contender in the 10 Oscar categories where it’s nominated (Pitt’s pretty much a lock for supporting actor and Tarantino has a good shot at original screenplay), and the Academy Awards since their inception have always adored movies about Hollywood. This one has it right in the title.\n\n‘The Irishman’\n\nMartin Scorsese’s Netflix gangster epic came into Oscars like a heavyweight, but like “A Star Is Born” last year, is starting to look like an also-ran. The film, which tracks World War II veteran and Mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) over multiple bloody decades, received widespread critical acclaim but has lost out on every major honor so far. Still, don’t count out “The Irishman” yet: Crime dramas tend to do well at the Oscars (Scorsese’s “The Departed” marked his first and only best picture in 2007), Netflix put a lot of horses behind its campaign, everyone involved is a Hollywood favorite – not only Scorsese and De Niro, but also supporting-actor nominees Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – and it could benefit from the preferential ballot if it's the second or third choice for a majority of voters.\n\n‘Joker’\n\nOf course the Oscars’ biggest wild card is the one with the iconic comic-book supervillain. Joaquin Phoenix seems destined to win best actor for his unnerving transformation from mentally unstable outcast to face-painted nihilist in Todd Phillips’ psychological thriller origin story. The film's chances for best picture aren’t as good as in other categories – such as original score and hair/makeup – but “Joker” leads with the most Oscar nominations (11 total). Like \"Irishman,\" it might also be helped by the preferential ballot, plus the controversial \"Joker\" has made enough money ($334.6 million domestically, $1.1 billion worldwide) that it can’t be ignored.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/09/15/oscar-watch-hustlers-joker-rising-film-fest-faves/2303687001/", "title": "Oscar watch! 'Hustlers,' 'Joker' and other film-fest faves on the rise", "text": "Is “Ford v Ferrari” in the driver’s seat for an Oscar run? Or might “Joker” have the last laugh?\n\nIt’s still a ways to go before the 92nd Academy Awards (airing live Feb. 9 on ABC) but Venice International Film Festival and Toronto Film Festival have started to propel some contenders out in front of others.\n\nWhat do we know so far? Well, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s black comedy “Parasite” seems like this year’s \"Roma,\" a foreign-film favorite that could get a best picture nod. There’s no overpowering “A Star Is Born” that looks like a monster, though we all remember how last year’s A-list musical ultimately drowned in the “Shallow” end. And Taika Waititi's subversive World War II satire \"Jojo Rabbit\" is for real after winning the Toronto people's choice award – an Oscar bellwether for best picture.\n\nRanked:All the best films we saw at Toronto Film Festival (including 'Joker')\n\nWinner! Taika Waititi's WWII satire 'Jojo Rabbit' takes Toronto Film Festival people's choice award\n\nAlso, this year’s best actor category is going to be nuts, with overdue thespians such as Eddie Murphy (“Dolemite Is My Name”) and Antonio Banderas (“Pain and Glory”) jockeying for slots with up-and-comers (“Just Mercy” star Michael B. Jordan) and usual suspects (Leonardo DiCaprio in “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood”) alike.\n\nAnd we haven’t even seen all the heavyweights yet: Martin Scorsese’s much-anticipated Netflix gangster epic “The Irishman” debuts at New York Film Festival later this month, while the all-star female-fronted “Little Women” and Sam Mendes World War I drama “1917” (starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth) will arrive around Christmas.\n\nWhile Oscar watchers wait patiently for those, here are six festival films that are already making some noise:\n\n'Little Women':Meryl Streep calls upcoming adaptation a 'masterpiece'\n\nWhy so serious, Oscar?5 reasons why Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' is a bona fide awards threat\n\n‘A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood’\n\nTom Hanks is an Oscar fave – five best actor nominations, two wins – and Mr. Rogers is a timeless kids’ TV icon, so that’s a match just made for award season. The qualities that make director Marielle Heller’s super-sweet movie (in theaters Nov. 22) switched up from the usual biopic – the overall meta vibe, plus it’s not really about Mr. Rogers – will help in terms of a possible best picture nomination, and Hanks seems like a lock for a supporting nod with a spot-on performance.\n\n‘Ford v Ferrari’\n\nThe Toronto world premiere of James Mangold’s 1960s-set racing drama (in theaters Nov. 15) revved up the crowd, receiving a rapturous response, so best picture seems likely. The biggest question with this is where its main stars go: As car designer Carroll Shelby, Matt Damon seems like the lead, though Christian Bale (playing driver Ken Miles) is the emotional center and could garner a best actor nomination. A possibility for supporting actor: scene-stealing Tracy Letts as formidable automobile magnate Henry Ford II.\n\n‘Hustlers’\n\nCould a stripper crime dramedy (in theaters now) storm the Oscars? You bet, with Jennifer Lopez earning some of her best reviews ever as the ringleader of a group of women who fleece their rich Wall Street clients. She’s likely to be nominated in either best actress or supporting actress, depending on how she’s pushed. And with the Academy moving in a more populist direction, a best picture nod isn’t a stretch if the box office lives up to the crowd-pleasing film’s critical acclaim.\n\n‘Joker’\n\nEven with a bunch of competition, Joaquin Phoenix’s gripping and disturbing turn as the title character is as good a lock for a best actor nod as you’ll get right now. (He’s also long overdue for a win, after earning three previous acting nods.) Not as sure a thing: a best picture nomination. “Joker” (in theaters Oct. 4) won the Golden Lion as well as glowing reviews out of Venice, though reviews were more tempered in Toronto, given the dark and polarizing subject matter. Again, chances will be helped if this very different comic-book movie is a commercial hit.\n\n‘Marriage Story’\n\nThe most all-around adored festival hit so far is also the most emotional: Noah Baumbach’s Netflix drama (in select theaters Nov. 6, streaming Dec. 6) about a young couple navigating a heated divorce and custody battle has shades of a modern “Kramer vs. Kramer.” A best picture nomination appears to be in the future, exceptional turns by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson make them favorites in the two lead acting categories, and Laura Dern seems primed for a supporting actress slot as a tough divorce lawyer.\n\n‘The Two Popes’\n\nIf Netflix backs three horses this awards season, this entertaining and extremely well-acted dramedy (in theaters Nov. 27, streaming Dec. 20) could be a holy dark horse. Historical figures at its center – Popes Benedict (Anthony Hopkins) and Francis (Jonathan Pryce) – help its best picture chances, as does its exploration of various issues within the Catholic Church in affable fashion. Also, the fact it's an acting master class gives a boost to Pryce as a best actor candidate and Hopkins for supporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2012/11/06/bond-girls-harris-marlohe/1685685/", "title": "Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe double up for 007", "text": "Donna Freydkin, USA TODAY\n\nNaomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe join the ranks of Bond girls\n\nHarris, a theater veteran, imbues her Eve with fearlessness and bravado\n\nMarlohe, who cut her teeth in French TV, romances Daniel Craig's 007\n\nNEW YORK — Naomie Harris is personable, eloquent and very, very pretty, with dewy skin and legs longer than the West Side Highway. But her physical attributes aren't why she wound up secretly smitten with James Bond in the latest film, Skyfall.\n\n\"I was never cast for hotness. I was cast because they wanted to create this specific character. The hotness factor was never a part of the audition process. All my costumes were practical for a woman in the field,\" says Harris. \"The sexiness of Eve comes out through her wit and intelligence, rather than her wearing slinky dresses.\"\n\nAs a field agent with a crush on 007 (Daniel Craig), Harris, 36, gets stirred and shaken aplenty. And along with Bérénice Marlohe, the French actress who toys with the British secret service agent in Skyfall, Harris — on paper, at least — joins the ranks of such mythically fanciful Bond girls as Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), May Day (Grace Jones) and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).\n\nBut not so fast. Both actresses say they the wanted the roles because they were substantial, as opposed to merely sensuously superficial, as some have been in years past.\n\nFor Marlohe, 33, \"it was very important to get rid of this 'Bond girl' title. It's very abstract, and you can't build anything on that. It was important to create a real human being and a real person and a real story in the real world. It's what makes her modern,\" she says.\n\nIndeed, director Sam Mendes cast both women precisely because they're earthy, as opposed to otherworldly.\n\n\"I was trying to create as much as possible characters that weren't at all what they first appeared,\" says Mendes. \"Traditionally, there are two Bond girls — one is homespun, if you will, and one is exotic. It's a tough one. You have to work hard to give the women in the movie a journey. They are expected, just like gadgets and beautiful locations are expected, to be part of the film. I was helped in that by having two calm and independent women. They are low-key. They are very bright. They don't make a fuss. That immediately endeared them to everyone on set.\"\n\nIn person, both women exude intelligence and confidence. Harris graduated from Cambridge and studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, breaking through internationally in Danny Boyle's 2002 zombie flick, 28 Days Later. Marlohe plays the piano and studied at the French arts school Conservatoire de Paris for a decade.\n\nBut Marlohe could, perhaps, work on her comic timing. She says that when she met with Mendes, she cracked a bad joke about not being interested in the part, her first in a major international production.\n\n\"I was afraid he would take that as me not wanting the job. But he understood. I was extremely happy and peaceful,\" she says of getting the role of Sévérine.\n\nAnd satiated. Mendes confirms Marlohe's claim that she can chow down like a lumberjack. \"She has an enormous appetite. She eats constantly.She is unspoiled and un-actressy. She makes no fuss. I teased her about the fact that she had no qualms about going in when the food came around,\" says the director.\n\nFilm Naomie vs. real Naomie\n\nAs for Harris? \"She gets the award for the biggest discrepancy between what you see on-screen and off-screen. She's very gentle and loving and a bit of a ditherer in life. On-screen, she's the reverse: confident and active,\" says Mendes. \"Naomie has earned her spurs in movies. I saw her in Danny's movie 28 Days Later and later on stage in his production of Frankenstein. I called him up and asked if she was nice.He told me that she's delightful. She's an amazing, balanced, calm girl. I had to cast someone who was a match for Bond.\"\n\nThis time, Harris' Eve goes on a journey that makes for a surprising conclusion in the film. Her character isn't your typical Bond vixen: She's fearless, yes, but also a little hapless as an agent and more comfortable being a desk jockey.\n\n\"When I was cast, they said they wanted to have a modern Bond girl and wanted to take the character in a new direction. They wanted her to be an equal to Bond. So I felt I had a lot of scope, a lot of room, to create the character,\" says Harris. \"You really felt that you were free to create a character in any way you wanted. It's the most freedom I ever felt. That's one of the reasons the franchise survives so well. It's what they enable you to do.\"\n\nNot 'arm candy' anymore\n\nAccording to Michael G. Wilson, who has produced Bond films since 1979's Moonraker, Andress emerging from the water in Dr. No established the iconic image of the quintessential bombshell Bond girl. Since then, there have been hits and misses. The high point? Green as Vesper Lynd, who cracks Bond's heart wide open.\n\n\"Over the years, when you had wonderful women playing the parts, the leading roles were always quite interesting. Probably around the time of Octopussy, it got to be arm candy,\" says Wilson. \"There were some times we didn't cast it too well. You have to admit that. In the last few films, we've tried to get away from arm candy. I think the women and the roles written for them are getting better and more challenging. We have to get actresses who can do the job. Sophie Marceau came along in The World Is Not Enough, and she was great. Eva Green in Casino Royale was just spectacular.\"\n\nThe current Bond ladies aren't sure what's ahead for them. They're adjusting to the attention being lavished on them, courtesy of the film, and the seemingly endless press responsibilities that come with being in it. Marlohe hopes Skyfall leads to more American film roles.\n\n\"As an actress, I felt way more confident on seeing such talented actors working because they are so able and they're not afraid to question themselves. Being around them made me feel more confident,\" she says of sharing screen time with Craig and Javier Bardem, who plays the film's villain.\n\nAnd Harris loved being able to delve into her more adventurous side by playing Eve. \"I always think of myself as someone who runs away from danger. She runs into it, and she loves it,\" she says. \"I had to do a lot of physical stuff. It was two months of training before we started. I normally don't do any exercise at all. I was having to exercise five days a week, two hours a day. I did combat and yoga and running. I was covered in bruises. In the beginning, it was hell, and then you get through the pain barrier and you start enjoying it. You feel more alive.\"\n\nSo is she still a gym rat? \"It's done. It was so easy when I had this trainer wake me up in the mornings. Now I would have to do that to myself and I can't. The bed's too cozy.\"\n\nEve could probably relate.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/07/javier-bardem-silva-skyfall/1686189/", "title": "Javier Bardem gets in Bond's head as 'Skyfall' villain", "text": "Bryan Alexander, USA TODAY\n\nBardem's Bond villain has a unique haircut, making it Bardem's second bizarrely coiffed bad guy\n\nBardem on Silva: \"\"He definitely thinks he's the most beautiful man in the world\"\n\nDirector Mendes \"wanted Silva to sort of be a throwback to the slightly more theatrical Bond villains of the 1960s\"\n\nWhen Javier Bardem was a young actor in Spain, he had a powerful dream in which all of the characters he had portrayed were in the same room. Yet they had nothing to say to one another because they had so little in common.\n\nIt's a surreal concept that still motivates the 43-year-old Oscar winner, though he concedes that the idea of his growing list of characters never sharing traits is \"impossible, of course.\"\n\n\"But chasing that idea is what gives me ...,\" Bardem says, struggling for the proper English, \"what's the word? Inspired. It gives me hunger. It's my goal. I try to bring people to the screen that didn't exist before. When I see actors that do that, I go, 'Wow.' \"\n\nAn international wave of moviegoers and critics has already been wowed by Bardem's newest addition to the room: the menacing yet quirky villain opposite Daniel Craig's James Bond in Skyfall, opening in U.S. theaters Thursday at midnight.\n\nThe battle between the two has propelled the much-awaited 23rd edition of the Bond franchise to already staggering heights. After a four-year wait since 2008'sQuantum of Solace (while production stalled due to MGM Studios' financial woes), the classic British series returns with born-again energy while celebrating an honorary 50th anniversary. Skyfall already has grossed $287 million overseas and looks ready to break franchise records when it opens here.\n\nBardem's next reunion of his characters will definitely take a turn for the very weird, given the nature of his Skyfall creation, Raoul Silva. He's a way-out-there cyberterrorist who shows the same menace and odd hair as the bowl-cut psychotic hit man Anton Chigurh, whom Bardem portrayed in 2007's No Country for Old Men — a role that earned him a supporting-actor Oscar.\n\nBut the freakishly blond Silva has an outsized presence, not to mention a great retro wardrobe, worthy of a classic Bond villain.\n\n\"The guy is really, really confident about himself in a weird way,\" says Bardem. \"He definitely thinks he's the most beautiful man in the world.\n\n\"You have to work on two different levels,\" he adds. \"One is to make him as real as possible. And the other is to fly a little bit higher than the rest of the characters. You are allowed to do that. Because that is what people are expecting to see when you play a Bond villain, especially since the films are turning 50 years.\"\n\nIt's just what Bond fans want in a baddie, says Bill Desowitz, author of James Bond Unmasked. \"Silva is right there with the classic villains Dr. No and Goldfinger as far as fun flamboyance. He's someone who you can really have fun with. But you still very much feel the threat.\"\n\nDirector Sam Mendes says that when he was brought on board to direct Skyfall with the looming anniversary, he wanted to pay tribute to films like the original Bond, 1962's Dr. No. \"I wanted Silva to sort of be a throwback to the slightly more theatrical Bond villains of the 1960s. I thought, 'Who would I most want to see playing a Bond villain?' It took me about me about 10 seconds to come up with Javier.\"\n\nMendes instructed the team of screenwriters to create with Bardem in mind as they constructed a tale involving a former agent bent on revenge against Bond's MI5 boss, M (Judi Dench), who Silva believes betrayed him in the field.\n\n\"The part really was crafted for Javier,\" says Mendes. \"It wasn't much more complicated than that.\"\n\nSilva's role is also central to the story, even if he physically does not appear until a powerful interrogation scene with Bond exactly midway in the film. \"It's a very slow build to the entrance,'' says Mendes. \"We tantalize the audience.\"\n\nOn paper, the self-deprecating Bardem might the last person who should have been cast for the tech-savvy freak. One big red flag: Bardem says he is so bad with computers that pretending to look competent in front of a computer keyboard was a bigger challenge than perfecting the long stretches of English dialogue for the part.\n\n\"Cyberterrorism — I don't know what that means myself,\" says Bardem. \"Because I basically cannot send an e-mail. That's like a whole different world to me. I'm so behind the technology these days. It's kind of scary. That's why Sam put the camera behind me when I was at the computer.''\n\nSecond red flag: Bardem also shows a marked lack of interest in firearms, which are pretty key with villains in general — especially in Skyfall when Silva's hunt for Bond and M intensifies into an on-the-ground manhunt.\n\n\"I'm lost in that, too,\" Bardem says, conceding that he didn't recognize the kind of gun he was given. \"I didn't even know what mine was called. For the most part, I just put in some earplugs and just shoot.\"\n\nBut Mendes knew as soon as Bardem appeared in full Silva attire for his screen test that he had his villain.\n\n\"We rolled camera, he looked into the lens, and he was this character. He didn't even open his mouth,\" says Mendes. \"It was shocking and amazing all at the same time.\"\n\nFrench actress Bérénice Marlohe, whose alluring character warns Bond about the deepest fear that Silva is capable of instilling, says Bardem earns that compliment. \"He managed to combine this ability to be highly unpredictable — like his life is not directed by any rules — but at the same time, you can feel his humanity. It makes him even more evil.\"\n\nLongtime Bond producer Barbara Broccoli says Bardem pumps life into the character. \"When Silva is evil, he makes your skin crawl. But Javier is also so sexy and attractive.''\n\nBardem says Silva's greatest weapon is \"uncomfortableness.\"\n\nThis is very much on display in the sexually charged first encounter, in which the seated and bound Bond is teased close-up by Silva, who even (gasp!) touches the eternally macho agent's chest.\n\n\"You can feel that energy in the scene. The camera captures that strange, slightly unhinged quality,\" says Mendes. \"They got the giggles a couple of times, particularly when Silva starts undoing Bond's shirt.\"\n\nDespite the overt sexual overtones, Bardem says the scene is more about a poker game between the two adversaries.\n\n\"I bet, (then) he bets stronger,\" says Bardem. \"I'm trying to dismantle him, and he's trying to dismantle me. Within that, everything is allowed.\"\n\nAs to whether Silva is truly attracted to Craig's Bond or just playing the game, Bardem doesn't show his cards.\n\n\"Everyone will have their own opinion. My interpretation? Silva is a man who is really not attached to anything or anybody. And not to any label. In other words, he's there to really move forward with his plan.\"\n\nAnd is Silva seeking more serious relations with Bond? \"Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. That's the question the audience has to answer.\"\n\nThere are some mysteries about Silva that are revealed in Skyfall, including the reasons for his outlandish attire. Mendes makes clear that the strange coif — however different — will cause some to think Bardem is harking back to his No Country for Old Men character.\n\n\"(Silva's hair) is completely a character choice, not an actor choice,\" says Mendes. \"It wasn't 'how can I make this different from the last thing I played?' \"\n\nBardem won't say whether it's a wig or dye job — \"that's a 007 secret.\" But he doesn't see the wild hair as any more or less important than any other feature for his character.\n\n\"Hair is part of the physicality as much as the eyes, the hands and the ears,\" he says. \"It's not something I'm obsessed about or married to.\"\n\nNor does he buy into the idea that playing villains is more enjoyable than other types of characters. After all, he has earned rave reviews for roles as diverse as a quadriplegic seeking the right to die (2004's The Sea Inside) to a love-besotted artist in Woody Allen's 2008 romantic comedy, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, in which Bardem starred alongside future wife Penelope Cruz. (They wed in 2010). He'll next appear as a soul-searching priest in Terrence Malick'sTo the Wonder, due in April.\n\n\"As long as there's a human being behind the character, with some kind of conflict, as we all have, then it's interesting to play anyone, whether it's a villain, good guy, bald, long hair, tall or short,\" says Bardem.\n\nIt all goes back to the characters in Bardem's imaginary room. But should Skyfall's Silva and No Country's Chigurh, who famously used to flip a coin to determine the fate of his victims, ever meet in one of his dreams, they would have at least one thing in common.\n\n\"Maybe they could have a chat about their hairstyles for a second. I think Silva has a strong sense of humor, so he would make fun of Chigurh's hair. And I guess Chigurh would not like that at all. And he would flip a coin. I don't know what happens after that.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/02/09/new-films-see-this-week-magic-mike-last-dance-sharper/11199386002/", "title": "New films to see this week: 'Magic Mike's Last Dance,' 'Sharper'", "text": "With the Super Bowl upon us, Channing Tatum is busting out all the right moves.\n\nThis weekend, Salma Hayek joins Tatum for a third \"Magic Mike\" to close out the female-friendly dance-flick trilogy.

While bartending, Mike meets wealthy socialite Max (Hayek) and one sensual, gravity-defying, strip-teasing lap dance later, they're off to London, where Max hires the Magic One to recruit male strippers for the saucy revamp of an outdated play.

His best pal Debbie (Witherspoon) is an LA single mom. When she gets a chance to take an important class in Manhattan, they switch homes and lives – with Peter taking care of her teen son (Wesley Kimmel) – and learn a bunch about the other.

Chances are, as one lieutenant reminds them, they won’t make it.\n\nAs I watched that movie, battling my own vertigo all the way, I considered the thought that sometimes we need to be reminded of what courage looks like.\n\nMore Lowry:In Trump's world, it is liberty for some and ‘anguish for the rest’\n\nEditorial:Trump impeachment trial turned into mockery at the end\n\nTravel ban:Trump travel ban adds 6 more countries, draws worry from U.S. residents with family abroad\n\nI was reminded of it again this week, as the Senate took its final votes to “acquit” President Donald Trump on two articles of impeachment — abuse of power and obstruction of justice.\n\nI was reminded in stands taken and votes cast in favor by two men, in particular: Sen. Mitt Romney, Republican from Utah, who described Trump’s conduct as “grievously wrong,” and Sen. Doug Jones, Democrat from Alabama, who will now almost certainly lose his seat in that “red” state come fall.\n\nTrump, in his ever-so-thuggish way, has already taken to verbally attacking Romney for being the only principled Republican to break ranks, and indeed the first U.S. senator in history to vote to convict a president from his own party of impeachment.\n\n“I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me,” said Romney, who voted to convict only on the abuse of power charge.\n\nAs for Jones, he was a hero long before he took an oath to serve in what was once known as the most deliberative parliamentary body in the world, and long before he cast his votes to convict Trump on both charges.\n\nIndeed, while serving as a U.S. attorney in Alabama in 2001 and 2002, Jones brought to justice two white men, Ku Klux Klan members Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, for their roles in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four little black girls.\n\nJones has looked straight into the eye of pure evil, without blinking, so we know something of his heart.\n\n“Senators are elected to make tough choices,” Jones said. “We are required to study the facts of each issue before us and exercise our independent judgment in keeping with the oaths we take.”\n\nLater, in his own speech on the Senate floor, Jones said Trump’s actions “were more than simply inappropriate. They were an abuse of power.”\n\nTwo other moderate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, also stuck to their principles and voted to convict despite possible political repercussions back home.\n\nSo yes, before we close this chapter in history, let us preserve the names for posterity: Romney, Jones, Manchin and Sinema.\n\nThree Democrats, one Republican. When everything was on the line, they voted their conscience, placing principle over political convenience, putting institution over personal welfare.\n\nThey stood up for the best ideals this nation can offer, and in so doing have reminded us, once more, what courage looks like.\n\nBruce Lowry is the opinion editor for NorthJersey.com.

You can't keep him away from it,\" Miller says. Teaming with her old robotic frenemy (Schwarzenegger) and a futuristic super-soldier (Davis) against a state-of-the-art new Terminator (Gabriel Luna). Sarah is a \"much darker\" warrior this time around, Miller adds. \"If you knew Linda, light and fluffy is not what she wants to do.\"\n\n‘Marriage Story’ (Nov. 6)\n\nStars: Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and Laura Dern\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nThe skinny: With shades of \"Kramer vs. Kramer,\" the dramedy (streaming on Netflix Dec. 6) centers on the relationship breakdown and increasingly nasty divorce between a New York stage director (Driver) and an actress (Johansson) who relocates their 8-year-old son (Azhy Robertson) to LA. Driver and Johansson \"revealed so much of themselves and the performances are so personal. They're my words, but they feel so of them,\" says Baumbach, a child of divorce who later went through one himself. \"I found myself actually moved in ways that I haven't felt as a director making a movie before.\"\n\n‘Doctor Sleep’ (Nov. 8)\n\nStars: Ewan McGregor, Kyliegh Curran and Rebecca Ferguson\n\nDirector: Mike Flanagan\n\nThe skinny: Stephen King's \"The Shining\" sequel returns a grown-up Danny Torrance (McGregor) to the Overlook Hotel, which spawned a lifetime of nightmares that drove him to suppress his psychic powers with drugs and alcohol. He gets sober, though, and helps a youngster with the \"shine\" escape a gang of psychic vampires, though their journey takes them to that infamous snowy locale. Danny \"realizes that this is also part of his growth,\" McGregor says. \"It's quite interesting to step back from the actual plot and look at it as somebody's path from addiction into recovery.\"\n\n‘Charlie’s Angels’ (Nov. 15)\n\nStars: Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska\n\nDirector: Elizabeth Banks\n\nThe skinny: With her new team of awesome secret agents – scientist Elena (Scott), ex-MI6 agent Jane (Balinska) and wild child Sabina (Stewart) – Banks celebrates the '70s \"Angels\" show and the 2000s movies but also wants to break from modern female superhero fare with a story \"about women who don't have supernatural ability, but who just have grit and stamina and training and sisterhood.\" Banks' priority was recruiting an inclusive girl group that \"the audience wants to hang out with,\" she says. \"Part of why you love these movies is that sense of sorority that everyone feels.\"\n\n‘Ford v Ferrari’ (Nov. 15)\n\nStars: Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\nThe skinny: In the car-racing drama, automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Damon) and British driver Ken Miles (Bale) are hired by Ford to develop a car that will beat rival Ferrari at the 1966 Le Mans. Mangold thought of them as \"brothers\" who have thoughtful meals together but also a fight involving fisticuffs and a loaf of bread. \"They're not really trying to break each other's noses. It may have been Jason Bourne and Batman, but that's not who they were in this movie,\" Mangold says. \"They're playing that really unique dance of where we roughhouse with each other but there's a bond inside it all.\"\n\n‘A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood’ (Nov. 22)\n\nStars: Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys and Chris Cooper\n\nDirector: Marielle Heller\n\nThe skinny: Hanks inhabits the iconic Fred Rogers in the drama about a troubled journalist (Rhys) assigned a story on the children's television legend. In addition to donning eyebrows, a wig and that red sweater, Hanks had a breakthrough into his portrayal while watching \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\": \"I probably was about seven hours into it when I said, 'Oh, this is not for us.' If you know how the world works, this show was not for you because it's meant to be an explanation about how odd the world can be and yet how wondrous at the same time. That's not anybody who's above the age of 8 or 9.\"\n\n‘Frozen 2’ (Nov. 22)\n\nStars: Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell and Josh Gad\n\nDirectors: Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck\n\nThe skinny: A mystery is afoot in the animated musical sequel, as Elsa (Menzel) seeks the origins of her magical powers, but everything, from characters to songs, have matured in the follow-up to the 2013 hit. Buck views Elsa, Anna (Bell), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and snowman Olaf (Gad) as if they \"just graduated college. So now what? The world is wide open.\" Lee adds that \"Frozen 2\" revisits the theme of love vs. fear from the original: \"What's the day after 'happily ever after' look like? Usually, it means changes come and it affects your relationships. Change is a big part of life and it's a big part of their lives.\"\n\n‘Knives Out’ (Nov. 27)\n\nStars: Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis and Chris Evans\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nThe skinny: When a successful crime novelist (Christopher Plummer) is found dead after his 85th birthday party, an eccentric Southern-fried detective (Craig) is called in to investigate the matter and the old man's oddball relatives. Johnson's modern spin on the murder mystery features twisted tropes, Hitchcockian elements and a darkly comic side.\n\n\"How do you put the engine of a thriller into a whodunit so that it carries you through with a little more momentum than just clue-gathering and still has all the pleasures of the setup and the payoff,\" says Johnson, a lifelong Agatha Christie junkie.\n\n‘Jumanji: The Next Level’ (Dec. 13)\n\nStars: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black\n\nDirector: Jake Kasdan\n\nThe skinny: A rescue mission is on the itinerary for the sequel, which features Johnson, Hart, Black and Karen Gillan as characters in a dangerous video game world. This time, the real-world personalities swap avatars, the action sequences are bigger and more elaborate (speedy ostriches! attacking monkeys!) and \"the combination of those things gave us a chance to wake up all of it,\" Kasdan says. The rules of \"Jumanji\" are still the same, though the main characters \"find that in fact it's a new sort of playing field and they are actually no more prepared than they were the first time.\"\n\n‘Bombshell’ (Dec. 20)\n\nStars: Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie\n\nDirector: Jay Roach\n\nThe skinny: \"Bombshell\" follows how the women at Fox News, including Megyn Kelly (Theron) and Gretchen Carlson (Kidman), took down sexually abusive media mogul Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). But it also digs into how lesser-known employees – symbolized by fictionalized character Kayla Pospisil (Robbie) – dealt with Ailes’ “almost cult-like requirement for loyalty,” Roach says. The underlying question of this story “is will women speak up for each other in a world where they're actually almost required to attack each other if somebody dares question the male-driven sense of entitlement?”\n\n'Cats' (Dec. 20)\n\nStars: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba and Jennifer Hudson\n\nDirector: Tom Hooper\n\nThe skinny: The popular (and idiosyncratic) stage musical, about Jellicle cats who make the choice of which feline persona will be reborn into a new life, is coming to the big screen with an \"enhanced\" story and more than just Swifties in mind. \"The intention is to satisfy all of the legions of global fans the show already has and open it up to a new family audience,\" says producer Eric Fellner. \"You can take a beloved musical score and story, and when you put it under the camera rather than a proscenium arch, it makes everything that much more immediate and that much more exciting.\"\n\n‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ (Dec. 20)\n\nStars: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac\n\nDirector: J.J. Abrams\n\nThe skinny: \"Everything has led to this moment,\" Boyega teases about the new film, which wraps up the current \"Star Wars\" trilogy \"in a nice, red bow\" and also finishes off the 42-year Skywalker saga. Boyega's Stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn is back with his friends in \"Rise of Skywalker,\" and since 2015's \"The Force Awakens,\" he's felt his character needed \"to eventually find his place and to have a team that he’s fighting for\" without losing his strong personality along the way. \"I wanted to show him in a light that shows growth and more of an understanding of his world and of the people in it.\"\n\n‘Little Women’ (Dec. 25)\n\nStars: Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh and Meryl Streep\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nThe skinny: Louisa May Alcott's coming-of-age classic was read to Gerwig at such a young age that \"I don't remember a time\" when Jo March (Ronan) and her sisters weren't a part of her inner life, the filmmaker says. Unlike the book, Gerwig shows the Marches as adults first, with flashbacks to childhood \"to walk with their younger selves.\" But her version emphasizes Alcott's themes of financial inequality: \"Women have always had difficulty making money, certainly in the 19th century. And this is the conversation we're still having now. That felt urgent to me.\"\n\n‘1917’ (Dec. 25)\n\nStars: George MacKay, Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nThe skinny: Loosely based on a story Mendes' grandfather told him when the filmmaker was a boy, \"1917\" is more thriller than World War I combat movie, with two young British soldiers (MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) having to deliver a message before a 1,600-men battalion walks into a deadly trap. Filmed to be one continuous shot, the drama shows \"the human costs of the war viewed through these two men in this one particular journey in time on this one day,\" Mendes says. \"That idea conveyed the size and the destruction of World War I perhaps better than trying to do the whole thing.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/24"}]}

Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism.

The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said.

Ron DeSantis claimed credit for the stunt, which took the migrants from Texas, not Florida, and left them without planning on the street.\n\nHis stunt may have been outdone by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who started sending buses of migrants to Washington, DC, back in April and on Thursday morning, left asylum-seekers outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ house at the US Naval Observatory. She’s under intense criticism from immigration hawks for saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that she was confident the border is “secure.”\n\nMany rightly pointed out that the political point came at the expense of vulnerable migrants who had already been through a tremendously arduous journey – but some of the details of the transport may surprise you. For starters, many of the migrants were appreciative of the ride.\n\nAre these migrants in the country illegally?\n\nThese stunts by Republican governors are built on the false idea that the migrants are in the country illegally. Technically, those on the buses and planes are asylum-seekers who have been processed by federal immigration authorities and are awaiting court dates.\n\nWhere are the migrants coming from?\n\nWhile most of these migrants crossed the border with Mexico, they are fleeing poor economies and dangerous situations at home in Central America and, increasingly, South America. After crossing the border and claiming asylum, they are released in the US to wait for hearings on their asylum claim.\n\nRELATED: A ‘radical shift’ at the border is making things tougher for Biden\n\nOne person left in Massachusetts, a 45-year-old named Leonel, told The New York Times about his three-month journey from Venezuela through Colombia and Central America. He tried more than once to cross the US border with Mexico before being detained and then released in San Antonio.\n\nIt was there that he was approached and asked if he wanted to go to Massachusetts. It’s not clear if he knew he was headed to a wealthy island community unprepared for the arrivals.\n\nAre they being forced on the buses and planes? No, they are not\n\nAnger at the stunts is in part also fed by the idea that the people are being forced onto buses. That is not true, as CNN’s Gary Tuchman found when he visited a shelter in Eagle Pass, Texas, in August.\n\nHe met asylum-seekers planning to meet up with family and friends already spread around the country. Other migrants coming to the US without somewhere to go were happy for the free trip.\n\nWho is happy for the ride? These people have incredible stories\n\nTuchman talked to a 28-year-old woman named Genesis Figueroa from Venezuela who traveled for a month and a half by foot, bus and boat to get to Eagle Pass with her husband.\n\n“I got very tired. My legs hurt and I got sick,” she told Tuchman in Spanish. “I came down with pneumonia. I was hospitalized for three days in Guatemala.” Watch Tuchman’s report.\n\nHe also talked to cousins traveling from Venezuela; one man’s brother died during the journey after disappearing while they crossed the Rio Grande.\n\nNearly 750 migrants are known to have died at the southern border since October 2021, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently reported.\n\n“We left in search of a dream, but now it’s a very difficult, hard situation,” Luis Pulido told Tuchman in Spanish. He was going to get on a DC-bound bus, hoping to get off in Kentucky to be met by relatives before moving toward Chicago.\n\nWhat happens after the bus ride?\n\nA week after their bus trip, Tuchman found Pulido and his cousin in Chicago, where they had met up with relatives, were sheltered in a small, shared apartment and were looking for work in a restaurant. They likely can’t legally work for at least 180 days, according to rules posted on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.\n\nWatch Tuchman’s follow-up.\n\nTuchman told me Pulido and his cousin went to their first appointments, but it was mostly administrative and they are waiting for their next appearance.\n\nIt takes a long time to get a work permit\n\nGetting a work permit can take up to a year, New York City officials told CNN’s Polo Sandoval, who also reported on this issue last month.\n\nHe went to a shelter in Brooklyn and met a young couple from Venezuela, Anabel and Crisman Urbaez, who are seeking asylum.\n\nThey showed him cellphone videos from their two-month, 10-country trek, often on foot, which started in Peru and continued through jungles in Colombia and the Darien Gap linking South and Central America – all with their 6- and 9-year-olds and their dog Max.\n\nHow long does it take to settle an immigration case?\n\nIt takes years. The average time to complete an immigration case is 1,110 days, according to data maintained by Syracuse University. During that time, migrants and asylum-seekers start to build American lives.\n\nHow many will be granted asylum?\n\nLess than half of asylum applications have been granted in recent years, according to Syracuse.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the rate of denial was over 70%, but during the first year of the Biden administration the grant rate grew to nearly 40%.\n\nWhy are so many coming from Venezuela?\n\nAlvarez wrote recently about the mass exodus from Venezuela. The United Nations says similar numbers of people are fleeing the South American country – which has suffered from years of political repression and economic unrest – as war-torn Ukraine. Around 6.8 million Venezuelans are part of this diaspora.\n\nHow many people have crossed the border this year?\n\nThere have been nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection so far in the fiscal year that ends September 30.\n\nSome of those encounters are repeat crossers. Others have been turned away under a Trump-era Covid-19 policy the Biden administration has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to end. A fraction are seeking asylum.\n\nWhy are officials declaring states of emergency?\n\nOfficials in New York City, Illinois and Washington, DC, have declared emergencies to deal with the buses, and they have complained they have no idea when or where to expect them, and they want warning from Texas, Arizona and now Florida.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million and bused around 9,000 migrants up north.\n\nOverall, the buses and now planes have moved thousands of migrants, but it’s a small fraction of the nearly 700,000 pending asylum applications slowly working through the justice system.\n\nThese stories are all unique, but so many of them share the theme of fleeing a home without opportunity and being comparatively happy for the trip inside the US from the border.", "authors": ["Zachary B. Wolf"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/economy/immigration-jobs/index.html", "title": "America needs immigrants to solve its labor shortage | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nImmigration has long been a political football in the United States. But If you’re wondering why America’s labor shortage persists nearly three years into the Covid pandemic, it’s in part because America doesn’t have enough immigrants.\n\nImmigrants are vital to the US economy and fill thousands of US jobs – jobs many Americas don’t want to do. In 2020, the processing of legal immigrant worker visas stopped and only picked up towards the end of 2021.\n\nAnd by the end of last year there were close to 2 million fewer working-age immigrants in the United States than there would have been if pre-pandemic immigration continued unchanged, according to new research from the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Part of the reason why there are so many vacancies and unfilled jobs in the US is that we are missing a whole lot of immigrants who regularly were coming before Covid,” said Giovanni Peri, the author of the UC Davis research and Director of the Global Migration Center.\n\nThe immigration debate has been reignited because of a surge at the US-Mexico Border. In March 2020, President Trump invoked Title 42 – a law enacted during the pandemic to prevent the spread of Covid – that has kept migrants and would-be asylum seekers out of the country.\n\nAsylum seekers are legally able to work in the United States while they await their asylum cases. During that waiting period, those seeking asylum can apply for work permits — a process that usually takes 180 days before they are authorized.\n\nBut the decrease in legal immigration over the last two years has hurt American businesses. Especially in industries that require lower skilled labor: construction, agriculture, and hospitality.\n\n“We don’t make up the losses unless we really change immigration laws and we allow more people every year to come in,” said Peri. “The way in which we are catching up is that we are processing visas at the speed that it was done before Covid. So for a while there will be this gap.”\n\nThe lack of available workers has pushed wages higher – fueling higher inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that in addition to an aging workforce there is a lack of foreign labor contributing to labor shortages.\n\n“The combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about one-and-a-half million missing workers,” said Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve last month.\n\nThe ‘big impact’\n\nThe biggest impact comes to industries like construction, agriculture, and especially hospitality – which are reliant on immigrant workers. Those types of industries had higher rates of unfilled jobs last year – adding to existing labor shortages, according to UC Davis research. There are currently 10.3 million open jobs in the US – 377,000 in construction and 1.6 million in hospitality. That number has been on the rise in recent months.\n\n“The hospitality [sector] was employing a very large number of immigrants, 30%- 40% of the labor force in that sector was foreign born. And so you’re missing a lot of them, and potentially that is a big impact,” said Peri.\n\nThe restaurant industry has borne the brunt of the downturn in immigration. Slower service, restaurants closed for lunch, higher prices – are all a result of labor shortages. And the restaurant industry is on track to grow by 14% in the next decade – while the US-born workforce is expected to grow by just 10%, according to the National Restaurant Association. There will be more restaurant jobs than the US workforce can fill. Sixty percent of restaurant operators are facing staffing shortages limiting their operating capacity, according to National Restaurant Association.\n\nBut a new piece of legislation, “The Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act,” was introduced in the House earlier this year. The law would create a new visa program for workers in industries like hospitality.\n\n“Immigration reform is an economic necessity for the restaurant industry,” said Sean Kennedy, EVP of Public Affairs at the National Restaurant Association. “Allowing more legal immigration would be a win-win for employers in desperate need of employees and individuals seeking new opportunity.”\n\n“Skilled” workers\n\nAbout 1 million of the 2 million potential immigrants who were lost during the pandemic were college educated, according to the UC Davis research. These workers would be considered “high-skilled workers,” potentially coming to the US on H-1B specialty visas.\n\nThose high-skilled workers are job multipliers. For each high-skilled worker – 2.5 additional jobs are created, according to a report by UC Berkeley.\n\n“High skilled immigration is incredibly important,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group. “We shouldn’t think of it as something that addresses short-term shortages – although it can help – but something that is really important for long run: innovation, productivity, growth, and health of the economy.”\n\nEarlier this month, the American Farm Bureau Federation, along with 350 other agricultural groups, called on the Senate to pass an agricultural reform bill already passed by the House to address the farm labor crisis. Skilled foreign farm workers are the backbone of US agriculture and are traditionally in the US on H-2A seasonal visas, which saw its highest ever utilization rate this year, according to the Farm Bureau. But many in agriculture says it’s not enough and they still can’t find workers.\n\n“The farm labor crisis is hindering production and contributing to food price inflation. We must address this workforce crisis threatening farms across the United States so our producers can continue to feed, clothe, and fuel our nation,” the letter to Senate leadership read.\n\nBut, according to the Department of Labor, 317,000 temporary H-2A jobs were certified last year, more than six times the number in 2005. But only 80% of those jobs certified resulted in a visa.", "authors": ["Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/politics/texas-far-right-politics-invs/index.html", "title": "How two Texas megadonors have turbocharged the state's far-right ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGun owners allowed to carry handguns without permits or training.

Women forced to drive hours out-of-state to access abortion.\n\nThis is Texas now: While the Lone Star State has long been a bastion of Republican politics, new laws and policies have taken Texas further to the right in recent years than it has been in decades.\n\nElected officials and political observers in the state say a major factor in the transformation can be traced back to West Texas. Two billionaire oil and fracking magnates from the region, Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks, have quietly bankrolled some of Texas’ most far-right political candidates – helping reshape the state’s Republican Party in their worldview.\n\nOver the last decade, Dunn and his wife, Terri, have contributed more than $18 million to state candidates and political action committees, while Wilks and his wife, Jo Ann, have given more than $11 million, putting them among the top donors in the state.\n\nTim Dunn is seen during a National Network for Safe Communities conference in 2015. (From National Network for Safe Communities) From National Network for Safe Communities\n\nThe beneficiaries of the energy tycoons’ combined spending include the farthest-right members of the legislature and authors of the most high-profile conservative bills passed in recent years, according to a CNN analysis of Texas Ethics Commission data. Dunn and Wilks also hold sway over the state’s legislative agenda through a network of non-profits and advocacy groups that push conservative policy issues.\n\nCritics, and even some former associates, say that Dunn and Wilks demand loyalty from the candidates they back, punishing even deeply conservative legislators who cross them by bankrolling primary challengers. Kel Seliger, a longtime Republican state senator from Amarillo who has clashed with the billionaires, said their influence has made Austin feel a little like Moscow.\n\n“It is a Russian-style oligarchy, pure and simple,” Seliger said. “Really, really wealthy people who are willing to spend a lot of money to get policy made the way they want it – and they get it.”\n\nIn this Dec. 29, 2015, file photo, Farris Wilks watches U.S. Senator and then-presidential candidate Ted Cruz deliver remarks in Cisco, Texas. Ronald W. Erdrich/AP\n\nDragged to the ‘hard right’\n\nDunn and Wilks did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In past interviews and opinion pieces, Dunn has argued that his political spending is focused on making Texas’ state government more accountable to its voters, while Wilks has described his donations as aimed at electing principled conservative leaders.\n\nFormer associates of Dunn and Wilks who spoke to CNN said the billionaires are both especially focused on education issues, and their ultimate goal is to replace public education with private, Christian schooling. Wilks is a pastor at the church his father founded, and Dunn preaches at the church his family attends. In their sermons, they paint a picture of a nation under siege from liberal ideas.\n\n“The cornerstones of our government are crumbling and starting to come apart,” Wilks declared in a 2014 sermon at his insular church, the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day. “And it’s because of the lack of morality, the lack of belief in our heavenly Father.”\n\nTexas’ far-right shift has national implications: The candidates Dunn and Wilks have supported have turned the state legislature into a laboratory for far-right policy that’s starting to gain traction across the US.\n\nThe Texas State Capitol is seen on the first day of the 87th Legislature's third special session on September 20, 2021 in Austin, Texas. Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images\n\nDunn and Wilks have been less successful in the 2022 primary elections than in past years: Almost all of the GOP legislative incumbents opposed by Defend Texas Liberty, a political action committee primarily funded by the duo, won their primaries this spring, and the group spent millions of dollars supporting a far-right opponent to Gov. Greg Abbott who lost by a wide margin.\n\nBut experts say the billionaires’ recent struggles are in part a symptom of their past success: Many of the candidates they’re challenging from the right, from Abbott down, have embraced more and more conservative positions, on issues from transgender rights to guns to voting.\n\n“They dragged all the moderate candidates to the hard right in order to keep from losing,” said Bud Kennedy, a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper who’s covered 18 sessions of the Texas legislature.\n\n“I don’t think regular Texans are as conservative as their elected officials,” Kennedy said. “The reason that Texas has moved to the right is because the money’s there.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Donors with influence on Texas politics 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPolitical investments paying off\n\nOver the last decade, many of the most conservative bills in the Texas legislature, on topics from LGBT rights to guns to private school vouchers, were killed by the moderate Republicans who held sway in the state House. That changed last year, thanks to people like Valoree Swanson.\n\nSwanson was a Sunday school teacher and political activist when she challenged a 14-year incumbent Republican, Debbie Riddle, in 2016 in a district covering Houston’s Republican-dominated northern suburbs.\n\nSwanson, who ran to Riddle’s right, shocked political observers by outraising the incumbent – an unusual feat for a first-time candidate. Her largest donor: Empower Texans, a political action committee created by Dunn and largely funded by him and Wilks. She defeated Riddle in the Republican primary by more than 10 percentage points and went on to easily win the general election.\n\nLast year, Swanson won a major legislative victory: She authored the transgender sports bill, which blocks trans students from playing on K-12 school sports teams that aren’t aligned with their genders at birth. While other bills about transgender issues had failed in previous years, the sports bill was approved by a legislature now firmly controlled by the GOP’s right flank after the moderate former House speaker retired. Observers saw it as a validation of the billionaires’ early investments in Swanson’s first campaign, paying off years later.\n\n“They’re effectively investing their money and they’re moving the needle on policy in Austin,” said Scott Braddock, the editor of Quorum Report, a publication that’s been covering the legislature for decades, referring to Dunn and Wilks. “These are extreme people investing a lot of money in our politics to reshape Texas, such that it matches up with their vision.”\n\nDemonstrators gather on the steps to the State Capitol to speak against transgender-related legislation being considered in the Texas Senate and Texas House, May 20, 2021, in Austin, Texas. Eric Gay/AP\n\nSwanson is hardly an outlier: All 18 of the current Republican members of the Texas Senate, and almost half of the Republican members of the Texas House, have taken at least some money from Dunn, Wilks or organizations that they fund. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton have also been major beneficiaries of the billionaires’ spending.\n\nTexas is one of just 10 states that allow individuals to make unlimited contributions to state political candidates, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures – letting Dunn and Wilks have more influence than they might elsewhere in the country.\n\nWhile Dunn and Wilks focus on state politics, they’ve also gotten involved in national races. Wilks, his brother Dan and their wives were among the largest donors to super PACs supporting GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016, contributing a total of $15 million. And Dunn has given millions of dollars to super PACs supporting former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in recent years.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Cruz called the Wilks brothers “the epitome of the American dream” and “fearless champions of conservative causes, much to the consternation of the corrupt corporate media.”\n\nSo far in 2022, Dunn’s and Wilks’ political investments haven’t been as successful as in past years. Defend Texas Liberty, the group they fund, gave more than $3 million to Don Huffines, a former state senator who challenged Abbott in his Republican primary and won just 12% of the vote. Despite his loss, experts pointed out, over the course of the campaign Abbott embraced some of the positions Huffines had staked out, including strong opposition to transgender rights and support for deploying National Guard members to the US-Mexican border.\n\nDefend Texas Liberty’s second-largest beneficiary this year has been Shelley Luther, an unsuccessful far-right legislative candidate who attracted national attention after she was arrested for refusing to shut down her Dallas hair salon to comply with coronavirus restrictions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Luther – who proposed banning Chinese students from Texas universities and declared she is “not comfortable with the transgenders” – said that Dunn and Wilks had been integral to her campaign.\n\n“Without them, I couldn’t have even run,” Luther said. But she added that the spending wouldn’t have given the billionaires influence over her votes or decisions: “He wants me to do what I say that I represent,” she said of Dunn.\n\nEnforcing the ‘law of the jungle’\n\nThe Texas Highway Patrol stands in front of pro-life demonstrators as pro-choice supporters leave the Capitol in Austin, Texas, on Saturday May 14, 2022.

They also fund a network of organizations that have been influential at boosting conservative causes.\n\nTexans for Fiscal Responsibility, a non-profit chaired by Dunn, has released a “Fiscal Responsibility Index” each legislative session grading state lawmakers based on their stances on conservative bills. The scorecard, which is often cited in election ads that show up in voters’ mailboxes, is known in Texas political circles for its ability to make and break Republican primary campaigns.\n\n“If you don’t show up well on the scorecard, you’re going to have a lot of money spent against you,” Seliger said.\n\nTexas Republicans say that even a deeply conservative record doesn’t protect someone from a primary challenge funded by Dunn, Wilks and groups they bankroll.\n\nState Sen. Bob Deuell had won elections for years in his northeast Texas district and racked up a conservative record – including co-authoring a 2013 abortion bill that was considered among the strictest in the country at the time, and was struck down by the US Supreme Court.\n\nBut in 2013, Deuell, a doctor, supported a bill that overhauled Texas’ end-of-life procedures. Texas Right to Life, a group whose largest donor over its history is Wilks, falsely claimed the bill would “strengthen Texas’ death panels.” The following year, Deuell was challenged by Bob Hall, a tea party activist.\n\nBob Deuell speaks to CNN's Ed Lavandera in Greenville, Texas on February 23, 2022. CNN\n\nTexas Right to Life spent more than $150,000 on mailers, voter guides and political consultants for Hall and other candidates in 2014, airing a barrage of ads claiming Deuell had “turned his back on life and on disabled patients.” Hall won the Republican primary in a runoff by 300 votes. Since that first campaign, Hall has received more than $900,000 from Dunn, Wilks, and groups that they are major funders of – about a third of his total donations.\n\n“All this West Texas money is what made him into a viable candidate,” Deuell said of Hall, who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nSeliger, Deuell’s former colleague in the Senate, has also staked out conservative positions on many issues, and Dunn gave his campaign $1,000 during his first year in office in 2004.\n\nBut after Seliger decided he couldn’t support efforts to divert funding from public schools to private school vouchers, Dunn turned on him, he said. In the decade since, he’s found himself repeatedly running against a challenger backed by groups funded by Dunn and Wilks.\n\n“That’s the law of the jungle now in Texas,” Seliger said. “The majority of Republican Senate members just dance to whatever tune Tim Dunn wants to play.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Conservatism vs. control within the Texas Republican Party 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDunn has defended his spending and his group’s campaign tactics.\n\n“Empower Texans remains outside the swamp, and the group informs voters who want their representatives to do in Austin what they promised during election season,” he wrote in a 2018 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, responding to criticism of the group’s tactics. “If all of us outsiders stick together, we can drain the Austin Swamp.”\n\nZachary Maxwell has had an inside view of the billionaires’ influence. He worked for Empower Texans, Dunn’s PAC, and served as campaign manager and chief of staff for then-state Rep. Mike Lang, who received more than 60% of his campaign donations from Wilks and PACs he and Dunn were major funders of.\n\nMaxwell told CNN in an interview that there was “no way” Lang could have gotten elected without Wilks’ money. At one campaign fundraiser, he said, Jo Ann Wilks handed Maxwell a check for more than $100,000.\n\n“I was like, ‘Can you even write a check that big?’ ” Maxwell remembered. “I about had a heart attack.”\n\nHuge sums like that helped buy Wilks influence once Lang took office, Maxwell said. “Whenever (Farris Wilks) called, he answered,” Maxwell said of Lang. “There was a lot of control.”\n\nLang did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nWest Texas upbringings\n\nTexas has a long tradition of oil and gas magnates using their fortunes to shape politics. Hugh Roy Cullen, one of Houston’s wealthiest philanthropists, supported the pro-segregation Dixiecrat movement in the 1940s, and H.L. Hunt, who owned a vast swath of the East Texas Oil Field, funded a conservative radio program that aired across the US in the ’50s and ‘60s.\n\nWhat sets Dunn and Wilks apart, political observers say, is how they’ve spent so much money pushing not just business-friendly policies that boost their bottom line but also socially conservative bills that seem designed to reshape Texas in the image of their far-right Christian values.\n\nBoth are products of humble West Texas upbringings who earned huge fortunes in Texas’ energy industry.\n\nDunn, 66, lives in Midland, the childhood home of George W. Bush and a center of the state’s oil industry. He grew up in nearby Big Spring, the son of a farm and factory worker, and studied chemical engineering at Texas Tech before working for Exxon and other oil and banking companies.\n\nHe started his own oil company, now named CrownQuest Operating, in 1996. The firm operates oil wells around West Texas’ Permian Oil Basin and beyond, and pumped 31 million barrels of oil in Texas in 2021, making it the state’s 12th largest oil producer, according to government records.\n\nDunn became more involved in Texas politics in 2006, when he opposed a tax measure that included a new tax on business partnerships – including some that fund oil wells, Texas Monthly reported. He started an organization to oppose the measure, Empower Texans, which continued to fund conservative causes even after the tax legislation passed. The group’s PAC shut down in 2020, and the billionaires more recently pivoted to funding Defend Texas Liberty.\n\nWilks, 70, grew up in a converted goat shed in Cisco, Texas, a town of 3,700 where sleepy streets are dotted with more than a dozen churches. He and his younger brother Dan were the sons of a bricklayer and started their careers as apprentice masons.\n\nAfter several other business ventures, in 2002 they founded Frac Tech Services, a company that provided trucking services for fracking operators. It was perfect timing: Fracking was about to take off in Texas and elsewhere in the US amid a boom in shale gas.\n\nLess than a decade later, in 2011, the Wilkses sold their majority share of the company for more than $3 billion to a group that included international investors. Since then, they’ve been buying up land in Texas and around the Western US, joining the ranks of America’s largest landowners – and getting involved in politics.\n\nFarris Wilks is the pastor of the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day Church, which operates a sprawling compound outside of Cisco and was founded by his father. In sermons, he has denounced homosexuality and abortion rights in vitriolic terms.\n\n“A male on male or a female on female is against nature,” Wilks declared in a 2013 recording of one sermon posted on his church’s website, which is no longer publicly available. “This lifestyle is the predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children. … They want your children.”\n\nDunn also preaches at his church, the Midland Bible Church, where he serves as a member of the congregation’s “pulpit team.”\n\n“No matter what rules you grew up with, none of them are enforceable in God’s kingdom,” he declared in one 2018 sermon.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Times of London, Dunn told a reporter he believed that, as the newspaper put it, “his oil has existed for only 4,000 years, the time decreed by Genesis, not 200 million years as his geologists know.”\n\nThat religious fervor has influenced Dunn’s and Wilks’ political moves. In a meeting with former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, who is Jewish, Dunn declared that only Christians should hold leadership positions in the chamber, Texas Monthly reported. Straus declined an interview request with CNN.\n\nAnd both Wilks brothers have donated millions of dollars through their personal foundations to conservative Christian groups, including crisis pregnancy centers, according to IRS records, which work to dissuade women from abortion and in some cases share misleading medical information.\n\n‘The goal is to tear up, tear down’\n\nPeople who’ve worked with Wilks and Dunn say they share an ultimate goal: replacing much of public education in Texas with private Christian schools. Now, educators and students are feeling the impact of that conservative ideology on the state’s school system.\n\nDorothy Burton, a former GOP activist and religious scholar, joined Farris Wilks on a 2015 Christian speaking tour organized by his brother-in-law and said she spoke at events he attended. She described the fracking magnate as “very quiet” but approachable: “You would look at him and you would never think that he was a billionaire,” she said.\n\nBut Burton said that after a year of hearing Wilks’ ideology on the speaking circuit, she became disillusioned by the single-mindedness of his conservatism.\n\n“The goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,” she said of Wilks. “And rebuild it the way God intended education to be.”\n\nIn sermons, Dunn and Wilks have advocated for religious influence in schooling. “When the Bible plainly teaches one thing and our culture teaches another, what do our children need to know what to do?” Wilks asks in one sermon from 2013.\n\nDunn, Wilks and the groups and politicians they both fund have been raising alarms about liberal ideas in the classroom, targeting teachers and school administrators they see as too progressive. The billionaires have especially focused on critical race theory, in what critics see as an attempt to use it as a scapegoat to break voters’ trust in public schooling.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, James Whitfield, the first Black principal of the mostly White Colleyville Heritage High School in the Dallas suburbs, penned a heartfelt, early-morning email in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, encouraging his school to “not grow weary in the battle against systemic racism.”\n\nJames Whitfield looks at photos at his home in Bedford, Texas on January 13, 2022. CNN\n\nThe backlash came months later. Stetson Clark, a former school board candidate whose campaign had been backed by a group that received its largest donations from Dunn and organizations he funded, accused Whitfield during a school board meeting last year of “encouraging all members of our community to become revolutionaries” and “encouraging the destruction and disruption of our district.” The board placed Whitfield on leave, and later voted not to renew his contract. He agreed to resign after coming to a settlement with the district. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitfield said he saw the rhetoric pushed by Dunn and Wilks as a major cause of his being pushed out.\n\n“They want to disrupt and destroy public schools, because they would much rather have schools that are faith-based,” Whitfield said. “We know what has happened over the course of history in our country, and if we can’t teach that, then what do you want me to do?”\n\nMeanwhile, the legislature has also been taking on the discussion of race in classrooms, passing a bill last year that bans schools from making teachers “discuss a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” The legislation was designed to keep critical race theory out of the classroom, according to Abbott, who signed the bill into law.\n\nSome of the co-authors and sponsors of the bill and previous versions of the legislation received significant funding from Dunn and Wilks.\n\nThe billionaires “want to destroy the public school system as we know it and, in its place, see more home-schooling and more private Christian schools,” said Deuell, the former senator.\n\nThe Texans feeling the impact include Libby Gonzales, an 11-year-old transgender girl living in the Dallas suburbs. She and her family say they feel like targets after the new law restricting trans students’ participation in school sports went into effect last year – passed by Swanson and other legislators bankrolled by Dunn and Wilks. Now, Libby won’t be able to play for the girls’ soccer team that she’d like to join.\n\nLibby Gonzales plays outside her home in a suburb of Dallas on January 19, 2022. CNN\n\n“We don’t have issues in our neighborhood, among our friends,” said her mother, Rachel Gonzales. “It’s when our legislators meet and decide that they’re going to leverage their political power against some of the most marginalized kids in our state.”\n\nGonzales has started volunteering for political campaigns in an attempt to turn the tide on anti-trans policies. Libby said she’s been following the news about Texas’ conservative turn – and worrying what’s coming next.\n\nLast month, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank that Dunn serves on the board of, called on the legislature to ban the prescription of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors.\n\n“I’m under attack,” Libby said. “I have no idea why people don’t understand that I’m just a girl: an 11-year-old girl living in Texas – with amazing hair.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Matthew Reynard Will Simon Ed Lavandera", "Casey Tolan", "Matthew Reynard", "Will Simon", "Ed Lavandera"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/us/migrant-influx-us-border-what-it-looks-like/index.html", "title": "This is what the crisis along the US border looks like | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs a Trump-era migration policy remains in limbo, so are the lives of thousands of migrants waiting across the United States border, many sleeping out in the cold in encampments or overcrowded shelters, hoping to cross to request asylum.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, near the US border across from Brownsville on the southern tip of Texas, migrants – mostly Venezuelans and Haitians – are living in a large encampment, with tarp-covered tents and clotheslines stretching between them. Some families have been waiting there for weeks.\n\nMigrants who spoke to CNN by phone and in person describe the conditions in the camp as dire. They are sleeping under tents and don’t know where their next meal will come from. Temperatures are expected to dip below freezing in the next few days.\n\nMany, including mothers and sick children, are living on the streets, in abandoned homes and on sidewalks as they wait. “They feel desperate,” said Glady Edith Cañas, director of the non-profit Ayudándoles a Triunfar.\n\nAt the heart of their limbo: Some migrants have been waiting for the end of the public health border policy known as Title 42. The 2020 policy, which officials said was an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19, allows authorities to swiftly expel migrants encountered at the southern border, with some exceptions.\n\nThe Title 42 policy was set to end Wednesday, but Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday put a temporary hold on its termination. Until the court issues an order – which can come at any time – the authority will remain in place; the Biden administration is asking the court to let the policy end next week.\n\nOfficials have predicted lifting Title 42 will result in a spike in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US, and border cities have been bracing for a flood of people.\n\nNow, because the end of Title 42 is delayed, uncertainty looms over those waiting at the border.\n\nSome migrants are not waiting\n\nCNN drone pilot Al Meshberg captured video of a large group of migrants gathered on the Mexican banks of the Rio Grande and a large law enforcement presence of US Border Patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety and Texas National Guard on the US side.\n\nAs CNN cameras rolled, a group of migrants, including small children, crossed the river on a raft. Moments after the migrants crossed into the United States, the migrants could be seen walking out of the bushes wrapped in synthetic blankets while being escorted to Border Patrol vehicles.\n\nThis week at Matamoros, some used inflatable rafts to cross the Rio Grande, pulling themselves over on a rope attached to the US side. In a video of a crossing there obtained by CNN, some are heard saying they were tired of waiting.\n\nMeanwhile, at the westernmost edge of Texas this week, some 800 miles northwest of Matamoros, National Guard troops and state police lined one side of the Rio Grande at El Paso, and armed members of the Mexican army line some parts of the other side at Ciudad Juárez.\n\nThere, after crossing the river – wading through discarded belongings of those who came before them – migrants have in recent days lined up for hours near the border wall to turn themselves in to US Border Patrol agents.\n\nAs the sun set, some lit fires to keep warm or wrapped themselves in blankets and stayed in line.\n\nA group of migrants are waiting on the US side of the Rio Grande as the Texas National Guard blocked access to parts of the border with barbed wire and vehicles as seen from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on December 20, 2022. David von Blohn/CNN\n\nEarly Tuesday, National Guard members and state troopers put up barbed wire, blocking a common crossing used by thousands of migrants over the past several weeks. Four people were taken into custody after they tried to crawl under the barbed wire, video showed.\n\nMigrants hoping to cross were told Wednesday morning to go to a point about a mile down the river. There, once again, they lined up outside the border wall on the US side to present themselves for asylum requests.\n\nElsewhere on the US side, shelters are packed, and still, not everyone is sheltered. A crowd of migrants could be seen sleeping on the ground outside a bus station Sunday in El Paso.\n\nAnd the region will get dangerously cold Friday night and Saturday morning: Wind chills could reach 15 degrees early Saturday in El Paso, and the upper 20s in the Brownsville area.\n\nEl Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser declared a state of emergency Saturday, due to a surge of migrants who have recently arrived in the community and are living in what he described as unsafe conditions.\n\nThe mayor said Monday he heard more than 20,000 migrants were on the Mexican side of the border, waiting for Title 42 to be lifted.\n\nDrone footage showed a large crowd of migrants lining up near the border in El Paso on Tuesday, with families and small children waiting near barbed wiring and Texas National Guard troops.\n\nAcross the Rio Grande, Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, has also seen an uptick in arrivals in recent weeks, according to Mayor Perez Cuellar. “This is a city of migrants,” he told CNN.\n\nThousands also were waiting for Title 42 to be lifted in Reynosa, a Mexican city across the border from the Rio Grande Valley, including 4,000 who, as of Sunday, were staying in two shelters and an estimated 4,000 in other encampments and the surrounding areas, according to Pastor Hector Silva.\n\nMigrants cross the Rio Grande into the US from Ciudad Juarez on December 18, 2022.

Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security projected last month that between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border daily when Title 42 ends, more than double the number of people crossing at the time.\n\nCrossings are already rising in some areas.\n\nIn the last two weeks, border authorities in the Rio Grande Valley at Texas’ southern tip encountered between 900 and 1,200 migrants daily, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. That’s reminiscent of a surge in 2019, when agents encountered at least 1,000 daily, the source said.\n\nAnd a senior Border Patrol official said last week more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the US near El Paso daily over the weekend, describing the number as a “major surge in illegal crossings” in the area.\n\nMeanwhile, housing the arriving migrants has presented a challenge.\n\n“I really believe that today our asylum-seekers are not safe as we have hundreds and hundreds on the streets and that’s not the way we want to treat people,” El Paso’s mayor said Saturday.\n\nTwo vacant schools in El Paso will be used as temporary sheltering facilities for migrants, city authorities announced Tuesday, in addition to three emergency shelter hotels.\n\nThe city is also sending teams to the different areas where migrants are gathering to provide transportation services and temporary shelter.\n\n“All eyes are on El Paso and for this reason, we must show the world the compassion our community is known for and illustrate the resilience and strength of our region,” City Manager Tommy Gonzalez said in a statement.\n\nThe American Red Cross has deployed resources and personnel to El Paso to assist with the influx of migrants, the organization said in a Wednesday statement. The organization has provided phones to organizations working in the region so migrants can reconnect with family members.\n\nMigrants sleep in the cold outside a bus station on December 18, 2022 in El Paso, Texas. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nTitle 42 frozen, but plans still underway\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security last week released a plan for the scheduled end of Title 42. It involved surging resources to the border – including hiring nearly 1,000 Border Patrol processing coordinators – and increasing transportation resources, such as flights and buses.\n\nDespite the freeze on ending the policy, US authorities are moving forward with planning.\n\n“We’re going on as if nothing’s changed,” a senior US Customs and Border Protection official told CNN, adding policy discussions are still underway to provide other legal pathways to Nicaraguans, Haitians and Cubans who make up a large number of encounters.\n\nAs for what happens on Wednesday if the expiration is still on hold, one official said there may be a “mini surge.”\n\n“I think there’s some that probably haven’t gotten the message and won’t until they cross,” the official said. “There are some already committed who will cross.”", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/us/san-antonio-migrant-truck-deaths/index.html", "title": "On a Texas road called 'the mouth of the wolf,' a semitruck packed ...", "text": "San Antonio CNN —\n\nA distant cry led a worker Monday evening to a tractor-trailer abandoned on a desolate country road under the blazing Texas sun on the outskirts of the city.\n\nOn this barren stretch of scrubland adjacent to railroad tracks, the perilous journey north for dozens of undocumented migrants – many of them Mexican – ended in the back of a scorching tractor-trailer, nearly 150 miles north of the US border with Mexico.\n\nIn all, 53 people died in what one Homeland Security Investigations’ agent called the deadliest human smuggling incident in US history. Some victims could be younger than 18.\n\n“This is nothing short of a horrific human tragedy,” said San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg.\n\nA local businessman described the back road where the semitruck was abandoned as “la boca del lobo” in Spanish, or “the mouth of the wolf,” because it is remote and pitch black.\n\nThe road runs parallel to Interstate 35, a major north-south route in the central United States for traffic and commerce from the southern border. The interstate stretches from Laredo, Texas, to Duluth, Minnesota, near the Canadian border. From San Antonio, it meanders north to Austin, Waco, Fort Worth and Dallas.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel investigate the tractor-trailer Monday in San Antonio. Jordan Vonderhaar/Getty Images\n\nIt’s a route often exploited by smugglers at a time when record numbers of migrants are being intercepted at the US-Mexico border.\n\n“This sheds light on how dangerous human smuggling is,” said Craig Larrabee, Homeland Security Investigations San Antonio acting special agent in charge.\n\n“In the past, smuggling organizations were mom-and-pop,” Larrabee told CNN. “Now, they are organized and tied in with the cartels. So you have a criminal organization who has no regard for the safety of the migrants. They are treated like commodities rather than people.”\n\nA cry for help leads to ‘stacks of bodies’\n\nJust before 6 p.m. on Monday, a worker in a nearby building heard a cry for help and alerted local authorities to the abandoned truck, according to San Antonio Police Chief Bill McManus.\n\nThe doors to the hulking trailer were partially open when the worker arrived. Inside, he saw the bodies, the chief said.\n\nForty-eight people were dead at the scene and two died later at hospitals, said a federal law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, the Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office (BCMEO) said it had received a total of 53 bodies.\n\nThey were migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and possibly El Salvador.\n\nOne body was found outside the trailer.\n\nInside the truck there were at least 22 Mexicans and two Hondurans, the federal law enforcement official said.\n\nSeven Guatemalans were among the dead, and another Guatemalan was in critical condition at a hospital, according to the nation’s foreign minister.\n\n“We’re not supposed to open up a truck and see stacks of bodies in there,” San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said told reporters on Monday. “None of us come to work imagining that.”\n\nSurvivors, suffering from heat stroke, were hot to the touch\n\nThese dangerous and sometimes fatal human smuggling operations, transporting people in crammed trailers and vans with no air conditioning, are common along the southern border.\n\nIn 2017, 10 migrants died and dozens were injured from heat-related conditions in a tractor-trailer discovered at a San Antonio Walmart about three miles northeast of the latest incident. The driver of the truck was sentenced to life without parole in a federal prison.\n\nPolice and other first responders work at the place where dozens of migrants were found dead Monday in San Antonio. Eric Gay/AP\n\nOn Tuesday, San Antonio resident Angelita Olvera left two colorful crosses in honor of the victims near the site of the latest tragedy.\n\n“I didn’t know them,” she told CNN of the victims. “They are sons, mothers, fathers and grandchildren.”\n\nTemperatures in San Antonio on Monday ranged from the high 90s to the low 100s.\n\nSixteen survivors – 12 adults and four children – were rushed to local hospitals. Suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion, the patients were hot to the touch, according to Hood. On Wednesday, 11 people were still in local hospitals.\n\nThe trailer had no air conditioning. There was no sign of water inside. It was unclear how long the victims had been dead.\n\n“They were still in there, awaiting help, when we arrived … meaning just being too weak – weakened state – to actually get out and help themselves,” Hood said of the survivors.\n\nFelipe Betancourt Jr., co-owner of a trucking company in Alamo, Texas, told CNN the semitruck abandoned on Monday used the same federal and state identifying numbers as one of his vehicles. The truck in San Antonio is the same color as his red Volvo semi, but is not owned by his firm.\n\nA man pays his respects at a makeshift memorial for the victims in San Antonio. Eric Gay/AP\n\nRefrigerated semitrucks are insulated and meant to keep the temperatures stable, Betancourt said, but “if it’s carrying something hot inside, it won’t let the heat escape. The temperatures can reach up to 125-130 degrees when the doors are shut.”\n\nOn Monday, the truck went through a checkpoint north of Laredo, Texas, according to US Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose sprawling district includes Laredo and San Antonio.\n\nHomeland security officials are investigating the deaths, along with local police.\n\nThree people were taken into police custody away from the trailer, Chief McManus said. They are believed to be part of the smuggling conspiracy, according to ICE.\n\nTwo men, Juan Claudio D’Luna-Mendez and Juan Francisco D’Luna-Bilbao, were charged federally with “possession of a weapon by an alien illegally in the United States” in connection with the incident, according to criminal complaints filed Monday in US District Court for the Western District of Texas. It is unclear if the two men charged are among the three people detained earlier.\n\nInvestigators at the scene traced the Texas registration plate on the semitruck and to a residence in San Antonio, the affidavit said. The suspects were arrested during traffic stops after leaving the residence, according to the complaints, and numerous weapons were recovered in a car and truck driven by the suspects.\n\n‘Brothers and sisters who died following their hope of a better life’\n\nThe victims were 40 males and 13 females.\n\nSome of them could be under 18 years old, according to Tom Peine, a Bexar County spokesman.\n\nSo far, the medical examiner’s office has potentially identified 37 people, BCMEO said in a statement Wednesday. Medical examiners in neighboring counties were assisting due to the number of victims.\n\nSome victims had one photo ID while others had multiple IDs or none, complicating the identification process, Peine said.\n\nConsular officials from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras also vowed to help identify victims and assist survivors. The medical examiner was also in touch with the consulate of El Salvador though the nationalities of the victims are still being determined, Peine said.\n\n“Far too many lives have been lost as individuals – including families, women, and children – take this dangerous journey,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on social media.\n\nThe Biden administration earlier this month launched what Mayorkas called an “unprecedented” operation to disrupt human smuggling networks amid soaring numbers of migrants at the southern border.\n\nPresident Joe Biden described Monday’s discovery as “horrifying and heartbreaking.”\n\n“Exploiting vulnerable individuals for profit is shameful, as is political grandstanding around tragedy, and my administration will continue to do everything possible to stop human smugglers and traffickers from taking advantage of people who are seeking to enter the United States between ports of entry,” Biden said.\n\nPope Francis, via Twitter, urged prayers “for these brothers and sisters who died following their hope of a better life.”\n\n650 died trying to cross US-Mexico border last year\n\nMigrant rescues are increasing across the nation’s southern border.\n\nSince October, more than 14,000 searches and rescues have occurred along the border with Mexico, according to US Customs and Border Protection – including those from dangerous water crossings. That’s up from 12,833 searches and rescues in fiscal year 2021, with more than three months left in this fiscal year.\n\nAt least 650 people died while trying to cross the US-Mexico border last year, the highest number since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency.\n\nMonday’s tragedy brings the total number of deaths for the first six months of the year to 290.\n\nOn Tuesday, helicopters buzzed over the desolate stretch of road where the trailer was abandoned as authorities searched for other migrants who might have been on the truck.\n\nOlvera, the resident who left crosses near the scene, recalled joining neighbors in 2017 to pray for the 10 migrants who died in a broiling tractor-trailer parked at a Walmart.\n\nShe used to live in Piedras Negras, Mexico, Olvera said, fighting back tears, and is too familiar with the poverty some migrants have died fleeing.\n\nIt’s a tragedy that has repeated itself throughout the years. In 2003, 18 migrants, ranging in age from 7 to 91, were found dead in the back of a semitruck in Texas with about 100 other people as temperatures soared past 100 degrees, investigators said. The driver in that case was initially sentenced to life in prison, but in 2011 was resentenced to nearly 34 years in prison.", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez Nicole Chavez Priscilla Alvarez", "Ray Sanchez", "Nicole Chavez", "Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/us/moscow-idaho-killings-investigation/index.html", "title": "Inside the investigation into who killed 4 college students in Moscow ...", "text": "Moscow, Idaho CNN —\n\nNine days since the killings of four college students attending the University of Idaho, police have not arrested any suspect, but are “definitely making progress,” according to an outside public information officer.\n\n“It takes a while to put together and piece together that whole timeline of events and the picture of really what occurred,” said Aaron Snell, communications director for Idaho State Police. “A lot of this the public doesn’t get to see because it’s a criminal investigation. But I guarantee you behind the scenes, there’s so much work going on.”\n\nThat work includes interviews with more than 90 people as detectives look into more than 700 leads.\n\nBut Moscow, a city of about 26,000 residents, hasn’t recorded a murder since 2015. The quadruple homicide has rattled the small college community, and anxieties have only heightened with the ongoing lack of answers.\n\nFlow of information\n\nMuch of the information in the case will eventually be used for prosecution and cannot be put into the public eye, at risk of impeding justice at the very end, Snell said.\n\nBut the limited details available to the public and confusion over early police statements hasn’t eased community concerns.\n\nMoscow police initially told the public that the attack was targeted, with no further threat to the public. But by day four, Police Chief Jason Fry adjusted that statement: “We cannot say that there is no threat to the community.”\n\nSnell acknowledges the early messaging may have been off, given that the roughly 30 members of the Moscow Police Department all initially responded to the crime scene, with no dedicated public information staff within the department.\n\nWithin days, the department had to bring in outside resources to assist with the investigation, including Snell.\n\nIn addition to the hundreds of leads, police are also combing through large files of surveillance footage submitted by residents of the early morning hours when police believe the murders happened.\n\n“This is a very large operation, a very large investigation and it’s a very terrible crime,” Snell said.\n\nOther angles are taking longer to investigate. It is believed a fixed-blade knife was used in the attack on the students, and to aid in the investigation, law enforcement asked local businesses to come forward with evidence that a fixed-blade knife was purchased. As of Tuesday, Snell says no local businesses have provided information that a knife matching that description was bought or obtained.\n\nThreat to the public\n\nAnytime a person or people responsible for such a violent crime have not yet been caught, there is a threat to the public, Snell said.\n\n“We recognize that it’s always wise for people to lock their doors, walk in pairs, be alert of what they’re doing. There is somebody or some people out there somewhere that are murderers, and we want to find them and bring them to justice,” Snell said.\n\nHe told CNN there could potentially be more than one person responsible for the killings. He also reiterated that police still believe it was a targeted attack, partly because of evidence found at the scene and the fact that two people in the house survived.\n\nSome students have since left the area to take classes remotely, telling CNN that police statements have not been reassuring.\n\nEthan Chapin, 20; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Madison Mogen, 21, were found dead November 13, police said. CNN\n\nThe University of Idaho president said Tuesday that many students have given the school input on how they hope to proceed after the fall break, resulting in a decision to allow students to finish the rest of the semester either in-person or remotely.\n\nIn his message, University of Idaho President Scott Green said, “Faculty have been asked to prepare in-person teaching and remote learning options so that each student can choose their method of engagement for the final two weeks of the semester. Moving courses fully online is not preferred but may be necessary in limited situations.”\n\nHowever, others in the community, including the mother of victim Ethan Chapin, have extended patience and gratitude for the police department’s work.\n\nAt a memorial on Monday evening, Stacy Chapin thanked the “Moscow Police Department, who now carry the burden every day not only for us, but for all of the impacted families.”\n\nQuelling rumors\n\nIn the absence of details, rumors have been spiraling about the case, causing police to have to dispel them publicly, one by one.\n\n“As people are out there and they’re talking about this case, the public sentiment changes,” Snell said. “They’re confused. They’re upset. We want to try and dispel rumors, and we want to try and make sure that the truth is out there.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'In denial:' Father and siblings of Idaho victim speak to CNN about investigation 04:06 - Source: CNN\n\nInvestigators looked “extensively” into hundreds of pieces of information about victim Kaylee Goncalves having a stalker, but “have not been able to verify or identify a stalker,” police said in a Facebook post Tuesday.\n\nEarlier, police said the surviving roommates and friends who made the 911 call and spoke to dispatchers have been excluded from involvement as suspects. A man seen on surveillance video standing near two of the victims has also been eliminated as a suspect, as well as a driver who took two of the victims home.\n\nAnd the report of a “skinned” dog three weeks before the killings is not connected to the case, according to police.\n\nMoscow Police said Monday a dog was found at the home of the stabbings, but “the dog was unharmed and turned over to Animal Services and then released to a responsible party.”", "authors": ["Natasha Chen Jack Hannah Jason Kravarik", "Natasha Chen", "Jack Hannah", "Jason Kravarik"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/trevor-reed-russia/index.html", "title": "American Trevor Reed is back in the US after being released from ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAmerican Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former Marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019, is back in the United States, his mother Paula Reed tweeted early Thursday.\n\nReed was released in a prisoner swap Wednesday.\n\n“It’s been (a) very exciting day for the Reed family,” Paula Reed tweeted. “Trevor is back in the USA.”\n\nThe release ended a nearly three-year ordeal for Reed, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the “life and health” of Russian police officers in an altercation. Reed and his family have denied the charges against him.\n\nIn her tweet, Paula Reed also advocated for the release of Paul Whelan, a US citizen and former Marine who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and arrested on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied.\n\nReed’s release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.\n\nHis release came after months of effort by the US government, officials said, and was particularly urgent given concerns about Reed’s health. It was ultimately secured through a prisoner swap for Russian citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko.\n\nThe exchange took place in Turkey on Wednesday, Trevor’s parents, Paula and Joey Reed, previously told CNN.\n\nThe couple, who spoke to their son by phone shortly after the prisoner exchange, said he had been subdued. “The first phone call we got, he did not sound like himself,” Paula Reed said Wednesday evening at a news conference outside their home in Granbury, Texas.\n\nShe said his spirits seemed better by the time they received a second call from him later in the day: “He still looks terrible, but he sounded better. He sounded more like himself.”\n\nTrevor Reed, who was detained in Russia for nearly three years, saw Yaroshenko on the tarmac during the prisoner swap but did not say anything to him, according to his father.\n\n“Trevor quickly told us that they – the American plane pulled up next to the Russian plane, and they walked both prisoners across at the same time like you see in the movies,” Joey Reed said earlier on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nThe Reeds said they had also spoken to President Joe Biden on Wednesday and expressed their gratitude.\n\n“I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence,” Biden said in a statement. “And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.”\n\nAsked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday whether he had been surprised by Reed’s release given Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Biden said: “I did it.” The President, pressed on how, continued, “I raised it,” adding, “Three months ago.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told Collins earlier Wednesday that the President waited to notify the Reed family of their son’s freedom due to “not wanting to put anyone in a position of putting that at risk – even people who are excited and joyful and looking forward to the news.”\n\nPressed on whether Russia was able to extract any other conditions from the US aside from a one-to-one prisoner swap, Psaki told CNN, “There were no other conditions that I’m aware of,” later adding, “This was about one issue and topic and I don’t think we should read into it further.”\n\n‘Months and months’ of negotiations\n\nReed’s release was the result of “months and months of hard careful work across the US government” on the matter, a senior administration official said, noting that “the conversations on this particular issue have accelerated recently to get us to this point.”\n\nOne driving factor was concern for Reed’s health. His family has expressed worry about his likely exposure to tuberculosis as well as lingering effects from having Covid-19.\n\nThe official, speaking to reporters on a background call Wednesday, said that “ultimately, those negotiations led the President to have to make a very hard decision with a decision to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine.”\n\nYaroshenko is a Russian pilot who had been detained in Liberia by undercover US Drug Enforcement Agency agents on May 28, 2010, and brought to the US, according to Russian state news agency TASS. He was convicted of drug smuggling in 2011 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, which he had been serving at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. He has denied the charges against him.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry had previously raised the possibility that Yaroshenko could be returned “in exchange for any American national” held in Russia.\n\nThe official did not provide details about how or why Yaroshenko was chosen for the swap, but noted that he had served the majority of his US sentence and is now in Russian custody.\n\n“This is a tough call for a President. President Biden made it to bring home an American whose health was a source of an intense concern, and to deliver on his commitment to resolve these hard cases and reunite Americans with their loved ones,” the official said.\n\nPaula Reed spoke Wednesday with CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.”\n\n“I’m going to try not to cry, because he doesn’t want me to cry,” Reed’s mother, Paula, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day” Wednesday. “Obviously, I’m going to cry a little bit, give him a big hug, and just, you know, give him hugs, and it will be the four of us together again (for the first time) in a few years, so it’s going to be great.”\n\nReed’s father previously told CNN he believed it was likely Reed was suffering from tuberculosis, that he was coughing up blood and also had a broken rib. He said Reed went to a prison hospital but did not receive treatment and was then sent back to solitary confinement.\n\nAs Reed started a second hunger strike in protest of his treatment by Russian authorities, Reed’s parents went to protest outside of the White House in the hopes of securing a meeting with the President.\n\nThe Reeds ultimately did meet with the President at the White House for about a half hour last month.\n\n2 other Americans still detained in Russia\n\nWednesday’s release also brought renewed attention to the case of Whelan. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.\n\nLast June, he told CNN of the grim conditions of the remote labor camp where he works in a clothing factory he called a “sweatshop” and said obtaining medical care is “very difficult.”\n\nIn his statement welcoming Reed’s release, Biden said his administration “won’t stop” until Whelan is home.\n\nThe Whelan family expressed happiness at Reed’s release but said it was a day of “varied emotions” and questions for them.\n\n“Unfortunately, time is not on Paul’s side. Our parents are literally not getting any younger. Our hope remains that Paul will be home so they may see him once more. But each day that hope dims,” his brother David Whelan said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, US basketball star Brittney Griner remains detained in Russia after she was arrested in February on allegations of drug smuggling. A Moscow court recently extended her detention until May 19, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nWhile her legal team has had access to her and was able to see her several times a week throughout her detention, a US official from the US embassy in Moscow was finally granted consular access to Griner in late March, and said they found her to be in “good condition.”\n\nNed Price, a State Department spokesman, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Wednesday that the cases remain top priorities for the US.\n\nPsaki echoed Price’s sentiment, saying Wednesday that the White House will “continue to do everything they can” to secure the release of Whelan, Griner and other Americans still detained in Russia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Radina Gigova Anna Chernova", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Radina Gigova", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/25/us/arrest-warrant-north-carolina-woman-dead-mexico-friday/index.html", "title": "Mexico issues arrest warrant for US citizen accused of killing her ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn arrest warrant has been issued in Mexico for a woman suspected of fatally assaulting a friend from North Carolina while on vacation last month in San Jose del Cabo, a prosecutor says.\n\nShanquella Robinson, 25, was traveling with college friends from Winston-Salem State University when she died while staying in a vacation rental property, said her father, Bernard Robinson.\n\nRobinson, with six friends, arrived October 28 in Mexico, according to a Thursday statement by Mexican prosecutors working on extradition proceedings with their country’s attorney general and Foreign Affairs Ministry.\n\nEvidence shows the death resulted from “a direct attack, not an accident,” and involved a female friend of the victim, the prosecutors said.\n\nMexican authorities have said the death occurred in San Jose del Cabo.

It might be his day off from a regular railroad company job, but he is hard at work putting the finishing touches on the first of a series of art projects for Brickey Elementary.\n\n“It’s a lot of driving around downtown, which is good for me,” Swaggerty said of his day job. “I used to see the freight cars with graffiti on them and I started following a lot of those artists on social media.”\n\nThe self-taught Swaggerty began dabbling with Sharpie pen and pencil sketches and eventually moved onto spray paint in 2014. “I do the chalk art downtown, carve soap stone, graphic design for T-shirts,” he said. “I’m not a master of one particular thing. I like to be proficient in everything.”\n\nSwaggerty is most recognized for his portrait of Popcorn Sutton in Graffiti Alley behind Market Square. The portrait took a lot of time to create by hand, and regularly pops up in social media posts and led to some paid commissions.\n\nSince that portrait, Swaggerty has also finished commissions for private clients' homes, local businesses and schools. They include a massive 30-foot-long mural at the Knoxville home of former Major League closer Joe Nathan. “It took several weeks when I did it years ago; a lot of times I look back and I could do it a lot faster now,” said Swaggerty.\n\nThe Health Factory in South Knoxville features eight solo pieces of his art and four collaborative pieces with fellow artist Shane Sandberg. “It allowed me to gain my confidence and get my feet wet doing larger scale stuff,” he said. Swaggerty’s work is also featured at Inskip and Fountain City baseball fields, Kybra Athletics, Rocky Top Crossfit, Doggie Stylin’ Pet Wash and Boutique in Maryville and Los Primos restaurant in Harriman.\n\nThe 2004 Central High graduate went back to school and painted a mural in the football fieldhouse, three sides of the pump house and may have something in the works for the cafeteria. The Brickey commission includes two large murals in the foyer, art in the cafeteria and gym and new directional signs.\n\n\"I find out what people want and what they like, then sketch it on paper or draw it on my iPad Pro,” said Swaggerty of his commissions. “After I show the design to them we go back and forth and refine it after that.”\n\nFans of murals may also know of Swaggerty’s renditions of Smokey, Garfield and a LEGO man in the alleyway beside Old City Java. And his latest addition is of his beloved VW Bug.\n\nEvery summer, Swaggerty participates in the Endeavor Summit for young professionals at The Mill and Mine, creating live art.\n\nSwaggerty will often design and have a limited run of hats and T-shirts printed for sale. “I did 'The North Knox' design and threw it up on social media and sell just 60-70 of them at a time,” he said.\n\n“My goal is to take my art as far as it can go and I’m happy to see where that is,” said Swaggerty. “I just want to keep doing cool stuff. Hopefully people think I’m a decent artist.”\n\nTo see more of Cody Swaggerty’s work follow him on Instagram @cswaggerty or email at swag14@yahoo.com.\n\nKARNS\n\nDona Bean dinner raises $7,754 for children\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nNearly 200 people gathered to honor the memory of Dona Bean and raise money for children in need at Karns schools at a dinner held at Beaver Ridge United Methodist Church on Wednesday, July 18.\n\nDona Bean was an active member of Beaver Ridge UMC since around 1995. She raised her two children, Adam Bean and Cortny Bean, in the church and participated heavily in the youth program and Praise Band.\n\nShe died of cancer after a valiant fight in the fall of 2017.\n\nPastor Larry Dial said, “Dona was a force, a very passionate person and she was an exceptional person. A very unusual person and a very beautiful person. Being a Karns resident with the maiden name of Beaver, we had great fun with that and she was good natured about it.”\n\nAttendees at the dinner donated as much or as little as they wished for a delicious meal of ham, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and homemade biscuits with ice cream sandwiches for dessert.\n\nThe funds raised will go to children in need at Karns schools, particularly the elementary school, where Bean worked as a personal accountability instructor and mentor facilitator.\n\nIf a child acted out in class or routinely failed to do homework they would go to Bean, and she inspired the children to do better by encouraging them and holding them accountable. She would help them do homework and study about how to build character and be a good citizen.\n\n“My mom was 100 percent committed to the kids and to the church,” said Bean’s daughter, Cortny Bean. “She brought us here to help us form a firm foundation. Her passion for the community grew and she found herself working for Karns Elementary School.\n\n“She believed that if you surrounded yourself with good people who would encourage you and hold you accountable, that the sky was the limit. She always loved being a part of other people’s success, and that started with children.”\n\nDona Bean established the Helping Hands mentor program at Karns Elementary School in 2009. She paired 20 to 30 mentors from the church each with a child in need of extra love and attention.\n\nThe mentors, now under the direction of Teresa Davis, meet with their student mentee once a week for lunch in a quiet place on campus. They’ll listen and encourage the children giving them much needed extra love and attention. They’ll even bring a small birthday and/or Christmas gift.\n\n“It’s an invaluable program that really makes a difference to the kids,” said Davis. “We have 20 to 30 mentors, but we need a lot more. It only takes an hour of time once a week to change a child’s life for the better. They just need someone they can count on to listen and encourage them … and give them much needed attention.”\n\nDial said the dinner was a success, raising $7,754 for students who might need a coat, a pair of shoes, or may not be able to meet even the reduced price for lunch.\n\n“Dona was a lifelong children’s advocate who did the best she could to make the children’s lives better. … Whatever the need, we want to meet it.\n\n“We’ve raised $7,754 with the dinner, but we invite the community to go to our website and donate to this mission project in honor of Dona. All the proceeds go to fulfill needs of the children as directed by the principal and teachers.”\n\nTo donate, visit: www.beaverridgeumc.org\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nWWII veteran receives Jubilee of Liberty medal\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\n“It was a job that had to be done and young folks like me had to do it,” said James D. “Bud” Mynatt Jr. as he spoke about flying combat missions over France during World War II at a ceremony awarding him the French Jubilee of Liberty medal on July 18.\n\nYoung men who answered the call of their country to serve during that war are often called “the Greatest Generation,” and Mynatt exemplifies that. He was 20 years old when he flew his very first two bombing missions on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During the next several months he completed 35 combat missions supporting ground forces over Caen and Brest, France.\n\nThe Jubilee of Liberty Medal was commissioned by the Regional Council of Normandy for the 50th anniversary of D-Day and is now minted by the 8th Air Force Historical Society to pay homage to eligible veterans including land forces, offshore personnel and airmen.\n\nThis is not the first time Mynatt has been recognized; last year he was awarded with France’s highest honor, earning the distinction of Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honor. In addition, he received two distinguished flying crosses, four air medals and the Presidential Citation from President Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nRecalling one mission when he co-piloted “Sky Pirate,” a B-24 plane, he described being hit with German flak (gunfire) 330 times. “We lost two engines and the landing gear, but we got back, it brought us back,” he said. Later the crew patched the holes with tape and kept flying.\n\nCalling it “unusual,” Mynatt was proud that during his 35 bombing missions not a single life was lost.\n\nA Knoxville native and 1942 Central High School graduate, he married his high school sweetheart, Carolyn Cruze; they will celebrate their 74th anniversary in December.

Richard Armstrong not your usual priest\n\nAl Lesar, Shopper News correspondent\n\nEvery morning that Rev. Richard Armstrong walks in his office, his first order of business is to touch and then kiss a medal given to him from Mother Teresa, then say a quick prayer to her for strength to get through the day.\n\n“What struck me was that (Mother Teresa) was such a tiny little lady,” Armstrong said. “You felt such an overwhelming power coming out of her. She radiated God’s grace.\n\n“Even though she was so tiny, I felt small in front of her.”\n\nEarlier this month, the 46-year-old Armstrong, who had the opportunity to meet Mother Teresa (now Saint Teresa of Kolkata) while in the seminary in Maryland, began a challenge that will require all the help and guidance he can muster.\n\nArmstrong belongs to the Byzantine eparchy of Parma, Ohio, but is employed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville. He will continue to work as assistant director in the Office of Christian Formation in Knoxville while handling the role of parochial administrator at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Norris and St. Therese Catholic Church in Clinton. Recently, he was granted bi-ritual faculties in Rome, so that he might celebrate the Latin Rite (Roman Catholic) and the Byzantine Rite.\n\nA priest with a family\n\nMeeting a person who has been canonized by the Catholic Church isn’t the only thing that will make the native of northern Virginia special.\n\nIn 2009, he was ordained as a Byzantine Catholic priest. The custom of that Eastern Rite is that priests marry. He and his wife, Emily, have been married for 20 years. They live in Powell with their eight children – ages 4-19. All the children have been homeschooled. Their oldest daughter just finished her freshman year at Pellissippi State Community College, majoring in chemistry.\n\n“Somehow we manage to make it,” said Emily. “It’s a mystery how we get it done sometimes. We’re together in this. I’ve learned you can’t think too far ahead.\n\n“Faith is a big part of the homeschool curriculum that we have. It was important to us that our children live their faith. We have a lot of individual activities outside (their Powell) home that are suitable for the different age levels.”\n\nDeveloping academic high-achievers is hardly the mission for the Armstrongs.\n\n“I always feel inadequate, but I do what I can for them,” Emily said. “All we want them to be is faithful people.”\n\nIncident doesn't go away\n\nGoogle Rev. Richard Armstrong’s name and there’s a misleading and incomplete news account from 2011 that won’t go away.\n\nFather Richard and a parishioner from his Knoxville Byzantine church regularly would go to the Volunteer Women’s Medical Clinic in Knoxville, where abortions were performed. They would be on the side of the building, off the property, and pray. They would bring a large cross and other icons.\n\n“It wasn’t a protest,” he said. “We had no signs. We weren’t there to be seen. We were there to pray.”\n\nThat fateful day, Armstrong said he had left the site when their prayers were finished and was in his car. The parishioner was ready to put the large cross and its cinder block stand in his truck when the facility’s director confronted the parishioner. She grabbed the cross. He had one end of it and she had the other.\n\n“I said, ‘Let her have it. Let go of it,’” Armstrong said. “She took the cross on the abortion clinic property.”\n\nArmstrong said the director threatened to call the police. He was all for that. He hoped to get his cross back, but he refused to enter the clinic. The police arrested Armstrong and his parishioner before listening to their side of the story.\n\nAfter several hours in the booking process, Armstrong was released on his own recognizance, while the parishioner had a $1,000 bond because the director claimed he assaulted her with the cross.\n\nThe court process took a couple years before all the charges were dropped and the court record was expunged. But the original news story – without any resolution – is still alive on the internet.\n\n“That’s part of the difficulty today,” Armstrong said. “We ultimately got what we wanted. The clinic was closed a couple years later. That’s what our prayers were for.\n\n“If I had to do it again, and I knew it would close the clinic, I would do it again.”\n\nMore:Shopper News photos of the week\n\nMore:G&D Deli serves local goodies and worth the drive\n\nWORDS OF FAITH\n\nDon't be anxious about the road ahead\n\nTom Ogburn, Shopper News columnist\n\nOne of my favorite places in the Smoky Mountains is the Tremont area. The road runs so close to the mountain stream that you can almost feel its spray. As you wind your way up the old logging road, the asphalt gives way to gravel, and the trees arch over you as a natural canopy. When you look forward, you are surrounded with beauty but can only see a short stretch in front of you. You have to wait to see what God has in store around the corner.\n\nThe last time I made the drive up the mountainside, I could not help but think about how often we find ourselves so anxious about what is around the corner in our lives that we miss the beauty of the moment. We worry so much about our tomorrows that we miss what God has for us in our today.\n\nIn The Lord’s Prayer, a part of what Jesus teaches his disciples to pray is, “give us this day our daily bread.” These can be difficult words to pray with meaning because we are tempted to want to know God’s plan for our long-term provision. Too often we long for not only enough for the day, but enough for a lifetime. Instead, Jesus invites us to pray enough for today alone. This requires us to trust God in this bend in the road. It also calls for us to believe God will not only be present in our todays, but will also be waiting for us and providing what is coming for us around the corner.\n\nLater in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 6, Jesus teaches: “25 Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?...34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”\n\nWhile I appreciate those who have exotic birds and care for them as pets, the picture Jesus uses is the birds that live in the wild. Jesus assures us that if God cares and provides for these wild birds, how much more will God care and provide for us who are the very children of God through faith. We can trust God to provide our daily bread. We do not have to worry about what is around the next corner. So, enjoy the drive. Don’t worry about tomorrow. God is already there ahead of us.\n\nTom Ogburn is senior pastor at First Baptist Church in downtown Knoxville.

Along with the award, Marshall was presented with a $50 check and a $250 gift card to A&W Office Supply.\n\nPrincipals nominate a deserving teacher and a Rotary Club committee looks at educational history, professional development and best practices in demonstrating innovative approaches to reach students. “Their community involvement, commitment to their school community and the extra things they do,” said Rachel Ford, club director. “Lindsay Marshall has worked tirelessly, (and is) deserving of the accolade.”\n\nPrincipal Ina Langston was at the Rotary luncheon to talk about Marshall’s contribution at Fountain City Elementary.\n\nLangston said Marshall’s students come from foreign places, speaking little or no English at home. “They come to our Fountain City community with great needs, not least of which is to communicate in a language so very different from what they know,” she said.\n\n“Imagine a child that is 6 years old walking into a building where they can only understand gestures and facial expressions for a very confusing seven hours,” said Langston. “It doesn’t take Ms. Marshall long to put a smile on their little faces. She gets more hugs than we get in a month. She inspires her little ones in so many different ways.”\n\nMarshall stepped to the podium to say a few words. “Allow me to tell you a little bit about the students I teach,” she said. “They come from countries such as India, Colombia, Honduras and Moldova ...\n\n“They are hardworking and bright and often have to work twice as hard as their classmates to understand. Some of them have survived trauma I could never understand. I admire them more than they’ll ever know. When they first step into a classroom you can see the apprehension on their faces. I am the bridge between the life they knew before and what they will become.”\n\nRegardless of their grade-level, Marshall teaches her ELL students how to walk in the hallway, fill a lunch tray and ask permission to use the bathroom — lessons usually mastered in kindergarten. “They are the first lessons I teach them,” she said. “In the ELL classroom we focus on reading, writhing, science, math, and communication.”\n\nWhile Marshall’s first responsibility is to advocate for her students by making individualized learning programs, she also recognizes the importance of reaching out to their families. “We know the more we can get the families into our building, the better the outcome,” she said.\n\n“What has stuck with me are the lessons they have taught me,” said Marshall. “It’s these children who have been my greatest mentors. they have taught me perseverance, patience through the joys and the heartaches.”\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\nFirst Friday features Maryville artist at Rala, more\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nAnother First Friday approaches, and galleries and shops in the downtown area will be bursting with the best of local artists’ work. There’ll be live music playing, and you can munch finger food while you stroll, view and perhaps pick something out that you just have to have.\n\nOf special note are two exhibits.\n\nThe UT Downtown Gallery will present works from the Ewing Gallery permanent collection. The Ewing Gallery has many works by former undergraduate and graduate students. This exhibition features a selection of works from every department in the School of Art created from the 1970s to the present day – close to half a century of art. With the gallery having been closed to the public during the month of July, this exhibition is eagerly anticipated.\n\nDown the hill, on Jackson Avenue, Rala will offer a show by Maryville artist Jon Pemberton, who works in mixed media.\n\n“I have been making art of some kind since I can remember,” Pemberton, who teaches special education at Sevier County High School, says. “I have been making art to show for about 15 years. I started by painting vintage hardshell suitcases, and was fortunate enough to tap into the Indie Craft circuit and sell in some really cool cities like Washington, D.C.; Cincinnati, Brooklyn, Asheville and Knoxville.\n\n“I love to work with a bunch of different materials. Wood, spray paint and acrylic paint are my main materials right now, but I also play around with acrylic Plexiglas and found objects. I really like creating layers with different materials so that there is a sense of dimension.”\n\nPemberton’s wood cutouts of people, animals and things are painted using his own unique process. “When I was in high school, I got into graffiti. I learned how to cut three color stencils and have been using them ever since. I take source images and block them into high, medium, and low tones, then paint them in a monochromatic scheme.”\n\nThe Yakima, Wash., native moved to Tennessee after meeting his wife, Elisabeth. “I moved to be closer to her and fell in love with East Tennessee. It is my home now.” The couple, married 12 years, have two children – Ashlynn, 12, and Owen, 7.\n\nThe staff at Rala says, “we always eagerly await Jon’s creations – not only to see which pop icons he chooses to immortalize but also to see the different shapes and types of art he creates.”\n\nOther First Friday galleries include the Emporium Center, WDVX Studios, The Art Market Gallery, many more. If you haven’t been to a First Friday event, you might be surprised at how lively downtown has become. Why not take it all in, support local artists and have summer evening fun at the same time?\n\nJon Pemberton at Rala happens from 6 to 9 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 3 at Rala, 112 Jackson Ave., and the artist will be in attendance.

Apropos to Karns, the mural features a whimsical beaver among the streamside plants.\n\nNear the mural is an educational installation with information on streamside buffers.\n\nMore than 50 community members helped with the project, from making tiles to assembling the mural in the hot summer sun during a July 4 work week.\n\nProject manager Stephanie Carlson said she thought her biggest challenge would be funding the project. She said she was pleasantly surprised to find the community stepped up to help fund the project and she was able to get a grant to fully fund the mosaic installation.\n\n“We had a lot of luck with the community sponsorships, which I though was going to be a challenge, but the community really stepped up especially the Beaver Creek Kayak Club, Alisa Pruett Realtor, District 6 Democrats, Roger Kane, among others. Plus, we got a grant from the Tennessee Arts Commission and the project was fully funded. Really this project was a lot easier than I thought it would be.\n\n“The goal of the mural is to bring awareness to the beauty and light that could occupy our steams if we took care of them. The trees, shrubs and flowers are all native to our region and are part of a healthy streamside buffer.\n\n“We believe that this art installation is a great way to beautify the area, increase appreciation for the arts and the environment, and connect people to their watersheds.”\n\nIt was smiles and laughter all around for about 50 community members at a cookout sponsored by Knox County Stormwater Management after the ribbon cutting.\n\nInfo: www.knoxcounty.org/stormwater\n\nMore:Back to school 2018: Meet the new Knox County school principals\n\nOPINION\n\nGrowing up is child's play – but only to a child\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nI’m in Nashville visiting my grandchildren and their parents. I offer my widest smile to 2-month-old Clara and get a toothless grin in return. Her eyes are big and bright; she stares up at me while I talk to her in a soft voice. She coos in response and I feel like I’ve won a prize.\n\nAll the while, Simon is playing with his cars and his superhero action figures. He calls them super-herios (rhymes with Cheerios) but I don’t correct him. There’s time enough for that.\n\nWhen Clara gets hungry I hand her to Jordan and sit down next to Simon. I watch him line up his cars in a precise order only he understands. He’s very serious about his work. “You have to take turns,” he says to no one in particular. “Spider-Man, you’re next. Hulk, you have to wait.”\n\nWhen he tires of cars and super-herios, we decide to go for a walk. I try to help him walk down the steps but he brushes my hand aside. “No, Ya-Ya,” he tells me. “I’m big now. I can do it myself.” I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nHe’s too big to hold my hand when we walk down the driveway, but he lets me help him cross the street. We walk to the park together where I learn he’s too big for the little slide, too big for the baby swing, and too big to use a sippy-cup.\n\nHe remains big most of the afternoon but sometimes, I discover, he can be very small. “I can’t wash my hair,” he says in solemn voice, “I’m just a baby.” He’s also too little for daycare, too little to eat all his dinner, and too little for his swim lessons.\n\n“I can’t go under the water,” he tells his swim instructor. “I’m just a little boy. And I just got my hair cut.”\n\nI smile as I listen to him try to navigate a world where he is either a giant or a Lilliputian, depending on the circumstances. He wants to be big most of the time, but sometimes, when the world seems frightening, it’s easier to be a baby living under the protection of his loving parents.\n\nI’m still thinking about Simon, later that night, when Zack calls. He sounds happy but stressed so I encourage him to list his worries.\n\nHe’s editing his master’s thesis and trying to schedule classes for the first semester of his PhD program. He and his new wife are getting ready to move into their apartment and he’s trying to coordinate a truck rental, so they can move their furniture. He has a paper he needs to write and submit to a conference, and he still has to switch his utilities to his new place.\n\nI listen and say everything he needs to hear. “You have a lot on your plate” and “I’m sure it will all come together.”\n\nThen with a sigh Zack says, “I’m too young for all this grownup stuff. I’ve been doing way too much adulting lately. Life was easier when you did everything for me,” he adds with a laugh.\n\nA smile spreads across my face when I hear the parallel between Zack’s words and Simon’s.\n\nMaybe it’s true, not just for toddlers and twenty-somethings, but for me too. It’s nice to be a grownup and to chart my own course, but every now and then, I wish I were little. There are days I’d happily trade bank statements and car maintenance for an afternoon nap and a graham-cracker snack.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snowcolumn@aol.com.\n\nMore:Check out last week's blog here!\n\nMore:Victor Ashe: Sleazy anti-Burchett mailer ought to disqualify Jimmy Matlock", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/23"}]}

An engine firing Friday helped position the lander toward the moon and allowed flight controllers to determine that the engine burn and throttle systems needed to land were functioning as intended.\n\nThe tests set the Odysseus craft up to enter lunar orbit Wednesday ahead of its landing Thursday near the moon's south polar region.

Astrobotic attempted to salvage the mission by having its probe explore what it could of space, but the malfunction eventually forced the company to abandon its plan.\n\nThe lander may not have been able to touch down on the moon, but NASA still said scientists were able to gather important data on the \"interplanetary environment\" before it was sent on Jan. 18 plummeting to Earth, burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Peregrine lander's mission also drew highly-publicized scrutiny from the Navajo Nation, whose members objected to the human remains it carried on board bound for a lunar burial.\n\nNASA's interest in lunar missions\n\nIf a private company like Intuitive Machines can pull off the mission, it would open the door for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nBoth Odysseus and Peregrine are part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. With a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028, the program will see NASA more often partnering with private companies to help place scientific payloads on the lunar surface.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its since-delayed Artemis program. Among the cargo are tools to test plume-surface interactions and measure both radio astronomy and space weather interactions with the lunar surface.\n\nIntuitive Machines also is serving customers like Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander, as well as sculptor Jeff Koons, who is sending up 125 inch-sized moon figurines in a see-through cube, according to reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nThe mission, and others like it ahead, is intended to pave the way for human exploration of the moon.\n\nNASA delayed plans for Artemis II until 2025, which is when a group of spacefarers could finally embark on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The mission would be the precursor to Artemis III years later, when another crew of astronauts will set out to land on the lunar surface itself.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Next up: Intuitive Machines and its IM-1 Nova-C lunar lander, expected to launch as early as mid-February.\n\nThe race by private companies to soft-land an uncrewed American spacecraft on the moon continues with Nova-C, targeted to touch down at crater Malapert A, near the moon’s south pole.\n\nNova-C will carry experiments to aid future lunar explorers and technology for navigation beacons that could help guide lunar landings.\n\nRecent landers have been boxlike in appearance, but the 2-ton Nova-C is different. The lander is a six-legged, six-sided upright cylinder, more than 13 feet high and 5 feet in diameter. A successful landing will make it the first American spacecraft to touch down on the moon in 50 years.\n\nOn Friday, Japan became the fifth nation, joining the U.S., Russia, China and India, to land a craft on the moon. A problem developed with the lander's solar panels, however, which could cut short its operating time.\n\nHere's what Nova-C lander looks like\n\nThe unique shape is based on NASA's Project Morpheus, a 2010-14 project to develop a vertical takeoff/landing craft.\n\nLike Peregrine, the Nova-C mission is part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, in which the space agency pays private companies to deliver scientific experiments and other payloads to the moon. It's the first of three lunar landings planned by Intuitive Machines as part of the commercial payload services initiative, the company said.\n\nThe lander was delivered to the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida, in December. The craft will be launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nWhat happened to the Peregrine lander?\n\nPeregrine was launched by United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral at 2:18 a.m. EST Jan. 8. ULA is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\nThe lander separated from the rocket about 50 minutes after launch and continued toward the moon, but a fuel leak developed about six hours later.\n\nIt had been scheduled to land on Feb. 23 but burned up in a controlled reentry over the South Pacific Ocean at about 4:04 p.m. Jan. 18.\n\nAstrobotic made the crash announcement on Jan. 14, six days and 16 hours after the spacecraft’s launch and subsequent fuel leak that prevented it from landing on the moon. It's still not clear what caused the fuel leak, though a faulty valve is suspected. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe craft was able to successfully deploy some payloads which collected and transmitted data.\n\nThe landing was part of NASA's preparation for its next two manned missions, Artemis II and III. Artemis II will circle the moon, and Artemis III will land near the lunar south pole.\n\nNASA announced Jan. 9 that Artemis II is pushed back to September 2025. Artemis III is delayed until September 2026. The delays are unrelated to the Peregrine crash.\n\nWhy did Astrobotic crash Peregrine lander?\n\nAstrobotic considered changing Peregrine’s orbit to miss the Earth but decided to end the lander’s mission instead. Engineers sought to protect satellites in Earth orbit and avoid creating additional debris in cislunar space, Astrobotic said.\n\nCislunar space is the expanse between the Earth, moon and the moon’s orbit. An increase in lunar missions in recent years has increased the number of spent rockets, satellites and other discarded items in orbit.\n\nPeregrine had about 20 payloads of various types, NASA says, and had been scheduled to operate for about 10 days after touchdown.\n\nObjectives included study of the lunar exosphere, thermal properties and the amount of hydrogen in the lunar soil. Magnetic fields and radiation also would have been measured.\n\nAstrobotic is preparing a larger lander called Griffin that is expected to launch late this year using a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nThe company says Griffin is the largest lander since the Apollo lunar module. It will carry NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole.\n\n___________\n\nCONTRIBUTING Claire Thornton\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Associated Press; Astrobotic Technology; NASA; Intuitive Machines; space.com; Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum; spacenews.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/19/odysseus-lunar-lander-photos-nasa-spacex-launch/72658140007/", "title": "Odysseus lunar lander sends back first photos after SpaceX launch", "text": "The Odysseus moon lander has beamed home some selfies of the spacecraft juxtaposed in front of Earth as it makes its way to the lunar surface.\n\nThe images were captured a day after Houston-based Intuitive Machines' uncrewed lander launched aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on its way to potentially become the first commercially-built craft to ever reach the moon.\n\nThe space company shared four images Saturday on the social media site X. The photos were chosen from hundreds of images captured by the lander's cameras, which were programmed to take five images every five minutes for the first two hours after separating from the SpaceX's rocket's second stage.\n\n\"Out of all the images collected, Intuitive Machines chose to show humanity’s place in the universe with four wonderful images we hope to inspire the next generation of risk-takers,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nInteractive maps:How long will the solar eclipse darkness last in your city?\n\nOdysseus remains on track for a Thursday moon landing attempt\n\nNamed for the Greek hero of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" Odysseus has the potential to be a history-making spacecraft if it touches down on the moon.\n\nNo commercially-built lander has ever made it to the lunar surface, and it's been more than 50 years since the last American moon landing in 1972 as part of NASA's Apollo program.\n\nBut Intuitive Machines' lander is hardly the first to make the attempt.\n\nIn January, Pittsburgh-based aerospace company Astrobotic sent its Peregrine lander on a doomed mission to the moon that ended with the spacecraft burning up in Earth's atmosphere days later. Shortly after separating from the United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, Peregrine's propulsion began leaking a critical amount of propellant that forced Astrobotic to eventually abandon plans of landing on the moon.\n\nThe outlook for Odysseus appears to be more optimistic, with Intuitive Machines reporting that the spacecraft is still on track to attempt a moon landing Thursday near the moon's south polar region. Scientists have long been interested in studying the south pole due to the presence of water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nAfter liftoff Thursday, the 14-foot-tall Nova-C lander reached its intended orbit about 48 minutes later and established communication with ground control in Houston, Intuitive Machines said. A successful engine firing Friday helped position the lander toward the moon and allowed flight controllers to determine that the engine burn and throttle systems needed to land were functioning as intended.\n\nFlight controllers reported Sunday that Odysseus \"continues to be in excellent health\" as they prepare for a Wednesday \"lunar orbit insertion\" a day ahead of the touchdown.\n\nThe landing will be streamed on the company's IM-1 mission landing page. Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander, will also take over the exterior of the Las Vegas sphere during the landing attempt, according to a press release.\n\n“We are keenly aware of the immense challenges that lie ahead,” Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said in a statement after the launch. “However, it is precisely in facing these challenges head-on that we recognize the magnitude of the opportunity before us: to softly return the United States to the surface of the Moon for the first time in 52 years.”\n\nNASA hopes mission paves the way for astronauts to return to moon\n\nIntuitive Machines' lunar mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies to place scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface.

The students hope the device accomplishes a trio of \"firsts:\"\n\nThe first university student-built project to land on the moon.\n\nThe first device to photograph a \"selfie\" of a spacecraft making an extraterrestrial landing.\n\nThe first device to use Wi-Fi on the lunar surface.\n\n“EagleCam will probably record enough data for Ph.D. students to analyze in dissertations for the next 10 years,” Troy Henderson, EagleCam faculty advisor and director of Embry‑Riddle’s Space Technologies Laboratory, said in a press release. “The scientific return is enormous.”\n\nThirsk also noted Toronto-based Canadensys Aerospace built a miniaturized dual-camera lunar imaging suite carried by Odysseus. The goal: Capture some of the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy's center from the moon's surface.\n\nMoon-landing technology 'still difficult'\n\nFounded in 2013, Intuitive Machines is a Houston-headquartered vendor company in NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.\n\n\"This mission’s primary objective is to deliver a variety of payloads to the Moon’s south pole region, a part of the Moon that remains unexplored,\" an Intuitive Machines press kit said.\n\n\"These payloads include scientific instruments and technology demonstrations that aim to pave the way for future human and robotic exploration of the Moon,\" the press kit said.\n\nOdysseus should orbit the Moon about a dozen times before descending to the surface, the company reported.\n\n\"This upcoming mission will certainly help us to test and validate some of the landing technology — which is still difficult,\" Thirsk said of Intuitive Machines' lander.\n\nIn 1996, Thirsk flew aboard space shuttle Columbia on the 17-day STS-78 mission. Thirteen years later, he became the first Canadian to serve a long-duration mission aboard the ISS.\n\nFor the latest news from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, visit floridatoday.com/space.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY .

Fortunately, those who were left filled with awe and excitement of the vast cosmos that surrounds Earth have even more to look forward to in the year ahead.\n\nHere's a look at five cosmic stories to expect in 2024, from a rare eclipse to astronauts' first return to the moon in decades.\n\nRecapping 2023's wild year in space:UFOs, commercial spaceflight, rogue tomatoes and more\n\nNASA's return to the moon\n\nIn the years ahead, NASA will aim to put astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the Apollo missions came to an end five decades ago.\n\nBut before that can happen, the space agency must first send a group of spacefarers on a trip around the moon and back. Last year, NASA introduced the three Americans and one Canadian who will be part of the Artemis II mission, which is set to launch as soon as November.\n\nTheir 10-day journey spanning 600,000 miles will see them circumnavigating the moon – but never touching down – to test the capabilities of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and a crewed Orion spacecraft needed for deep space exploration.\n\nThe Artemis program represents NASA's renewed interest in lunar missions. When the day comes that the crew of Artemis III are able to set foot on the lunar surface, they will be the first Americans to do so since the last Apollo mission in 1972.\n\nUncrewed lunar missions ahead\n\nIndia became the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the lunar surface last year after the successful touch-down of its Chandrayaan-3 probe.\n\nEven more attempts to send uncrewed landers to the moon are slated for 2024.\n\nJapan will make the first attempt Jan. 20 after its small spacecraft called SLIM launched in September and continues to orbit the moon.\n\nWhile the United States hasn't attempted to land a vehicle on the moon's surface since the 1970s, NASA is a customer for two private companies attempting the feat this year. Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh company, will launch its Peregrine lunar lander on Jan. 8, which could land in February. Houston-based Intuitive Machines will launch another lander aimed for the moon’s south pole as early as mid-February.\n\nTotal solar eclipse over North America\n\nOn April 8, a total solar eclipse will travel on a diagonal path, cutting across a wide swath of North America and shrouding millions of people in darkness.\n\nIt's been six years since the last time the moon completely blocked the sun's light from reaching a portion of the United States, and it will be even longer until it does so again. After this year, the rare celestial event won't occur for another 20 years, NASA says.\n\nThe moon's shadow will first blanket Mexico's pacific coast in darkness as it travels northeast into Texas. The path of totality will cover another 11 U.S. states before ending in Maine and crossing into the maritime provinces of Canada.\n\nWhile spectators will want to don specialized protective eyewear to shield themselves from the sun's powerful rays, a total eclipse is a rare opportunity to view the event with the naked eyes. Just make sure the moon is completely blocking the sun's face before removing your specs.\n\nEra of commercial spaceflight grows\n\nLast year, Virgin Galactic helped usher in the dawn of commercial spaceflight by regularly offering rides to the edge of space for paying civilians.\n\nThe company owned by billionaire Richard Branson, as well as its competitors like Blue Origin, are expected to continue selling tickets to wealthy customers who crave the experience of a few minutes of weightlessness – coupled with a view of Earth that can't be beat.\n\nVirgin Galactic's sixth civilian customer mission is expected in January, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin will likely resume civilian flights at some point in 2024 after a successful uncrewed science mission in December.\n\nElsewhere, private astronauts continue to travel to the International Space Station to conduct scientific experiments.\n\nAs early as January, the first all-European commercial astronaut crew will embark for the ISS as part of Houston-based company Axiom's third mission to the station.\n\nLast August, NASA itself teamed up with Elon Musk's SpaceX to begin offering a commercial crew program ferrying trained astronauts to the ISS for science missions. The eighth crew is targeted to launch no earlier than mid-February\n\nThe partnership with private industry frees up NASA to focus on building spacecraft and rockets for deep space missions.\n\nSolar activity:NOAA detects largest solar flare since 2017\n\nInvestigating Jupiter's moon for signs of life, and other cosmic missions\n\nNASA's largest spacecraft developed for planetary missions will make its long-awaited departure later this year to Jupiter's moon Europa, which scientists believe may have the right conditions to support life.\n\nWhile Europa's exterior is icy, it conceals a vast ocean beneath the surface that could harbor signs of life. The Europa Clipper, which will launch in October, is hoping to find them.\n\nIt won't be until 2030 that the uncrewed craft arrives at Europa. When it gets there, it won't land on the surface itself, but will instead conduct numerous flybys near the surface to scan and study the moon.\n\nNASA also plans to send two crafts to Mars sometime in 2024 to orbit and study the red planet, and for its EscaPADE mission, while the European Space Agency will launch its Hera mission in October to fly by a decimated asteroid.\n\nThe Hera mission is a follow-up to a NASA mission from 2022 in which the space agency successfully crashed a spacecraft into an asteroid known as Dimorphos. The earlier mission was the first test of the agency's planetary defense strategy for asteroids, dubbed the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, and now the ESA wants an up-close look of how it went.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

But then Nike announced last Friday that the Day One version of the Ja 1s would come out while Ross was in town. It seemed like fate, like a sign he had to do the sort of thing he’d never done before.\n\nHe was going to drive around an unfamiliar city looking for a shoe store that had them in stock.\n\n“It’s because of Ja. He’s amazing,” Ross said. “I don’t even like pink, but I’m going to grab these.”\n\nAll things Grizzlies: Latest Memphis Grizzlies news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe long-awaited release of Morant’s first signature shoe was equal parts stunning and subdued throughout the city, a reflection both of Morant’s star power and the problems he has encountered off the court that led to a more restrained launch by Nike.\n\nSelect stores throughout Memphis were part of Nike’s initial retail release. The Ja 1s, which cost $110, will be available in many more retail stores starting May 4. They were also made available Wednesday on the Nike app and website. By 11:30 a.m., the Nike app was already out of stock on all sizes.\n\nIt left those in the know locally scrambling, calling from place to place to figure out what store had them and what store didn’t.\n\nPLAYOFF SUBPLOT:Taylor Jenkins, Darvin Ham are best friends but for Grizzlies-Lakers 'I can't wait to kick his tail'\n\nOPINION:The Grizzlies are Jaren Jackson Jr.’s team right now, even if Ja Morant plays\n\nThat’s why, as Mona Owens approached the cash register at Hibbett Sports on Summer Avenue at around 10:35 a.m., she feared the worst answer to her question.\n\n“Do you have any Ja’s left?” she asked.\n\nAt which point, employee Kierra Williams explained how there were people lined up out the door even before she arrived at work two hours earlier. They had 60 pairs of Morant’s shoes when the doors to the store opened. They had four pairs left 35 minutes later, all in kid’s sizes.\n\n“Give me the 4.5,” Owens said with an urgency that suggested this was not the beginning of her quest.\n\n“My boss and my godson got me running from store to store. It’s chaos,” she then explained to a Commercial Appeal reporter watching this unfold. “I want one now because I see the colors.”\n\nAt the Hibbett Sports on Austin Peay Highway in Raleigh, word had gotten out to customers that it had a supply of Morant’s shoes.\n\nWhile employees were trying to assist those who came in the store looking for Ja 1s, others were calling, trying to be one of the first ones to get a pair. The men’s sizes were sold out within 45 minutes of the store’s opening.\n\n“Our phone has not stopped ringing … Everybody has been looking for them,” sales associate Michelle Patterson said. “We only get traffic like that when it’s Jordan’s, so needless to say, Morant is doing his thing.”\n\nAt the Foot Locker, customers were told they could only buy one pair that day.\n\nIt prompted one man, who asked not to be named, to buy one pair of shoes, go to his car, change his clothes, and attempt to buy another pair. He had two young children at home and both wanted Morant’s shoes.\n\nMany had been anticipating this for weeks, partly because Nike pushed back the release date.\n\n“He was getting in so much trouble, I thought these would never come out,” said Jackson Estes as he waited in line.\n\nA few people behind him stood Trey Draper, the former Memphis basketball player and a member of Morant’s inner circle. He had already gotten a pair of Morant’s shoes for himself weeks ago. But it was his father’s birthday, and he wanted to deliver something special to his doorstep.\n\nSo Draper called around, found out what stores still had them in stock and marveled at everyone else inside Oak Court Mall who had done the same.\n\n“This is hilarious,” he said. “It’s a dream come true.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/brittney-griner-released/index.html", "title": "WNBA star Brittney Griner released from Russian detention in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention, President Joe Biden said Thursday.\n\nGriner was released in a prisoner swap that involved Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\n“She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home,” Biden said at the White House Thursday morning alongside Griner’s wife, Cherelle. “After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under untolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.”\n\nBiden acknowledged that Griner’s release was occurring while Whelan remained imprisoned, saying that Whelan’s family “have to have such mixed emotions today.”\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nGriner is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas, a US official told CNN.\n\nGriner’s February arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin that played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the same time that the US enacted crippling sanctions in response to the Ukraine war, US diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations to try to secure the release of both Griner and Whelan.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said.\n\nThe prisoner swap occurred in Abu Dhabi Thursday, according to senior Biden administration officials. A joint statement from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said the Gulf countries played a role mediating the exchange between the US and Russia.\n\nAsked when Griner would be home following his remarks, Biden indicated it would be in the next “24 hours.” As for what he would say to Whelan’s family, he said, “We’re speaking to them.”\n\nCherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife’s release and said she was “overwhelmed with emotions.”\n\nBoth she and Brittney Griner “will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today,” she added.\n\nThe Griner family echoed those sentiments in a statement Thursday night.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers - including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the family said. “We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch President Biden give remarks after Brittney Griner release 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nWhelan told CNN in an exclusive phone call from the penal colony where is being held in a remote part of Russia that he was “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release. Whelan said he was happy that Griner was released, but that he “was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.”\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” they are going to try with the Russians in an effort to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe official said there is a recognition that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians thus far – and didn’t rule out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said. “We have made clear to the Russians, that we at least are open to talking about that which is at our disposal, that which we could actually deliver. It would be somebody in our custody.”\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\n“This is a gift to Vladimir Putin, and it endangers American lives,” tweeted House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Leaving Paul Whelan behind for this is unconscionable.”\n\nGriner – who, for years, had played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – had been detained since February, when she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\n‘The only deal we could make right now’\n\nMonths and months of “difficult” negotiations with the Russians culminated in Thursday’s prisoner swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in recent weeks that an opening existed to secure the American basketball player’s release.\n\nThe final deal itself came together over the past 48 hours, the officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence.\n\nThat opening, while a significant breakthrough, was still a “painful” one, the officials said: in exchange for a convicted arms dealer, Russia would only agree to release Griner, leaving another American – Whelan – behind. In multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nBiden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden was briefed throughout the morning as he awaited confirmation that Griner was back in US hands, a US official said. Once that happened, Biden spoke with Griner from the Oval Office, with Cherelle Griner, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also on the call, a second official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brittney Griner's wife speaks about WNBA star's release 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said, because Russia said it has been handling their cases differently based on what each has been accused of.\n\nThe Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.\n\nIn the end, when it was clear Russia was going to refuse on Whelan, the US had to accept it.\n\n“It was a choice to get Brittney or nothing,” the US official said.\n\nThe official says that was a “difficult decision” for Biden, but again, one he felt he had to make.\n\nGriner was moved from the penal colony to Moscow within the last 48 hours. Thursday morning, she boarded a plane for the United Arab Emirates. Upon arriving there, she was met on the tarmac by US officials, including special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens. She was in “an extremely upbeat mood” and “all smiles” and “grateful.”\n\nWhelan family ‘devastated’\n\nWhelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. Whelan had been carrying out his sentence at a different labor camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow, where he told CNN in June 2021 he spent his days working in a clothing factory that he called a “sweatshop.”\n\nWhelan’s family expressed happiness at the news that Griner is on her way home but said Thursday they are “devastated” that he was left behind.\n\n“It’s a great day for the families of the wrongfully detained and we feel wonderful for them,” David Whelan, Paul’s brother, said on “CNN This Morning.” “But we do worry about what’s in Paul’s future. I think it’s become clear that the US doesn’t have any concessions that the Russian government wants for Paul. So I’m not really sure what the future holds.”\n\nThe Biden administration told Whelan’s family ahead of the Griner announcement, David Whelan said.\n\nIn an email to the media, David Whelan said his family was “devastated” at the news and increasingly worries that Paul won’t survive the rest of his sentence.\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news, according to senior administration officials.\n\nEarlier this year, after the US secured the release of Trevor Reed, another American who’d been detained in Russia since 2019, Paul Whelan expressed frustration through a statement shared by his parents.\n\n“Why was I left behind?” Whelan said in April. “While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brother of Paul Whelan reacts after sibling remains detained in Russia 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of Death’ included in swap\n\nBout has returned home to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nIt was a US decision to have the exchange happen in Abu Dhabi, an official familiar with the discussion said. “Russia was happy with it,” then UAE facilitated and provided the venue.\n\nWhen Putin and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, met in Russia in October, one of the issues they discussed was prisoner exchanges, and there was an agreement that the UAE could be helpful on the topic, a senior UAE official told CNN.\n\nThe US was aware that MBZ planned to raise the topic with Putin and there was nothing but encouragement from the US side, the official said.\n\n“There was criticism of the Putin meeting at the time. But that meeting is part of the reason that Griner was released today,” the official said.\n\nIn his statement Thursday, Biden thanked the United Arab Emirates for its help with the exchange.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement that the two countries were involved in joint mediation efforts leading to the prisoner swap. The statement said that the “success of the mediation efforts is a reflection of the mutual and solid friendship that connects both countries with the United States of America, and the Russian Federation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch interview with Viktor Bout 13 years ago from Thai jail after US sting operation 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked about the role of Saudi Arabia, US officials suggested a number of countries were involved.\n\n“We have and I’m sure we’ll continue to lean on partners around the world to work this through with us and to give us their ideas and to impress upon the Russians how important it is to us to resolve these sorts of cases. We appreciate when those partners do help us,” an administration official said.\n\nBout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death,” is a former Soviet military officer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Moscow had slammed his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased” and Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nSteve Zissou, Bout’s lawyer in the US, told CNN on Thursday that the prisoner swap between Griner and his client was “fair.”\n\n“As I have urged for some time, given the 15 long years that Viktor Bout has been in custody since the United States government targeted him in 2006, his exchange for Brittney Griner, who has only been in custody for a few months, is fair,” Zissou said in a statement.\n\nZissou told CNN said that his legal team knew a swap was imminent 24 hours ago.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Jeremy Herb Mj Lee Kevin Liptak", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Jeremy Herb", "Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm death toll rises to 37 in Buffalo as criticism arises over ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022. Jeffrey T.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/03/my-shoes-dirty-studies-suggest-theyre-covered-fecal-bacteria/1637780001/", "title": "Are my shoes dirty?

But this weekend, there's more on the line.\n\nWith questions swirling about the company's strategy and rising competition, investors will be scrutinizing every data point more than usual — including the length of every line outside Apple stores — as two new iPhones go on sale Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This launch is more important than the past couple because of the fall in Apple's stock price,\" said Brian Colello, an equity analyst at Morningstar. \"During virtually every other launch, the outlook for the company has been more optimistic than what we see today.\"\n\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone 5 a year ago, the stock was trading above $700. Since then, it has slumped by a third and closed at $472.30 Thursday.\n\nSince Silicon Valley legend Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone in 2007, the device has taken the mobile phone market by storm. But rivals, led by Samsung, have begun to catch up, in part by making cheaper smartphones that run on Google's free Android operating system.\n\nThat's sparked concern that Apple's iPhones are too pricey for developing markets such as China. This worry was exacerbated by the unveiling of the iPhone 5c earlier this month, which is a cheaper version of the new iPhone 5s but still deemed too expensive for developing markets.\n\nA near riot broke out when the iPhone 4S made its debut in Beijing in January 2012. But by late Thursday night, there was not even a line outside Apple's flagship Beijing store. And this was at 10.30 p.m. when the store's Sanlitun area buzzed with many evening revelers for the Mid-Autumn Festival, a public holiday.\n\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone 5 last year, the company sold 5 million units during the first weekend. This year, Apple is launching two phones and releasing them in more countries, including China, at the same time. This has Wall Street looking for a higher number from this weekend.\n\nCiti research analyst Glen Yeung estimated that Apple will sell about 7.75 million units of the iPhone 5s and 5c combined over the launch weekend.\n\nMorningstar's Colello and Will Power of RW Baird are looking for 7 million, while Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray forecasts 5 million to 6 million units.\n\n\"The 5 (million)-6 million range may be viewed by some as a disappointment, given that it will include China as a launch country for the first time,\" Munster wrote in a recent note to investors. \"Demand is healthy, but slightly below where demand was for the iPhone 5.\"\n\nThe sales weekend started first in Australia, which will be followed by 10 other countries, including China, the U.S., Japan and the U.K.\n\nColello considers sales of 7 million iPhones this weekend a baseline that Apple must meet to avoid raising concern about early supplies or customer demand.\n\nLast year, Apple sold 5 million iPhone 5 units during the first weekend, but this did not include China. When the device reached that country later in the year, Apple sold 2 million more units during the initial weekend — for a total of 7 million, according to the Morningstar analyst.\n\nThis year, Apple took pre-orders for the iPhone 5c, starting on Sept. 13. But the company did not release pre-order numbers in the days that followed — something it had done during previous launches. That omission made some investors nervous.\n\n\"The non-disclosure is a mild negative for now, but we prefer to gain further insight into initial demand for Apple's higher-end iPhone 5s before rushing to judgment,\" Colello said.\n\nApple did not make the iPhone 5s available for pre-order, so the first indications of demand for the higher-end device will come this weekend. But analysts are now worried that Apple may not release any sales figures from the weekend — another change from previous launches.\n\n\"Apple not releasing sales figures would be immediately viewed as a disappointment,\" Munster wrote in a note to investors.\n\nStill, the Piper Jaffray analyst said that the supply of iPhone 5s units may be limited because Apple may not have been able to make enough of the new fingerprint sensors that go into the device.\n\n\"If the iPhone 5s sells out early in the weekend, it means demand is healthy and supply is short,\" Munster wrote. \"But if 5s supply lasts through the weekend, it could mean that demand is weaker than expected.\"\n\nDuring last year's iPhone 5 launch, Apple stores in the U.S. largely sold out of the devices by midday Saturday.\n\nContributing: Calum MacLeod in Beijing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2023/02/15/el-paso-police-shooting-inside-cielo-vista-mall-food-court/69908920007/", "title": "Police: Fight between 2 groups led to fatal shooting at El Paso mall", "text": "A random fight between two groups of young men at Cielo Vista Mall on Wednesday night led to a person being killed and three others injured, El Paso police said.\n\nThe fight happened around 5 p.m. when the two groups got into a fight at the mall's food court, El Paso Police Department interim police Chief Peter Pacillas said.\n\nA person in one of the groups then pulled out a gun and fired it, Pacillas said.

The movie theater in the parking lot also was temporarily locked down.\n\nLate into the night, dozens of police officers, some armed with rifles, remained inside and around Cielo Vista Mall and the neighboring Fountains of Farah shopping center.\n\nA SWAT team entered the mall as El Paso police were joined by Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, the U.S. Border Patrol and FBI agents.\n\nCity officials praised the rapid response by law enforcement agencies in the area after the El Paso Police Department issued a citywide tactical alert.\n\nTexas governor, others react\n\nTexas Gov.

Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, responded to Abbott, saying, \"How about gun violence prevention legislation for our community’s security? You promised you would take action after the August 3rd shooting and you’ve done nothing but loosen gun laws. The legislature is in session. Be a man of your word for once and do something!\"\n\nFormer presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke tweeted: \"This shooting at Cielo Vista is painful for El Paso, especially the families of those killed at the nearby Walmart in 2019. I don't know the details yet. But what I do know is that I love this town and I will do everything I can to stop this from happening again.\"\n\nEl Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser tried to reassure the city Wednesday night, saying in a statement, \"As our community faced a shooting threat this evening, our emergency responders, law enforcement officers as well as our agency partners responded immediately to the emergency situation. There is no current threat to our community.\"\n\nAt a news conference later that night, Leeser said the El Paso Police Department was assisted by other area law enforcement agencies in helping secure the community's safety, and he applauded the quick, unified response. He also emphasized that the Police Department is leading the investigation.\n\nOther city of El Paso leaders respond to shooting\n\nEl Paso city Reps. Art Fierro and Joe Molinar were attending a community meeting when they first received word of the scene unfolding at Cielo Vista Mall, Fierro said, and the two made their way to Burges High School to visit the family reunification center.\n\n“First and foremost, my thoughts and prayers go out to all the family and friends,” Fierro said. “We’re just seeing if there’s any way we can volunteer and comfort some of these families.”\n\nArchives from 2021:YouTuber, active-shooter fears and shadows of Aug. 3 meld in Cielo Vista Mall chaos\n\nPeople sheltered in various stores within the mall when the shooting began and were ushered out through one exit once the scene had been secured.

I’ve learned so much hanging out with Tinker.’’\n\nError Jordan: Key figures still argue over who was responsible for Nike deal\n\nHatfield confirms that Jordan does a lot more than cash his Nike royalty checks, which are expected to reach $100 million this year. In fact, Hatfield said, the two recently met at Jordan’s home in Jupiter, Fla., with a second shoe designer and a videographer to go over the final details of the next Air Jordan, model No. 30 of the sneaker line launched in 1984.\n\n“We work conceptually and then we get into prototypes and then we go into the refinement process,’’ Hatfield said. “And only after the refinement process can we sit down and just check all the boxes and Michael says it’s awesome or whatever and then we’re off to the races.\n\n“It’s mind boggling to me even after all these years that Michael is still so interested in the process and the details and so willing to give us time. I think he actually enjoys talking about design. He enjoys contributing to design. And then of course he really, really loves the results.’’\n\nJordan said he would have it no other way.\n\n“The key to the whole process is I have as much input as I did the first day if not more now, if anything,’’ Jordan said. “Because I feel like whoever’s wearing the shoes may not have the understanding of the history and what it took, so I want to make sure everybody understands that. Because to me that’s very authentic.\n\n“If you lose that authenticity, then it’s tough for the consumer to accept. So we stay very authentic with everything we do, from the ads to the new product to all the things.’’\n\nHatfield said the process of creating a signature shoe calls for collaboration.\n\n“We’re trying to improve performance for a particular athlete, but we’re also trying to extract the DNA from that athlete and design it into the shoe,’’ he said. “So in order to do that, you’ve got to talk about personal things and take the time to learn and get to know the people.’’\n\nTheir collaboration began under anxious circumstances. Peter Moore, Nike’s lead creative designer, had just left for Adidas when Hatfield was assigned to the Air Jordan line. He’d spent the previous four years as Nike’s corporate architect.\n\nWhat's bigger than Michael Jordan? Gotta be the shoes\n\nHaving heard Jordan was interested in design, Hatfield talked about his hope for a full collaboration, beyond what took place during the design of the first and second Air Jordans.\n\n“I haven’t been able to get rid of Tinker since,’’ Jordan quipped.\n\nFor Air Jordan 13, Hatfield created designs based on images of a predatory black cat, along the lines of a panther — what Hatfield said he imagined when watching Jordan play basketball. He showed Jordan the designs between a TV commercial shoot Jordan was doing in Los Angeles.\n\n“He stopped me in the middle of this presentation and he just looked at me and he goes, ‘How did you know?’ ” Hatfield recalled. “And I’m like, ‘How did I know what?’ He said, ‘How did you know that only my closest friends call me The Black Cat?’ ”\n\nIt was evidence they were in tune, and apparently still are even though Hatfield declined to reveal anything about Air Jordan 30 — other than he and Jordan collaborated.\n\n“It’s been a long and fun relationship,’’ Hatfield said, “and in some ways led to the innovation that has driven the market.’’\n\nPHOTOS: Nike Air Jordans through the years", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/30"}]}

The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to 10 degrees below zero by daybreak Thursday. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service. Cheyenne, Wyoming, recently dropped 32 degrees in just eight minutes.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022. Abbie Parr/AP\n\nLife-threatening cold\n\nPlaces that will escape the snow, won’t escape the cold. Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Current wind chills across Montana and the Dakotas are as cold as 50 to 60 degrees below zero and will fall even further after dark Wednesday.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the upcoming “historic low temperatures” across the state, with near zero or negative digit wind chills by midday on Friday.\n\nGreg Behrens, of Des Moines, Iowa, tries to stay warm as he makes his way on a snow-covered sidewalk, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa. Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nThe declaration will help “ensure that essential supplies, especially propane can be delivered for both commercial and residential needs,” the governor told reporters.\n\n“Communities across the state are about to see temperatures that they haven’t experienced in a decade or more,” Kemp said.\n\nThe state will be pretreating roads and bridges in anticipation of the inclement weather and officials urged residents to avoid travel if possible.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear also declared a state of emergency, with wind gusts expected to reach 40 to 50 mph on Friday and minus 10 to minus 26 degrees wind chills expected on Saturday. Beshear asked residents to stay off roads and to have a backup heat source.\n\nJackson and Birmingham will both spend more than 80 hours below freezing between Friday and Monday.

This heavy rainfall will slide southward to Southern California on Saturday and Sunday, accompanied by gusty winds of 30 to 50 mph.\n\nResidents told to shelter in place\n\nSeveral small communities in northern California were under evacuation orders and warnings Saturday due to flooding. Three communities near the city of Watsonville were told to evacuate by the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office due to creek flooding, while officials ordered the communities of Paradise Park and Felton to evacuate due to rising levels of the San Lorenzo River.\n\nNeighborhoods near the Santa Rita Creek in Monterey County were put under a warning Saturday afternoon because of concerns the creek “will spill over its banks,” according to the sheriff’s office.\n\nEvacuations from the floodwaters were being conducted Saturday with the help of an armored rescue vehicle in south San Ramon.\n\nResidents in the community of Wilton, roughly 20 miles from Sacramento, were ordered to shelter in place due to the rains and floods.\n\n“Rising water has made roads impassable in the area,” Sacramento County officials said on Facebook, urging those who were already on the road to head to safety and those who were home to “stay at home.”\n\nThe county on Saturday issued a proclamation of local state of emergency for the winter storms, saying the atmospheric river it’s been experiencing has caused “significant transportation impacts, rising creek and river levels and flooding” in the Wilton area.\n\nA flood watch for more than 16 million is in effect including the entire Bay Area and Central Valley though Saturday night. Rain could ease Saturday evening before the calendar turns to 2023.\n\nPotentially historic rainfall\n\nEarlier weather predictions said widespread rainfall accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are expected in northern and central California, but locally higher amounts of 5 to 7 inches are also possible for the foothills.\n\nNorthern California and the central California coast have already received 2 to 4 inches of rain in the last week. The cumulative effect of multiple Pacific storm systems laden with moisture from a potent atmospheric river will make impacts such as flash floods and landslides more likely.\n\nVideos and photos shared by the National Weather Service in San Francisco show fallen trees blocking roadways, and multiple landslides.\n\nIn Oakland, local officials urged people to stay off the roads due to the heavy rain and flooding.\n\n“If you have to travel, use caution.

The Santa Barbara Airport closed Sunday evening due to flooding on the airfield, it said on its website.\n\n“This storm is predicted to be one of the largest and most significant in our county’s history and our goal is to get through it without any fatalities or any serious injuries,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to follow orders and evacuate ahead of possible mudslides.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing. The county set up shelters where evacuees could spend the night.\n\nIn San Diego, Mayor Todd Gloria said during a news conference Sunday that the storm \"has the potential to drop a significant and unusual amount of rainfall on San Diego.\" He added that the city could receive between 2 to 2.5 inches of rain from Sunday night to Tuesday, with some areas possibly getting half an inch of rain per hour.\n\nGloria noted that the storm would be the city's third rain event in two weeks and reissued an evacuation order for low-lying and flood-prone areas within the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Orange County issued an evacuation warning for Silverado Canyon, Williams Canyon and Trabuco Canyons due to heavy rains, and encouraged residents in the area to evacuate, especially those with disabilities, access or functional needs, and with large animals.\n\nDesert communities on high alert\n\nWhile the heaviest rains in the low and high California desert are expected late Monday through Tuesday, the surrounding mountains will be hit earlier, with heavy rain likely beginning Sunday night, and heavy snows expected Monday night.\n\nAbout a quarter- to a half-inch of rain is expected in the western part of the Coachella Valley on Monday and a total of 1 to 1.5 inches through Tuesday. The east valley is forecast to get three-quarters of an inch of rain.\n\nMount San Jacinto is expected to receive up to 3 feet of snow and San Gorgonio a little more. Chances of rain lessen across the Coachella Valley by Wednesday but intermittent showers could occur through the end of the week.\n\nSouthern California schools brace for severe weather\n\nThe weather service forecast up to 8 inches of rainfall across Southern California’s coastal and valley areas, with 14 inches possible in the foothills and mountains.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued for the majority of Los Angeles County, including downtown and where the Grammy Awards are being held along with the east area, according to the weather service in Los Angeles. The alerts are in effect until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\nBy 5 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said up to 1 inch of rain had fallen. \"Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,\" the weather service added.\n\nIn response to the dangerous conditions, some schools said Sunday that instruction would move to online classes.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of students, faculty and staff as its top priority, Cal State Fullerton will pivot to remote classes on Monday, Feb. 5, 2024. Staff are encouraged to work remotely,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia State University Long Beach also said campus operations would be modified due to the severe weather, adding that \"in-person classes may shift to online instruction or alternative assignments, where possible.\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it was planning to open schools as usual Monday. The decision would be reevaluated at 6 a.m. Monday, said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.\n\nTorrential rain could lead to flooding and mudslides\n\nHeavy rain was expected from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast through Southern California on Sunday into Monday, the NOAA Weather Prediction Center said. Rainfall of 2-5 inches and up to 6-10 inches in some spots was likely, the prediction center said. “This will result in considerable flash, urban and small stream flooding with debris flows and mudslides,” the prediction center said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday that heavy rain would be moving into the area: 3-6 inches was expected for the coasts and valleys and up to 6-12 inches in the mountains.\n\n“Due to the numerous mountains and hills, even just a few inches of rain can cause significant flooding,” AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin said. “The greatest risk … is expected across the canyons and hills of Southern California, especially in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles counties.”\n\nStorm's slow pace makes it more damaging\n\nBy lingering over large parts of California, the storm was drenching terrain that was already saturated from the atmospheric river-driven system that hit much of the state Wednesday and Thursday, increasing the chances of flooding.\n\n“The core of the low pressure system is very deep, and it’s moving very slowly and it’s very close to us,'' said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles-area office. \"And that’s why we have those very strong winds. And the slow nature of it is really giving us the highest rainfall totals and the flooding risk.”\n\nHeavy rain is expected in Southern California through Tuesday and there's a chance for showers through Friday, making mudslides and debris flows likely, forecasters say.\n\n“Even if the rain does start to let up on Monday morning, just the sheer amount of rain overnight will cause lingering flooding issues into the morning hours,” Kittell said.\n\nThree children ‘in the eye of the storm’ 400-plus miles away\n\nDoug and Pam Barry were among more than 100,000 Californians without power when an outage hit their Miraloma Park neighborhood in San Francisco on Sunday morning.\n\nThat was far from their biggest concern, though. Their two sons are attending college in Los Angeles and San Diego, respectively, and their daughter Jessica was visiting the youngest son in San Diego when the storm hit. Now she’s hoping her plans to return Sunday to her home in Scottsdale, Arizona, don’t get disrupted.\n\n“We have all three children in the eye of the storm in Southern California,” Doug Barry said. “We texted them yesterday to be careful with the approaching storm. We will get a good storm, but they will have it worse. Rarely do we share the same weather concerns with our children in California who are 400-plus miles away.”\n\nWill harsh weather keep stars from arriving at Grammys?\n\nThose sporting stylish outfits and elaborate hairdos at the Grammy Awards need not fear the wet and windy weather Sunday in Los Angeles, despite the downpour of biblical proportions expected early in the evening.\n\nThe infamous L.A. traffic? That may be another story.\n\nThe traditional red-carpet walk is being held under a roof and tarp outside the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown L.A., where nearly 5 inches of rain are forecast through Tuesday. The National Weather Service's L.A. office is warning of a \"DANGEROUS SYSTEM with major risks to life and property. Substantial flooding.''\n\nThat's bound to make traffic even more of a nightmare than usual, even for the stars. Last year, headliners such as Beyonce and Bad Bunny arrived late after getting caught in traffic, and it wasn't raining.\n\nThough the heaviest rainfall is not expected until 6 p.m. local time, an hour after the Grammys begin, the forecast calls for moderate rain from noon on, in addition to 30-50 mph winds in Los Angeles County.\n\nHeavy snow, powerful winds could lead to whiteout conditions\n\nHeavy, wet snow was expected to spread across the Sierra Nevada on Sunday through Tuesday morning, with snowfall of 2-3 inches per hour, the prediction center said. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph could lead to whiteout conditions in the Southern California mountains, forecasters said.\n\nPalisades Tahoe, a ski resort about 200 miles northeast of San Francisco, said it was anticipating the heaviest snowfall yet this season, with accumulations of 6 inches per hour for a total of up to two feet.\n\nWhat is a Pineapple Express?\n\nA Pineapple Express is the best-known nickname for an atmospheric river, which occurs when the source of the moisture is near Hawaii. When a Pineapple Express hits land in the western U.S. and Canada, it triggers heavy rain and snow. In California, it can lead to several inches of rain in a day.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; Cheri Carlson, Ventura County Star; Kate Franco and Christopher Damien Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2023/08/20/hurricane-hilary-live-updates-storm-nears-baja-palm-springs-road-closures-state-of-emergency-declare/70635806007/", "title": "Hurricane Hilary updates: 1-10 east and west closed amid flooding", "text": "The Coachella Valley — which was under an unprecedented tropical storm warning until it was lifted around 2 a.m. Monday — is experiencing heavy flooding and other damage after Tropical Storm Hilary churned through the region on Sunday.\n\nLatest road closures across the Coachella Valley\n\nSeveral roads continue to be closed due to storm damage and flooding across the Coachella Valley, leaving significant clean-up work to allow residents to travel across the valley again.\n\n“This storm has been unlike anything our community has faced before.

The local state of emergency will last for seven days and is a required step to request state or federal assistance, according to a press release from the city. The State of Emergency will also allow the city to activate its emergency plan.\n\n“Tropical Storm Hilary has threatened local infrastructure and public health and safety, and exceeds the City’s capacity to address the impacts with its own personnel and resources,” the press release stated.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nNational Weather Service extends flash flood warning until 11:30 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service has extended the flash flood warning for the Coachella Valley area until 11:30 p.m. Sunday for the area’s nine cities and surrounding unincorporated areas such as Mecca and Thousand Palms. The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening flash flooding” caused by heavy rain.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nInterstate 10 closed\n\nInterstate 10 is closed due to flooding, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris. The Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park this afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nThousands of IID customers without power\n\nOver 7,000 Imperial Irrigation District customers are currently without power, with storm-related power outages reported across the district’s eastern Coachella Valley and Imperial County service area. Between about 5:30 and 7 p.m., IID reported roughly a dozen separate power outages on its social media accounts, including 1,693 customers in El Centro, 1,107 in the Westmorland/Calipatria area, and 1,190 customers in two different areas of Indio.\n\nThe Indio outages are impacting 572 customers in the area from Madison Street to 50th Avenue and 618 customers in the area from Lingayan Avenue to Peach Street.

Larson Foundation Trauma Center. In one photo, an abandoned golf cart sits submerged in water.\n\nBut Lee Rice, the medical center’s public information officer, said that none of it has affected any patient care areas of the hospital.\n\n“Fortunately, it hasn’t had any impact on our patient care areas,” Rice said. “So, it’s business as usual for us.”\n\nOnline videos showed the inside of Eisenhower with a small amount of water in the back hallways, with towels on the floor to absorb the moisture.\n\nRice said that some of the flooding has merely forced Eisenhower to divert ambulances to another section of the hospital that has not experienced the effects of the ongoing rainfall that has come with Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nEisenhower is in its slower time of year, which is typical during the summer months, Rice said. She added that it has helped Eisenhower avoid any serious challenges during the storm.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Eisenhower closed urgent care facilities in Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and La Quinta but left Emergency Department services open and available to the community as needed.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nCenter of storm nears Coachella Valley\n\nAt 5 p.m., the National Hurricane Center reported the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was located 25 miles south-southwest of Palm Springs and moving north at 23 mph.\n\nAs Hilary moved closer to the Coachella Valley, strong winds have picked up. Palm Desert reported a peak wind gust of 46 mph at 4:20 p.m.\n\nPalm Springs International Airport had a top wind gust of 40 mph at 3:40 p.m.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nDesert Sands, Palm Springs Unified schools closed Monday\n\nAll schools will be closed Monday in two of the Coachella Valley's three districts, Desert Sands Unified and Palm Springs Unified.\n\nIn Coachella Valley Unified School District, the first day of the school year will be Thursday.\n\nXavier College Preparatory High School also said it will be closed Monday, although staff will try to come to campus to assess any damage caused by the storm. The school said it is anticipating some minor damage caused by flooding and leaks.\n\nCollege of the Desert will also be closed on Monday, although classes for the new semester are not set to begin until next week. College of the Desert \"currently has a lot of water and debris on site,\" and the Palm Desert campus has also \"experienced some water intrusion in key areas.\"\n\nSchool officials are asking everyone to remain off campus, and \"no business will be conducted at any location, with the exception of COD’s Maintenance Team and Campus Safety Team, who will help assess the damage and determine any challenges to student or work spaces.\" Regular business is expected to resume on Tuesday.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio and Erin Rode\n\nStorm shelter at Desert Mirage High School\n\nDesert Mirage High School in Thermal is being used as a temporary storm shelter, according to the Coachella Valley Unified School District.\n\nThe shelter is open to the public and includes a dedicated reception area and a cooling zone. The district said it expects the shelter to be open until Monday or Tuesday afternoon, with more information to be sent out as the storm continues.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPalm Springs declares local emergency\n\nPalm Springs City Manager Scott Stiles has declared a local emergency because of the storm, city spokesperson Amy Blaisdell said.\n\nShe said the declaration opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\nCity law gives the manager the authority to proclaim a local emergency, but it must be ratified by the city council within seven days or it becomes invalid.\n\nMore road closures across valley\n\nMore roads are closing across the Coachella Valley as police advise residents not to drive. Closures were being announced frequently; below is only a partial list:\n\nPalm Springs: Police announced the closure of two more roads in Palm Springs. Farrell Drive was closed between Ramon Road and Mesquite Road.\n\nEl Cielo Road was also closed at Mesquite Avenue, while the Dinah Shore Bridge is closed from Palm Springs to Cathedral City. Golf Club Drive is also closed at the Whitewater Wash.\n\nIndian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino were already closed at the washes.\n\nCathedral City: Cathedral Canyon Drive and Dinah Shore Drive were also closed by Cathedral City Police. Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive was already closed.\n\nEast valley: 66th Street was closed between Van Buren Street and Jackson Street. Box Canyon Road from Interstate 10 to the All American Canal was closed in the Mecca area.\n\nEven in areas where roads weren't fully closed, conditions were treacherous. Just after 4 p.m., two of the three eastbound lanes of Highway 111 were closed due to rocks in the road at the Cathedral City-Rancho Mirage border.\n\nPalm Springs Police Lt. Gustavo Araiza advised residents to avoid travel in the city unless absolutely necessary and to drive with extreme caution if they must.\n\n“We don’t need collisions tying up resources,” he said.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio, Jay Calderon\n\nNewsom, Palm Springs officials discuss storm preparedness, bridge request in Sunday visit\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom stopped in Palm Springs on Sunday as Tropical Storm Hilary wrecked havoc on the Coachella Valley. He met with Palm Springs city councilmembers and staff in the city’s emergency operations center.\n\nNewsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California on Saturday to support the Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nThe city posted photos of the visit on its Facebook page Sunday, explaining that city staff updated the governor on the city’s storm preparations while Newsom offered “whatever assistance he could provide to the city.” The post noted that Newsom had been “instrumental in bringing Oakland Urban Search and Rescue and Swift Water California OES Task Force teams to Palm Springs,\" where they were going to be used to assist with rescues during the storm.\n\nThey also discussed the city's request for an elevated bridge on North Indian Canyon Drive over the Whitewater Wash. The Coachella Valley Association of Governments has been trying to secure funding for such a bridge, which would reduce the need for rain and wind-related closures.\n\nPhotos show Newsom adding his name to the Emergency Operations Center sign-in sheet during his visit. Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner, City Councilmember Lisa Middleton, City Manager Scott Stiles, Police Chief Andrew Mills and Fire Chief Paul Alvarado are pictured meeting with Newsom during the visit.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nUpdated rain totals: Palm Desert sees 1.18 inches by 2 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain has moved through the Coachella Valley and brought soaking rains that have flooded many streets and intersections. Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.\n\nPalm Desert 1.18 inches\n\nCathedral Canyon 1 inch\n\nThermal airport 0.91 inches\n\nPalm Springs Airport 0.89 inches\n\nLower Tahquitz Creek 0.86 inches\n\nFlash flood, severe thunderstorm warning issued for some Coachella Valley cities\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSome locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.\n\nAt 1:51 p.m., doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m., doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.\n\nFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\n\nMotorists should turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Heavier rain, winds forecast for Palm Springs area Sunday\n\nThe Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.\n\nNWS Meteorologist Adam Roser said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is \"definitely flash flooding.\"\n\n\"Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,\" he said. \"As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.'\n\nRoser said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.\n\n\"WIth tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,\" he said.\n\nThe rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Roser said.\n\n— Kate Franco, Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nHow much rain has fallen so far?\n\nSo far, Tropical Storm Hilary has brought a light but steady rainfall to the Coachella Valley, but weather forecasts advise the rain should become heavier on Sunday afternoon and evening.\n\nAs of noon, official National Weather Service rain totals included 0.40 at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.46 in Thermal at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, 0.46 in Thousand Palms and 0.36 in Palm Desert.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHilary makes landfall over Baja California\n\nThe now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.\n\nHilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.\n\nThe storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nThe Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.\n\n—The Associated Press\n\nEvacuation order near Banning\n\nRiverside County has issued an evacuation order north of Banning and near the Morongo Reservation as the worst of Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts approach.\n\nThe county's emergency management department announced the order late Sunday morning for the Mias zone in the Apple/ElDorado burn scar.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSplash House says it will carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.\n\n\"We're gonna keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,\" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. \"But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!\"\n\nEvents will be at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.\n\n\"Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,\" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocal and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.\n\nLater, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.\n\n—Eric Hartley\n\nMost flights canceled out of Palm Springs on Sunday\n\nAhead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and WestJet all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.\n\nDelta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.\n\nEight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary within striking distance of Baja early Sunday\n\nThe National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.\n\nMeteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nElizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon.

Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/09/29/hudson-valley-ny-flooding-what-to-know-severe-storms-this-weekend/71001402007/", "title": "Hudson Valley flooding: What to know about severe storms this ...", "text": "Storms that rolled through the Hudson Valley overnight Thursday and intensified Friday morning impacted residents and snarled travel throughout Friday.\n\nWhere is the flooding, traffic worst?\n\nThe storm is expected to continue into the weekend with a coastal flood advisory in place for the region through 11 a.m. Sunday.\n\nParts of the New York State Thruway, Bronx River Parkway, Hutchinson River Parkway, Saw Mill Parkway and the Playland Parkway were partially closed Friday afternoon due to flooding.\n\nThe Thruway Authority reported backed up traffic on the Gov.

The gelding \"went wrong leaving the first turn, pulled up and was vanned off.\" A seventh horse, Freezing Point, was euthanized following an incident in Race 8 on the dirt track.\n\nTwo of the seven total deaths were sudden deaths, four days apart, by the same trainer, Saffie Joseph Jr.\n\nMore:Lord Miles scratched from Kentucky Derby after deaths; Churchill Downs suspends Saffie Joseph\n\nHorses die at racetracks, but they don't die like this.\n\n\"In all my years, I've had one horse die while she was racing,\" a trainer who would only identify as being in the industry for a \"long, long time\" told the Courier Journal. \"The necropsy found she was born with a heart defect.\"\n\nHorse racing is an insular community with private information. Horses and their owners are protected by VCPR or Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationships. It's the horse version of HIPPA. That means when the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission does publish a necropsy, there is no identifying information for which horse it's regarding.\n\nPlus, the culture of horse racing is not to publicly call out others in the industry. The Courier Journal agreed not to name the people we spoke with out of their concern that speaking out could damage their standing in the horse racing community and possibly their jobs.\n\n\"Because you never know when your horse will be next,\" one owner said.\n\nBut sudden death in a horse can happen?\n\n\"It can happen, but two in one week?\" the trainer said. \"Maybe that's just bad luck or maybe it's what the (expletive).\"\n\nThe Courier Journal spoke with nearly a dozen owners, trainers and veterinarians at Churchill Downs on Friday about the deaths. None were willing to be quoted directly, but they all wanted answers. However, it's going to take time to figure out what's really going on here.\n\nIt will take at least two weeks for necropsy results.\n\nNot waiting for results, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission (KHRC) scratched all of Joseph's horses and Churchill Downs suspended the trainer from racing at the track.\n\n“Given the unexplained sudden deaths, we have reasonable concerns about the condition of his horses, and decided to suspend him indefinitely until details are analyzed and understood,” Bill Mudd, president and chief operating officer of Churchill Downs said in announcing the suspension. “The safety of our equine and human athletes and integrity of our sport is our highest priority. We feel these measures are our duty and responsibility.”\n\nThe Kentucky Thoroughbred Association consists of 700 industry members including owners, breeders and trainers.\n\n\"Five deaths at one race track is abnormal,\" said Chauncey Morris, the executive director of the Kentucky Thoroughbred Association. \"Everybody in this sport − especially our organization − is absolutely dedicated to safety and reform and making everything that happens between training and racing better. But, there’s a lot of unknowns that we won’t know until we have full data from the necropsy report.\"\n\nJoseph had already scratched several of his horses before the suspension, which resulted in Lord Miles being removed from the Derby was handed down.\n\n\"If there is something going on over there like contamination — or we don't know what it is — some virus or something, we don't know,\" Joseph said Thursday referencing Keeneland, where his horses were stabled before coming to Churchill Downs. \"We have no answers. I mean, there's a lot of questions. There's a lot of thoughts, but there's nothing right now.\"\n\nMaryland's thoroughbred horseman organization made headlines last month after five horses suffered fatal injuries while racing or training at Laurel Park.\n\n\"Our horses and riders' lives are at risk and our industry's future is on the line. The status quo at Laurel Park cannot continue,\" Tim Keefe, president of the horseman organization wrote in a letter to the racing commission following the deaths.\n\nMorris said the same isn't happening in Kentucky, despite at least three deaths at Keeneland during its spring meet.\n\n\"We do not have those circumstances at either the Keeneland meet or the Churchill Downs meet,\" Morris said regarding the Maryland horsemen raising alarm bells. \"Here in Kentucky, there's a lot more collaboration and communication that happens between the horsemen, the association (the racetracks) and the regulators.\n\n\"It's not by accident that we're the Horse Capital of the World.\"\n\nThe collaboration is also because a horse was euthanized on the race track following the 2008 Kentucky Derby.\n\nNow, Eight Belles has a race named in her memory.\n\nFor all graded stakes races − the top of the top thoroughbreds − the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission does TCO 2 testing, which is considered part of an anti-doping procedure that tests a horse's blood.\n\nAt Churchill, this is done in the stalls. At Keeneland, there's a barn where horses filter through near the paddock.\n\nThere's a high likelihood, one veterinarian told the Courier Journal, that during the investigation into Joseph, the commission will draw TCO 2 samples from other horses.\n\n\"(These deaths are) very sad,\" Morris said. \"There is no horseman on this backside – including Saffie Joseph – that ever wants to lose a horse under any circumstance. ...

Or maybe speed freaks. Drive on any freeway when it's not rush hour, and we might as well be out at PIR.\n\nYes, we've been pedal to the metal ever since 1909 when Arizona auto racing first roared to life at the State Fairgrounds. Dirt tracks littered the Valley in those early days, as we just wanted to get together and see whose jalopy would cross the finish line first.\n\nThese were no-frills facilities like Jordan Speedway at 16th Street and Camelback; Roosevelt Field at 17th Avenue and Roosevelt; Phoenix Midget Speedway at 17th Avenue and Garfield; and another at South Mountain near Central Avenue, among others.\n\nCrown jewel of Phoenix tracks\n\nBut one Phoenix track in particular at the southeast corner of 35th Avenue and Broadway Road captured our imagination for nearly 60 years: Manzanita Speedway.\n\n“For the dirt racers, Manzanita was their jewel in the desert,” says Rich Reininger, a long-time racing enthusiast and local driver coach for Pro AutoSports of Mesa. “Back in the day, the road to the Indianapolis 500 was through an organization known as the United States Auto Club. (The USAC) has a very robust history going back to early days of A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti and Johnnie Rutherford raced as part of that series.”\n\n“And many greats from that historic period went through Manzanita as part of the USAC championship,” he says.\n\nRELATED: Legacy lives on at Arizona Open Wheel Racing Museum\n\nTrack opens\n\nThe quarter- and half-mile earthen ovals followed an existing dog-racing track known as Manzanita Park when it first opened in August 1951.\n\nOwners Rudy Everett and Lawrence Meskimen couldn't make enough money off the dogs, so they followed the popularity of auto racing and reconfigured the 33 acres for cars.\n\nMore than 3,900 attendees showed up opening night and Manzanita's fate was sealed. Roe Mounts drove his 1933 Ford coupe to victory and into local lore winning the first featured race.\n\n“(The track) also gave national attention to locals like Lealand McSpadden who moved here in the early days, lived in Tempe, and carved out his own legend as a racer at Manzanita,” Reininger says. “McSpadden went on to be inducted in the Arizona Motorsports Hall of Fame and the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame.”\n\nMORE: Legacy lives on at Arizona Open Wheel Racing Museum\n\nClosing\n\nSo what happened to beloved old “Manzy,” as it was called? The motors don't roar anymore.\n\nWell, as you might imagine, Phoenix grew up around the site, and Manzy survived the ebbs and flows of the Valley's boom and bust cycles.\n\nThe last “bust” came in 2007-08, not long after Mel Taylor and his son Bobby Taylor, a retired racer, bought the property.\n\nDeclining attendance, and increased opposition to the noise and dust of the track by area residents, forced the Taylors to sell the property in 2009 to heavy equipment provider Southwest Rigging to store its cranes and other machinery. The track's last race was April 11, 2009.\n\nWe'll just have to fulfill our need for speed somewhere other than Manzanita Speedway.\n\nContact “Only in Arizona” columnist Mark Nothaft at marknothaft.onlyinaz@gmail.com.

Drama. Crashes. Tempers.\n\nNASCAR continues to get exactly what it wants with a Chase for the Sprint Cup format that fosters an extreme degree of intensity rarely seen this often in the sport’s history.\n\n“It’s a no-holds-barred, wild, wild west,” Denny Hamlin said.\n\nBut is that really what stock car racing should be at its highest level?\n\nMatt Kenseth deliberately ruined race leader Joey Logano’s chance to punch his ticket to the finale with a win Sunday at Martinsville Speedway, exacting cold revenge for a racing incident which occurred two weeks ago at Kansas Speedway. He drove straight into the corner and kept his foot on the gas until Logano’s car was crushed against the wall.\n\nMatt Kenseth puts Joey Logano into wall at Martinsville\n\nThe incident was shocking, considering its severity and Kenseth’s mild-mannered, clean-driving reputation. But those are the kind of emotions the Chase has created.\n\n“I love (NASCAR chairman) Brian France, but when he says that drivers are doing what they have to do, it seems like he’s promoting this type of racing,” Hamlin said. “So that’s tough to crown a true champion when things go like this.”\n\nWATCH: Kenseth wrecks Logano at Martinsville\n\nNASCAR executive vice president Steve O’Donnell said after the race officials were “disappointed” with Kenseth’s actions and drew a clear distinction between what happened Sunday and the incident at Kansas. That could leave the door open for a penalty to Kenseth, which would likely be announced Tuesday.\n\nNASCAR took an initial step by parking Kenseth for the remainder of the race, but it still needs to do more.\n\nKenseth should be suspended for next week’s race at Texas Motor Speedway — even though that won’t help salvage Logano’s title hopes (he’s currently last in the Chase with two races until the next elimination).\n\nJames: Jeff Gordon's fairytale season reaches new heights\n\nThink that’s unfair? Then switch the name “Kenseth” with “Kyle Busch.” Busch was suspended for a Cup race in 2011 after he intentionally wrecked title contender Ron Hornaday in a Camping World Truck Series race.\n\nKenseth said last week that officials have completely lost control of the racing. It was as if he wanted to prove his point at Martinsville.\n\nSo now NASCAR needs to send a clear message: Kenseth’s brand of thuggery shouldn’t be involved in deciding a championship.\n\nThe sport seems to be turning into more of a circus every week, and NASCAR needs to decide what it wants to be. Is it a form of competition that provides an even playing field in order to determine wins and championships? Or is it a glorified county fair demolition derby which emphasizes entertainment over integrity?\n\n“It doesn’t matter what my thoughts are,” Brad Keselowski said. “It matters what Brian France’s thoughts are. He’s the one that runs the sport. I think that’s a good question for him.”\n\nJudging by the fan reaction at Martinsville, the majority of fans loved Kenseth's move, reminiscent of a popular WWE wrestler running down the ramp and jumping into the ring, then taking out the bad guy with a chair to the head.\n\n“Wow, man!” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said. “They’re going to talk about that for awhile. I mean, look at this Chase. It’s wild for these fans and they’ve gotta be thrilled with how this Chase is so intense compared to our past formats. Unbelievable stuff happening out there.”\n\nUnbelievable is the perfect description for the stunning turn of events.\n\nWATCH: Logano calls Kenseth a coward\n\nLogano had won three straight races and was en route to a Martinsville victory that would have clinched a spot in the championship race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He would have become the first driver since Jimmie Johnson in 2007 to win four races in a row. But Kenseth, still angry over Logano booting him as he tried to block for the win at Kansas, wasn’t going to allow that to happen. Eliminated from the Chase last week in the race-ending crash at Talladega Superspeedway, Kenseth allowed his emotions to play out behind the wheel of a race car at about 100 mph.\n\nThe most popular form of motorsports in the United States should strive for more than cheap thrills. Yes, TV ratings and attendance have been down in recent years, and something needed to change. The new Chase format is exciting, and it resembles the playoffs in other major league sports.\n\nBut NASCAR needs to be careful. The playoff should be about creating thrilling races, not carnival sideshows.\n\nJeff Gordon after winning Martinsville: 'That was a rock star moment'\n\nOfficials can say they’re unhappy with Kenseth’s actions, but you can bet the footage from Sunday will end up in highlight reels and commercials for years to come. Tickets will be sold and the sport marketed off exactly the kind of incidents NASCAR claims to condemn.\n\nMartinsville might be remembered more for the Kenseth/Logano incident than Jeff Gordon’s stirring win. The images of the crash and the aftermath, including Logano’s father Tom having to be restrained in the garage, will be replayed on a loop.\n\nIs that a good thing?\n\nNASCAR has been on the verge of an identity crisis, and how it reacts going forward might determine whether it’s viewed as a legitimate sport or sports entertainment. Lately, it seems to be veering dangerously toward the latter.\n\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\n\nPHOTOS: Highlights from the 2015 Chase for the Sprint Cup", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/horseracing/2023/06/07/churchill-downs-horse-deaths-morality-reviews-kentucky-racing-commission/70296311007/?utm_source=FOX_Sports", "title": "12 horse deaths at Churchill Downs: First KHRC morality reviews out", "text": "Twelve horses died in the span of six weeks at Churchill Downs, prompting the famed Louisville track to suspend racing operations and move the remainder of its Spring Meet to Ellis Park in Henderson, Kentucky.\n\nWhen the move was announced June 2, per a recommendation from the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, Churchill Downs Inc.

The necropsy report revealed mild to moderate changes in the heart, brain and lung but notes, \"these were not thought to be significant enough to be the cause of the sudden death.

He was taken via ambulance to a medical center, where a private practitioner took radiographs of the injury, and was later euthanized after connections were consulted.\n\nReview findings: KHRC said Freezing Point \"had no major issues to trigger closer scrutiny,\" and an evaluation of the dirt track \"revealed no issues.\" ...

The colt and others in the Pat Day Mile Stakes were deemed sound with no gait abnormalities noted during both pre-race exams and the track warmup period.

It's the first time F1 is in the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas since 1981 and 1982, when Alain Prost and Niki Lauda raced in the Caesars Palace Grand Prix in the resort's parking lot. Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg both finished fifth in the two races to claim their respective drivers' championships.\n\nThis year's track is much different as Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris will race on the famous Strip in a night race with the city's lights shining down. The championship is already wrapped up as Verstappen won his third straight title at the Qatar Grand Prix last month, but there is still competition among the rest of the grid. Amonst drivers, Fernando Alonso, Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz are all within six points of each other for fourth place; in the constructor's standings, Ferrari is within 20 points of Mercedes for second place.\n\nWith traffic jams and sky-high ticket prices, fans have been concerned about the cost of attending the race and what it actually means to the community. Beyond the racing, Formula 1 has embraced the culture of the city. Among the weekend's festivities, there is an F1-themed wedding chapel and the Bellagio is hosting a shoey bar for fans to celebrate like Daniel Ricciardo. Here is everything you need to know about the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix:\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix schedule\n\nPractice 1: Thursday, Nov. 16, 11:30 p.m. ET\n\nThursday, Nov. 16, 11:30 p.m. ET Practice 2: Friday, Nov. 17, 3 a.m. ET\n\nFriday, Nov. 17, 3 a.m. ET Practice 3: Friday, Nov. 17, 11:30 p.m. ET\n\nFriday, Nov. 17, 11:30 p.m. ET Qualifying: Saturday, Nov. 18, 3 a.m. ET\n\nSaturday, Nov. 18, 3 a.m. ET Race: Sunday, Nov. 19, 1 a.m. ET\n\nThe Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix will follow the traditional race weekend format with three practice sessions, qualifying and the race. The times are a little later than usual for a race weekend on American soil.\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix start time\n\nThe lights will go out at the inaugural F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix at 10 p.m. local time Saturday (1 a.m. ET) on Sunday morning.\n\nThere are a few reasons why the race is so late. First, race organizers wanted to be fair to the sport's European viewers. That is, according to Las Vegas GP Ceo Renee Wilm.\n\n\"That was actually a compromise to make sure we are broadcasting at a time when our European fans can get up with a cup of coffee and watch the race six, seven in the morning, very similar to how we [in the US] watch the European races,\" Wilm said recently.\n\n\"So that was actually a very important component of planning out our sequencing for the race weekend.\"\n\nThe organizers also had to find time in order to close off Vegas' busy streets in order to make the race work. With the circuit driving through the Vegas strip,\n\nOrganizers also wanted to embrace the culture of Las Vegas, the entertainment capital of the world. While F1 has expanded to three races in the United States — Austin, Miami, Las Vegas — each one has been unique to the vibe of the location.\n\nHow to watch the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix\n\nThe Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix will air on television on ESPN.\n\nThe race will be live streamed on ESPN3 and ESPN+.\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas ticket prices\n\nInitial entry fees for the Las Vegas Grand Prix were around $2,000 on the low end. The average price was around $7,000. Hotels saw their rates soar in anticipation of the global event, tailor-made for international high-rollers.\n\nKTNV Las Vegas reports that ticket prices have been cut by nearly 60 percent, but it hasn't just been tickets. Hotels near the event have slashed their prices up to 80 percent for nights leading up to the race.\n\nFurthermore, the Grand Prix initially charged fees to any business or hotel that had a view of the race, threatening to build statues in the sightlines of any building that had a view and did not pay. Those fees eventually came down, but it set a bad tone for the city. Never mind all the construction that took place as well near the end of the Strip, forcing large traffic jams across the city for weeks. — Jon Hoefling\n\nTickets for the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix on resale websites have been popular, as well.\n\nAs of Monday, the race was one of the top 10 sports events of the year on StubHub, per the resale company. The average price for a three-day pass to the race was $2,100.\n\nOn Thursday, a three-day pass for the race started at $759 on StubHub and $856 on SeatGeek.\n\nFormula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix track details\n\nThe track for the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix runs along the famous Strip. The 17-turn circuit is 3.853 miles/6.201 kilometers around with the paddock located off the Strip at the intersection of Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane. Drivers will wind around the Sphere before taking Sands Avenue to the Strip where they will pass The Venetian, The Mirage, Caesars Palace, The Bellagio and The Cosmopolitan.\n\nSafety issues on the Vegas track\n\nThe FIA is inspecting drain covers around the Las Vegas Grand Prix track after the concrete frame around one failed, bringing an early end to first practice.\n\nCarlos Sainz was running at high speed on the Strip when he approached a yellow flag, then hitting something that led to his engine switching off. The heavy impact was audible onboard, and the session was red flagged to allow for the Ferrari to be cleared. At the same time, FIA personnel went out on track to inspect the area, and soon confirmed the session would not be resumed.\n\n“Following inspection, it was the concrete frame around a manhole cover that has failed,” an FIA spokesperson said. “We now need to check all of the other manhole covers which will take some time – we will be discussing with the local circuit engineering team about the length of time it will take to resolve and will update with any resultant changes to the schedule.”\n\nRead the full story.\n\nHow weather affects Formula 1 cars\n\nThe weather does affect the performance of an F1 car. The colder the weather is, the less the tires stick to the track. The extended time it takes for the tires to warm up means more power is exerted. The cold also affects the brakes, which means the drivers will have a harder time controlling the cars and they could face lockups, and it will take longer for brakes to heat up.\n\nThat could spell trouble, as the Las Vegas Grand Prix has the potential to be the coldest race in Formula 1 history. Temperatures are expected to be 49 degrees Fahrenheit/9.4 degrees Celsius with a humidity of 65 percent.\n\nThe previous record for the coldest F1 race was the 1978 Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal where temperatures dropped to 41 degrees Fahrenheit/5 degrees Celsius.\n\nWho will win the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix?\n\nMax Verstappen (-250) is the favorite to win the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, according to BetMGM Formula 1 odds. This would mean the Red Bull Racing driver won all three races in the United States in his historic season that at one point had a record 10-race win streak\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris (+900) has the second best odds to win the race followed by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc (+1200), Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Pérez (+1400) and Leclerc's teammate Carlos Sainz (+1400). Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton (+1800) has the sixth best odds of taking home the trophy.\n\nIf you’re new to sports betting, don’t worry. We have tips for beginners on how to place a bet online.

The odds of it happening twice is in the trillions. I run almost 4,000 horses and it never happened. It doesn’t make sense.”\n\nOn Saturday night, 4-year-old filly Parents Pride collapsed and died following the eighth race at Churchill. Then on Tuesday, a similar tragedy occurred after 5-year-old Chasing Artie ran the eighth race. Both horses are owned by Ken Ramsey and had been at his farm near Lexington.\n\nIt has been a tragic start to the Churchill Downs meet leading up to horse racing’s most high-profile event. Also on Tuesday, 3-year-old filly Take Charge Briana from the D. Wayne Lukas barn suffered a catastrophic breakdown during the fifth race. Wild on Ice, who had been training for the Kentucky Derby, suffered a leg fracture during a workout on April 27 and had to be euthanized.\n\nChurchill Downs confirmed the deaths of the horses Wednesday afternoon in a public statement. \"While a series of events like this is highly unusual, it is completely unacceptable,\" the statement issued by Churchill Downs spokesperson Darren Rogers reads in part. \"We take this very seriously and acknowledge that these troubling incidents are alarming and must be addressed.\"\n\nWhile concerns will be raised about the safety of the racetrack any time there are multiple horse deaths in a short period of time, the manner in which both horses from Joseph’s barn collapsed suddenly suggest other factors at play. Joseph said his team was retracing steps and looking for any possible reason including testing the feed and hay that his horses are being given.\n\nJoseph said bloodwork from every horse in his barn since Tuesday night turned up nothing unusual, nor did the initial necropsy results from Parents Pride. In the meantime, though, Joseph said his plans to race other horses this weekend are in limbo.\n\n“When you don’t know something, that’s when it worries you the most,” Joseph said. “Something is wrong. A lot of thoughts run through your head, but you can drive yourself insane. But I'm very uneasy right now.

In 2022, his runners won 174 times out of 823 starts and earned more than $10 million in prize money.\n\nLord Miles, who won the Wood Memorial Stakes in April, is supposed to be Joseph’s third Derby starter.\n\nFor any trainer, getting to the Derby is considered the peak of the profession. But after the events of the last several days, Joseph is admittedly preoccupied with questions and fear about tragedy striking again.\n\n“We have to get through it and figure out what’s the reason,” he said. “I don’t think it’s just bad fortune. For it to happen twice? We’re going to see. I don’t have an answer. I wish I did. I’d love to have closure. But you just have to go through protocol. Not having an answer is the worst thing. When a horse gets injured, that’s different. You have an answer. There’s no answer for this.”\n\nAny spate of unusual horse deaths, of course, will give rise to backstretch speculation about whether malfeasance or illicit drugs were in play, which Joseph called “the hurtful part.” That only adds to the urgency for Joseph to find anything that would connect the dots.\n\n“Theories aren’t going to help anything. We need facts,” he said. “There’s a lot of speculation, obviously, but what can you do? Until we get some kind of information it leaves you broken, it leaves you shattered.

'I Love Downtown' Rochester?", "text": "Alan Morrell\n\nSpecial to Rochester Democrat and Chronicle USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nRochesterians love their festivals, for sure — but maybe not so much in the dead of winter.\n\nThat’s when the “I Love Downtown” celebration used to be held, on or around Valentine’s Day every February for a decade or so. Parades, fireworks and daredevils were among the attractions in the early years, and events like bathtub racing and kissing contests were held later. Sometimes “I Love Downtown” was a one-day event, sometimes it stretched over a weekend.\n\nOfficials came up with the “I Love Downtown” campaign partly to “beat the winter blahs” as well as to promote the city center. People turned out by the thousands in the beginning, when the first festival coincided with the grand opening of The Mill in the former Edwards Department Store.\n\nBut as anyone who has been here a while knows, Rochester’s often bone-chilling cold in February gets people in hunker-down mode. It wasn’t always that cold during the festival, but “I Love Downtown,” which started with sizzle, began to fizzle and quietly faded away.\n\nThe first “I Love Downtown” event was held on Valentine’s Day, 1978. Organizers promoted the makes-no-sense nature it all.\n\n“It’s absurd to have a parade in February, and that’s the nature of it,” Fran Collins of the Downtown Promotion Council said in a published ad. “Needless to say, there’s no such thing as a snow day.”\n\nTwo parades were held, one by daylight and one by torchlight. A broom-hockey game on Main Street pitted city officials against members of the media. The main event was the debut of The Mill, a shopping mall of specialty stores and restaurants that opened in the former Edwards store the same day. (The Mill was featured in a previous Whatever Happened to…? story.)\n\nThe most sensational attraction involved Carlos Obando walking a tightrope strung across Main Street from the Mill to the National Clothing Co. building. A Democrat and Chronicle story said that a crowd estimated at more than 8,000 watched Obando pull off the stunt from 100 feet up.\n\nAnd then, of course, there were the fireworks. They’re a common sight in summer, but not so much in February.\n\nMore:Whatever Happened to ... Locust Lawn Restaurant?\n\nMore:Whatever Happened to ... the ice rink at Xerox Square\n\nMore:Whatever Happened to ... the notorious Suicide Hill?\n\n“Loved the winter fireworks,” Michael Szczur of Rochester posted on Facebook. “Five degrees outside. Best comment at the fireworks: ‘No bugs.’”\n\nThe initial festival was successful enough to make it an annual event. Broom hockey returned in 1979, as did a single parade. The Mill held a first-birthday party that included state lottery officials spinning a “Wheel of Fortune” with prizes. A “Big Mac Tour Bus,” courtesy of McDonald’s, offered downtown tours.\n\nAn arctic chill had descended on Rochester that year, with a temperature of one degree during “I Love Downtown” festivities. The cold didn’t stop a performer going by the name of “Houdinii” who escaped from two straitjackets while hanging upside-down more than 100 feet over the Genesee River. “A cheer rose from the crowd,” Jackie Farnan wrote in a Democrat and Chronicle story. “Why did he try the stunt, for expenses only, in miserable conditions in the dead of winter? ‘I love downtown,’ he said.”\n\nFarnan noted that few people were on Main Street as planned, but “many were inside stores shopping.” The following year, organizers didn’t take any chances.\n\nThe 1980 “I Love Downtown” festival had no parade and none of the spectacles of previous years. “We just couldn’t trust the weather,” a Downtown Promotion Council executive said in a news story.\n\nInstead of enticing people to downtown streets, the plan was to lure them into buildings and stores. The plans included lots of events – music, dance, art shows and the like – all over downtown. “They milled everywhere but at The Mill,” Farnan wrote. The struggling venture was already slated to close and did so at the end of March. “I Love Downtown” trudged on a few more years.\n\nMore:Rochester weather: Time lapse of heavy snowfall downtown\n\nIn 1981, organizers paired “I Love Downtown” with another event, Winterfest. By 1983, radio officials got involved to reinject some zest into “I Love Downtown.” “We were told to come up with as much craziness as possible,” one of the officials said in a Democrat and Chronicle article. Bathtub racing was introduced, with teams competing on Main Street. Thousands of Styrofoam ping-pong balls with attached coupons were dropped from the top of the Sibley’s building.\n\nJohnny Cash performed in Rochester the night before and was scheduled to receive a medallion from city officials during the 1983 “I Love Downtown” events. Cash had to cancel because of illness and went to Nashville, where he was hospitalized with pneumonia.\n\nThe 1984 version of the festival included a kissing contest that came to be called “The Great Sweetheart Kiss-Off.” Couples puckered up in the windows of McCurdy’s to see who could kiss the longest. Bathtub racing and other events returned, as they did in ensuing years.\n\nBy decade’s end, the luster of the event had apparently worn thin. Publicity and coverage of “I Love Downtown” waned. There were no news mentions after 1988.\n\nPeople in Rochester still love downtown – OK, some of them, anyway – and people in Rochester still love their festivals. But in February, maybe not so much.\n\nAlan Morrell is a Rochester-based freelance writer.\n\nAbout this feature\n\n“Whatever Happened to? ...” is a feature that explores favorite haunts of the past and revisits the headlines of yesteryear.\n\nHave an idea you’d like us to explore?

Here's when and why we celebrate in 2024.", "text": "Presidents Day comes as the winter drags on, offering a celebratory three-day weekend after the rush of the holiday season and the January observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nAfter Presidents Day, there are no federal holidays until May, so you'll have to wait a while for another three-day weekend. Aside from the name, an obvious homage to Presidents of years past, you might not know the significance of the holiday.\n\nHere’s when Presidents Day falls in 2024 and a history lesson about the federal holiday.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2024?\n\nPresidents Day is on Monday, Feb. 19 this year. Presidents Day is celebrated on the third Monday of February every year.\n\nThe date of Presidents Day changes every year because of the Uniform Holiday Bill signed in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Uniform Holiday Bill mandated that three holidays, including Presidents Day, occur on Mondays to prevent midweek shutdowns and add long weekends to the federal calendar.\n\nWhat is Presidents Day?\n\nPresidents Day is also called \"Washington’s Birthday\" as a celebration of the nation’s first President. But George Washington’s birthday is not on Feb. 19 – it is Feb. 22. Or it might be Feb. 11.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting.\n\nGeorge Washington was born on Feb. 11, 1731, at a time when Britain and its colonies used the Julian calendar, a product of the Roman Republic that went out of popular favor in 1582. The Brits still used it until 1752. The country celebrated Washington’s birthday as a sign of respect long before it became a federal holiday in 1879.\n\nAfter Johnson’s Uniform Holiday Bill, it was celebrated on the third Monday of February. Around this time, the country also began using the holiday to honor not only Washington but Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday is February 12.\n\nRepublican Rep. Robert McClory spearheaded the bill, which caused outrage from some who objected to changing the date we celebrate Washington’s birthday.\n\n\"We are not changing George Washington's birthday,” McClory said. “We would make George Washington's Birthday more meaningful to many more people by having it observed on a Monday.\"\n\nHe also proposed changing the name of the new shared holiday to Presidents Day. As a Congressmember from Illinois, McClory came from the state where Lincoln spent much of his life.\n\nMany opposed this as well. Tennessee representative Dan Heflin Kuykendall said, \"If we do this, 10 years from now our schoolchildren will not know or care when George Washington was born. They will know that in the middle of February they will have a 3-day weekend for some reason.”\n\nThe measure failed to pass. While we know the holiday more popularly as\"Presidents Day,\" the federal government still officially calls it Washington’s Birthday.\n\nPresidents Day in November?Why states celebrate so differently\n\nWho gets Presidents Day off?\n\nFederal holidays are those observed by the federal government, so anyone who works for the federal government generally has the day off. Federal holidays may also be observed on Monday or Friday if they fall on a weekend.\n\nHolidays currently recognized by the federal government:\n\nNew Year's Day: January 1\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day: Third Monday in January\n\nWashington's Birthday, or Presidents Day: Third Monday in February\n\nMemorial Day: Last Monday in May\n\nJuneteenth National Independence Day: June 19\n\nIndependence Day: July 4\n\nLabor Day: First Monday in September\n\nColumbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day: Second Monday in October\n\nVeteran's Day: November 11\n\nThanksgiving Day: Fourth Thursday in November\n\nChristmas Day: December 25\n\nEmployees who work elsewhere may not get these holidays off. According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal holiday time off is a benefit agreed upon by employer and employee. In other words, your employer does not have to give you a paid day off on federal holidays.\n\nJust Curious for more?

Is it a federal holiday? Everything to know", "text": "Presidents Day is fast approaching, which may signal to many a relaxing three-day weekend and plenty of holiday sales and bargains.\n\nBut next to Independence Day, there may not exist another American holiday that is quite so patriotic.\n\nWhile Presidents Day has come to be a commemoration of all the nation's 46 chief executives, both past and present, it wasn't always so broad. When it first came into existence – long before it was even federally recognized – the holiday was meant to celebrate just one man: George Washington.\n\nHow has the day grown from a simple celebration of the birthday of the first president of the United States? And why are we seeing all these ads for car and furniture sales on TV?\n\nHere's what to know about Presidents Day and how it came to be:\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2024?\n\nThis year, Presidents Day is on Monday, Feb. 19.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated on the third Monday of every February because of a bill signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Taking effect three years later, the Uniform Holiday Bill mandated that three holidays – Memorial Day, Presidents Day and Veterans Day – occur on Mondays to prevent midweek shutdowns and add long weekends to the federal calendar, according to Britannica.\n\nOther holidays, including Labor Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, were also established to be celebrated on Mondays when they were first observed.\n\nHowever, Veterans Day was returned to Nov. 11 in 1978 and continues to be commemorated on that day.\n\nWhat does Presidents Day commemorate?\n\nPresidents Day was initially established in 1879 to celebrate the birthday of the nation's first president, George Washington. In fact, the holiday was simply called Washington's Birthday, which is still how the federal government refers to it, the Department of State explains.\n\nFollowing the death of the venerated American Revolution leader in 1799, Feb. 22, widely believed to be Washington's date of birth, became a perennial day of remembrance, according to History.com.\n\nThe day remained an unofficial observance for much of the 1800s until Sen. Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas proposed that it become a federal holiday. In 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed it into law, according to History.com.\n\nWhile initially being recognized only in Washington D.C., Washington's Birthday became a nationwide holiday in 1885. The first to celebrate the life of an individual American, Washington's Birthday was at the time one of only five federally-recognized holidays – the others being Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.\n\nHowever, most Americans today likely don't view the federal holiday as a commemoration of just one specific president. Presidents Day has since come to represent a day to recognize and celebrate all of the United States' commanders-in-chief, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\nWhen the Uniform Holiday Bill took effect in 1971, a provision was included to combine the celebration of Washington’s birthday with Abraham Lincoln's on Feb. 12, according to History.com. Because the new annual date always fell between Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays, Americans believed the day was intended to honor both presidents.\n\nInterestingly, advertisers may have played a part in the shift to \"Presidents Day.\"\n\nMany businesses jumped at the opportunity to use the three-day weekend as a means to draw customers with Presidents Day sales and bargain at stores across the country, according to History.com.\n\nHow is the holiday celebrated?\n\nBecause Presidents Day is a federal holiday, most federal workers will have the day off.\n\nPart of the reason Johnson made the day a uniform holiday was so Americans had a long weekend \"to travel farther and see more of this beautiful land of ours,\" he wrote. As such, places like the Washington Monument in D.C. and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota – which bears the likenesses of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt – are bound to attract plenty of tourists.\n\nSimilar to Independence Day, the holiday is also viewed as a patriotic celebration. As opposed to July, February might not be the best time for backyard barbecues and fireworks, but reenactments, parades and other ceremonies are sure to take place in cities across the U.S.\n\nPresidential places abound across the U.S.\n\nOpinions on current and recent presidents may leave Americans divided, but we apparently love our leaders of old enough to name a lot of places after them.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau pulled information from its databases showcasing presidential geographic facts about the nation's cities and states.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the census data shows that as of 2020, the U.S. is home to plenty of cities, counties and towns bearing presidential names. Specifically:\n\n94 places are named \"Washington.\"\n\n72 places are named \"Lincoln.\"\n\n67 places are named for Andrew Jackson, a controversial figure who owned slaves and forced thousands of Native Americans to march along the infamous Trail of Tears.\n\nContributing: Clare Mulroy\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Or you might have the day off from school, but your grocery store remains open for shopping.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about what’s open and closed on Presidents Day.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2023:Here's why we really celebrate the federal holiday\n\nThe mystery of Presidents Day:Not every state celebrates the same.

Others are controversial, like Columbus Day. And then there is the case of the third Monday of February.\n\nThe holiday we celebrate federally on this day is both controversial and one few people seem to care about.\n\nYou’ll notice I haven’t referred to what today’s holiday is because no one seems to agree what to call it or when it should take place. Sometimes, state agencies cannot even agree on what to call the holiday (see Illinois). Allowing for all that, about 14 states appear to refer to the holiday as President’s Day (note the apostrophe before the letter s). Another 10 call it Presidents’ Day (note the apostrophe after the letter s). And two claim the holiday as Presidents Day (no apostrophe).\n\nOther incarnations of the holiday exist too. Washington’s Birthday is fairly popular, with six states – and the federal government – celebrating it. Mississippi opts for George Washington’s Birthday, at least according to its state court system. Our first president’s home state of Virginia drops the reference to “birthday” and goes with George Washington Day. North Dakota goes a little outside the box under state law, choosing not to name the day and instead going with the snappy “recognition of the birthday of George Washington.”\n\nSix states combine the name Washington (sometimes with “George”) with some combination of the names (Abraham) Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Presidents’, President’s or Daisy Gatson Bates and the word “day” or “birthday.”\n\nConfused yet? Nine states don’t even celebrate the day. Three that do (including Georgia) celebrate it in either November or December around Thanksgiving or Christmas.\n\nTo be clear, some holiday around Washington’s day of birth that celebrates a president or presidents has been around for a long time. Federally, it’s been recognized since 1879.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many industries, including the travel industry, wanted to create a “super holiday” for presidents given that Lincoln’s birthday (February 12 and never federally recognized) is close to Washington’s. Thanks to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968, such a holiday was established on the third Monday of February. Federally, it was called Washington’s Birthday to not upset members of Congress from Virginia.\n\nThe vast majority of states, however, didn’t follow suit in keeping the name Washington’s Birthday.\n\nPart of the problem is that a lot of states have also created a super holiday meant to celebrate more than just Washington. Calling the third Monday in February something with the words “president” and “day” worked better. Only a handful of states still celebrate Lincoln’s Birthday (including his home state of Illinois) compared with about half of them in 1940.\n\nOf course, just to add to the ridiculousness, Illinois manages to have both a Presidents’ Day and Lincoln’s Birthday, without a day specifically dedicated to Washington. That is if you believe the state treasurer. The Illinois secretary of state designates the day as Washington’s Birthday.\n\nSpeaking of Washington, his actual birthday of February 22 never falls on the third Monday of February. If February 22 is a Monday, it would be the fourth Monday of February.\n\nTo me, though, what makes the whole argument of what to call the third Monday in February fun is how inconsequential it really is. Most Americans don’t really care about the holiday.\n\nAn examination of Google Trends reveals that only Columbus Day ranks lower in online searches by Americans of federal holidays. A majority of states don’t even celebrate Columbus Day, and a number of states have decided to mark something else on that day (e.g. Indigenous Peoples’ Day).\n\nThere are a bunch of non-federal holidays that beat Washington’s Birthday in Google searches as well. This includes, perhaps not surprisingly, Valentine’s Day.\n\nA poll from 2012 further makes the point. Adults were asked what holiday should be eliminated, if one needed to be. Among the options listed, Presidents’ Day came in first at 35%.\n\nAnd back when the idea of making Washington’s Birthday a holiday that always fell on a Monday was being discussed, most Americans were not in favor. Just 35% wanted Washington’s Birthday to be consistently observed on a Monday, according to a 1967 Louis Harris & Associates poll. Lawmakers went against the public and set the Monday date anyway.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like anyone really cared.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/02/19/presidents-day-does-it-celebrate-washington-lincoln/11281966002/", "title": "Is Presidents Day a federal holiday?

And leading up to their birthdays, students in schools often spent time learning about their accomplishments.\n\nNow, we have Presidents Day, better known as a national day of bargains on cars, mattresses, appliances, televisions and more.\n\n\"It's become more of a shopping day and a break in the calendar. Are we supposed to be honoring all the presidents that day? If so, how are we doing that?\" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University in Houston. \"If it was Presidents Day in all the schools in the country and (teachers and students) were really looking at the executive branch, there might be something useful, but as it is now, it's more about a worker holiday than it is a day of intellectual reflection.\"\n\nEven our calendars are confused. Microsoft Outlook lists Lincoln's Birthday (Feb. 12), but not Washington's Birthday (Feb. 22) or Presidents Day (Feb. 20).

A decade earlier, Congress had established New Year’s Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day as federal holidays.\n\nWashington's Birthday was first observed on Feb. 22, 1880, and five years later, federal workers in the 38 states had the holiday, too, according to the National Archives. And it was also the first federal holiday to honor a single person's birth date; the second, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, was signed into law in 1982.\n\nAfter Lincoln's death in 1865, some sought to make his birthday (Feb. 12, 1809) a holiday, too. That effort failed, but several states continue to observe Lincoln's Birthday as a paid holiday, according to the National Constitution Center. And some schools across the U.S. still do have days off for the presidents' birthdays.\n\nPresidents Day 2023:From traveling to shopping major sales — here are ways to enjoy the long weekend\n\nHow did George Washington's Birthday become Presidents Day?\n\nIn June 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established the observance of Washington's Birthday on the third Monday of February – Memorial Day, Veterans Day and Columbus Day were also moved to Mondays – a move that resulted in more three-day holidays for federal employees. It also resulted in Washington's birthday never being celebrated on his actual birthday, since the law took effect in 1971, notes the Mount Vernon website.\n\nWithin the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Illinois Sen. Robert McClory suggested the renaming of the holiday to Presidents Day, to also celebrate Lincoln's birthday, according to History.com.\n\nThat suggestion was dropped from the proposal. But advertisers latched onto Presidents Day as another date for sales and promotions inflicting scores of fake Georges and Abes on us in their commercials.\n\nEven though federal employees have the day as a holiday, the law did not officially change the third Monday of February to Presidents Day, so it remains Washington's Birthday. For instance, the National Weather Service and the Federal Reserve System continue to call the date Washington's Birthday.\n\nIn 2007, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York suggested Susan B. Anthony be added to those celebrated on the third Monday of February, but that measure was not acted on.\n\nBy the way, the Mount Vernon website suggests readers contact their representatives in Congress and them to fully bring back Washington's Birthday.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The great emancipator was born on Feb. 12, but Indiana doesn't recognize his birthday until Nov. 23 this year.\n\nUnder Indiana law enacted in 1972, the governor can move the observance of state holidays to any other day of the year. If the governor doesn’t act, the holiday falls on the date set by the legislature. Since 1989, the only exception to that law is Martin Luther King Jr’s birthday, which must be observed on the third Monday in January.\n\nAccording to Ashley Hungate, Director of Communications for the State Personnel Dept., both president's birthdays have been recognized separately by state employees since 1947 and have been observed near the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays since 1979.\n\nDon't bother to check the mail today.

Six years later, the holiday was extended nationwide.\n\nIts modern version — with Presidents Day always being celebrated on the third Monday of February — didn't occur until nearly a century later. In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day and Veterans Day to select Mondays in order to give federal employees more three-day weekends. However, it didn't take effect until Jan. 1, 1971. In 1980, Veterans’ Day was returned to its original November 11 date, after complaints.\n\nFun facts: Presidents Day never actually falls on any of our presidents' birthdays.

Their ad-libs killed. They were so good at the job that watching their performance was equal to two straight days of entertainment. First came the watching of the actual live ceremony. Then, the next day, came the ranking and repeating of their best lines.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Fey and Poehler set the gold standard for emceeing at the annual ceremony held by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association — an occasion known for being much looser than the Oscars and Emmy, thanks in no small part to all the champagne and cocktails involved.\n\nThey are the women who landed this magnificent jab at sexism and ageism in their 2014 monologue: “'Gravity' is nominated for best film. It’s the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.”\n\nNow the dynamic duo is returning to host the Golden Globes on Sunday night to a very different vibe. Thanks to the harsh reality of COVID-19, this will be a virtual event. There will be no ballroom packed with mega-stars to laugh or gasp when the hosts launch their best lines. Instead, the nominees will be on-camera at home, waiting for the winners to be announced.\n\nGolden Globes 2021:How to watch, everything you need to know about the hybrid awards show\n\nIt's enough to daunt even Fey and Poehler, who starred respectively in the sitcom hits \"30 Rock\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" and together in the movies \"Baby Mama,\" \"Sisters\" and \"Wine Country.\" They've each written best-selling books. They both played influential roles in political image-making with their definitive impressions on \"Saturday Night Live\" of Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd yet, they seem a little nervous.\n\n“We just have a few final questions: When, how, why, where and what? Just those, that’s all we need to find out. But we’re going to figure it out,” Poehler told Seth Meyers last month on NBC's \"Late Night.\"\n\nSo what exactly do the friends and creative collaborators need to do to maintain their Golden Globe excellence? Here's a five-point plan.\n\nGolden Globes 2021 predictions:Who will win – and who should?\n\n1. Embrace the awkwardness\n\nTiming is everything in comedy, which makes the reality that Fey and Poehler will host from separate coasts an enormous challenge.\n\nFey will be working from the Rainbow Room in New York City's Rockefeller Center, while Poehler will be at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. Even if there are no technical glitches, the physical separation increases the difficulty of being funny in tandem.\n\nThe situation, however, does give Poehler and Fey room to mock their own strange set-up — and the entire live-TV viewing experience that has become the norm during the pandemic. Let's hope they simulate some disasters to explore what could go wrong. Just imagine the possible jokes about Zoom meetings with muting fiascos or text messages mistakenly shared on-screen that reveal their panic.\n\nGolden Globes 2021 honorees:Jane Fonda thanks Norman Lear for support at 'height of my being controversial'\n\nWe're also praying that Tina and Amy find spontaneous fun in the handing out of statuettes to celebrities at home. Maybe they could review the wallpaper and bookshelves of celebrity houses, much like Twitter's popular Room Rater account does for cable news guests.\n\nTheir celebrity pals could help out by volunteering to be trashed for their interior decorating on the air. We're already chuckling at the thought of Fey and Poehler critiquing, say, Will Ferrell's man cave or Julia Louis-Dreyfus' she shed.\n\n2. Address the controversy\n\nThe buzz leading up to the Golden Globes has been about the Los Angeles Times investigative reporting on financial and ethical questions regarding the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\n\nThe newspaper conducted extensive interviews and reviewed documents that “paint a picture of an embattled organization still struggling to shake its reputation as a group whose awards or nominations can be influenced with expensive junkets and publicity swag.”\n\nThe L.A. Times also reported that the 87-member HFPA has no Black journalists. This year's Globes nominations for best picture drew criticism for not including well-reviewed movies with predominantly Black casts like \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Judas and the Black Messiah.\"\n\nMore:Time's Up calls out zero Black HFPA members voting on Golden Globes; stars join protest\n\nFey and Poehler should use their comedy platform to deliver the sort of pointed rebukes that could prod the Globes to making changes that are long overdue. Instead of ignoring the headlines, they can make them the focus of their toughest jokes.\n\nAnd might we suggest one or two or 27 jokes about the fact that Netflix's meringue-fluffy \"Emily in Paris\" is a Globe nominee, while HBO's intensely brilliant \"I May Destroy You\" was snubbed?\n\n3. Don't pull any punches\n\nEven though 2020's stress has become 2021's continuing worries, Fey and Poehler aren't paid to be soothing. They need to stick to their style of unflinching humor that delights in mocking hypocrites and deflating big egos.\n\nThe unleashed it in 2013, when Fey and Poehler earned applause for zapping the director of \"Titanic.\" Addressing the complaints that \"Zero Dark Thirty\" director Kathryn Bigelow was getting for the film's portrayal of torture techniques, Poehler said, \"I haven't really been following the controversy over 'Zero Dark Thirty,' but when it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron.\"\n\nThe hosts also have called out Joaquin Phoenix for showing up at the Globes after publicly describing awards shows as \"total and utter bull(bleep)\" and skewered Hollywood's treatment of and unrealistic standards for women.\n\nNoting the arduous makeup that transformed one nominee, Fey joked in 2015: \"Steve Carell's 'Foxcatcher' look took two hours to put on. .… Just for comparison, it took me three hours today to prepare for my role as human woman.\"\n\nThere are numerous potential targets for Fey and Poehler to choose from for Sunday's opening monologue: men and women from the worlds of show business, politics, social media and Wall Street. But one individual stands out at the moment for his vacation choices during the Texas power failure crisis. Watch out, Ted Cruz!\n\n4. Redeem George Clooney\n\nOne development since Fey and Poehler's last hosting gig is Clooney's new status as the father of 3-year-old twins. It's quite a change from the suave actor's previous image as a matinee idol paired with younger actresses, hence the that awesome \"Gravity\" joke.\n\nClooney earned more flak from the pair when he received the Golden Globes prize for contributions to the industry, the Cecil Be. DeMille Award. Noting his marriage in 2014 to Amal Alamuddin, Fey described her as an accomplished human rights attorney \"who worked on the Enron case, an adviser to Kofi Annan on Syria and was appointed to a three-person commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza strip.”\n\nThe punch line? “So tonight her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award.”\n\nClooney seemed to enjoy the line immensely, but now that he has become just another harried father scrambling to keep up with his toddlers, Tina and Amy should make peace with his ordinariness.\n\n5. Make this their last hurrah for Globes hosting\n\nWith all of the soul-searching that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association seems to need, this should be Fey and Poehler's farewell to the Globes.\n\nThe two already have addressed the idea that handing out trophies has dropped from frivolous to meaningless in 2021. In the promos for Sunday's broadcast, Fey says, \"The stakes have never been lower.” To which Poehler adds, “We play our cards right, this could be the last awards show ever.”\n\nThis doesn't mean Fey and Poehler should give up helming award shows altogether. The Oscars are in desperate need of hosts who could become regulars at the job the way Johnny Carson and Billy Crystal were in past years.\n\nJust be sure to add Maya Rudolph to the mix. Remember at the 2019 Oscars, when Rudolph joined Fey and Poehler as presenters? That was cool. Fey told the audience, \"We're going to stand here a little too long, so the people who get USA Today tomorrow will think that we hosted.\"\n\nIt worked, or at least it proved that they should become a hosting triad. When it comes to Fey, Poehler and Rudolph as combined forces, three very funny women are even better than two.\n\nThe Golden Globes will air live coast-to-coast on NBC at 8 EST/5 PST.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/01/24/where-to-watch-oscar-nominated-movies-2023/11111780002/", "title": "2023 Oscar movies: Where to stream winners like 'The Whale ...", "text": "This year's Academy Awards ceremony might be over but before you start prepping for the 96th Oscars in 2024, why not catch up on some award-worthy fare you missed (or want to see again)?\n\nFrom box-office blockbusters to film-festival favorites, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences handed out trophies to a bunch of different movies on Sunday.

See the many 'firsts' from Michelle Yeoh, 'Naatu Naatu,' more\n\n'Everything Everywhere All at Once'\n\nDon't worry about having your brain broken and just go with the wild flow of this action-packed, multiverse-hopping genre mashup that won seven Oscars including best picture, original screenplay, directing (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), actress (Michelle Yeoh), supporting actor (Ke Huy Quan) and supporting actress (Jamie Lee Curtis). Yeoh dazzles as a laundromat owner whose tax issues get shoved aside when she gets a crash course in alternate realities (including one where she has hot dog fingers!) and has to learn from the lives of her other selves to stop a nihilistic villain.\n\nWhere to watch: Showtime, Apple TV\n\n'The Banshees of Inisherin'\n\nGetting ghosted by a friend or a loved one is a relatable bit of stress and heartbreak. Add a 1920s remote Irish island setting, toss in two of the greatest actors of their generations, and you've got a best picture nominee with something to say. Martin McDonagh's wonderfully bleak exploration of isolation, desperation and mortality lets Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson loose as ex-best pals in a sudden fiery feud, with nice supporting turns from Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan as characters caught up in their not-so-civil war.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\n‘Elvis’\n\nNot sure if everyone’s heard, but Elvis Presley was a big deal. And Baz Luhrmann’s stylish musical drama – nominated for best picture – pays tribute to the King of Rock ’n’ Roll from his early 1950s gigs to his later days as a Vegas headliner. When a burgeoning Elvis (top-notch leading man Austin Butler, who earned his first best actor nod) lays into the rockabilly tune “Baby Let’s Play House” and wiggles his hips, young women (and older ones, too) scream and swoon in preternatural delight, possessed by the power of a fledgling rock god.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\n'The Whale'\n\nBrendan Fraser took home the best actor Oscar for a career-defining, big-hearted showing in Darren Aronofsky's latest psychological drama, a soulful, intimate character study of a 600-pound writing teacher desperate to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter (Sadie Sink), who's a bit of a pill. Fraser delivers an astounding and incredibly compassionate portrayal, and the film acts as an empathy test in a supremely cynical social media landscape.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'\n\nAs Queen Ramonda, Angela Bassett was a top contender for supporting actress and also rules Wakanda in Ryan Coogler's thoughtful Marvel sequel, which won costume design for Ruth Carter and made history (she's the first Black woman to win two Oscars). After the death of King T'Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman), Ramonda and her daughter Shuri grieve their loss and face the new threat of Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) and his underwater kingdom. Wakanda is filled with compelling women who come into their own in the film: They question each other, make hard decisions and wrestle with complications in ways that make them a joy to watch.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+, Apple TV\n\n'All Quiet on the Western Front'\n\nLike its 1930 counterpart (which won a best picture Oscar), the latest adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque novel – told from a German point of view – is harrowing and deeply effective with its anti-war message. And the Academy voters loved it, giving it four Oscars including best international film. A 17-year-old (Felix Kammerer) lies about his age to proudly go to the front lines of World War I, witnesses carnage and becomes numb to the brutality while an officer (Daniel Brühl) desperately negotiates for an armistice.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'The Fabelmans'\n\nSteven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale – which snagged nods for best picture, directing, actress (Michelle Williams) and supporting actor (Judd Hirsch), among others – flashes back to the 1950s and ’60s and the legendary filmmaker's childhood growing up in a Jewish family. Newcomer Gabriel LaBelle amazes as teenage Spielberg, here named Sammy Fabelman, a kid whose creative world just explodes when he gets a camera in his hands while also navigating parental drama and antisemitic bullying.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV\n\n'Top Gun: Maverick'\n\nTom Cruise is known for jumping off planes in crazy \"Mission: Impossible\" stunts but come on, he's much better in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Even though he didn't snag a best actor nomination, Cruise still oozes A-list cool as the returning flyboy from the 1986 original training a new crop of young pilots in an endlessly entertaining, nostalgic sequel that scored best picture, screenplay and original song nods – and won the best sound Oscar! – plus made a major movie star out of Glen Powell.\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount+\n\n'Tár'\n\nBest actress nominee Cate Blanchett soars in Todd Field’s classical music drama, which also scored nods for best picture, directing and original screenplay. Powered by Blanchett’s baton-wielding tour de force, the film is a modern tale about a cultural giant who uses her power in not-so-great fashion, so there are #MeToo factors at play. However, “Tár” has more of a timeless quality, playing out in the style of a Greek tragedy with the epic downfall of a woman behaving badly.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV, Peacock\n\n'Triangle of Sadness'\n\nSelf-obsessed models, Russian oligarchs, polite English arms manufacturers – everybody's sent up in Ruben Östlund’s deliciously grotesque class satire nominated for best picture. Harris Dickinson and the late Charlbi Dean play a beautiful couple who are invited on a trip for the super-rich aboard a yacht captained by a gonzo, Marxist-loving American (Woody Harrelson). The ship hits an unruly storm – leading to the most heinous, vomit-drenched dinner you could ever imagine – and then sinks in a ridiculous fashion, turning the tables on the wealthy and showing who really rules.\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Apple TV\n\n'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'\n\nA tech billionaire (Edward Norton) invites his longtime crew (including Janelle Monáe, Dave Bautista, Leslie Odom Jr., Kathryn Hahn and Kate Hudson) for a murder mystery getaway on his absurdly posh private Greek island. Daniel Craig's Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc inexplicably shows up, a body hits the floor and the game is afoot for director Rian Johnson's fun and twisty sequel, which like the first \"Knives Out\" earned Johnson a screenplay Oscar nomination.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'Women Talking'\n\nDirector Sarah Polley won a screenplay Oscar for her adaptation of the Miriam Toews novel, an intimate drama that centers on a group of women in a religious colony who, after a series of rapes, meet to determine if they'll stay and be forced to forgive or leave and risk not being welcomed into heaven. The acting is phenomenal, with Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy and Rooney Mara among those playing characters determining their fate in a life-altering barn debate.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV\n\n'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio'\n\nGuillermo del Toro, a modern master of the macabre, gives the classic fairy tale a twisted bliss with this enjoyable stop-motion take set in 1930s Italy that won best animated feature. With a precocious, troublemaking wooden puppet desperate to be a real boy and a star-studded voice cast (from Ewan McGregor to Cate Blanchett), the whimsical narrative takes on war and fascism – you haven't lived until you've seen Pinocchio mocking Mussolini – plus tackles dark and fairly mature matters with life-affirming zeal.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'RRR'\n\nAn action epic that manages to be more glorious and bromantic than a \"Top Gun\" movie, the Indian blockbuster stars N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan as buff heroes who take on 1920s British colonialists in a must-see movie – the best of last year, actually – with love stories and over-the-top spirit. It didn't get a best picture Oscar nomination but its original song \"Naatu Naatu\" – which accompanies our two protagonists in a dance battle with a smarmy British guy – won the original song Oscaragainst the likes of Lady Gaga and Rihanna.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'Navalny'\n\nDaniel Roher's film, the winner for best documentary, is a riveting and inspiring stranger-than-fiction deep-dive into the life and almost death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The movie chronicles the investigation into the 2020 poisoning of the charismatic dissident (and President Vladimir Putin's chief political rival), but it also hits on an emotional level, including interviews with the subject's children and Navalny himself, a man willing to go to extreme lengths to better his country.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nThe best of the Oscars 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/entertainment/academy-awards-2022/index.html", "title": "'CODA' wins the Oscar in a streaming breakthrough, but Will Smith ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“CODA” won best picture, but that historic breakthrough for streaming service Apple TV+ at the Oscars was overshadowed by one spontaneous act, as Will Smith delivered a viral moment that will be remembered and talked about for years.\n\nThe most memorable exchange on the film industry’s biggest night wasn’t the kind anyone would have anticipated or wanted. Before winning his Oscar for “King Richard,” Smith seemed upset about a joke that Chris Rock told about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, marching to the stage and appearing strike him across the face. Rock looked genuinely stunned, while Smith returned to his seat, shouting words that were bleeped out at Rock.\n\nWiping away tears, Smith during his acceptance speech referenced that the character he played, Richard Williams, protected his family, then said, without specifically mentioning Rock or what happened, “I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees.” He added, “Love will make you do crazy things.”\n\nThe best-picture suspense between two streaming nominees perceived as frontrunners lasted throughout the night. “CODA’s” Sian Heder won for best adapted screenplay, but “The Power of the Dog’s” Jane Campion, the first woman to be nominated twice as best director, later became the third woman ever to claim that prize. (Heder was overlooked in that balloting.)\n\nBased on results from other awards leading up to the Oscars, this was already viewed as a landmark year for streaming services, which, led by Netflix, have steadily chipped away at industry resistance to seeing them as full competitors with major studio releases.\n\nFor all its hard work, though, Netflix didn’t catch the bouquet, as voters went with Apple’s more uplifting story, about the hearing child of deaf parents. Including this year’s contenders “The Power of the Dog” and “Don’t Look Up,” seven Netflix movies have now been nominated for best picture, but thus far none have won.\n\nBest picture: \"CODA\" Apple TV+ Best actress: Jessica Chastain, \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye\" Searchlight Pictures Best actor: Will Smith, \"King Richard\" Chiabella James/Courtesy of Warner Bros.

Despite that decision, the telecast still ran more than 3 ½ hours.\n\n\"Dune\" won multiple Oscars on Sunday, including best cinematography Chia Bella James\n\nThe other big winner of the night was the science-fiction epic “Dune.” Dominating the technical categories, the Warner Bros. film claimed six Oscars for sound, film editing, production design, cinematography, visual effects and Hans Zimmer’s musical score. It was the prolific composer’s second win out of a dozen nominations, the first coming for “The Lion King” in 1995. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of WarnerMedia.)\n\nThe televised show underscored the emphasis on bringing more entertainment into the telecast, opening with Beyoncé performing the nominated song from “King Richard” outside the venue, before turning it over to hosts Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes, who gently roasted some of the nominees (“House of Gucci” was referred to as “House of Random Accents”) and taking aim at Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, promising, “We’re gonna have a gay night.” Sykes later directed a joke at Texas over its voter-registration laws.\n\n\"Encanto\" won best animanted feature film. Disney\n\nDisney’s “Encanto” was honored as best animated movie. Although the film performed reasonably well in theaters, it (and its music) appeared to particularly catch on after making its debut on the studio’s streaming service, Disney+, symbolic of a year viewed as streaming’s awards coming-out party.\n\nSupporting actress and actor represented perhaps the night’s least-suspenseful selections, but were among the most emotional, with Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur winning for Steven Spielberg’s remake of “West Side Story” and “CODA,” respectively. Kotsur becomes only the second deaf actor to be honored, following his co-star Marlee Matlin, who was recognized for “Children of a Lesser God” in 1987.\n\nSteven Spielberg, from left, Rita Moreno and Ariana DeBose arriving at the Oscars. Jae C. Hong/AP\n\nAfter thanking Spielberg and co-star Rita Moreno (who originally played the role), DeBose spoke of being a queer Afro-Latina woman, quoting the movie in saying to those who might be questioning how they fit in, “There is indeed a place for us.”\n\nQuestlove tearfully accepted an Oscar for his documentary “Summer of Soul,” and Japan’s “Drive My Car” earned best international film, with the three-hour drama having garnered a best picture nomination as well.\n\nKenneth Branagh, an eight-time nominee in various categories, received his first Oscar for writing “Belfast,” the deeply personal look at his homeland that he also directed and produced.\n\nAlthough the Grammys and Tonys employ a similar format in time-shifting awards, many Academy members have complained about the perceived slight to those nominees. Nevertheless, there was a heightened sense of urgency to streamline the presentation after the Oscars slumped to record-low ratings last year, as did many major award shows.\n\nThe switch only saved a bit of time, which was used on lavish musical numbers – including a colorful rendition of “Encanto’s” song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” – comedy bits like dropping Schumer from the rafters dressed as Spider-Man, and showcasing “fan favorites” as unscientifically voted on via Twitter.\n\nThe broadcast also incorporated its share of nostalgia, including a 60th-anniversary James Bond movie tribute, cast reunions from “White Men Can’t Jump,” “Juno” and “Pulp Fiction,” and a 50th-anniversary celebration of “The Godfather,” bringing director Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro out for a standing ovation.\n\nThe latest Bond film, “No Time to Die,” garnered best song for Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell, one of the few awards handed out to a box-office blockbuster, as the industry increasingly splits between popular and prestige fare.", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/03/12/blue-ribbons-oscars-2023-un-ukraine-refugee-solidarity/11463123002/", "title": "What is the blue ribbon at the Oscars?

Well, it wasn't the first time.\n\nBefore another movie joins the hallowed ranks at Sunday's 95th annual Academy Awards (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT), we're rethinking past best picture winners and the films that should have conquered them.\n\n1942\n\nDid win: \"How Green Was My Valley\"\n\nShould have won: \"Citizen Kane\"\n\nPerhaps the most egregious mistake came relatively early in Oscars history, with John Ford's coal-country drama – which took five Academy Awards to a lone \"Kane\" screenplay win – getting the nod over Orson Welles' epic about an eccentric media mogul that is widely regarded as the best movie ever made.\n\n1953\n\nDid win: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"\n\nShould have won: \"High Noon\"\n\nEven with a stellar cast – including Charlton Heston, Dorothy Lamour and Jimmy Stewart – \"Greatest Show\" is essentially a 152-minute commercial for the circus. They must have been clowning around because this category also included \"High Noon,\" one of the greatest Westerns of the genre's golden age with Gary Cooper as a cool lawman.\n\n1967\n\nDid win: \"A Man for All Seasons\"\n\nShould have won: \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\n\nThat year's best picture win went to a rousingly successful Sir Thomas More biopic, along with a bunch of awards-season gold. But come on, \"Man,\" they should have gone for Mike Nichols' debut black comedy about marital strife. It's absolutely nuts, risky for its time, and features astounding turns from Richard Burton and especially Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n1974\n\nDid win: \"The Sting\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Exorcist\"\n\nBoth were huge hits that came in with 10 nominations, and Robert Redford and Paul Newman's ragtime-tinged con-man caper was the safe choice. \"The Exorcist\" was the true standout, a fright-fest masterpiece about faith and innocence that's scared the socks off folks for nearly 50 years.\n\n1980\n\nDid win: \"Kramer vs. Kramer\"\n\nShould have won: \"Apocalypse Now\"\n\nNot to take anything away from the wrenching look at divorce with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, but \"Apocalypse Now\" was unlike any war film that came before it, an operatic and grandiose episode that delved into the horrors, physical and otherwise, inherent on the battlefield.\n\n1982\n\nDid win: \"Chariots of Fire\"\n\nShould have won: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"\n\nOne was a true-life story of Olympic athletes that we remember now mostly because of its catchy theme song. The other was a rip-roaring, two-fisted and hugely influential ode to the serial adventures of yesteryear – with an adventurous archaeologist on the hunt for the Ark of the Covenant – that took pop culture by storm. And a \"Raiders\" win would have been a game-changer for blockbusters.\n\n1986\n\nDid win: \"Out of Africa\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Color Purple\"\n\nThe epic romance with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep in colonial Kenya won over Oscar voters but not critics, who gave \"Africa\" mixed reviews. The Academy whiffed by not honoring a film with Whoopi Goldberg's Golden Globe-winning performance, Oprah Winfrey's high-profile Hollywood debut and Steven Spielberg's honest exploration of racism, sexism and domestic violence in the early 20th century.\n\n1990\n\nDid win: \"Driving Miss Daisy\"\n\nShould have won: \"Field of Dreams\"\n\nThe pairing of Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in a heartwarming dramedy about an elderly white woman and her African-American driver took down \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"My Left Foot\" and \"Dead Poets Society.\" Good movies all around, but none as excellent as the corn-fed Kevin Costner fantasy that captured the wonders of baseball and, yes, dreams.\n\n1995\n\nDid win: \"Forrest Gump\"\n\nShould have won: \"Pulp Fiction\"\n\nTom Hanks literally running through history in the overly earnest \"Gump\" is what the Oscars, at least back in the day, lived for. Not so much Quentin Tarantino's genre mash-up \"Pulp Fiction,\" an ultraviolent, narratively complex cultural phenomenon that wasn't just the best picture that year but arguably of the entire decade.\n\n1997\n\nDid win: \"The English Patient\"\n\nShould have won: \"Fargo\"\n\nAnthony Minghella's romantic World War II drama is a fine film, though it tests viewers' patience over the course of three hours. On the other hand, \"Fargo\" spawned a TV series and a fandom for the Coen brothers' winningly quirky black comedy about murderous deeds and dimwits in snow-covered Minnesota.\n\n1999\n\nDid win: \"Shakespeare in Love\"\n\nShould have won: \"Saving Private Ryan\"\n\n\"Dunkirk\" and \"1917\" have also gone the route of putting the audience right in the middle of the horrors of war, but \"Private Ryan\" did it best – and with \"America's Dad\" Tom Hanks, no less. \"Shakespeare\" had an intriguing concept as a referential, experimental biopic but it has no business upending another Spielberg classic.\n\n2005\n\nDid win: \"Million Dollar Baby\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Aviator\"\n\nMartin Scorsese would end up getting his big Oscar win two years later for \"The Departed\" but it should have happened with \"Aviator.\" The Howard Hughes biopic, piloted by Leonardo DiCaprio's fantastic descent into eccentric madness, is a no-brainer over Clint Eastwood's above-average boxing drama with the super-downer ending.\n\n2006\n\nDid win: \"Crash\"\n\nShould have won: \"Brokeback Mountain\"\n\nPaul Haggis' interwoven all-star drama about racial tensions in L.A., plagued by mixed reviews and complaints of stereotyping, has caught flak for more than 10 years as an Oscar fail. And it is, especially considering Ang Lee's timeless and resonant \"Brokeback\" was sitting right there, with Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledger as cowboys in a forbidden love affair.\n\n2011\n\nDid win: \"The King's Speech\"\n\nShould have won: \"Black Swan\"\n\nThe consensus at the time was that period drama \"King's Speech,\" with Colin Firth's George VI working through a troublesome stutter, pulled an upset on David Fincher's vaunted Facebook bio \"The Social Network.\" Yet flying above both was the polarizing \"Swan,\" Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman's weird and wonderful character study of an embattled ballerina.\n\n2019\n\nDid win: \"Green Book\"\n\nShould have won: \"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\n\"Green Book\" is a fine, well-acted movie but on a night where many Black voices were honored, the top prize went to a film about race relations from a white point of view. Spike Lee's \"BlacKkKlansman,\" however, would have been the ideal choice: an entertaining, thought-provoking cop drama that digs into America's racist past to mirror our own tumultuous times.\n\nRecommended reading for Oscars 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/03/28/oscars-chris-rock-will-smith-police/7189129001/", "title": "Will Smith, Chris Rock Oscars slap: Your legal questions, answered", "text": "Chris Rock declined to file a police report Sunday after Will Smith slapped him onstage at the Academy Awards, Los Angeles police appeared to confirm.\n\nBut now the Academy says it will investigate on its own, releasing a statement Monday afternoon: \"The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night's show. We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law.\"\n\nThis goes one step further than what the Academy said just after Sunday night's show, which was basically that it didn't condone violence.\n\nThe moment that shocked Hollywood and millions of viewers came after Rock made a joke about a “G.I. Jane” sequel, referencing Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head. (Actress Demi Moore appeared in the 1997 movie with a shaved head.)\n\nSmith appeared to laugh at first, before walking up to the stage, slapping Rock, returning to his seat and yelling, “Keep my wife's name out of your (expletive) mouth.”\n\nPinkett Smith was seen rolling her eyes after Rock's joke at the awards show.\n\nIn 2018, she confirmed that she was diagnosed with alopecia, an autoimmune skin disease that can cause hair loss on the scalp and on other parts of the body.\n\n'This is just a wild night':Social media is stunned about Will Smith smacking Chris Rock\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it was “aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program.\".\n\n“The incident involved one individual slapping another,” the LAPD said. “The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.”\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Rock’s representatives for additional information.\n\nStill, the slap seen around the world spurred much discussion from viewers. Could Will Smith face charges? Can the Academy rescind his Oscar?\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nCould Will Smith face assault charges?\n\nSmith's slap was assault and battery under California law, and any watching police officer in the building could have immediately removed Smith from the stage, according to legal analyst Aron Solomon, who says he checked California statutes after the incident witnessed by millions.\n\n\"The immediate question (online) is was it a crime, and statutorily it's clear it was assault and battery – there was actual physical contact – and that's a misdemeanor,\" says Solomon, chief legal analyst for Esquire Digital in Philadelphia, which helps lawyers grow their practices. \"Generally both are punishable by a fine of $2,000 and up to six months in county jail.\"\n\nAlleged misdemeanors in LA are handled by the Los Angeles City Attorney's office. USA TODAY has reached out for a comment.\n\nBut if Rock doesn't press charges, prosecution may be unlikely.\n\n'I was out of line':Will Smith apologizes to Chris Rock after slapping him at Oscars over joke\n\nWhat did Will Smith, the Academy say about the slap?\n\nAfter the incident, Smith accepted the award for best actor for his performance as Venus and Serena Williams’ father in “King Richard,” saying: “I know to do what we do, you’ve got to be able to take abuse; you’ve got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business you’ve got to be able to have people disrespecting you. And you got to smile, and you've got to pretend like that’s OK.\"\n\n\"I want to apologize to the Academy, I want to apologize to my fellow nominees. … Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things.”\n\nSmith apologized directly to Rock on Instagram Monday for his \"unacceptable\" and \"inexcusable\" behavior. \"I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong.\"\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released a statement on Twitter Sunday night saying it “does not condone violence of any form.”\n\n'Love will make you do crazy things':Will Smith apologizes to Oscars after hitting Chris Rock onstage\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild, which is the union that represents film and TV performers, said in a statement Monday that it has been in contact with the Academy and ABC regarding the incident and is working \"to ensure that this behavior is appropriately addressed.\n\n“As the union representing presenters and other performers working on the Oscars, SAG-AFTRA is focused on ensuring our members always work in a safe environment,\" the statement said. \"Violence or physical abuse in the workplace is never appropriate and the union condemns any such conduct. The incident involving Will Smith and Chris Rock at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable.\"\n\nThe union declined to comment \"on any pending member disciplinary process.\"\n\nCould the Academy rescind Will Smith's Oscar?\n\nIt's unlikely, Solomon says, although that would depend on the contractual terms and conditions of its awards process.\n\nFour-time Oscars host Whoopi Goldberg, a member of the Academy's board of governors who won a best supporting actress Oscar in 1991 for \"Ghost,\" also predicted Monday that Smith will not be stripped of his award.\n\n\"We’re not going to take that Oscar from him,” Goldberg said on \"The View.\" \"There will be consequences I’m sure, but I don’t think that’s what they’re going to do, particularly because Chris said, ‘Listen, I’m not pressing any charges.' ”\n\nSo far, the Academy has not rescinded director Roman Polanski's 2003 Oscar for \"The Pianist,\" although it expelled him from the Academy in 2018, decades after he pleaded guilty to statutory rape in a plea bargain in the late 1970s and fled the country.\n\nIn its statement Monday, the Academy cited its bylaws for a variety of sanctions less severe than suspension or expulsion, including private or public reprimand, temporary or permanent loss of privileges, or \"revocation of Academy awards or honors.\"\n\nThe relevant \"inappropriate conduct\" in the Academy bylaws that might apply to the slap includes: \"Physical contact that is uninvited and, in the situation, inappropriate and unwelcome.\" Also: \"Intimidation, stalking, abusive or threatening behavior, or bullying.\"\n\nEven if Rock declines to file a criminal complaint, he could file a civil suit against Smith – and he has up to two years to do so if he later finds he has suffered either a physical injury or reputational injury or both, Solomon says.\n\nIf Rock decides to press criminal charges, prosecutors would then have to decide whether to pursue what's called a \"wobbler,\" an offense that toggles between a misdemeanor and a felony. If Smith's target had been, say, a police officer rather than a fellow entertainer, a prosecutor could make the case that this was a more \"aggressive\" offense, Solomon says.\n\nThe office of Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón declined to comment, citing the jurisdiction of the city attorney's office over alleged misdemeanors.\n\nGascón, who took office in 2020, is under threat of recall, accused by police and many of his own assistant district attorneys of being \"soft\" on crime after he announced new policies aimed at criminal justice reform.\n\nOscars after-parties:Shell-shocked Governors Ball crowd is abuzz over Will Smith Oscars incident\n\nHas this ever happened at the Oscars before?\n\nNot as far as Rachel Fiset knows. She's a former lawyer for the Academy (now a criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles) who used to be among the team of lawyers who, with city lawyers, would work the Oscars before the show, making sure people without tickets didn't sneak in, and having them removed if they did. Then they'd get to go inside and enjoy the ceremony themselves.\n\n\"(The Oscars show) is so warm and so friendly and so fun, and everyone is so excited – so this was really out of the norm,\" she says. Nevertheless, what happened was \"a crime, a misdemeanor, and it could absolutely be charged if the city attorney wanted to pursue it, but I have a hunch they won’t without Chris Rock's cooperation.\"\n\nWhy wasn't Smith removed from his seat after the slap? It was possible to do so, Fiset says, but the lawyers are scattered throughout the audience and probably didn't have time to come together to decide.\n\nMore to the point, she says, the show's producers and lawyers doubtlessly \"knew he was going to win\" and taking him out would not have been a good look for anybody, especially the Academy.\n\n\"The Academy is very conservative and I think not doing anything last night was a conservative approach,\" she says. \"On balance, the Academy made a fair decision in leaving him in the audience to win his Oscar, and then dealing with it today.\"\n\nShe was impressed with Rock's low-key reaction. The \"joke\" he told might have been mean but it wasn't a crime. \"He handled it perfectly,\" she says. \"Will Smith looks very angry, and did himself a lot of reputational harm.\"\n\nHe will likely get Oscar's slap-on-the-wrist punishment, she predicts.\n\nWhat are the repercussions for Will Smith and Chris Rock?\n\nNo matter what happens (or doesn't) in court, the slap was bad for both men, for the Academy and for the movies, Solomon says.\n\n\"It hurts Chris Rock for using poor judgment for making a bad joke that crossed the line, and it hurts Will Smith because (he responded with) violence,\" Solomon says, although he wonders if the level of outrage being expressed online would be the same if it were two white movie stars in a similar wrangle.\n\nThe slap \"dishonored the film ('King Richard'), it dishonored Venus and Serena Williams, it dishonored Questlove (whose win immediately after for best documentary was overshadowed), it dishonored the Academy – there are so many aspects to this that no matter how you slice and dice it, there's nothing good that comes from it.\"\n\nWho won at the Academy Awards?

And Native creatives based in or hailing from Oklahoma are playing key roles in many of the hot new titles.\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed shows out now follows four Native teenagers in rural Oklahoma, while the most popular title ever on one major streaming service is a long-running film franchise's latest installment, which features an Indigenous heroine.\n\nHere are four current or recent TV series and four recent films that you can stream now that are made largely by and about Indigenous people — and three more you can look for coming soon:\n\nMore:Native Americans share why growing representation in entertainment is so vital\n\nTelevision shows\n\n'Reservation Dogs'\n\nWhere to see it:Hulu.\n\nFilmed primarily in Oklahoma, the FX Networks hit debuted in 2021 to almost universal acclaim and premiered its sophomore season last year to more high praise. It has blazed trails as the first mainstream TV show on which every writer, director and series regular performer is Indigenous.\n\nCo-created and executive produced by Oscar-winning New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (\"Thor: Love and Thunder\"), who is of Maori ancestry, and Tulsa-based moviemaker Sterlin Harjo (\"Barking Water\"), who is Seminole and Muscogee, the bawdy and uproarious coming-of-age comedy focuses on four present-day Native teenagers who set out to escape their rural Oklahoma home for sunny California.\n\nIn June, Harjo announced that the third and current season will be the last for the Peabody Award-winning show.\n\n\"As we continued to break stories and write scripts this season, it became clear to the producers, Taika and me that the season three finale is the perfect SERIES finale,” Harjo posted June 29 on Instagram.\n\nSeason 3 of \"Reservation Dogs\" ran 10 episodes, and the series finale bowed Sept. 27.\n\n'Dark Winds'\n\nWhere to see it:AMC+.\n\nThe long-awaited big-budget series based on Oklahoma-born and bred novelist Tony Hillerman's best-selling mystery novels about fictional Navajo detectives Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee debuted in summer 2022. The series was created by Chickasaw Nation citizen and Ardmore native Graham Roland.\n\nWith Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker Chris Eyre (best known for the groundbreaking 1998 indie film \"Smoke Signals\") directing many of its episodes, the series counts film icon Robert Redford and \"Game of Thrones\" mastermind George R.R. Martin among its executive producers, along with Roland.\n\nSet in the 1970s, the series stars Lakota actor Zahn McClarnon (\"Reservation Dogs\") as Leaphorn and Hualapai actor Kiowa Gordon (\"The Twilight Saga\") as Chee. The six-episode first season made a powerful enough impression that the show was quickly renewed for a second.\n\n\"Dark Winds\" Season 2, which also includes six episodes, premiered July 30 on AMC, with the finale airing on Sept. 3.\n\nVariety reports that the series more than doubled its Season 1 viewership on AMC+ with the first two episodes of its sophomore season, and the show recently gained a celebrity fan in Oscar-winning filmmaker and Duncan native Ron Howard, who took to the social media site formerly known as Twitter to praise \"Dark Winds\" as \"Powerful, suspenseful.

Filmed in the Stoney Nakoda Nation near Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with a largely Indigenous cast, the prequel pits one of the now-iconic alien trophy hunters against Naru (Amber Midthunder, \"The Ice Road\"), a Comanche woman determined to prove herself as a warrior.\n\nDirector Dan Trachtenberg (“10 Cloverfield Lane”) worked closely on the creature feature with producer Jhane Myers, a Comanche and Blackfeet artist, dancer and filmmaker who hails from Oklahoma. There's even a version of the film fully dubbed in Comanche — a first for a new movie release in a Native language — available on Hulu.\n\nSoon after the movie premiered in July 2022, 20th Century Studios revealed that the action-thriller, which earned strong reviews, scored the biggest premiere on the Disney-owned streamer to date, topping all film and TV series debuts. Based on hours watched in the first three days of its release, \"Prey\" also marked the most-watched film premiere on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star Banner in all other territories, according to a news release.\n\nDisney and Trachtenberg recently confirmed that \"Prey\" is the rare streaming-only movie to get a physical media release. It was unleashed Oct. 3 on 4K UHD, Blu-ray and DVD. According to Slash Film, the Blu-ray release includes the Comanche audio track as well as two hours of bonus features, including a making-of featurette, panel discussion, alternative opening sequence, deleted scenes and audio commentary.\n\n\"Prey\" will compete for six Primetime Emmys, including Outstanding Television Movie, when the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards air Jan. 15 on Fox.\n\n'Wild Indian'\n\nHow to see it: Starz, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Vudu, Google Play Movies, Apple TV and more.\n\nFilmed in Oklahoma in early 2020, the crime drama marks the feature film debut of Native American writer-director Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr. (Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians) and made its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe harrowing drama centers on two Anishinaabe men — played by Michael Greyeyes (\"Rutherford Falls\"), who is Nêhiyaw (Plains Cree) from Muskeg Lake Cree Nation — Treaty Six Territory in Saskatchewan, and Tahlequah-born actor Chaske Spencer (“The Twilight Saga”), who is Sioux, Nez Perce, Cherokee, Creek, French and Dutch — who share a traumatic boyhood secret about the murder of a schoolmate.\n\n'Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher'\n\nWhere to see it:Netflix.\n\nChickasaw Nation Productions spent years turning the epic life of the titular Chickasaw Rancher, Montford Johnson, into a biopic that spans from his birth in 1843, through the tumultuous years of the Civil War and its aftermath and on to the Land Run of 1889.\n\nThe son of an Englishman and a Chickasaw woman, Johnson (Martin Sensmeier, who is Tlingit and Koyukon-Athabascan) befriended Cherokee fur trader and merchant Jesse Chisholm (Chickasaw citizen Eddie Easterling), who convinced him to establish cattle ranches and trading posts in the newly created Indian Territory to serve his fellow First Americans. At the height of his ranching operations, Johnson accumulated a herd of more than 35,000 head of cattle grazing over a million acres.\n\n'Love and Fury'\n\nWhere to see it:Netflix.\n\nBefore he broke out with \"Reservation Dogs,\" Sterlin Harjo worked for years making independent narrative and documentary films, including this 2020 deadCenter Film Festival selection.\n\nFor this doc, Harjo followed several Indigenous musicians, dancers, visual artists and poets for a year as they pursued their careers in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nARRAY Releasing, the distribution arm of Oscar-nominated filmmaker Ava DuVernay’s narrative change collective, acquired \"Love and Fury\" in fall 2021 for a streaming and limited theatrical release.\n\n3 Native American titles to look for coming soon\n\nMarvel's 'Echo'\n\nWhere to see it: Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nMarvel Studios leaps into Native storytelling with this new series, with all five episodes set to debut Jan. 10, 2024, on both Disney+ and Hulu. They'll be available on Hulu until April 9. \"Echo\" also marks the first Marvel Studios series to drop all episodes at once for maximum binge-watching.\n\nAs part of the \"Hawkeye\" series, Native actress Alaqua Cox, who is Menominee and Mohican, was introduced in late 2021 in the role of Maya Lopez/Echo, the fearsome commander of the criminal organization the Tracksuit Mafia.\n\n\"Echo\" is the first Disney+ Marvel series to get a TV rating of MA, indicating it is for \"mature audiences only,\" largely due to its graphic violence.\n\nThe series is being hailed as major moment not only for Native Americans but also for the disability community: Cox is deaf and an amputee.\n\nAlthough it was filmed in Georgia, the show also is a milestone for Oklahoma: Maya is depicted as Choctaw, and much of the series' action is set in her small-hometown in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.\n\n'Rez Ball'\n\nWhere to see it: Netflix.\n\nAlong with helming episodes of \"Reservation Dogs\" and Marvel's \"Echo,\" Navajo director Sydney Freeland wrote with Harjo this Native American basketball drama, which is based on Michael Powell’s sports novel \"Canyon Dreams.\" LeBron James is among the producers.\n\nDescribed as \"Friday Night Lights\" meets \"Hoosiers,\" the coming-of-age sports drama follows the Chuska Warriors, a Native American high school basketball team from Chuska, New Mexico, that must band together after losing their star player if they want to keep their quest for a state championship alive. It's an all-American underdog sports story — with all-American underdogs who happen to be Navajo.\n\nProduction got underway earlier this year in New Mexico, including filming on reservations with the permission and support of the local sovereign tribal nations.\n\nNo release date has been announced.\n\n'Yellow Bird'\n\nWhere to see it: Paramount+.\n\nTrue crime stories have been big hits for streamers (think \"Girl in the Picture,\" \"The Innocent Man\" and \"Tiger King\"), so this project, which was announced in 2021, definitely has potential.\n\nHarjo and fellow Native writer-director Erica Tremblay (Seneca-Cayuga), who is originally from Oklahoma, are reportedly co-creating and executive producing a potential series based on Sierra Crane Murdoch’s Pulitzer Prize finalist \"Yellow Bird: Oil, Murder and a Woman’s Search for Justice in Indian Country.\"\n\nWhen Lissa Yellow Bird was released from prison in 2009, she found her home, the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, transformed by the Bakken oil boom. When Yellow Bird learned three years later that a young, white oil worker had disappeared from his reservation worksite, she became concerned.\n\nThe book (and presumably the intended series) chronicles her obsessive search for clues, which takes her on two divergent paths: to her own tribe, altered by oil-boom wealth, and to the non-Native, down-on-their-luck oilmen, including many who traveled hundreds of miles to find work toward the end of the Great Recession.\n\nYellow Bird will be among the executive producers of the show, according to Deadline.

But those aren’t the rewards they’ve been seeking.\n\nThere’s the “media blitz” of press interviews and appearances in recent weeks. There’s the steady campaign to get voters for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences to this week choose “Traffic Stop,” Davis and Heilbroner’s 32-minute short-documentary contender, for the big prize at the March 4 ceremony. But the sudden visibility for the married, part-time Martha’s Vineyard residents is only part of the triumph.\n\nEven more, it’s the 600 movie theaters around the country and many more in 30 countries that Heilbroner says are now screening a social-justice-oriented film that might otherwise have largely been seen only by a certain percentage of HBO viewers.\n\nAnd it’s the many interviews being given by the subject of “Traffic Stop”: black second-grade schoolteacher Breaion King. Davis and Heilbroner want as many people as possible to learn about the physical struggle, handcuffing and arrest that happened to King, who had no criminal record. That happened after a white Texas police officer stopped her for driving too fast and, King says and is indicated in the video from the incident, that she was trying to comply with his orders.\n\n“What’s exciting to me is that the film is getting the platform of the Oscars … (and) we’re quite set on having the film change the world as much as it can,” director Davis says in a phone interview. She mentions that “Traffic Stop” might be used in police training and also to start conversations with young African-Americans about how to better interact with police. “There are groups who really want to help us use this as a tool for social change.”\n\nMentioning concern about the high number of black people who are stopped by police and the “thousands” who are “roughed up and sometimes killed,” producer Heilbroner adds that outreach is key. “We think we have a film that can be a good conversation starter, and this is a conversation that needs to happen in this country.”\n\nKing will accompany Davis and Heilbroner to the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles, as will their children – Katrina, 20, and Quentin, 23 – who helped work on the film. The couple says King, who continues to be shaken by the 2015 incident, has been wonderful in helping to get the word out about the film as she’s tried to balance the new fame with her teaching schedule.\n\nWhen nominated for an Oscar, there’s “the pride in your work that might win an award and you feel happy about that,” says Heilbroner. “But you always have to remind yourself that this is a real story. This is not a story that you wrote; this is someone’s life.”\n\nWhile “Traffic Stop” represents the filmmakers’ first time in the Oscar race and first documentary short, they are hardly new to awards for their work or for focusing their filmmaking on social justice topics. Davis, whose childhood summers were spent in Woods Hole and who co-founded the Woods Hole Film Festival, first gained some fame for 2001’s “Southern Comfort.” The documentary about a transgender man dying of ovarian cancer won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and a Special Audience Award at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nThe joint work by Davis and Heilbroner, a former prosecutor and author, has since included 2004’s “Jockey,” which won Davis a Primetime Emmy Award, about the difficult working conditions in horse racing; 2010’s “Stonewall Uprising,” about how the Stonewall riots in New York City affected the gay rights movement; and 2014’s “The Newburgh Sting,” about the FBI targeting a Muslim community.\n\nSeveral of the couple’s films have been shown locally at the Martha’s Vineyard Film Center, where Davis is on the board of directors. Davis has high praise for center founder Richard Paradise’s programming there, calling the theater “one of the best technically that I know.” Paradise says he is a big fan of the couple’s movies and has been praising and showing “Traffic Stop” on the island regularly before the Oscars.\n\nDavis and Heilbroner also have shown films at the Woods Hole festival and at the Newport Film Festival in Rhode Island (the couple’s “Pucker Up,” about a whistling contest). They plan to screen the full-length documentary “Say Her Name: The Life and Death of Sandra Bland” – about a black Texas woman taken to jail after a traffic stop and later found hanged in her cell – at this summer’s Woods Hole festival. They are also finishing up “Born Into the Gig,” a documentary about the children of famous singers who are trying to make it in the music business. Ben and Sally Taylor from the Vineyard – children of James Taylor and Carly Simon – are part of that movie.\n\nDavis and Heilbroner have an apartment in New York City and a home in Connecticut – where poor internet reception delayed them being able to find the Oscar nominations online until they started getting congratulatory text messages. They have brought their work, too, to Heilbroner’s longtime family home on the island, where the couple and their children spend summers and have sometimes lived year-round.\n\nThe couple was on the island when they got the call from HBO about King’s story, which was similar to what they were working on in “Say Her Name.” Davis had wanted to try directing a short film. This situation seemed a perfect choice to tell simply and focus on one particular incident and one afternoon, but also tell what Davis describes as “a slice of life that could happen to any African-American who is pulled over” by the police.\n\nDavis compares the style they ended up using on “Traffic Stop” to a poem, with Heilbroner noting appreciation that HBO didn’t require something more expository or linear. “Traffic Stop”– which can be viewed on HBO On Demand – tells King’s story by showing scenes of her talking, teaching her students and dancing, then intercutting those with police dash-cam video of her arrest and subsequent ride in a police car.\n\nThe dash-cam shows the officer picking up the slight King and throwing her to the ground, handcuffing her, threatening to taze her and shoving her into the car. The in-car footage also records a conversation King had with another police officer about why white police officers so often seem to have altercations with black residents.\n\n“We were so enamored of her right away, by her poise, her intelligence,” the child of a single mother who was the first in her family to go to college, and who “had made a career for herself,” Davis says. “Here’s someone doing everything right who ends up really roughed up by the cops. And she has the presence of mind to (later) engage this (second) police officer in this conversation about race. … (She) helps to humanize so many people’s stories who you don’t hear about.”\n\nWhile “Traffic Stop” has resulted in an Oscar season that has been “exciting” and “really, really fun,” talking to so many people about their movie in recent weeks has been much more of a “whirlwind” than they expected. Describing doing a 7:15 a.m. Sunday interview for a morning TV talk show, Heilbroner notes with a laugh, “That’s not a typical day in the life of a civil-rights filmmaker doing documentary films.”\n\nIs that kind of Oscar campaign worth it? Besides getting word out about the film and its subject to as many people as possible, he says, “We might as well try to win.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/carron-phillips/2017/03/02/phillips-black-americas-beef-award-shows/98543220/", "title": "Phillips: Black America's beef with award shows", "text": "Carron J. Phillips\n\nThe News Journal\n\nFirst, it was the Grammys and then it was last Sunday’s Oscars.\n\nBut no matter the awards show – unless it’s the NAACP Image or the BET Awards – Black America is getting sick and tired of being sick and tired of not seeing their faces represented enough at the podium.\n\n“One of the first people who taught me how to act was Denzel Washington and I met him for the first time tonight. Thank you,” said Casey Affleck after he won Best Actor for his role in “Manchester by the Sea” over Washington.\n\nBritish pop singer Adele gave similar credit to one of her muses, Beyoncé, weeks prior during the Grammys.\n\n“But I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and grateful and gracious but the artist of my life is Beyoncé. And this album for me, the \"Lemonade\" album, was so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul bearing …You are our light,” said Adele after she won the Grammy for Album of the Year over Beyoncé.\n\nCasey Affleck is the new Adele, and Denzel Washington is just the latest Beyoncé.\n\nThere have only been 10 black artists to win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and after last Sunday at the Academy Awards, an African-American's name has only been called to the stage 37 times in the award show's history. That includes awards in the categories of acting, directing, writing and music.\n\nFor some people, awards shows aren't \"that big of deal,\" but when you've been marginalized and overlooked for centuries, accolades are never menial.\n\nThey weren't for Hattie McDaniel in 1940 when she became the first African-American to win in Oscar.\n\n\"I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry.\"\n\nAnd that same notion rang true when Halle Berry won in 2002.\n\n\"(This moment) it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.\"\n\nSince activist and writer April Reign started the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite back in 2015, we have seen few improvements. While the Academy Awards air-balled last year in the diversity category, they set new records this year in the number of nominations among people of color.\n\nBut still, the beef between Black America and award ceremonies remains.\n\nBecause we still remember that Taylor Swift, Daft Punk and Macklemore beat Kendrick Lamar at the Grammys. Beck somehow won over Beyoncé. And while he already has two Oscars to his name, there’s this feeling that Denzel Washington should have more, especially when Spike Lee, John Singleton and Will Smith don’t have any.\n\nLast Sunday night we cheered as Viola Davis, Mahershala Ali, Barry Jenkins and Ezra Edelman walked off the stage with trophies in hand.\n\nBut we also felt cheated when the first movie with an all-Black cast to win Best Picture had their historic moment ruined by an epic mistake.\n\n\"Moonlight\" was forced to share the spotlight.\n\nWe were robbed of hearing Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCrane's speech. But fortunately for us, Jenkins recently revealed what he would have said.\n\n“[Moonlight playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney] and I are this kid. We are Chiron,” he says, referring to his background as a child from Liberty City, Miami, whose mother once struggled with drug addiction. “And you don’t think that kid grows up to be nominated for eight Academy Awards. It’s not a dream he’s allowed to have. I still feel that way. I didn’t think this was possible. But now I look at other people looking at me and if I didn’t think it was possible, how are they going to? But now it’s happened. So what I think ofpossibility, let’s take it off the table. The thing has happened.”\n\nBlame Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, or PwC for the epic catastrophe that took place at the end of Sunday night’s show, but we all lost. \"La La Land's\" bunch had their moment taken from them, and the team from Moonlight weren’t able to properly celebrate.\n\nIt was just another example of how most Black Americans feel when something goes right for them in their life. You don’t want to believe that it’s real at first, and even then, sometimes you still can’t celebrate your victories like you want.\n\n“It's hard to feel joy in a moment like that, in front of (the La La Land cast and crew),\" said \"Moonlight\" actor Mahershala Ali backstage after the show.\n\nIn a weird way, it’s reminiscent of the lesson that Black children are constantly reminded of by their parents in this country: “You have to be twice as good as them, to get half of what they have.”\n\nThe notion can be confusing, frustrating and sounds cruel, but it’s real.\n\nAnd that’s what lies at the center of this beef. Because always having to prove yourself over and over again at your job, in your life, while playing a character in a movie, or while even making an album, is exhausting.\n\nEspecially when you know that your half efforts are better than others' when they’re at their best.\n\nAnd the times when you do give your all, you accept that you're not likely to hear your name called when it’s time for someone to take the stage to receive their trophy.\n\nI misspoke before.\n\nBlack America doesn’t have a beef with award shows. It has one with the mediocrity that they consistently reward at them.\n\nCarron J. Phillips is the Engagement Editor at delawareonline. Contact him at cphillips@delawareonline.com.

Others, like major earthquakes, solar flares or cyberattacks, have the potential to disrupt communications for millions of people for an extended period of time.\n\nThe challenges people faced on Thursday ranged from nuisances to serious communication issues and can be a learning experience for the future in case of a big emergency, Provencio said.\n\nWhat does SOS mode on iPhone mean?Symbol appears during AT&T outage Thursday\n\n\"Use this experience to inform future action,\" Provencio said. \"If you are having difficulty today, then you're likely going to have it again at some point.\"\n\nOn Thursday, some local emergency service providers told people if they needed to reach 911, they should try calling from a landline or ask someone else to call for them.

After major hurricanes like 2017's Maria in Puerto Rico, power and communications could be impacted for days, weeks or even months on end.\n\n\"Right now, we are asking people to consider that possibility.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/29/nashville-bombing-area-communications-network-exposed-achilles-heel/4070797001/", "title": "Nashville bombing at AT&T building exposed area communications ...", "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – The vulnerability of the telecommunications system in Nashville and beyond became clear Christmas Day when AT&T's central office in downtown became the site of a bombing.\n\nMayor John Cooper called the blast on Second Avenue an attack on infrastructure.

Paul Bailey, R-Sparta, who most recently served as chairman of the Senate commerce committee, hopes the Tennessee legislature can hear from AT&T representatives about what type of plan they’re implementing to prevent this type of outcome if another similar disaster occurs.\n\n\"They need to have better redundancies in place,” Bailey said, referring to AT&T’s backup systems to prevent widespread outages. “It’s just very concerning that we have 911 centers go down. Lots of emergency services losing communications. That’s really concerning to me.”\n\nNashville Metro Council member Freddie O'Connell, who represents the downtown area, said the city must also follow up on how to create more redundancy in critical communication systems in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\n\"How does a city as a whole function if we go through something like this again or a natural disaster?\" he said. \"We learned our systems are not redundant enough when one major provider goes offline.\"\n\nPolice officers on the scene Friday were issued burner phones, according to Metro police spokesperson Don Aaron. Nashville’s police department uses FirstNet network, a priority network for first responders to use on existing AT&T cell towers for voice and data.\n\nNashville’s 911 line remained operational but officials were without access to administrative phone lines through Friday evening, according to Stephen Martini, director of the Nashville Department of Emergency Communications.\n\nIn the absence of non-emergency phone lines, residents were encouraged to request services through hubNashville online, which officials monitored for a three-day period.\n\nMartini said communications to emergency personnel via radio was never impacted over the weekend.\n\nHe declined to share details on how the department remained operational, citing sensitive public safety information, but said a redundancy plan, dubbed the PACE method (Primary, Alternate, Contingent, Emergency), was in place.\n\nNashville’s director of information and technology services, Keith Durbin, said Verizon phones had to be driven to some staff on Christmas Day.\n\n“This was one of the worst case scenarios that happened,” Durbin said. “... To have (AT&T)completely taken out … was even broader impact than we thought.”\n\nLuckily, he said, none of the city’s “internal network backbone” was affected, with issues primarily coming from smaller Metro facilities. Some were continuing to experience issues Monday, including the Davidson County Clerk's office.\n\nThe city was able to switch from AT&T to a secondary internet carrier Friday. But the city doesn’t have a backup for phone services. It’s something officials have considered in recent years.\n\nThose talks, Durbin said, will be revived after the bombing. He said he’s confident it’ll now get wide support.\n\nBailey said he heard from 911 center directors in his district reporting outages nearly 100 miles away from Nashville. Residents in the area received reverse emergency calls to inform them not to dial 911, but instead to use another phone number to get in touch with dispatchers.\n\nAnd then there were the retail stores, pharmacies, businesses and hospitals that were impacted, he said.\n\nHe credits AT&T for working quickly to restore service. But he said it’s concerning that one incident could wipe out so much of the region’s communications capability.\n\n“This affected our entire Southeast region,” Bailey said. “There were multiple states that had issues because of this.”\n\nBut as for whether the Tennessee General Assembly wields much power to compel action from AT&T, “the short answer is no, we don’t,” Bailey said.\n\nThe state’s Public Utility Commission, a five-member board consisting of political appointees, also has limited ability to regulate for-profit communications companies. Much of that would be a federal issue, Bailey noted.\n\nState and hospitals face outages\n\nThe city wasn't alone in experiencing communication outages.\n\nThe Tennessee General Assembly, which has offices adjoining the Capitol downtown, also had outages over the weekend. The email system was down for a portion of the day Saturday, and staff were told to work from home Monday after the building experienced phone outages until Sunday evening.\n\nState government office buildings remained closed Monday due to safety hazards that the outages continued to pose, said Lola Potter, spokesperson for the Department of Finance and Administration.\n\nFire and safety alarm systems in state buildings in Nashville still weren’t fully functioning.\n\nOther state services were impacted over the weekend, though state employees found workarounds and alerted authorities in some situations, such as with reporting child abuse.\n\n“Obviously we were concerned about it, but we took precautions by reaching out to law enforcement,” said Jennifer Donnals, chief of staff for the Department of Children’s Services.\n\nA state web form and app that field child abuse reports remained in service, Donnals said, and staff in different regions also alerted major children’s hospitals around the state to the hotline being down.\n\nThe timing of the disruptions occurring on a weekend – and a holiday weekend at that – meant the agency would likely have been receiving fewer complaints than on weekdays anyway.\n\nMeanwhile, hospitals in the region have also had to work around outages since the weekend, mostly stemming from their landline phone systems going down and being unable to receiving incoming calls.\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center reported it was back in service by late Monday afternoon, while TriStar Centennial Medical Center was experiencing some intermittent outages.\n\nBoth hospitals had to set up new, temporary phone numbers for people to call, according to spokespeople for both hospital systems\n\nHealth records and other IT infrastructure needed to care for patients were not affected at Vanderbilt, nor were employees’ ability to make internal calls within the hospital.\n\nThere were remaining limitations to flight corridors in and out of the Nashville International Airport on Monday, but it did not have a significant impact on flight departures and arrivals, according to Tom Jurkovich, vice president of communications and public affairs for the airport.\n\nFlights were grounded at Nashville Airport on Christmas afternoon due to telecommunication issues stemming from the explosion. Jurkovich estimated up to 45 of 116 flights scheduled for departure that day were delayed.\n\nFollow reporters Yihyun Jeong and Natalie Allison on Twitter: @yihyun_jeong, @natalie_allison\n\nMore:The ways Donald Trump and Republicans have tried to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 win\n\nMore:Red tape, confusion block COVID homeless aid from cash-strapped cities, counties across US", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/08/05/att-users-reporting-widespread-service-outage/31125437/", "title": "AT&T blames outages on hardware", "text": "Matthew Glowicki\n\n@MattGlo\n\nMany in Louisville took to social media Tuesday reporting widespread Internet and cellphone network service outages.\n\nUsers bombarded the social media accounts of telecommunication companies AT&T, as well as Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint with complaints about the outage.

Ron DeSantis and Republican lawmakers, a Florida judge has ruled that a new state law banning abortions at 15 weeks is unconstitutional and he intends to block it from taking effect on Friday.\n\nIn a verbal ruling on Thursday, Second Judicial Circuit Court Judge John Cooper said he would be issuing a temporary statewide injunction that will go into effect once he signs the written order in the challenge brought by some Florida abortion providers.\n\nThe decision is a short-term victory for abortion rights advocates in Florida and it comes a week after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated a constitutional right that had existed for half a century. Once Cooper signs the ruling, abortion in Florida will remain legal until 24 weeks into a pregnancy, making the state one of the most permissive in the south.\n\nChristina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, told CNN in a statement that the state intends to appeal the ruling.\n\n“While we are disappointed with today’s ruling, we know that the pro-life HB 5 will ultimately withstand all legal challenges,” Pushaw said.\n\nAbortion rights advocates and Democrats celebrated the decision by Cooper. In a statement, Florida Democratic Party Chair Manny Diaz said the law was “a gross interference in personal medical decisions that should be between patients and their doctors.”\n\n“Politicians like the Governor have no business restricting Floridians’ health freedoms,” he added.\n\nIn the short term, the decision will have far-reaching implications for women across the south, where so-called trigger laws – bans designed to take effect with the overturning of Roe v. Wade – and bans no longer in legal limbo are quickly halting access to the procedure. For years, Florida has been a safe harbor for women seeking abortion, and providers expect the state’s 55 clinics will be busy with appointments for women from surrounding states where abortion may soon be illegal.\n\nDeSantis signed the new abortion restrictions into law in April at an Orlando-area megachurch surrounded by women and children and cheered on by pastors, anti-abortion activists and other supporters.\n\nThe law would ban abortion at 15 weeks with no exemptions for women who become pregnant as a result of rape, incest or human trafficking. The law would allow for abortions in cases where a pregnancy is “serious risk” to the mother or a if fatal fetal abnormality is detected and two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing.\n\nAbout 75,000 of the 80,000 abortions reported by the state in 2021 came during the first trimester, meaning the vast majority of procedures will still be allowed under the new state law. Historically, Florida ranks among the states with the most abortions per capita annually, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe law directly challenged decades of legal precedent establishing abortion as constitutionally protected in Florida. The state constitution in Florida includes a right to privacy, which the state Supreme Court has long interpreted as giving Floridians the freedom to access abortion without government intrusion.\n\nIn his ruling from the bench, Cooper said the ban “violates the privacy provision of the Florida Constitution.”\n\nWhile the decision will delay the implementation of the state’s new abortion restrictions while the case proceeds through the legal system, the expectation is that the state’s conservative Supreme Court will have the final say. All seven members of the state’s high court were appointed by Republican governors, including three selected by DeSantis. By the time the case makes its way to the state Supreme Court, there may be a fourth DeSantis appointee on the bench due to a recent retirement.\n\nPushaw said it is the argument of the state that the Florida Supreme Court “previously misinterpreted Florida’s right to privacy as including a right to an abortion. We reject this interpretation because the Florida Constitution does not include – and has never included – a right to kill an innocent unborn child.”\n\nThe dramatic shift of the legal landscape in Florida has left Democrats and abortion rights advocates pessimistic that the longstanding legal protections will withstand this challenge for long.\n\n“We don’t believe this court will see it the way other courts have,” state Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book recently told CNN. “Any piece of protection, that modicum of protection is gone.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the time at which Florida’s 15-week abortion ban will be halted.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/georgia-six-week-abortion-law-overturned/index.html", "title": "Judge overturns Georgia's six-week abortion ban | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA Georgia Superior Court judge has overturned the state’s law banning abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy, ruling it unconstitutional and saying it cannot be enforced.\n\nThe decision from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney makes the procedure legal in the state again until at least 20 weeks of pregnancy, effective immediately. The judge’s order comes in response to a lawsuit that sought to strike down the ban on multiple grounds and will apply statewide.\n\nHB481, dubbed Georgia’s LIFE Act, bans, with some exceptions, abortion when early cardiac activity is detected – as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when many women don’t yet know they are pregnant.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a group that seeks to “strengthen and amplify the collective voices of indigenous women and women of color to achieve reproductive justice,” according to the group’s website.\n\n“After a long road, we are finally able to celebrate the end of an extreme abortion ban in our state,” Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, said in a statement, adding: “While we applaud the end of a ban steeped in white supremacy, it should not have existed in the first place. Now, it’s time to move forward with a vision for Georgia that establishes full bodily autonomy and liberation for our communities. “\n\nIn his opinion, McBurney wrote that when Georgia lawmakers passed the bill and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, “the supreme law of this land unequivocally was – and had been for nearly half a century – that laws unduly restricting abortion before viability were unconstitutional.”\n\nBecause the right to pre-viability abortion existed nationwide when the law was enacted, Georgia could not legally restrict it at that time, he wrote.\n\nThe state has filed a notice of appeal, according to a Kemp spokesperson.\n\n“Today’s ruling places the personal beliefs of a judge over the will of the legislature and people of Georgia,” the spokesperson said.\n\nWhen approving the measure in 2019, Kemp had said: “I realize that some may challenge it in a court of law. But our job is to do what is right, not what is easy. We are called to be strong and courageous, and we will not back down. We will always continue to fight for life.”\n\nState Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, “will continue to fulfill our duty to defend the laws of our state in court,” his spokesman, Kara Richardson, said in an email.\n\nMcBurney wrote in his opinion that sections of the legislation “were plainly unconstitutional when drafted, voted upon, and enacted.”\n\n“…[E]verywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments — federal, state, or local — to ban abortions before viability,” he wrote, adding that “if the courts have spoken, clearly and directly, as to what the law is, as to what is and is not constitutional, legislatures and legislators are not at liberty to pass laws contrary to such pronouncements.”\n\nWhile signed into law in 2019, the legislation had been blocked from taking effect until this summer. After the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization – which overturned Roe v. Wade, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion – the Georgia ban remained on hold for several weeks until a federal appellate court allowed the law to be immediately enforced.\n\nMcBurney wrote that lawmakers might pass similar legislation in light of the Dobbs ruling, but they would first have to face the “sharp glare of public attention that will undoubtedly and properly attend such an important and consequential debate whether the rights of unborn children justify such a restriction on women’s right to bodily autonomy and privacy.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Nick Valencia Devon M.

Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed into law a bill modeled after the controversial Texas abortion law, which allows private citizens to take civil action against abortion providers to enforce the law.\n\nThe “Oklahoma Heartbeat Act,” Senate Bill 1503, takes effect immediately and prohibits abortions at the time when a physician can detect early cardiac activity in an embryo or fetus, which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy – before many women even know that they are pregnant. The measure provides exceptions for medical emergencies, but not for rape or incest.\n\n“I am proud to sign SB 1503, the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act into law,” Stitt, a Republican, said in a tweet with photographs of him signing the legislation. “I want Oklahoma to be the most pro-life state in the country because I represent all four million Oklahomans who overwhelmingly want to protect the unborn.”\n\nSB 1503 would also allow private citizens to bring a civil lawsuit against a person who performs or induces an abortion, intends to perform an abortion, or knowingly aids or abets an abortion, such as paying for the procedure. Under the bill, relief would include at least $10,000 in statutory damages for each abortion the defendant performed or aided in violation of the act, legal fees and compensatory damages.\n\nThe bill would prohibit civil action against certain individuals, including the woman who had the abortion or sought the procedure. The bill also would bar a person who impregnated a woman through rape, sexual assault or incest from bringing a civil action.\n\nLast month, Stitt signed a near-total abortion ban into law that makes performing an abortion illegal in the state, with an exception only in the case of a medical emergency.\n\nThat law, which is expected to take effect this summer, makes performing or attempting to perform an abortion a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both.\n\nAbortion providers, including Planned Parenthood and the Tulsa Women’s Reproductive Clinic, last week filed a challenge to SB 1503.\n\nOn Tuesday, shortly before Stitt signed the legislation into law, the Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to grant the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order that would have paused the measure from taking effect.\n\nThe plaintiffs expressed disappointment in the court’s decision but said they would continue fighting in hopes of ultimately blocking the law.

Wade decision. The opinion is not final, and it is possible the vote count will change before a formal opinion is later rolled out, likely by the end of June. In it, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the “authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.”\n\nAt the case’s December hearing, the conservative justices who appeared inclined to join Alito framed a post-Roe landscape as one where states can choose the contours of their abortion policies for themselves.\n\nBut legal experts say the reality, if Roe is reversed, will not be that simple.\n\nAlready, lawmakers in both red and blue states are beginning to draw new battles lines in expectation of a patchwork system where abortion rights are no longer protected nationwide.\n\nLegislation introduced this year in Missouri is an extreme example of how anti-abortion lawmakers are looking to crack down on abortions that happen beyond their states’ borders.\n\nOne measure sought to allow private citizens to sue anyone who helps a Missouri resident obtain an abortion out of state, while also targeting efforts to provide medication abortion to residents. Another bill would apply Missouri’s abortion laws to abortions obtained out of state by Missouri residents and in other circumstances, including in cases where “sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.”\n\nThat bill has seen no movement in the legislature, while lawmakers did an end run around the other legislation when it was brought up on the state House floor last month.\n\nMary Ziegler, a Florida State University College of Law professor who’s the author of “Abortion and the Law in America: A Legal History, Roe v. Wade to the Present,” said the Missouri bill is a sign of things to come.\n\n“This won’t be the last state that tries to regulate conduct outside of its borders,” Ziegler told CNN.\n\n‘The portability of medication abortion changes the access landscape’\n\nWhat has complicated the picture since the last time the Supreme Court seemed to be poised to overturn Roe is the development of medication abortion, in which pregnancies are ended with a two-pill regime. It is now the method used in more than half of all abortions in the country. A recent loosening of the regulations around abortion pills, which the Food and Drug Administration has now cleared to be dispersed by mail, has prompted anti-abortion states to think of new ways to regulate its availability. How the pandemic expanded the use of telemedicine has also changed the abortion landscape, as – coupled with the loosened FDA regulations – some abortion patients can undergo the medication abortion procedures without being inside a clinic.\n\n“In the last three years education about abortion pills has been a huge part of my job,” said Katie Glenn, the government affairs counsel for the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life.\n\nSeveral states have outlawed telemedicine abortions and sending the pills by mail.\n\nBut some, like Texas, have gone further by contemplating how they’ll prosecute providers who seek to send in abortion pills from out of state. Texas last year expanded upon its existing prohibitions on mailing medication abortion pills by classifying the offense as the type of crime that would warrant extradition.\n\n“As you start to think about all the ways that the portability of medication abortion changes the access landscape, I think you see a lot of laws targeting that,” said Rachel Rebouché, who is a co-author of a coming law review article exploring the interstate legal questions raised by a Roe reversal.\n\nOn the flip side – and in anticipation that their states will become so-called “safe havens” for abortion seekers and clinics – Democratic lawmakers are pushing proposals that would limit the ability of out-of-state authorities to investigate providers within blue states.\n\nNew York lawmakers have introduced several bills that would protect abortion providers from extradition to other states. California is considering legislation aimed at the civil enforcement mechanism – i.e. lawsuits filed by private citizens against those who facilitate outlawed abortions – that was championed by Texas’ six-week ban and is being considered by other states.\n\nA bill in Connecticut would bar state agencies from assisting investigations or prosecutions launched by out-of-state authorities and restrict the disclosure of reproductive health records sought by out-of-state subpoenas, among other provisions.\n\nGlenn argued that these bills may have unintended effects on patients. She posited, for instance, that the Connecticut bill would prevent an out-of-state resident from pursuing a lawsuit for a botched delivery performed in the state.\n\nConnecticut state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, dismissed the criticism, telling CNN that “those on the anti-choice side would say anything to try and prevent individuals from being able to access legal safe abortion care.”\n\nShe said Connecticut lawmakers were prompted to push the bill, which passed the legislature last week, by the novel Texas law. The Texas law provided a model for one of the Missouri proposals targeting out-of-state abortions.\n\n“By being able to go after individuals that assist someone with an abortion, we recognized that a Texas-like law, in other states – they could reach to Connecticut,” Gilchrest said.\n\n‘Swift and decisive action’ against companies that aid employees in obtaining abortions out of state\n\nTexas legislators have previewed how they may seek to hinder access to the procedure even beyond their state.\n\nOne statehouse Republican sent Citigroup a letter earlier this year demanding that the company end its policy – adopted in reaction to the six-week ban – of covering travel costs for employees seeking abortions out of state.\n\nTexas state Rep. Briscoe Cain promised “swift and decisive action” if the company did not rescind the policy.\n\n“I intend to introduce legislation next session that bars local governments in Texas from doing business with any company that pays the abortion-related expenses of its employees or that provides abortion coverage as an employee benefit — regardless of where the employee is located or where the abortion is performed,” Cain wrote, adding that his proposal would apply “even if the employee is located out of state and even if the abortion is performed out of state.”\n\nCitigroup declined to comment on the Cain letter.\n\nThe tactic threatened by Cain echos a bill Texas enacted last year aimed at banks that decided to no longer finance certain gun manufacturing companies. But, more broadly, key legal questions remain untested about how lawmakers can regulate abortion-related conduct that happens outside their states.\n\nThe topic was debated among legal academics ahead the 1992 Supreme Court ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey, a case that many believed would lead to the end of Roe. (The court instead upheld its protections.) It was also the subject of a law review article in 2007, when the departure from the court of Justice Sandra Day O’ Connor, the swing vote in the Casey case, revived the belief that Roe’s days are numbered.\n\n“Basically every time there’s this inflection point, with the court changing, you see kind of these issues come up again,” said Greer Donley, who is one of the co-authors of the new article, which will be published in the Columbia Law Review, about the topic.\n\nBut, she said, this is the first time “we’re really starting to see legislators playing with the text and language of these bills coming out.”\n\n“And certainly you have an anti-abortion movement that is extremely emboldened right now with its own belief that the court is going to support a lot of its more creative measures,” Donley told CNN.\n\nThis story has been updated following the publication of a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v.

Gavin Newsom is escalating his feud with Republican-led states that have restricted access to abortion after the US Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this summer that rolled back the federal right to those services that was enshrined in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nAs part of his effort to make California a safe harbor for women seeking abortions, Newsom, a Democrat, launched a new state website earlier this week aimed at connecting women who live out of state with reproductive health care, including a tool that would help them find a provider and how to seek financial assistance for those services. On Thursday, he announced that his gubernatorial campaign has paid for 18 billboards advertising that site in seven states that have enacted abortion restrictions: Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.\n\nTouching on the privacy concerns many women in those states now face, Newsom, in a video announcing the new website abortion.ca.gov, noted that it will not track them or their personal information – as conservative lawmakers in some states weigh laws to prevent their state’s residents from seeking care across state lines.\n\nIn a statement announcing the billboards, Newsom said he had a message for “any woman seeking abortion care in these anti-freedom states: Come to California. We will defend your constitutional right to make decisions about your own health.”\n\n“These un-American abortion bans – many of them without exceptions for rape and incest – are literally killing women. The idea that these Republican politicians are seeking to ‘protect life’ is a total farce. They are seeking to restrict and control their constituents and take away their freedom,” he added.\n\nThe new billboards feature provocative messages such as “Texas doesn’t own your body. You do,” along with the new website address. “Need an abortion? California is ready to help,” another billboard reads.\n\nThe effort by Newsom, who is widely viewed as a future White House contender, is just the latest salvo in his flashy campaign against red state counterparts like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who he has deemed a threat to fundamental human rights in this country. With no serious threat to his re-election prospects this November, Newsom has sought to raise his profile nationally with the help of the prodigious war chest that he built up while successfully warding off a recall last year.\n\nHe aired $105,000 of ads on Fox News starting on July 4 targeting DeSantis as he told Floridians that freedom was under attack in their state – citing DeSantis’ restrictive moves to ban books and curtail access to abortion as well as the ballot box – and inviting those who were bothered by the Florida governor’s maneuvers to decamp to California. He then pledged $100,000 to Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee opposing DeSantis in November.\n\nDeSantis has responded by calling attention to crime in California and some of the worst problems with homelessness in the nation.\n\nFrom his political Twitter account on Tuesday, Newsom also noted the national stakes that have energized scores of moderate and progressive female voters ahead of the November elections as he drew attention to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham’s new proposed national ban on abortion – providing a link to California’s new website as he argued that the GOP’s agenda is about “controlling women.”\n\nEarlier this week, Graham introduced a bill that would limit abortion after 15 weeks with exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother. The South Carolina senator’s move has divided the GOP caucus and complicated the path ahead for many candidates in his party who are seeking office in swing states where the majority of voters favor abortion rights. Many Republican senators, including Graham, have previously embraced the view that the decision on how to restrict abortion should be left to the states following the June Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.\n\nIn California, which passed sweeping legal protections for both patients and providers who receive or offer abortion care after the June decision, Newsom is also advocating for and putting his financial weight behind a ballot measure that would amend the state constitution to guarantee the right to an abortion. In early September, the California Legislature also passed a package of about a dozen bills that would protect and expand access to abortion in the state.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/health/abortion-law-medications-methotrexate/index.html", "title": "Women with chronic conditions struggle to find medications after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNot 24 hours after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month, ending the right to an abortion in the United States, Myisha Malone-King got a call from her insurance company. It said that the medication she takes for a condition totally unrelated to abortion would no longer be available to her.\n\nMalone-King has Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can come with life-threatening complications. She was taking methotrexate, an inexpensive drug that has been used to help with chronic inflammation and pain since the 1980s.\n\nMillions of people take the drug for chronic conditions. Doctors prescribe it to help with things like cancer, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. But it can also be used off-label in very high doses to treat a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus, creating an unviable pregnancy that can be deadly for the pregnant person.\n\nMethotrexate is not used in what’s known as a medication abortion, which involves mifepristone (sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym, and is also known as RU 486) and misoprostol.\n\nBut in some states with restrictive abortion policies like Texas, the law classifies methotrexate as a drug that can induce abortion and groups it with the other two, meaning there can be restrictions on its use. However, Texas law also says that methotrexate can be prescribed for other purposes. And in that case, it is exempt from restrictions.\n\nRecent changes in abortion laws have sown confusion that has spooked insurance providers, pharmacies and medical offices into restricting the use of methotrexate, even in states where abortion is legal. It’s not clear how many people may be affected, but about 500,000 methotrexate prescriptions were written each month for the past year, said IQVIA, a pharmaceutical market research firm.\n\n‘Like a miracle drug’\n\nMyisha Malone-King Courtesy of Myisha Malone-King\n\nMalone-King lives in Maryland, which allows abortion up to the point of fetal viability. The decision to remove methotrexate from her care plan made absolutely no sense to her.\n\n“My feeling is, nobody should be making this decision over my body that my doctor and I have determined was right for me,” she said.\n\nMalone-King’s doctor was able to switch her to another medication. But she knows that not everyone is so lucky.\n\nMalone-King, a patient advocate who runs a chronic illness support group called Game of Crohn’s & Chronic Illness, worries about some of its members.\n\n“I really feel for the ones who really need this medication and it’s their only option and now they don’t have access all because of a law that has nothing to do with their situation,” she said.\n\nLike Malone-King, Becky Schwartz takes methotrexate for a chronic condition. She has lupus, a disease in which the person’s immune system attacks their own tissues and organs.\n\nNot six days after the US Supreme Court decision, Schwartz said, she got a letter from her doctor’s office that said it was pausing all prescriptions and refills of methotrexate. The form letter went on to explain that this decision was because of the Supreme Court decision on abortion.\n\nShe spoke to her rheumatologist, who told her that they would have to start weaning her off the drug, since her prescription would run out the first week of September.\n\n“Methotrexate has really been effective with helping me get my disease under control,” Schwartz said. “For me, it really is like a miracle drug.”\n\nSchwartz is dreading the medication change. Before she started methotrexate, flares would give her trouble walking, and it was so difficult to stand that she needed a shower chair to wash.\n\n“What if something causes me to get a flare again?” she asked. “For people who don’t have this, it’s hard to explain how such a change in my medicine could make such a drastic and terrible difference in my life.\n\n“I’m just going to have to decrease my activity until we can figure out what to do,” she added. “And for what?”\n\nBecky Schwarz Courtesy of Becky Schwarz\n\nSchwartz lives in Virginia, a state where abortion is legal, at least for now.\n\n“This feels like such an extreme reaction,” she said. “I feel like I’m being babysat by the government. I’m a grown adult. I am well aware of how to take my medication safely.”\n\nWhen doctors prescribe methotrexate, they typically have careful conversations with the patient about its potential side effects, including severe birth defects. Schwartz’s doctor recommended that she use birth control, which she said she does.\n\nAs soon as the Supreme Court decision came down, medical associations across the country told CNN that they anticipated some legal confusion and reduced access to some drugs. Several groups set up special task forces to guide members on best practices, particularly in states setting limits on abortion.\n\nThe Arthritis Foundation has also set up a helpline for people to report problems and a website to answer questions about methotrexate.\n\n‘My doctor and I should not be treated like criminals’\n\nAbortion is now banned in at least eight states, and many more bans are expected. Legal experts think half the states in the country will either outright ban abortion or restrict it significantly.\n\nFor Annie England Noblin, it wasn’t her doctor’s office that put a stop to her prescription for methotrexate. It was her pharmacy.\n\nEngland Noblin, a writer, lives in Missouri, where abortion is restricted except in case of emergency. She started taking methotrexate to help with her rheumatoid arthritis early this year.\n\nIt wasn’t until she went in to pick up a refill last week that the pharmacist told her that they needed a specific direction from the doctor that said the prescription was not for an abortion.\n\nThe extra step is not unusual in certain states with restrictive abortion laws. CVS told CNN that that is the chain’s policy now. Walgreens also said trigger laws in certain states require this extra step of verification. There are reports from some doctors, though, that some pharmacies are refusing to carry methotrexate at all.\n\nEngland Noblin’s local Walgreens carried the drug, but it had to take the additional step, she said.\n\n“It’s humiliating to be standing at a pharmacy counter and have the pharmacist look you in the eye and say she just needs to make sure you’re not using that drug to have an abortion,” she said.\n\n“My doctor and I should not be treated like criminals in the pharmacy line, and I shouldn’t be discriminated against because I have a body part that can produce a child.”\n\nEngland Noblin was so upset after the incident that she called Walgreens’ regional office. She said that when she asked whether the pharmacy would be having that same conversation with men, the answer was no.\n\n“I’m not angry at my pharmacist,” she said. “I’m angry at the policy. It just feels like they think I’m going to go home and pop 12 of them and have an abortion. Like that’s something women do.”\n\nWalgreens told CNN that it can’t address specific instances but that trigger laws in various states now require additional steps for dispensing certain prescriptions.\n\n“Our focus is meeting the needs of our patients and making sure they have access to the medications they need, in compliance with applicable pharmacy laws and regulations,” Fraser Engerman, senior director for external relations, wrote in an email.\n\nEngerman said the company provides ongoing training and information to help its pharmacists understand the latest requirements in their area. “With these supports, they are empowered to fill lawful, clinically appropriate prescriptions,” he said.\n\nIn clarifying guidance last week, the Biden administration said pharmacies couldn’t discriminate against customers with regard to supplying medications, making determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication, or advising them about medications and how they are supposed to take them.\n\nThe administration encouraged people to file complaints with the US Health and Human Services Department Office for Civil Rights if their prescription was rejected. England Noblin did so immediately.\n\n“It’s just so frustrating and just so wrong,” she said.\n\nSearching for clarity\n\nDr. Mehret Birru Talabi, a rheumatologist who also specializes in reproductive issues and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, has been hearing from a number of patients who are not able to get refills of medications that can cause abortion or birth defects, including methotrexate.\n\n“That’s really a travesty, because some of these patients have diseases that really are well-managed by these particular medications,” she said. “Just the idea that your reproductive health status might undermine your care and your treatment, even if you’re not pregnant – it’s really disheartening.”\n\nThe American Pharmacists Association said it is monitoring the situation with methotrexate closely, but it isn’t the only drug that has seen some restrictions. The group is also looking into issues related to access to misoprostol for things like gastric ulcer prevention, and there may be other medications that are included in the definition of “abortion-inducing drug.”\n\n“This comes back to the definitions of abortion-inducing drugs and state laws which sometimes are very detailed and very clear but sometimes are very vague and up to a lot of misunderstandings,” said Michael Murphy, adviser for state government affairs with the American Pharmacists Association.\n\nThe association has been observing how state pharmacy groups are handling the issue closely, as well. Kentucky’s association, for instance, said in guidance for its pharmacists July 1 that any prescription or medical order for a drug that is known to possibly cause abortion should be presumed by a pharmacy “to be for indications other than for the termination of a pregnancy. A pharmacy dispensing such prescription or medical order shall not be required to verify that the prescription or medical order does not violate any provision.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat kind of clarification helps pharmacists, Murphy said, but he knows that his members would like additional clarity from state policymakers so health care professionals can know how to navigate the complicated legal landscape after the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\n“For us as pharmacists, one of our biggest responsibilities is ensuring the safe and effective use of medications,” Murphy said. “And right now, with so much uncertainty around health care professionals’ legal liability, it’s really unfortunate how many patients are having access issues.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/us/abortion-access-restrictions-bans-us/index.html", "title": "See where abortions are banned and legal — and where it's still in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, nearly two dozen US states have banned or limited access to the procedure. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity.\n\nAll eyes are on Ohio this election cycle, as voters will be deciding whether to add an amendment protecting abortion rights in the state constitution. In a special election in August, Ohio voters rejected an initiative that would have made it harder to amend the state constitution — a critical victory for abortion rights advocates.\n\nThe fight over abortion is well underway in state legislatures. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced on Sept. 18 that it would resume abortion care services, after a judge ruled that a law from 1849 widely interpreted as an abortion ban did not apply to abortion procedures. The South Carolina Supreme Court in August reversed a temporary block on a “heartbeat bill” — which would ban abortion at the time when a fetus’ heartbeat can be detected, usually as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nThis year, health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced. In July, Iowa banned most abortions at about six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they are pregnant. A district judge, however, placed a temporary hold just a few days after it went into effect. Abortions remain legal in Iowa until 22 weeks. Also in July, a Wisconsin judge blocked a first-of-its-kind ban on abortion pills a week before it was intended to take effect in the state. Georgia’s six-week abortion ban was stopped last November by a state court, but days later, the state’s Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect while an appeal plays out.\n\nAs these legal challenges make their way through the courts, patients seeking access to the procedure must navigate a complicated patchwork of legislation, often requiring them to travel hundreds of miles.\n\nHere’s where abortion access currently stands in the United States.\n\nMore like this:", "authors": ["Annette Choi Devan Cole", "Annette Choi", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/health/30-year-old-embryos-twins/index.html", "title": "Parents welcome twins from embryos frozen 30 years ago | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn April 1992, Vanessa Williams’ “Save the Best for Last” topped the Billboard 100, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was running for the White House, “Who’s the Boss?” aired its final episode, and the babies born to Rachel and Philip Ridgeway a couple of weeks ago were frozen as embryos.\n\nBorn on October 31, Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from what may be the longest-frozen embryos to ever result in a live birth, according to the National Embryo Donation Center.\n\nThe previous known record holder was Molly Gibson, born in 2020 from an embryo that had been frozen for nearly 27 years. Molly took the record from her sister Emma, who was born from an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years.\n\nIt’s possible an older frozen embryo may have been used; although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks success rates and data around reproductive technologies, it does not track how long embryos have been frozen. But there’s no evidence of an older embryo resulting in a live birth.\n\n“There is something mind-boggling about it,” Philip Ridgeway said as he and his wife cradled their newborns in their laps at their home outside Portland, Oregon. “I was 5 years old when God gave life to Lydia and Timothy, and he’s been preserving that life ever since.”\n\n“In a sense, they’re our oldest children, even though they’re our smallest children,” Ridgeway added. The Ridgeways have four other children, ages 8, 6, 3 and almost 2, none conceived via IVF or donors.\n\nThe embryos were created for an anonymous married couple using in-vitro fertilization. The husband was in his early 50s, and they used a 34-year-old egg donor.\n\nThe embryos were frozen on April 22, 1992.\n\nFor nearly three decades, they sat in storage on tiny straws kept in liquid nitrogen at nearly 200 degrees below zero, in a device that looks much like a propane tank.\n\nThe embryos were kept at a fertility lab on the West Coast until 2007, when the couple who created them donated the embryos to the National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, in hopes another couple might be able to use them. The five embryos were overnighted in specially outfitted tanks to Knoxville, said Dr. John Gordon, the Ridgeways’ doctor.\n\n“We’ve never had in our minds a set number of children we’d like to have,” Philip said. “We’ve always thought we’ll have as many as God wants to give us, and … when we heard about embryo adoption, we thought that’s something we would like to do.”\n\nUnderstanding embryo donation\n\nThe medical name for the process the Ridgeways went through is embryo donation.\n\nWhen people undergo IVF, they may produce more embryos than they use. Extra embryos can be cryopreserved for future use, donated to research or training to advance the science of reproductive medicine, or donated to people who would like to have children.\n\nAs with any other human tissue donation, embryos must meet certain US Food and Drug Administration eligibility guidelines to be donated, including being screened for certain infectious diseases.\n\n“Embryo adoption is not a legal ‘adoption’ at all, at least in the sense of a traditional adoption which occurs after birth,” the National Embryo Donation Center says. “However, the term allows all parties to conceptualize the process and eventual reality of raising a non-genetically related child.”\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine says, “Application of the term ‘adoption’ to embryos is inaccurate, is misleading, and could place burdens upon recipients and should be avoided.”\n\nMany colloquially call the donor process “embryo adoption,” but adoption and donation are not one and the same, said Dr. Sigal Klipstein, a Chicago-based fertility specialist and chair of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine’s ethics committee.\n\n“Adoption refers to living children,” Klipstein said. “It’s a legal process by which a parent-child relationship is created when it did not previously exist.”\n\nEmbryo donation, she said, is a medical procedure. “It’s a way by which we take embryos from one couple or individual and then transfer them into another individual in order to build families.”\n\nThe phrase “adoption” has become wrapped up in a larger cultural debate, used predominantly by those in faith-based communities with conservative leanings. The National Embryo Donation Center is a private, Christian-led organization. It requires recipients to pass a “family assessment” and says “couples must be a genetic male and a genetic female married for a minimum of 3 years.” The center says it has helped with the births of over 1,260 infants from donated embryos.\n\nKlipstein says that using donated embryos can often be cost-effective for people looking for fertility help, as it cuts out the price of looking for and storing donor sperm and eggs. “They don’t get the genetic connection to the children,” she said, “but they do have a much less expensive reproductive option than even with in-vitro fertilization in most cases.”\n\n‘We just wanted the ones that had been waiting the longest’\n\nFor the Ridgeways, building their family was always part of a larger calling.\n\n“We weren’t looking to get the embryos that have been frozen the longest in the world,” Philip Ridgeway said. “We just wanted the ones that had been waiting the longest.”\n\nWhen looking for donors, the Ridgeways specifically asked the donation center about a category called “special consideration,” meaning it had been hard to find recipients for these embryos, for whatever reason.\n\n“Going into this, we knew that we could trust God to do whatever he had sovereignly planned and that their age really had no factor. It was just a matter of whether or not that was in God’s plans,” Rachel Ridgeway said.\n\nTo pick their embryos, they went through a donor database. It did not list the how long embryos have been frozen, but it listed the donors’ characteristics like ethnicity, age, height, weight, genetic and health history, education, occupation, favorite movies and music. With some files, there are photos of the parents and of their children if they have them.\n\nThe Ridgeways assumed those listed with earlier donor numbers had been at the center the longest and tried to narrow their choice to those profiles.\n\nRisks of multiples\n\nSoutheastern Fertility, which partners with National Embryo Donation Center, thawed the embryos February 28. Of the five that were thawed, two were not viable. There’s about an 80% survival rate when thawing frozen embryos, experts say.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the CDC both recommend transferring one embryo at a time, as transferring more raises the likelihood for multiples, which also potentially increases risk for both mother and child. Twin babies are more likely to be born early, develop cerebral palsy, have autism and result in stillbirth.\n\nRachel remembers Gordon handing her a picture of the three embryos and recommending they transfer only two, telling her, “multiples can cause problems in pregnancy.” But she said there was no question in her mind that they would transfer all three.\n\nShe remembers getting teary-eyed and saying, “You just showed me a picture of my three children. I have to have them all.”\n\nPhilip and Rachel Ridgeway had twins born from embryos that were frozen for about 30 years. Courtesy Philip and Rachel Ridgeway\n\nThe remaining three embryos were transferred into Rachel on March 2, 29 years and 10 months after they were frozen. Two of the transfers were successful. Studies have found that 25% to 40% of frozen embryo transfers result in a live birth.\n\nLike ‘Rip Van Winkle’\n\nEmbryos can be frozen pretty much indefinitely, experts said.\n\n“If you’re frozen at nearly 200 degrees below zero, I mean, the biological processes essentially slow down to almost nothing. And so perhaps the difference between being frozen for a week, a month, a year, a decade, two decades, it doesn’t really matter,” Gordon said.\n\nDr. Jim Toner, a fertility specialist in Atlanta, likens it to an old story: “It doesn’t seem like a sperm or an egg or embryo stored in liquid nitrogen ever experiences time. It’s like that Rip Van Winkle thing. It just wakes up 30 years later, and it never knew it was asleep.”\n\nThe age of the embryo shouldn’t affect the health of the child.

Wade in June. The law bans abortions performed after early cardiac activity is detected – typically around six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant – except in medical emergencies.\n\nWith the judge’s ruling, abortion is again available up to 20 weeks post-fertilization (or about 22 weeks after a patient’s last menstrual period). The temporary restraining order is in place for the next 14 days, and the plaintiffs have requested a preliminary injunction while the case plays out.\n\n“S.B. 23 clearly discriminates against pregnant women and places an enormous burden on them to secure safe and effective health care such that it violates Ohio’s Equal Protection and Benefit Clause and is therefore unconstitutional,” Judge Christian A. Jenkins wrote in his order.\n\nOn September 2, Ohio abortion providers filed a new challenge against SB 23 in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, arguing that the law violates the state constitution. The groups said they withdrew their initial challenge to the law that was before the state Supreme Court, which denied their request for an emergency hold.\n\n“We’re grateful that, for now, Ohioans can once again widely access abortion care in their own state. But this is just the first step. We have already seen the devastating impact Senate Bill 23 has had on people seeking abortions in Ohio,” plaintiffs and litigators said in a joint statement.\n\nThe state’s abortion laws have come under particular scrutiny in recent months following a highly publicized case involving a 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio who traveled to Indiana to obtain an abortion.\n\nPreterm-Cleveland, an abortion clinic and one of the plaintiffs in the case, said Wednesday it would resume providing abortions for as long it possibly could.\n\nOhio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis said in a statement that “by forum shopping, abortion activists temporarily got what they wanted.”\n\n“We are more than confident that the heartbeat law will go back into effect relatively soon,” he said. “Further, we can assure pro-life Ohio that in the near future Ohio will become abortion free, regardless of what this local judge ruled today.”\n\nLaws that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the US Supreme Court ended a constitutional right to abortion. In several of these states, abortion rights advocates and providers have taken legal action to challenge abortion restrictions and have seen some success in temporarily blocking bans.\n\nIn neighboring West Virginia this week, lawmakers passed a bill that will prohibit nearly all abortions except to save a pregnant person’s life or in certain cases that involve rape or incest, sending the measure to the state’s Republican governor for his approval.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}]}

TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter called such bans of the social media app \"little more than political theater.\"\n\nScreen time is skyrocketing among young people\n\nTikTok's screen limit changes come as experts around the world stress concerns over the rising time that young people spend on screens, particularly on platforms like TikTok and other social media apps, with studies pointing to impacts on both physical and mental health.\n\nKids and screen time:How parents can manage during prolonged pandemic\n\nA study from Common Sense media, a nonprofit research organization, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth in screen time – with media use among tweens (defined in the study as kids age 8 to 12) and teens rising 17% from 2019 to 2021.\n\nIn 2021, tweens used an average of five hours and 33 minutes of screen media each day and teens had an average of eight hours and 39 minutes, the study said.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Common Sense Media founder and CEO James P. Steyer said TikTok's \"new features, particularly the screen time limits, are definitely a positive step to create a safer space for teens and families, but TikTok also needs to go further.\"\n\n\"TikTok continues to capture users' personal data and often nudges teens toward harmful content that can expose them to drugs, eating disorders, violence and more,\" Steyer continued. \"The nation's youth mental health crisis is rampant, and all social media companies need to make teens' well-being a priority, not merely an afterthought.\"\n\nScreen controls for parents, caregivers\n\nIn addition to the default screen time limit, Keenan said that TikTok will send every teen account a weekly recap of their screen time.\n\nTikTok is also introducing several new features to \"Family Pairing,\" which allows parents, caregivers and their children to customize safety settings.\n\nAmong the new features, caregivers will be able to set daily screen time limits for their teens – including scheduling different time limits for certain days of the week – mute notifications for certain times of the day and use a screen time dashboard to see how much their teens are using the app.\n\nExperts note that the needs of each family and individual are different.

These accounts briefly paused on and liked content about body image and mental health. The CCDH said the app recommended videos about body image and mental health about every 39 seconds within a 30-minute period.\n\nThe report comes as state and federal lawmakers seek ways to crack down on TikTok over privacy and security concerns, as well as determining whether the app is appropriate for teens. It also comes more than a year after executives from social media platforms, TikTok included, faced tough questions from lawmakers during a series of congressional hearings over how their platforms can direct younger users – particularly teenage girls – to harmful content, damaging their mental health and body image.\n\nAfter those hearings, which followed disclosures from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, the companies vowed to change. But the latest findings from the CCDH suggest more work may still need to be done.\n\n“The results are every parent’s nightmare: young people’s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, said in the report.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson pushed back on the study, saying it is an inaccurate depiction of the viewing experience on the platform for varying reasons, including the small sample size, the limited 30-minute window for testing, and the way the accounts scrolled past a series of unrelated topics to look for other content.\n\n“This activity and resulting experience does not reflect genuine behavior or viewing experiences of real people,” the TikTok spokesperson told CNN. “We regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies, and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need. We’re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the CCDH does not distinguish between positive and negative videos on given topics, adding that people often share empowering stories about eating disorder recovery.\n\nTikTok said it continues to roll out new safeguards for its users, including ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. In July, it added a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes as well as a feature to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikTok videos, set regular screen time breaks, and provide a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app. TikTok also offers a handful of parental controls.\n\nThis isn’t the first time social media algorithms have been tested. In October 2021, US Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s staff registered an Instagram account as a 13-year-old girl and proceeded to follow some dieting and pro-eating disorder accounts (the latter of which are supposed to be banned by Instagram). Instagram’s algorithm soon began almost exclusively recommending the young teenage account should follow more and more extreme dieting accounts, the senator told CNN at the time.\n\n(After CNN sent a sample from this list of five accounts to Instagram for comment, the company removed them, saying they all broke Instagram’s policies against encouraging eating disorders.)\n\nTikTok said it does not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide or self-harm. Of the videos removed for violating its policies on suicide and self-harm content from April to June of this year, 93.4% were removed at zero views, 91.5% were removed within 24 hours of being posted and 97.1% were removed before any reports, according to the company.\n\nThe spokesperson told CNN when someone searches for banned words or phrases such as #selfharm, they will not see any results and will instead be redirected to local support resources.\n\nStill, the CCDH says more needs to be done to restrict specific content on TikTok and bolster protections for young users.\n\n“This report underscores the urgent need for reform of online spaces,” said the CCDH’s Ahmed. “Without oversight, TikTok’s opaque platform will continue to profit by serving its users – children as young as 13, remember – increasingly intense and distressing content without checks, resources or support.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/09/11/disney-world-remove-legal-drinking-age-requirement-florida-debunked/70822543007/", "title": "Did Disney World remove its legal drinking age? Nope, just more ...", "text": "A rumor about Disney World “officially removing drinking age” requirements is making the rounds again after MouseTrapNews.com, a satire website that writes fake news stories about Disney parks, published a story recycling the same claim it made in a TikTok video last August.\n\nSnopes, a popular fact-checking website, debunked the previous claim, stating it was “nothing more than a story created for fun on a satire blog.”\n\nThe new story refers back to the original, claiming that Disney’s previous attempt to lower the drinking age on the property was challenged by the state, which wanted the company to create a “system that would ensure anyone from 18-21 who has been drinking does not get behind the wheel and operate a car.”\n\nIs Disney Genie+ worth it?What to know now that prices vary by park\n\nThe TikTok video associated with the new claim has already managed to rack up more than 7.3 million views since it was posted on Sept. 9.\n\nThe truth, much like the last time, is that Disney World is still allowed to sale alcohol to adults 21 years old or older.\n\nWhat is Disney World’s alcohol policy?\n\nDisney World’s alcohol policy is fairly typical. Alcoholic beverages can be purchased at Walt Disney World by all guests 21 years old or older, and buyers must present a valid form of identification at the time of purchase.\n\nAll guests visiting from outside of the U.S. are required to present both a valid passport as well as another form of government-issued photo ID from their country of origin.\n\nCan you walk around Disney World with alcohol?\n\nDisney World guests are allowed to walk around parks where the alcohol was purchased, but they’re not allowed to leave the parks with alcohol and it can't be taken with them on rides.\n\nWhen can you buy alcohol in Florida?\n\nFlorida is not a dry state, so alcohol is usually sold at all times, but rules will vary by county. Be sure to check with the local government resources for specific information.\n\nIn Florida, alcohol can generally be purchased for off and on-premise consumption between 7 a.m. and midnight. Many counties permit alcohol sales until 3 a.m. and some retailers operate for 24 hours every day.\n\nWhen can you buy alcohol on Sundays in Florida?\n\nFlorida has no restrictions on alcohol sales on Sundays, but many counties — even wet ones — limit sales hours on Sunday.\n\nFloridians can purchase alcohol on Sunday from 7 a.m. to midnight, but some counties restrict those hours from noon to midnight.\n\nLiberty and Lafayette counties are Florida's only dry counties where alcohol sales are prohibited on Sundays.\n\nIs Disney moving to Georgia?DeSantis v. Disney feud sparks online rumors\n\nCan passengers drink in vehicles in Florida?\n\nNope. Florida has strict open container rules, and it is unlawful to possess an open container of an alcoholic beverage or consume alcohol while driving or while a passenger in a motor vehicle – even if you're sitting in your car while parked.\n\nOpen containers can only lawfully be transported via a locked glove compartment or in the trunk of a car.\n\nThere are two exceptions: If you’re a passenger in a commercial vehicle or if you’re in a self-contained motor home longer than 21 feet. In the case of commercial vehicles, consumption of alcohol will depend on company policy. Ride sharing services like Uber and Lyft do not permit open containers of alcohol into their vehicles.\n\nCan you drink at 18 with your parents in Florida?\n\nBelieve it or not, the idea of Disney World getting some sort of “special permission” to skirt around the federal law setting the minimum legal drinking age isn’t that far-fetched. There are laws in 45 states that allow underage drinking in certain situations.\n\nFlorida has very strict drinking laws and prohibits possession of alcoholic beverages by anyone under 21 years old in virtually every circumstance.\n\nThe only exception applies to students between the age of 18-20 whose required curriculum at a postsecondary educational institution includes tasting alcoholic beverages for instructional purposes during classes.\n\nWhat states allow minors to drink with their parents’ permission?\n\nThere are 31 states that allow family members to furnish a minor with alcohol:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/956837/tik-tots-the-rules-for-children-on-social-media", "title": "Tik-tots: the rules for children on social media | The Week", "text": "Young heavy users of social media are more likely to experience low life satisfaction and unhappiness with their appearance, school and family than their less online-dependent peers.\n\nA report conducted by The Children’s Society last year found that 7% of 10- to 15-year-olds in the UK – or roughly 306,000 young people – feel unhappy with their lives, with social media thought to be a contributing factor. “Social media gives people a platform to be mean,” 16-year-old Yara told the charity. “They can be so cruel.”\n\nBut despite the correlation between social media and mental ill health, more children than ever are signing up to create their own online accounts. The communications regulator Ofcom’s Children and parents: media use and attitudes report for 2020/21 found that 87% of 12- to 15-year-olds use social media sites or apps and 42% of those aged between 5 and 12.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nWhat are the age limits?\n\nThe fact that almost half of 5- to 12-year-olds are using social media sites or apps is significant because the minimum age requirement for most social media platforms is 13.\n\nInstagram, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat and Facebook all require users to be at least 13 before creating an account with them. WhatsApp users in the European Economic Area must be at least 16 to register for an account. And YouTube states that you must be at least 13 to use its service, however “children of all ages may use the service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian”.\n\nWhen Ofcom’s researchers asked parents of children aged 5 to 15 whether they were aware of these minimum age requirements, almost 90% said they were. But less than four in ten of them could accurately state what the age requirement actually was.\n\nThree in ten parents of children under 13 surveyed by Ofcom “said they would allow their child to use social media despite the age requirement”.\n\nAre these age limits effective?\n\nEven though TikTok enforces a minimum age requirement, another report by Ofcom, which was published earlier this year, found that about 16% of three- and four-year-olds have been viewing content on the video-sharing platform, The Guardian reported. It described this trend as the “rise of the TikTots” – in other words, “children defying age restrictions to use social platforms”.\n\nOne 12-year-old female respondent told Ofcom that “for TikTok and Snapchat I think I put in a fake birthday because I was allowed to have it”.\n\nIn response to Ofcom’s 2022 report, a TikTok spokesperson said: “TikTok is strictly a 13-plus platform and we have processes in place to enforce our minimum age requirements, both at the point of sign up and through the continuous proactive removal of suspected underage accounts from the platform”.\n\nThe report also exposed the problem of “Finstas” – fake Instagram accounts used by young people to hide aspects of their online lives from their parents. Ofcom’s researchers believe that as many as two-thirds of eight- to 11-year-olds have multiple Instagram accounts, while almost 50% have an account just for their family to see.\n\nWhat are platforms doing to protect children?\n\nLast year, TikTok was praised by the NSPCC for limiting the direct messaging abilities of accounts belonging to users who are aged 16 and 17, and proactively asking users under 16 to decide whether they want their videos to be visible to their followers, their friends or just themselves.\n\nThe platform also announced that it would no longer send push notifications after 9pm to users aged between 13 and 15, and after 10pm for 16- and 17-year-olds. “We want to help our younger teens in particular develop positive digital habits early on,” said a TikTok spokesperson.\n\nAlso in 2021, Meta (then known as Facebook) announced what The Guardian described as “sweeping changes” to Instagram, which included giving under 16-year-olds private accounts by default, “ensuring that kids only share content publicly if they actively dive into settings and change their privacy preferences accordingly”.\n\nYouTube then announced a “surprisingly similar” set of changes which updated the default privacy settings for users under 18.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Justin Klawans", "Theara Coleman", "Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/tech/tiktok-states/index.html", "title": "Why a growing number of states are cracking down on TikTok | CNN ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTwo years after TikTok avoided a national ban in the United States, the popular short-form video app is now facing growing pushback at the state level.\n\nIn the past two weeks, at least seven states have said they will bar public employees from using the app on government devices, including Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Texas. (Another state, Nebraska, banned TikTok from state devices in 2020.) Last week, the state of Indiana announced two lawsuits against TikTok accusing the Chinese-owned platform of misrepresenting its approach to age-appropriate content and data security.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of 15 attorneys general wrote to Apple and Google calling on the app store owners to stop listing TikTok as being appropriate for teens, over claims about the prevalence of mature content on the app.\n\nThe mounting pressure on TikTok has come from states led by Republican governors who have highlighted fears that TikTok users’ personal information could wind up in the hands of the Chinese government, thanks to that country’s national security laws.\n\n“South Dakota will have no part in the intelligence gathering operations of nations who hate us,” said Gov. Kristi Noem in announcing the new state policy.\n\nThe flurry of announcements has drawn sharp contrasts with activity at the federal level. Since 2020, when the Trump administration threatened a ban over national security concerns, TikTok and the US government have been negotiating a deal that may allow the short-form video app to keep serving US users.\n\nThere have been years of closed-door negotiations between TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an opaque multi-agency panel charged with reviewing foreign investment deals for national security risks. One US official has suggested that CFIUS ban TikTok from the United States outright.\n\nWhatever outcome the negotiations produce is still expected to have big implications for TikTok and its users. But the federal government’s continued inaction on that front, as well as recent reports of delays in the negotiations, has left the door open for states to step in as the app has gained immense popularity among US users.\n\nIn taking these steps, the states are unlikely to disrupt how everyday users access the app. But these recent announcements could nonetheless add to political pressure for tougher action at the federal level, which could in turn be more disruptive to users.\n\n“It feels like the states are stepping into the DC vacuum on TikTok,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the investment research firm Cowen Inc. “I don’t see those new restrictions disrupting TikTok that much, but it probably adds a bit of pressure for Washington to ‘do something’ on TikTok one way or another.”\n\nThe Treasury Department, CFIUS’s chair agency, said in a statement that the panel is “committed to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard US national security” and declined to comment on TikTok specifically. The White House also declined to comment.\n\n“We’re disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods about TikTok,” Hilary McQuaide, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in a statement provided to CNN. “It’s unfortunate that the many state agencies, offices, and universities on TikTok in those states will no longer be able to use it to build communities and connect with constituents.”\n\nA long wait for federal action\n\nUS lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok — or its parent, ByteDance — to hand over the personal data of its US users. Security experts have said that the data could allow China to identify intelligence opportunities or to seek to influence US users through disinformation campaigns.\n\nTikTok has said it is working with the US government to address all reasonable national security concerns. It has also taken independent steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business. Last week, amid the pushback from the states, the company said it would restructure its US-focused content moderation, policy and legal teams under US Data Security, a special group within the company that’s led by US-based officials and walled off organizationally from other teams focused on the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the change, content policies TikTok develops for its global audience must be “reviewed and approved” for US audiences by TikTok’s US Data Security group, to ensure the policies meet the standards of any deal approved by CFIUS, the company said. Content moderation involving US users’ data, TikTok said, will be handled by a US-specific trust and safety team within the US Digital Security group, and not by its global trust and safety team.\n\nTikTok has previously acknowledged that employees based in China can currently access user data, and has also declined to commit to stop sending US user information to China.\n\nHarry Broadman, who leads the CFIUS practice at Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm, said he isn’t privy to the details of the negotiation between TikTok and the US government but called the continued lack of resolution “a mystery.”\n\n“I’m a little bit mystified why it’s taking so long for CFIUS to deal with this problem,” he said. “There must be some issue that’s going on.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a bipartisan pair of congressmen in the House, introduced new legislation that aims to ban TikTok from operating in the United States. In a statement, Rubio expressed frustration with the lack of action at the federal level.\n\n“The federal government has yet to take a single meaningful action to protect American users from the threat of TikTok,” Rubio said. “There is no more time to waste on meaningless negotiations with a CCP-puppet company. It is time to ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good.”\n\nAn opening for Republican governors\n\nWith no deal yet between CFIUS and TikTok, the states led by Republican officials appear to have capitalized on the moment from a “tactical, political, winning-points perspective,” Broadman said.\n\n“I don’t think it reflects a deeper suspicion on the part of the Republicans versus Democrats,” he said. “I think it’s more of a tactical question.”\n\nSince government agencies have clear authority to manage their own devices in ways they see fit, barring public employees from using the app represents low-hanging fruit (and easy headlines), Broadman said.\n\nIn some ways, the states that have restricted TikTok are following the federal government’s lead. Already, the US military, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security have prohibited their own employees from using TikTok.\n\nStates such as Maryland also enacted their TikTok bans on government devices as part of a wider crackdown on Chinese-linked products and services, making the announcement more about China than about TikTok individually. Maryland’s directive also applies to Huawei and ZTE, which the US government has also taken steps to block from US markets.\n\nAt least one state is going even further. Last week, Indiana sued TikTok in two separate cases. One claimed that TikTok lures children onto the platform by falsely claiming it is appropriate for users between 13 and 17 years old; the other claims TikTok has “deceived” consumers about whether user data is sufficiently protected from Chinese government access. TikTok has declined to comment on the litigation but has said “the safety, privacy and security of our community is our top priority.”\n\nSome states could also choose to begin advancing meaningful legislation that effectively limits TikTok on private devices, Broadman said, in a move that would more directly impact TikTok’s American user base. But such a move would likely introduce other issues about the regulation of commerce, and potentially result in legal challenges.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/08/06/tiktok-any-worse-privacy-and-data-mining-than-facebook/3311726001/", "title": "TikTok and privacy: What's the problem?

However, if you want to create a video and share it, or comment on someone's video, then you must fork over your personal information, starting with age, phone number and e-mail address.\n\nFrom there, TikTok freely admits – in the privacy policy on its website – it collects information shared from third-party social network providers, and technical (your location) and behavioral information (what videos you think are funny, how often you watch) \"about your use of the Platform.

How are the privacy laws there?\"\n\nMight there be a ban on all apps from China? Besides TikTok, which has reaped over 800 million downloads and currently is the no. 5 most downloaded app on Apptopia's charts, WeChat, a WhatsApp like communication program, and QQ, which is also used for direct messages, are both owned by China's Tencent.\n\nIn a speech this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said all \"untrusted\" Chinese apps should be removed from U.S. app stores. “With parent companies based in China, apps like TikTok, WeChat and others are significant threats to the personal data of American citizens,” not to mention tools for content censorship, Pompeo said.\n\nThe information collected by TikTok is similar to what's gathered by Facebook, but security researcher Patrick Jackson, the chief technology officer of security app Disconnect, says Facebook does more ill things with it, simply because it's so much bigger. Facebook boasts of over 2 billion users.\n\n\"The sheer volume of what's collected can't be compared,\" he says. \"What's bigger than using your data to influence an election, which Facebook did in 2016,\" with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he asks. That's when users data was tapped by Cambridge for political advertising.\n\n(This week Facebook introduced a TikTok clone for its Instagram app called Reels.)\n\nIn an April 2020 blog post, Tik Tok said it was doing everything it could to keep the U.S. data out of Chinese hands. \"Our goal is to minimize data access across regions so that, for example, employees in the APAC region, including China, would have very minimal access to user data from the EU and US.\"\n\nBut there's a different between \"minimal\" and \"none.\"\n\nJackson suggests that parents counsel their kids that if they are to use TikTok, only use it to watch videos, so less data can be compiled on them. Additionally, users can opt to have their account be listed as \"private,\" and only select certain friends to gain viewing access.\n\nAnd North says that if the Microsoft deal goes through, she'll be happy to let her kids download the app.\n\n\"They own it, they have the data on U.S. servers and follow U.S. laws, and I'm fine with it,\" she says.\n\nMicrosoft has long been a company that focused on business, with Office 365 software and cloud computing. Online it owns LinkedIn, which fits in with its work-centric mantra, and Skype, which Microsoft tried to transition into more of a business communication device. \"Where they need help is with the next generation, young people,\" says North. \"This could get them there.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/20/politicians-wage-war-on-tiktok-could-cost-them-young-voters/71572209007/", "title": "A TikTok ban? These young voters say politicians are 'out of touch'", "text": "“It was brutal,” Rep. Jeff Jackson, D-N.C., told his viewers in a March TikTok video, posted days after a heated congressional hearing over the popular social media platform.\n\nIn a rare bipartisan pile-on, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle had grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew for more than four hours over fears that the popular app is a national security threat. TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and leaders from across the political spectrum have expressed concerns the app could be used to spy on its 73 million American users, and to spread misinformation.\n\nJust last week, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley renewed her call for a TikTok ban after videos appeared on the site extolling 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden, while a rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Vivek Ramaswamy, had earlier criticized Haley’s daughter for using the app.\n\nBut in their zeal to take down TikTok, Haley and a political class dominated by Baby Boomers and Generation X risk turning off younger voters, who told USA TODAY the attacks are ill-informed and unfair.\n\nAveline Clark, a second-year student at the University of Akron, said she finds the arguments against TikTok “laughable,” as well as “xenophobic and hypocritical.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“American companies like Google and Meta are also stealing our data,” Clark, 20, told USA TODAY. “And the government isn’t doing anything about that. We’re not banning Google, we’re not banning Meta. But for some reason, we want to ban TikTok.”\n\nEarlier this year, regulators in Ireland fined Meta $1.3 billion over data privacy breaches, and levied $370 million in penalties on TikTok. Google has also agreed to pay $23 million to users as part of a legal settlement in a case centered around online privacy. Meta has additionally faced billions of dollars in fines from regulators around the world over privacy concerns.\n\nBoth platforms have vowed to transparently use user data and been critical of some legal efforts and other allegations against them.\n\nAbout 40% of TikTok’s users are between the ages of 18 and 24, according to the social media management platform Hootsuite. And about a quarter of adults ages 18 to 29 said they regularly get their news from TikTok, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\n\nPoliticians’ threats to ban TikTok, Clark said, may spell trouble for them with this younger audience and electorate.\n\n“It really does not help their image at all. And politicians, in general, do not need another issue to make them seem more inauthentic,” she said.\n\n'They don't understand it': TikTok divides generations in politics\n\nKeely Calloway, a freshman at George Mason University in Virginia, uses TikTok every day. She said politicians’ efforts to ban the app are part of a growing generational gap.\n\n“They’re just going against TikTok mainly because they don’t understand it,” Calloway, 18, said.\n\nCalloway pointed to the March hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nLawmakers “basically were just asking gibberish,” she said.\n\n“When you have 75-year-old politicians asking, ‘Does TikTok connect to my Wi-Fi network?’ people are not really going to take those politicians seriously,” Calloway added, referring to an eyebrow-raising question by 52-year-old Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C.\n\nJackson, who has more than 2 million TikTok followers, said in a post after the hearing that, \"Some of the questions were good and some definitely were not,” noting that “the majority of complaints that were raised apply to practically all social media platforms.”\n\nElected officials are not the only ones raising the alarm about TikTok. Presidential candidates have pitched the idea of restrictions or a national ban, including Republican hopefuls during the third and most recent GOP debate.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vowed to ban the app in his first week as president. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he believes the app is “polluting the minds” of young users.\n\n'Just scum':Nikki Haley's daughter becomes a flashpoint as GOP candidates spar over TikTok\n\nPresident Joe Biden, seeking reelection next year, has threatened to ban the app if TikTok’s Chinese owners do not sell their stake in the social media giant.\n\nRather than looking strong on national defense, though, Clark said candidates’ efforts to banish TikTok just make them appear “out of touch” with young voters.\n\n“Complaining about social media and complaining about TikTok just kind of lends to that image of (an) old man who doesn’t understand anything,” she said. “It does not help their chances. It does not help their public opinion.”\n\nYoung voters recognize TikTok concerns, oppose an outright ban\n\nCristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of the youth voter organization NextGen America, said TikTok is one of the most effective platforms for members of Generation Z and Millennials to engage with each other and current events.\n\n“TikTok serves as a huge platform where young people receive and consume their news and information and helps shape a lot of their viewpoints about what’s happening in the world,” she told USA TODAY.\n\nThat reach can also make it “the wild, wild west,” Tzintzún Ramirez said, warranting skepticism and regulation.\n\n“The truth is, it’s a double-edged sword. Yes, it’s a great way to reach and engage young people,” Tzintzún Ramirez said. “A lot of young people also receive a lot of misinformation and disinformation on the platform.”\n\nYoung voters told USA TODAY that they understand concerns about TikTok, including data privacy issues, and that they could support some regulatory measures.\n\n“Congress has the power to curb, to restrict, to do a lot of preventative measures,” said Jeremiah LaPorte, a high school senior and youth activist in New Jersey. “Saying that there’s no way to take preventative measures, and the only thing to do is to take it away in total – I just think that’s a little extra.”\n\nCalloway said young people like herself are more concerned about losing the app than potential security risks.\n\n“Most of what it seems like right now is just another Red Scare situation, where there’s nothing super scary that you should really be afraid of, but they just try to find something to make you be afraid of – for some reason – to ban this thing,” Calloway said.\n\nInstead of restrictions, Clark said she would like to see better education on Internet safety and moderation. And, she said, the measures should apply across social media platforms.\n\n“Young people understand,” Clark said.\n\nWhen using social media, she said, “you are probably going to have data stolen from you without your knowledge. And it’s something that a lot of young people just kind of accept. And not that I think that we should continue to accept it … But young people can see through the facade of politicians trying to single out TikTok as the single evil Communist data stealer.”\n\nTikTok can also be a tool for politicians reaching young voters\n\nYoung voters are also paying attention to the politicians that engage with them on TikTok, LaPorte, 17, said.\n\n“You can tell who is hearing the message of connecting to the young voters and who is not,” he said, adding that it’s something other young people “should definitely take note of when deciding who we want to represent us, and who’s making our policy.”\n\nClark said she thinks Jackson, the North Carolina congressman, is successful because of his “authentic” approach.\n\nCalloway likewise said Jackson has struck a chord with people her age by making them feel more included in government.\n\n“A lot of people on TikTok trust him because of the fact that he’s so open and so transparent. And I noticed a lot of youth really look up to him,” Calloway said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/tech/indiana-tiktok-lawsuits/index.html", "title": "Indiana Attorney General files lawsuits against TikTok | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita on Wednesday announced he has filed two separate lawsuits against TikTok, which accuse the company of making false claims about the safety of user data, and age-appropriate content.\n\n“The TikTok app is a malicious and menacing threat unleashed on unsuspecting Indiana consumers by a Chinese company that knows full well the harms it inflicts on users,” Rokita said in a statement. “With this pair of lawsuits, we hope to force TikTok to stop its false, deceptive, and misleading practices, which violate Indiana law.”\n\nThe lawsuits mark the most serious action taken yet by a state against TikTok, amid increasing attention to and concern about TikTok from state and federal officials in recent months. Also on Tuesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered state agencies to ban TikTok use on government-issued devices, citing the threat of “gaining access to critical U.S. information and infrastructure,” following the lead of several other states, including South Dakota and Maryland.\n\nTikTok does not comment on pending litigation, but said, “the safety, privacy and security of our community is our top priority,” according to a statement from a company spokesperson.\n\n“We build youth well-being into our policies, limit features by age, empower parents with tools and resources, and continue to invest in new ways to enjoy content based on age-appropriateness or family comfort,” the spokesperson said. “We are also confident that we’re on a path in our negotiations with the U.S. Government to fully satisfy all reasonable U.S. national security concerns, and we have already made significant strides toward implementing those solutions.”\n\nThe first lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday, alleges that TikTok lures children onto the platform by falsely claiming it is friendly for users between 13 to 17 years old.\n\nAmerican teens spend an average of 99 minutes per day on the app, the lawsuit claims, and in that time they’re exposed to content that can contain drug and alcohol use, nudity and intense profanity.\n\nThe suit claims this exposure can negatively influence the behaviors of minors.\n\nA second lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, alleges that TikTok has “reams” of highly sensitive data and personal information about consumers in Indiana and that the company “has deceived those consumers to believe that this information is protected from the Chinese government and Communist Party,” the media release said.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that TikTok’s European privacy policy has been updated “to clearly state that it permits individuals outside of Europe, including China, to access European user data,” while the company has “made no such update to its U.S privacy policy, which applies to Indiana consumers, explicitly informing them that their data is accessed by individuals and entities in China.”\n\nIn both suits, monetary civil penalties against TikTok, along with injunctive relief are being sought.\n\nTikTok has for years grappled with bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests, thanks to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests. And there has been renewed criticism of TikTok this year, stemming from a Buzzfeed News report in June that said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China. The reporting cited leaked audio recordings of dozens of internal TikTok meetings, including one where a TikTok employee allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.”\n\nIn a response to the report, TikTok previously said it “has consistently maintained that our engineers in locations outside of the US, including China, can be granted access to US user data on an as-needed basis under those strict controls.” The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multi-agency government body charged with reviewing business deals involving foreign ownership, has spent months negotiating with TikTok on a proposal to resolve concerns that Chinese government authorities could seek to gain access to the data TikTok holds on US citizens.\n\nA TikTok executive testified before a Senate panel earlier this year that it doesn’t share information with the Chinese government and that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China, but stopped short of committing to cut off flows of US user data to China.\n\nThe popular video-based app has also faced questions about the safety of young users after rocketing to popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, TikTok’s Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman joined executives from Snap and YouTube in a Senate hearing about children’s safety, during which he said TikTok is working to “keep its platform safe and create age appropriate experiences” but added “we do know trust must be earned.”\n\nAnd earlier this year, a group of state attorneys general announced an investigation into TikTok’s impact on young Americans focused on the app’s user engagement techniques and alleged risks that the platform may pose to the mental health of children. (At the time, TikTok said that it limits its features by age, provides tools and resources to parents, and designs its policies with the well-being of young people in mind.)", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/29/social-media-bill-ban-children-13/11734815002/", "title": "Social media bill in Senate would ban kids under 13.

And I do think it’s important to start building coalitions,” said Samuel Chapman, a 58-year-old California parent whose 16-year-old son died from fentanyl-laced drugs purchased through Snapchat in 2021. “I just don’t see it as the solution.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMost social media companies already prohibit users under 13 because of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, otherwise known as COPPA. However, it's not strictly enforced.\n\nSmart analysis delivered to your inbox:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nParents skeptical over proposed social media age restrictions\n\nChapman and his wife, OWN TV host Dr. Laura Berman, have been large proponents of social media legislation following the death of their son, including advocating for parental monitoring technology on such applications.\n\nChapman and Berman have advocated for Sammy’s Law – legislation named for their son – which would require major social media companies to allow parents to track their children through third-party monitoring software.\n\n“I’m all for parental permission. I don’t know if codifying will make it happen because everything that’s been put in place by these platforms and by our legislators thus far any 12-year-old has been able to get around,” Chapman added.\n\nChris Kunkle, whose children are 10, 15 and 17, voiced similar concerns while also taking issue with lawmakers’ reasoning for the legislation.\n\n“I think they’re using social media as a scapegoat. The mental health crisis – there's a lot of factors that go into it,” Kunkle said.\n\n“Yes, social media has shone a light on that for some of these kids, but I don’t think just blocking or making social media more difficult for children is really going to have any effect on the problem with mental health that we have,\" the 39-year-old father of three added.\n\nBipartisan group of senators push social media bill\n\nSens. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Katie Britt, R-Ala, introduced the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act aimed to protect children from the harmful effects of social media, emphasizing its impact on mental health.\n\nThe senators laid blame directly on social media for the growing mental health crisis, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2021 Youth Risk Behavior found poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased across nearly all groups of youth.\n\n“For too long big tech has exposed our kids to dangerous content and disturbed people. Moms and Dads have felt helpless while their kids suffered, sometimes leading to devastating tragedies,” Cotton said during the press conference introducing the legislation.\n\n“This bill is a giant step towards fixing that problem. It puts parents back in control and sends an important message: Social media companies have a duty to help keep kids safe and parents informed or face serious consequences,” he added.\n\nIn addition to restricting children under 13 from social media and requiring parental consent for those between the ages of 13 and 17, the proposed legislation, according to the bill text, also includes:\n\nRestricting social media companies from using algorithms to recommend content to minors.\n\nRequiring platforms to use “rigorous” age verification measures but prohibiting social media companies from using the information for other purposes.\n\nThe creation of a pilot program for a government-established age verification system companies can choose to use.\n\nProviding the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the authority to enforce the measures of the proposed legislation.\n\n“By instituting these simple, straight forward guidelines we’ll be able to give the next generation of children what every parent wants for their child, which is a chance to grow up happy and healthy,” Schatz said Wednesday.\n\nBills protect children online\n\nThe legislation is not the first targeting children who use social media platforms.\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill in February – the Making Age-Verification Technology Uniform, Robust, and Effective (MATURE) Act – to require social media platforms to verify that users are at least 16 years old before allowing them onto the platform.\n\nUnder Hawley’s bill, individuals would have to provide the platform with their full legal name, date of birth and a scan, image or upload of a form of government-issued identification, which would verify a user’s name and birthday\n\nHawley also introduced the Federal Social Media Act, a bill that would commission a report to study the impact of social media on users’ mental and physical health of those under the age of 18.\n\nThe Missouri lawmaker also led the effort to fast-track a national TikTok ban, before being blocked by Sen.

For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia.

Several other favorite food spots kicked off their own pumpkin spice plans earlier this month.\n\nDunkin' launched its fall menu last week – also earlier than in the past – pouring Pumpkin Spice Signature Lattes and pumpkin coffee.

Everything we're doing for the first time, we're doing for the first time. We're building the plane as we're flying.\"\n\nBut the quick success of the company is allowing Sweetens Cove to grow from releasing 5,000 cases in 2021 to roughly 11,000 in 2022 (cases are made up of six 750 milliliter bottles).\n\nThis year's number includes 7,000 cases of Kennessee and roughly 4,000 cases of limited-edition bourbon being released in the fall.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm very familiar with the rivalry with Tennessee and Kentucky, playing out in Knoxville and Lexington during my college playing days,\" Manning told Knox News. \"But now, it's about being friends and bringing them together.\"\n\n'Why not bring them together?'\n\nThe arc of the COVID-19 pandemic has played a role in the timing of this release. Bars and restaurants were closed in 2020 and 2021, Rivers said, making it difficult to build relationships with potential buyers during the company's first years in business.\n\nTaking on a $200 bottle was a big ask, he said, but Kennessee should be more accessible. That does not mean sacrificing taste.\n\n\"We kind of liked the fact, to start out, (trying) to create something small and limited and unique and kind of create this buzz — like a hidden treasure,\" Manning said. \"We felt like we did that. But now, we feel like it's time to let everybody have a chance to taste it and to understand just how special Marianne Eaves is and what she has created.\"\n\nThe fledgling company brought on Eaves, an acclaimed distiller, to continue her whiskey innovation with Sweetens Cove. Eaves is known as Kentucky's first female master distiller of bourbon since Prohibition, and she has worked on both sides of the Tennessee and Kentucky state lines.\n\nWhile residents of these states might not agree on music or horses or sports, Rivers said, everyone should agree on \"really good bourbon.\"\n\n\"Why can't they come together and create some delicious combustion?\" he said. \"For us, that's been an exciting part of the process. ... It seems like this funny, dangerous, intriguing, exciting place. That's exactly where we want to be.\"\n\nIf a Tennessee legend like Manning can get behind Kentucky, there's no reason bourbon drinkers in the Volunteer State can't do the same thing.\n\n\"I could tell right away when I got to Knoxville that beating Kentucky was important,\" Manning said. \"At the same time, healthy respect. ... This is kind of a fun play off the rivalry that we're trying to all be friends. Certainly, Kentucky and Tennessee are rivals in the bourbon business as well.\n\n\"Rather than argue about which state is better, why not bring them together?\"\n\nManning no longer a 'whiskey rookie'\n\nIn Manning's words, combining Kentucky and Tennessee bourbon is like \"1+1=3.\"\n\nA news release from Sweetens Cove states the Kennessee aroma \"suggests warm toasted oak, graham cracker, rich mulled spice and orange peel.\" The flavor features \"nuances of sweet warm caramel, vanilla and baking spices with a hint of citrus and gentle chewy oak,\" the release said.\n\nThe lower price will allow whiskey drinkers to enjoy these flavors in cocktails, Rivers said, perhaps choosing an old fashioned with Kennessee at Manning's one-of-a-kin Saloon 16 in Knoxville.\n\nThe bourbon also will be available at Oliver Royale and Simpl on Sevier, to name a few bars, in addition to liquor stores like McScrooge's Wine & Spirits, Green Meadow Wine & Spirits and Total Wine & More.\n\nWhile Manning told Knox News in 2020 he was a \"whiskey rookie,\" he has graduated to \"amateur\" status.\n\n\"I never liked people that all of a sudden become an expert after being involved with something for one year,\" he said. \"An expert — that takes a lot of reps. ... I'm still an authentic Michelob Ultra beer drinker. ... But I can appreciate my bourbon-loving friends telling me how good Sweetens Cove tastes.\"\n\nManning said he and his father recently enjoyed a Sweetens Cove old fashioned in New Orleans — a \"special little father-son thing to do.\"\n\n\"You can share it with your friends,\" he said. \"That's kind of what Sweetens Cove is all about ... the Volunteer spirit. And now we're bringing Kentucky into this.\"\n\nGrowing and giving back to golf\n\nRivers said Manning's position in the company is unique among celebrity-backed brands, in the sense that he is highly active as an owner. Manning is in direct contact with sales workers and has been \"very much a part of the decision to grow methodically and grow properly,\" Rivers said.\n\n\"That's just kind of how I'm wired, I guess,\" Manning said. \"If I'm going to be a part of it, I'm going to be a part of it. ... We hired Marianne to be the quarterback, if you will, and she's called the shots. And that's been a major touchdown, to use a cheesy football analogy.\"\n\nSweetens Cove currently offers bourbon products in 12 states. Rather than expanding into new markets with this release, Rivers said, the company will focus more on strengthening its position as a brand.\n\nThe company is dedicating $5 from every one of the first 10,000 bottles of Kennessee sold to help with small projects on small golf courses. Manning said this $50,000 pool could go toward items like ice machines, benches and range mats.\n\nAnyone with suggestions about where this money could be used should message @sweetenscovespirits on Instagram.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/business-food/oscar-mayer-cold-dog-popsicle/index.html", "title": "Oscar Mayer is now selling frozen wiener pops | CNN Business", "text": "1.

A water project that runs out of money before the pipes reached town. Sick residents who can’t afford the medicine that’s available elsewhere.\n\nAnd so for as long as Báten can remember, they have survived thanks only to the relatives who leave Guatemala for the United States, and the dollars they send home.\n\nBáten’s father worked in the U.S. for three years in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. His brother still labors in an Ohio factory, one of around 1.1 million Guatemalans working in the U.S.\n\nEven his friends who didn’t go north had to leave their mountain village to find work in Guatemala City. From there, they began pinging on Facebook earlier this year about a man named Bernardo Arévalo. “Look, these are the things Arévalo is proposing,” they told him. “You’ve got to spread this message at home.’”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“I want to stay and make a change,” said Báten, 28.\n\nThat idea – which can be heard among crowds flocking to Arévalo’s campaign rallies – makes Arévalo not only the leading candidate in his own country’s presidential race, but a consequential figure in another one 2,000 miles north.\n\nArévalo, initially an outsider, surged to the front of the race, on a promise to end corruption that has turned generations of Guatemalans into U.S. immigrants.\n\nIf Arévalo wins a runoff election Sunday, he stands poised to reshape the Biden administration’s approach to one of its most intractable challenges: the endless flow of migrants to the southern border.\n\nRepublican governors have responded with get-tough approaches, snaring border crossers with razor wire or shuffling them onto buses bound for Democratic cities. All that now plays out as the U.S. hurtles toward a possible election rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump – who ran on the phrase “build the wall.”\n\nWhile the political debate in the U.S. focuses on border security, no effort is likely to succeed without addressing root causes of poverty, corruption and violence.\n\nThe Biden administration in 2021 heralded a plan for hundreds of millions of dollars to address just that. But Central American leaders were reluctant to cooperate.\n\nArévalo promises he is different.\n\n“The first thing that will happen is that actually the United States will find a partner that is rooting out corruption and will have all intention of actually working toward development,” Arévalo told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview in the capital city of Quiché, the same state where Báten lives.\n\nIn the week leading up to the runoff vote, USA TODAY spent three days following Arévalo’s campaign across rural Guatemala in a country where top officials have been sanctioned by the U.S. as “undemocratic actors,” where the World Bank found nearly 20% of the gross domestic product comes from money sent home by Guatemalans in the U.S.\n\nArévalo’s candidacy stirs memories of an older generation: His father was the country’s first democratically elected president after an oppressive dictatorship. His ideas galvanize a younger generation’s social media idealism on the premise that Guatemalans wouldn’t leave in record numbers if they could find opportunities at home. Arévalo said a shared agenda with the United States is vital. “At the end of the day,” he said, “people are going out of places like Quiché because there are simply no options for them.”\n\nWho is Bernardo Arévalo?\n\nOn a warm weekday morning, Báten and his father led a march of dozens of Chiul residents through the cobblestoned streets of Santa Cruz del Quiché.\n\nAs the youngest member of Chiul’s council of leaders, Báten rallied to Arévalo’s cause, along with town elders who carried a banner the width of the street and blew noisemakers. They chanted in rhyme: \"¡Se ve, se siente, Arévalo presidente!\" Roughly, \"See it, feel it, Arévalo for president!\"\n\n“We don’t want any more corrupt politicians,” said Francisco Báten Itzer, Báten’s father. “We don’t want any more malnourished children, no more poverty and injustice. We want someone new.”\n\nTall, with glasses and a graying goatee, Arévalo has a Ph.D. and speaks five languages but was otherwise unknown to most Guatemalans until a few months ago. His bid was seen less as a real chance to take the presidency and more as an opportunity for a relatively new party, popular among urban academics, to expand its base.\n\nThat was until judges aligned with President Alejandro Giammattei eliminated three candidates on alleged violations in the first-round election. Thousands of voters nullified their ballot or opted for last-place Arévalo.\n\nIt was a massive, quiet protest against the alleged machinations of a group of powerful elites known in Guatemala as the “pact of the corrupt.”\n\nArévalo surged to the top, landing a spot in the runoff against Sandra Torres, a firebrand former first lady.\n\nTorres, who declined USA TODAY’s multiple interview requests, has shifted to the right as she makes her third bid for the presidency. She has seized on Arévalo’s birthplace, calling him the “Uruguayan candidate,” even though the constitution allows Guatemalan citizens born elsewhere to run for the office.\n\nArévalo’s unlikely success, resonant message and down-to-earth campaign through rural communities drove turnout from influential locals like the group from Chiul.\n\nThese town leaders can recount how the water pipeline was built to within sight of their village but then stopped, and now, when the rains dry up, so does the water in their faucets. How the wife of one of the men can’t afford basic medicine for a kidney condition, in a country where the public health system has a history of purchasing fraud, bribery and deals that benefited pharmaceutical suppliers, leaving patients at risk.\n\nBáten’s 25-year-old wife, he said, is a trained teacher, the kind his town needs. But she can’t get a teaching job, he said, because officials want her to \"purchase\" a work contract – a common form of bribery.\n\nThose realities drove the group from Chiul as they marched through Santa Cruz del Quiché toward the campaign rally.\n\nAs they did, Arévalo was fielding questions at a news conference on the edge of town. What will he do to entice young people living in rural areas to stay?\n\n“We need to remember that Guatemala is a country in which 6 of every 10 people is a young person and the majority of this population is indigenous,” Arévalo said. Rather than buy votes with gifts of rice or potatoes, he said, “Our plan is to bring universal access to social services, including health care, education and highways. We’re going to focus on the rural areas that have been most abandoned by the government.”\n\n“Our only condition,” he said, “is that we’re going to do it with transparency and honesty.”\n\nSeveral hundred people filled one side of the central plaza and spilled up the stairs of the Catholic church as Arévalo climbed the stage. The country’s ethnic diversity was on display in the traditional dress of men and women from numerous, distinct Mayan communities.\n\nCommunity leaders brought gifts. Báten climbed the stage and handed Arévalo a \"morral,\" a woven bag worn by indigenous men in Chiul.\n\nArévalo promised to build highways, ensure access to water and expand educational opportunities, his voice rising like a preacher’s as he yelled \"ya basta,\" enough with corruption.\n\nThen he paused, and considered the gift Báten had given him.\n\nThere is a \"morral\" hanging by his desk, Arévalo said softly. A bag that was gifted to his father, Juan José Arévalo, when he was campaigning in 1944.\n\n“I’m going to hang this 'morral' next to my father’s, a reminder of the confidence I was given and the Mayan belief that authority is granted to those who have served the community.”\n\nArévalo’s connection to Guatemala’s democratic past is what makes his desire to work with the United States so extraordinary: It was the CIA that undid his father’s legacy.\n\nA father’s complex history with the U.S.\n\nLike many Guatemalans over 60, Mayra Rodríguez remembers hearing stories about Arévalo’s father and the country’s first democratic “spring.”\n\n“My parents were poor, and they lived through the dictatorship,” said the retired teacher. “My mother and father told us how, when Arévalo won the election, people’s attitudes changed,” Rodríguez said. “They knew they would have a different sort of president.”\n\nSince its independence from Spain in 1821, Guatemala has been ruled by a series of dictators aligned with landowning oligarchs. The oligarchs, in turn, had interests aligned with the profits of the United Fruit Company, a U.S. banana producer that established a powerful fiefdom across Central America.\n\n\"United Fruit destabilized democratic frameworks wherever it could, and it ultimately worked best with military dictatorships,\" said Peter Chapman, author of the 2007 book, \"Bananas: How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World.\"\n\nWhen the elder, Juan José Arévalo, became the country’s first democratically elected president in 1944, he ended the violent dictatorship of Jorge Ubico, an army colonel whose 13 years in power were defined by brutality and earned him the nickname \"Little Napoleon of the Tropics.\"\n\nJuan José Arévalo’s democratic reforms were inspired by President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. He built schools and hospitals. He gave illiterate Guatemalan men voting rights. He nurtured fledgling unions. His efforts were not universally welcomed.\n\nBy the time Arévalo left office in 1951, there had been numerous attempts on his life and plots for his ouster.\n\nA year before he left office, a lobbyist for United Fruit met with an influential State Department official. The lobbyist, according to declassified CIA documents, suggested that the U.S. oust Arévalo, after he had taken too much interest in United Fruit’s exploitative labor practices.\n\nJacobo Arbenz succeeded him as president, demanding better terms for the rural poor. That move smacked of communism to the Truman administration during the anti-communist fervor of the time. So, the CIA orchestrated a coup to oust Arbenz in 1954. The elder Arévalo was forced to flee Guatemala and his son, Bernardo, was born in exile in Uruguay in 1958.\n\n\"The 1954 coup shuts down the possibility for democracy. And it's really the start of a civil war in Guatemala that lasts for 36 years,\" said Will Freeman, a scholar fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIt’s a memory older generations in Guatemala still carry.\n\n“The reforms his father enacted really made an enormous difference,” said Anita Isaacs, a professor of social science at Haverford College.\n\n“I see the father in the son,” she said. “It’s his message that he is carrying.”\n\nThe Biden administration’s ‘root causes’ immigration strategy\n\nTwo years ago, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris laid out a five-point strategy to tackle the “root causes” of migration from Central America, anchored by a $400 million plan to invest in programs to address problems that drive migrants to the U.S. border.\n\nThe strategy flatlined: \"They came up against, in the case of Guatemala, a corrupt class that just wouldn’t back down,\" Eric Olson, director of policy for the Seattle International Foundation said. \"They found real, strong and deep resistance in the region.\"\n\nThe administration’s “root causes” plan intended to support independent media, strengthen the justice system and prosecute corrupt actors. Instead, Guatemalan prosecutors aggressively pursued the officials leading anti-corruption efforts, and top judges, anti-corruption prosecutors and journalists fled to Mexico and the U.S.\n\nSo the Biden administration pivoted, sanctioning allegedly corrupt officials including Consuelo Porras, the country’s attorney general.\n\nOver the next two years, strategy reports from the White House show a different focus. A 2023 announcement trumpets not internal anti-corruption efforts but $1.2 billion in outside private investment.\n\n“We’re certainly clear-eyed that the change doesn't happen overnight,” a State Department official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “These efforts require sustained attention.”\n\nThere is no doubt an Arévalo win could open new avenues for the Biden administration, Olson said.\n\nThe Biden administration is not taking any public position in the race.\n\nThe State Department official rejected any suggestion that the administration has a “preferred candidate” and has instead condemned “election interference” and earlier efforts by Porras and her office to revoke the status of Arévalo’s Semilla party.\n\n“The most important thing for us is a free and fair election and a process that is not undermined by the Guatemalan attorney general or corrupt forces with which she works,” the State Department official said.\n\nIn a sign of the election outcome’s significance for the U.S., officials from the State Department, National Security Council and vice president’s office have met with both candidates.\n\nTo Biden’s advantage, Arévalo seems to have an agenda that tracks with the White House, even on thorny issues of border enforcement.\n\nBiden rolled out policies making it harder to seek asylum in the U.S.; Arévalo told USA TODAY he intends to crack down on smuggling through his country. Biden has opened “lawful pathways” for migrants to reach the U.S. and increased the availability of work visas; Arévalo thinks he can help.\n\n“We very clearly understand that there are problems with 'coyotes,' a form of organized crime, simply having control of many places at the borders,” Arévalosaid, a problem that an expansion of U.S. work visas could address. “We have been told by U.S. businessmen and by people in the U.S. government as well, that there is a need for workers in the United States.”\n\n“When it comes to Biden's ‘root causes’ strategy, I think Arévalo does seem to be very much on the same page,” said Rachel Schwartz, an expert on Guatemala’s democracy at the University of Oklahoma. “There is a sort of shared understanding of the problem and a shared sense of what the solutions are.”\n\nUS worries about Guatemala election interference\n\nTensions were high in the final days of the Arévalo campaign after an Ecuadorian presidential candidate was assassinated in early August. The brazen attack was captured on cellphone video and circulated on social media. Opponents of Arévalo commented, “and Bernardo when?”\n\nIn Guatemala, most presidential candidates travel by helicopter across the hard-to-access countryside: a sign, voters say, they’re in somebody’s debt and subject to corruption.\n\nArévalo, instead, crisscrossed the country’s mountainous terrain on winding two-lane highways in an older model charcoal-colored Ford SUV, in a convoy of three or four vehicles.\n\nAfter Quiché, he headed to Huehuetenango state, which shares both a border and a smuggling corridor with Mexico, just to the northwest.\n\nSome 45 police officers secured the perimeter of Arévalo’s rally just outside the walls of a school in the city center. The crowd sandwiched into a side street pumping the white flags of Semilla and purple signs with Arévalo’s name. Balloons and pennants danced in the breeze.\n\nRecent polls of likely voters favor Arévalo to win more than 60% of the vote.\n\nThere is a social movement backing him, he said, that includes young people, indigenous people and some in the private sector who want the rule of law respected. “They just didn’t see us coming,” he said.\n\nArévalounderstands there are no guarantees. His country’s legal system almost thwarted his party’s chances once before. He knows that even if he wins the election, his foes could use the power of the state to attack the outcome in court.\n\n“We know there’s going to be a reaction,” he said.\n\nWomen played marimba. Security detail readied the area where Arévalo would arrive, holding bulletproof shields like briefcases. Someone set off firecrackers in a nearby park, the noisy ta-ta-ta-ta drowning out the music as smoke billowed.\n\nRodríguez, the retired teacher who remembered her parents’ stories of Guatemala’s first democratic election, waited by the stage, her salt-and-pepper hair brushed back, her white lace \"huipil\" blouse neatly draped.\n\nRodríguez watched in awe. She believed Arévalo, like his father before him, would herald a new era where younger generations wouldn’t have to leave Guatemala.\n\n“I am 64 years old,” she said, “and we have lived a very sad story in my country. I have been hoping that the people would wake up. We are hungry for justice. We are hungry for honesty and integrity.”\n\nLocal performers took the stage to entertain his supporters while they waited. A clown danced. Campaign volunteers tossed T-shirts into the crowd. A \"cumbia\" promoting Arévalo played over loudspeakers.\n\nRodríguez asked for a turn.\n\nShe stepped on stage, nervous about remembering the lines of a poem she wished to share. She fumbled with the microphone.\n\nThe rally grew quiet as she swayed. The marimbas had gone silent. The green and purple balloons hovered in the humid air.\n\nThen, the words poured out.\n\n“In the darkness of night, we speak of truth and honor. It’s that Arévalo lives again …”\n\nThe oration went on. Men and women in the crowd wiped their eyes in silence.\n\nFinally, the poem reached its final line. The city center erupted in cheers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2016/07/28/student-news-new-brunswick-dancer-has-power-thanks-scholarship/87071722/", "title": "Student news: New Brunswick dancer has the power thanks to ...", "text": "Staff Report\n\nMyCentralJersey\n\nGregory Hines Dance Power scholarship award gives boost to student entering Rutgers\n\nNJ teachers complete intensive course on history of the holocaust at Rutgers\n\nSpring dean's list recipients at Middlesex County College\n\nAmerican Repertory Ballet and the Princeton Ballet School awarded incoming Rutgers Student Iraida Izaquirre the Gregory Hines Dance Power endowed scholarship.

Accreditation is not only a status; it is also an ongoing process that ensures a school’s continued growth and excellence. According to the MSA, accreditation is the result of an \"external, objective validation of school quality and achievement—the Gold Standard.\"\n\nFor two years, Union Catholic engaged in a comprehensive self-study, using the MSA protocol \"Excellence by Design.” The self-study process was facilitated by two Internal Coordinators: Noreen Andrews, Assistant Principal, and Barbara Dellanno, Dean of Academics & Faith-Formation.\n\nThe Planning Team, whose members represented a cross-section of UC stakeholders and included faculty member Catarina Abrantes, Director of School Counseling Jennifer Dixon, faculty member Timothy Breza, faculty member and alumus Edward Sagendorf class of 2007, Associate Principal and alumna Karen Piasecki class of 1988, faculty member and Media Specialist Kathy Webber, Student Support Services Director and alumna Meg Nuwer class of 1998, faculty member and alumnus Ed Thornton class of 2004, and Director of Parent Relations and UC parent Allison Lestarchick, working closely with the Internal Coordinators. This team developed a Mission Statement, reflecting UC’s vision for the school and its students; a Belief Statement, identifying UC’s core values and the beliefs that guide the school’s mission; and The Profile of a Graduate, specifying what UC students have to know, be able to do, and to demonstrate for the school to achieve its mission. These three foundation documents are available at www.unioncatholic.org under “About Us.”\n\nThe Planning Team also collected the information and data from stakeholders that was used to create its report on the Context of the School and its Profiles of Student Performance and Organizational Capacity. All of this led to the team’s development of a Plan for Growth and Improvement in student performance and the school’s capacity to achieve the desired outcomes. Three measurable objectives were identified by the team. The first two objectives focus on student performance: improving critical reading proficiency and increasing knowledge of the principles of Catholic social teaching. The third objective focuses on curriculum design in light of the Profile of the Graduate.\n\nIn October 2015, a Visiting Team appointed by MSA spent four days evaluating the school using the self-study as its guide. Some highlights of the Visiting Team’s report:\n\n“The principal is a visionary who began implementing technology into the classroom as early as 1997. Now all students have laptops and the school has integrated technology throughout.”\n\nUnion Catholic has a commendable cohesive environment. A true collaborative atmosphere permeates the work of faculty and staff\n\n“The vast number of volunteer work and charitable causes championed by the students and club moderators over the years demonstrates the school’s spirit of outreach, which also supports the school’s Catholic identity.”\n\nOn May 2016, Union Catholic received “Official Notice of Middle States Accreditation” for the period May 1, 2016 to May 1, 2023. In his letter to the school the MSA President, Henry G. Cram Ed. D, commended UC for continuing “to be among the schools throughout the world that meet the internationally recognized standards of quality of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools”—the Gold Standard.\n\nUnion County 4-H\n\nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nStephanie Lauer of Canbury was named to the spring chancellor's and dean's list at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock .\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents at the University of Connecticut received their degrees this spring :\n\nChristina Donna Massoni of East Brunswick, bachelor’s in nursing\n\nRachel Lynn Borden of Kendall Park, bachelor’s degree in economics\n\nCarissa Etsuko Buurstra of Keyport, bachelor’s degree in exercise science\n\nKiera Jean Schneider of Matawan, bachelor’s degree in animal science\n\nKatherine Girard Duddy of Metuchen, bachelor’s degree in English\n\nMatthew Jordan Russo of Middletown, bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering\n\nChase Barrett Adams of Monmouth Junction, bachelor’s degrees in finance and biological sciences\n\nErin Teresa O'Rear of Old Bridge, bachelor’s degree in animal science.\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents at the University were named to the spring dean's list: Quentin Robert Oddi of Clark, Rebecca Sara Bierstein, Suraj Reddy Muddasani of Dayton, Danielle Lee Lindeman of East Brunswick, Xiao Li of Edison, Ayushi Sanjay Pathak of Edison, Angelica Maria Monsanto of Fords, LindsayCarbone, Raj D.

A consent decree signed last month by Drummond Co. Inc., a coal mining and processing company that dates back to 1935, and the Black Warrior Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court will require the company to remediate the long-shuttered Maxine Mine site near the town of Praco. The consent decree calls for elimination of the discharges of acid, sediment, and toxic, heavy metals, among other pollutants, that have been flowing into the Locust Fork for decades. “The rulings in this case and the consent decree itself are critical to protecting the Black Warrior River from harmful legacy impacts of coal mining, and set a precedent for polluters throughout the state,” said a news release from Barry Brock, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented Black Warrior Riverkeeper in this case. The consent decree requires Drummond to pay $2.65 million in court costs and $1 million for a supplemental environmental project to mitigate the effects of past pollution, plus set aside funds to operate treatment systems for at least 30 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has entered a contract with a former Dunleavy aide for up to $50,000 in part to advise the administration on what legal fights to pursue against the federal government. The contract with Strategic Synergies LLC was signed in April and released by Dunleavy’s office last week. Brett Huber is listed on the contract as the firm’s sole owner. The contract period is for April 25 through Oct. 24. Alaska has long had a contentious relationship with the federal government over lands and resource development and other issues. The state has a history of pushing back in areas where it thinks the federal government is overreaching. Huber was Dunleavy’s campaign manager in 2018 and an aide to Dunleavy following the Republican’s election. Huber went on the manage an unsuccessful campaign in 2020 against a voter initiative that ends party primaries and institutes ranked choice voting for general elections. He was brought back to the administration last year as a senior policy advisor for “statehood defense.” Huber left work in state government April 2, said Patty Sullivan, a Dunleavy spokesperson. She said the position Huber held within the administration “has not been filled, and existing staff cannot perform the unique work.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cities across metro Phoenix have partnered with the Salt River Project to figure out how best to increase water storage on the Verde River. In the long run, the partners want to offset the declining capacity of Horseshoe Reservoir by raising the height of the Bartlett Dam, which sits about 20 miles downstream, to store that amount of water and then some. The SRP and 20 partners are working with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on the effort. The partnership is kicking off a four-year study into the feasibility of modifying the Bartlett Dam. Congress authorized the study last year, after a two-year-long SRP and Reclamation appraisal study, the Arizona Capitol Times reports. Ron Klawitter, a senior principal at SRP, said accumulating sediment at Horseshoe Reservoir has led to the loss of more than 45,749 acre-feet of water storage, about one-third of the reservoir’s original capacity. An acre foot contains 325,851 gallons. Exploring how to address that loss, the feasibility study will look at the impacts of raising the height of the 287-foot Bartlett Dam by between 62 feet and 97 feet. If the dam were raised by 97 feet, that would increase its capacity to 628,000-acre feet from its current 178,186 acre-feet.\n\nArkansas\n\nHuntsville: Ronnie Hawkins, a brash rockabilly star from Arkansas who became a patron of the Canadian music scene after moving north and recruiting a handful of local musicians later known as The Band, has died. His wife, Wanda, confirmed to The Canadian Press that Hawkins died Sunday morning after an illness. He was 87. “He went peacefully, and he looked as handsome as ever,” she said by telephone. Born just two days after Elvis Presley, the Huntsville native known to friends as “The Hawk” (he also nicknamed himself “The King of Rockabilly” and “Mr. Dynamo”) was a hell-raiser with a big jaw and a stocky build. He had minor hits in the 1950s with “Mary Lou” and “Odessa” and ran a club in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where acts included such early rock stars as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty. Hawkins didn’t have the gifts of Presley or Perkins, but he did have ambition and an eye for talent. He first performed in Canada in the late ’50s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse. With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-’60s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves The Band.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans. Legislators advanced a bill last week to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes needed “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The California Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Rescuers have recovered the body of a second victim after a boat carrying 13 people capsized on a lake over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife rescue team located the body Tuesday morning in 107 feet of water at Lake Pueblo State Park after an all-night search, the state agency said in a statement. The 11 others on the boat survived. The Pueblo County coroner plans to release the victim’s identity after next of kin are notified. The eight children and three adults were on the large, flat boat near a picnic area at Lake Pueblo State Park when witnesses reported high winds apparently overturned the boat Sunday evening. The second victim, 38-year-old Jessica Prindle, of the community of Pueblo West, died at the scene, the coroner’s office said. The survivors were treated for hyperthermia at hospitals, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. Park manager Joe Stadterman said the accident “underscores the importance of being extremely careful around the water.” “If you are on or even near the water, we strongly urge you to wear a life jacket,” he said. Lake Pueblo is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases – known as “gifting” – could now carry a heavy price tag in the state. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year. Thousands of people have attended the events, often paying a fee to be admitted, and exchanged cannabis-related products for other items or received them along with the purchase of an item such as a T-shirt. The Connecticut Post reports cannabis advocates say the bill penalizes people for doing something that’s now legal in the state. The legislation’s supporters say it still allows friends and family to gift cannabis as long as no money is exchanged.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The opening trial day in the criminal corruption case against the state auditor came to an abrupt halt Tuesday when the judge decided to give attorneys more time to consider issues raised by defense arguments that the indictment against Auditor Kathy McGuiness is defective. Judge William Carpenter Jr. ordered a halt to the proceedings after expressing concern about arguments made by defense attorney Steve Wood and the prosecution’s response to those arguments. Wood argued in a Wilmington courtroom that the indictment should be dismissed because it fails to allege where McGuiness’ supposed crimes occurred. Wood said venue regarding where an alleged offense occurred is among essential elements required by Delaware law in an indictment. McGuiness lives in Sussex County, and her office is in the capital, Dover, in Kent County, but prosecutors brought the case in New Castle County. “Nothing happened here,” said Wood, who rejected prosecution arguments that jurisdiction in New Castle County – or any county for that matter – is appropriate because McGuiness is a statewide elected official. Deputy Attorney General Maria Knoll argued the indictment is sufficient for trial because McGuiness serves all three counties, and her alleged crimes affected all three counties. The judge appeared skeptical of that argument.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With signs in hand after traveling from afar, thousands of people made their way to see D.C.’s annual Memorial Day parade Monday afternoon – the first parade held since the pandemic began, WUSA-TV reports. Some families traveled from across the country to be in the city for the parade’s return and to pay a visit to monuments around town. Area bands were in full gear in the sweltering heat to honor the men and women who died in service to their country. Rick Johnson, a retired Marine who served for 22 years, said he hopes those who came out take time to understand the true meaning of the day. “We as Americans need to truly understand what being free is and what the American flag truly represents,” he said. A Virginia woman, who asked to only go by Marlene, said though she’s lived in Arlington for 20 years, this is the first time she was able to give her thanks in person and honor those who are no longer here. As the bands played familiar tunes, and veterans passed by, Chris Stockwell, an Army veteran, said he is thankful for those who chose America and choose it every day. “Not everybody goes out there and serves, but those that do, we need to show support for those people,” Stockwell said. “They go out there and give their all to this country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Detectives have arrested an 18-year-old man after receiving a tip that he threatened a mass shooting at a school in a social media post. Corey Anderson’s post showed him with a handgun, a rifle and a tactical-style vest along with a caption that said: “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. Anderson was arrested at his home near Tampa on Sunday and charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. “This type of threat is unacceptable. This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. The sheriff said his agency will “do everything within our power” to track down anyone who makes school threats. “Protecting our students is our greatest priority,” Chronister said in the release. “We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.” Deputies discovered that the weapons in the photo were airsoft guns, the news release said. Anderson was booked into jail and later released on bond, jail records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The district attorney of coastal Georgia’s largest county has become the latest prosecutor in the state to say she’ll generally stop prosecuting misdemeanor marijuana cases involving possession of less than an ounce of the drug. Like other prosecutors, police chiefs and sheriffs who have stopped marijuana enforcement, Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones cited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to test for small amounts of marijuana unless other felony charges are involved. “Without a verified test, the state cannot prove that the accused violated the law,” Jones said in a statement. She also cited Georgia’s 2019 law that made hemp farming illegal, saying it’s hard to tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. The change began immediately. Officials in other jurisdictions including the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties, as well as Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County, have made similar announcements since 2019. “Disposing of low-level petty offenses that do not threaten public safety and do not involve a victim allows the state to focus already-limited resources on the serious cases that do,” Jones said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The former head of the Hawaii National Guard has been chosen to be the city’s new police chief. The Honolulu Police Commission chose retired Army Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan from among four finalists. Logan takes over from interim Chief Rade Vanic. Logan retired from the military in December 2019. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Honolulu police officer for 20 years. The department is still recovering from the 2019 conviction of former chief Louis Kealoha after he used his law enforcement power to frame his then-wife’s uncle for stealing their mailbox. He’s serving a seven-year federal prison sentence. His wife, a former city prosecutor, is serving 13 years. Logan said he was “just as surprised as anyone” by the decision, and his goal was to motivate, inspire and mentor people in the department. “I have to make myself available to the public to get their insights and answer their questions and concerns and show that the department ... is going to help them in what they would like in their community,” he told reporters after his selection. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi congratulated Logan and said building back public trust and restoring morale within the department need to be top priorities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Just under a third of the state’s registered voters cast ballots in the May 17 primary election, nearly matching the percentage that voted in the 2018 primary. Including new election-day voter registrations, 32.4% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2022 primary, the Idaho Press reports. That compares to 32.6% of registered voters who participated in the 2018 primary. In both of those primaries, there were hotly contested races for governor. Gubernatorial races normally guide turnout numbers, said former longtime Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. “If you get a third, 33%, that’d be a great turnout. That’s a sad commentary on our process,” Ysursa said, “especially when the whole ballgame’s in the primary.” Idaho is a strongly Republican state, and so the primary election is generally a strong predictor of the general election outcomes. Voter turnout in the state’s primary has been stagnant or declining for years since peaking in 1972 with more than 58% of registered voters casting ballots. Turnout was high that year because it was the first time residents between the ages of 18 and 20 were allowed to vote. “That was a big deal,” said Andy Brunelle, a retired Forest Service employee who worked for the state and tracked voter turnout as an editor for the Idaho Blue Book for many years, starting in the late 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An attempted murder charge has been filed after an attack on the “Walking Man,” a 75-year-old homeless man who over years has become a recognized figure in downtown Chicago. Joseph Kromelis was badly burned while resting on Lower Wabash Avenue last Wednesday and might not survive, Assistant State’s Attorney Danny Hanichak said. A 27-year-old man charged with attempted murder and aggravated arson was denied bond during a court hearing Monday, the Chicago Tribune reports. “This defendant did not target someone he got in an argument with, someone who wronged him or someone that he even knew,” Hanichak said. “This defendant decided to target the most vulnerable person possible: a 75-year-old homeless man sleeping on the street.” The man told police he poured gasoline on blankets without knowing Kromelis was under them, the prosecutor said. Kromelis has been the subject of news stories and a documentary. He once told the Tribune he roams around downtown “as a way of life.” In 2016, Kromelis was attacked with a bat. A GoFundMe account raised more than $32,000, though it was unclear at the time if he wanted the money, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Dozens of St. Vincent Health and Ascension Health workers in the state who were suspended without pay for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are asking a federal court to open a class-action lawsuit. The 64 workers claim the hospital network discriminated against them because they objected to the vaccine on religious grounds. “Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will,” the lawsuit said. Ascension Health owns St. Vincent Health. In July 2021 Ascension Health announced a requirement that its associates had to get the COVID-19 vaccination by November. There are roughly 14,700 associates in Indiana. Ascension Health said in a July release that “tens of thousands” of its workers had already been inoculated. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve,” the release said. Like other hospital networks in Indiana, St. Vincent Health allowed workers to get an exemption for religious beliefs or medical conditions. But the 64 workers who filed the lawsuit Friday say St. Vincent Health and its parent company “failed to individually and properly assess each application for religious exemption.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An invasive earthworm native to east Asia that was discovered in Iowa in 2018 has now spread to at least 11 counties. Officials in Dubuque and Muscatine counties were the first to report finding jumping worms, which are also known as crazy worms or Alabama jumpers due to their vigorous writhing and wriggling when disturbed. The snake-like worms can grow up to 8 inches long and are found amid leaf litter and closer to the soil surface than other earthworms commonly seen in Iowa. A map released in April by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach showed that the worms have now been found in Polk and Story counties, as well as Buchanan, Clayton, Jefferson, Johnson, Linn, Scott and Winneshiek. The ISU Extension website notes: “We assume jumping worms are much more widely spread than reports indicate.” ISU Extension said the worms, which have been infiltrating U.S. soil since the late 1800s, likely arrived in North America in potted plants, nursery stock or soil. They’re typically 3 to 5 inches long but are known to grow up to 8 inches. Jumping worms are darker and smoother than earthworms commonly found in Iowa. Identifiable characteristics include a cloudy-white and smooth narrow band; that band is raised on other earthworms. They do not produce an exterior layer of slime.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The recent bulldozing of a camp for homeless people has advocates arguing that Topeka should adopt more liberal policies modeled after ones in Kansas City, Missouri. Social worker Russell Burton and other advocates hope to raise the issue at the Topeka City Council’s meeting June 7, The Kansas City Star reports. Burton wants the city to require outreach workers to visit before a camp is bulldozed and to remain until city workers leave, something Kansas City mandates under a policy adopted in mid-April. He also wants to require the city to store people’s personal items for 60 days, as Kansas City does, twice the time set by Topeka’s policies. Topeka on May 10 razed an encampment just north of the Kansas River where more than a dozen people were living. Ken Saffer, a 57-year-old resident of the encampment on and off since 2017, said his belongings were confiscated, including clothing, tools and a generator. Others scrambled to collect medication and important documents. Spokesperson Gretchen Spiker said the city provided more than the required 72 hours notice before clearing the camp and followed its policies regarding belongings. She said the city “went above and beyond” to protect individuals’ constitutional rights.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new park that will allow public access to the Kentucky River is planned in Fayette County. The city plans to purchase 30 acres on the river near the Interstate 75 bridge into Madison County, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said in a statement. The city has signed an agreement, but the Urban County Council still needs to approve it. “This will provide new opportunities for recreation in Lexington. It will be a beautiful new park. And those who love kayaks and canoes will have a place to get onto the river and travel 12 miles between locks,” Gordon said. The $1.16 million cost for the property will come from fees developers pay to the city for the purpose of acquiring land for parks, officials said. Outdoor recreation has grown significantly in the past two years, and the park will establish a new kind of regional tourism with other river counties, said Mary Quinn Ramer, who is president of Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State and local governments and educational institutions could not require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for entry into government facilities under legislation advanced by a state Senate committee Tuesday. The 4-2 vote sends the House-passed bill by Rep. Larry Bagley, R-Stonewall, to the full Senate. As it came out of the committee, the bill would subject any government or state-run educational institution to civil penalties if it requires COVID-19 vaccinations for entry. Backers say government entities shouldn’t be asking about a person’s health status. Opponents of the bill said they didn’t want local governments subjected to civil fines for trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The bill would not apply to government health care facilities that would risk losing federal funding under any federal requirements for vaccines. It passed the House last month on a 59-26 vote. If approved by the Senate, it would go back to the House for approval of Senate amendment. The deadline for final adjournment of the legislative session is Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nWaterville: The Maine Attorney General’s Office has ruled that the fatal shooting of a man by police last year was justified. Waterville police responded in February 2021 to reports of Eric Porter, 32, armed with a knife and threatening people outside a hotel. The attorney general’s office said Friday in a report about the shooting that police ordered Porter to drop the knife and surrender when he charged at an officer with the weapon. Another officer shot and killed Porter, the attorney general’s report said. The report said officers tried using PepperBall launchers at Porter to no effect, and an electroshock weapon also didn’t subdue Porter because of his thick winter coat. Attorney General Aaron Frey wrote in the report that the officer who shot and killed Porter believed his colleague “would have been seriously injured or killed had he not shot Mr. Porter.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Thanks to the preservation of an early 19th-century plat, residents can soon see for themselves how the town – founded by Jonathan Hager in the 1760s – began to blossom in the years after the American Revolution, the Herald-Mail reports. After nearly two years in the hands of an expert document conservator, the plat and other documents – including a rare copy of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s proclamation to Marylanders in the days preceding the Battle of Antietam – are finally home with the Washington County Historical Society. Plans are to keep the delicate originals stored and preserved but to display copies for everyone to see. “My best guess is the plat plan was generated in the early 1800s,” said society President Bill Maharay. “It descended through the Hager family; it’s on vellum, and it shows the development of Hagerstown through various growth patterns.” This plat shows where the town was expanding as it developed. “And it’s not done in an orderly fashion,” Maharay said. “What I find most interesting is the water source for the town was the stream that starts up over by where the post office is. It’s now all underground, but it shows that stream pattern. And then the area on North Potomac where it rises up past Franklin was called the ‘healthy’ part of town because of sanitation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Firefighters battling a huge fire in the grandstand of a Boston horse racing track were hampered by a limited water supply and had to use thousands of feet of hose, officials said. There were no reports of injuries in the fire at Suffolk Downs that was reported about 10 p.m. Monday. The fire was knocked down by about 2 a.m. Tuesday, but crews remained on site to put out hot spots, the Boston Fire Department said in a tweet. Suffolk Downs, which first opened in 1935, has not had live racing since July 2019, but the grandstand remained open for simulcasting. The fire was first seen in the old press box on the roof, according to a statement from HYM Investment Group, which is redeveloping the site, but the cause remains under investigation. Boston firefighters were aided by several other area departments. The 161-acre site partially in Revere is being redeveloped into a mix of housing, retail, hotel, office and lab space. “The fire did not impact the area of Suffolk Downs currently under construction and redevelopment of the site remains ongoing,” HYM said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Any summer plans for late-night scooting through downtown Detroit have been thwarted by a new curfew established by city officials. The curfew, first reported by Outlier Media, applies to rentable electric scooters in Detroit’s Central Business District, bordered by the John C. Lodge Freeway, Interstate 75, Interstate 375 and the Detroit River. In cooperation with scooter operators, scooters will be shut down in this area between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew was announced by the Detroit Police Department during a press conference addressing summer safety efforts, including increased patrolling in Greektown and drag racing restrictions. Electric scooters operating in Detroit include Lime, Bird, Spin, LINK scooters operated by Superpedestrian and Boaz Bikes. During the curfew and within the designated area, enforcement by the operators varies, but some scooters will operate at reduced speeds or allow riders to finish their already activated trips. The city has not determined when the summer curfew will end, Outlier reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council has approved $1.2 million in legal settlements with two people injured by police during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of officers two years ago. The settlements with St. Paul resident Virgil Lee Jackson Jr. and Nashville freelance photographer Linda Tirado mean the city has agreed to pay a total of $5.4 million to settle federal civil rights lawsuits over injuries caused by police in May 2020, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The City Council approved the two settlements Thursday. The council agreed to pay Jackson $645,000. His lawsuit said that a Minneapolis police officer repeatedly shocked him using a Taser’s “drive stun” mode, pressing the electrodes directly onto his skin. He was in a parking lot at the time. Tirado lost the sight in her left eye after an officer fired a rubber bullet while she covered protests outside a police station. The City Council agreed to pay her $600,000. Floyd, 46, who was Black, died after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 91/ 2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was sentenced to 221/ 2 years in prison for murder and manslaughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the state of using a discriminatory proof-of-citizenship requirement for some new voters under a law dating back to the Jim Crow era. The dismissal came weeks after Mississippi repealed a 1924 law that required naturalized citizens – but not people born in the U.S. – to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A new law enacted in its place has also drawn opposition but is being grudgingly accepted by voting rights groups who say it ultimately should protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote. The secretary of state had been running names of potential new voters through a state Department of Public Safety database of people with Mississippi driver’s licenses and identification cards. Voting rights advocates said this practice disproportionately hurt people of color by flagging them as possible noncitizens. The new law says that if the public safety database raises questions about citizenship, the potential new voter’s name must be run through a federal immigration database. Groups that advocate for voting rights and immigrants’ rights said the federal database provides a safeguard to protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal judge has ordered St. Louis County to pay $300,000 to two people who sued after police barged into their home six years ago with guns drawn and without a warrant. A final judgment in the case was entered Thursday against the county, ordering it to pay Jon Luer and Andrea Steinebach for damages stemming from the home intrusion, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said in a news release. The ACLU said Luer and Steinebach were awoken about 3 a.m. July 10, 2016, to find armed officers in their hallway searching for a suspect who had skipped out on cab fare. The two officers interrogated the couple’s teenage son and searched his room. The officers left after deciding he was not the suspect but did not file an incident report about their contact with the family, the ACLU said. “Our family is still haunted by the illegal middle-of-the-night invasion of our home by the very people that are supposed to protect us,” Steinebach said in a statement. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the family’s lawsuit could proceed, calling police actions in the case a “severe, warrantless intrusion.” A police spokeswoman referred questions to the St. Louis County Counselor’s Office, which did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s top schools administrator has been cited in the case of a vehicle illegally passing a stopped school bus last month. Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen was cited Thursday after speaking with an officer, Helena Police Lt. Jayson Zander said. According to a police report, a school bus driver said a truck driven by Arntzen passed his bus while it was stopped to pick up children just after 7:30 a.m. May 19 in a Helena subdivision. The bus driver recognized Arntzen and recorded the license plate number on the red pickup truck, the police report said. A video of the incident reportedly “does not show the license plate of the vehicle involved,” Arntzen’s office said in a statement Friday. “Superintendent Arntzen does not recall the alleged incident,” Brian O’Leary, spokesman for the Office of Public Instruction, said in a statement Thursday. “She does acknowledge she drives a red pickup and lives in the area.” Montana’s 2021 Legislature passed a bill to improve bus safety after a student in northwestern Montana was hit and critically injured by a driver who passed a stopped bus in November 2019. Arntzen testified during a February 2021 legislative committee hearing in support of the bill, which doubled the fine for illegally passing a school bus to a maximum of $1,000.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A large fire that raged through a chemical plant was extinguished by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents who were initially evacuated were allowed to return to their homes, authorities said. Thick smoke billowing from the Nox-Crete facility just southwest of downtown Omaha could be seen as far away Monday evening as the Elkhorn River, about 20 miles to the west. Battalion Chief Scott Fitzpatrick said the first call for help came shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, and firefighters who initially entered the building found a much bigger fire than they had anticipated, forcing them to retreat. Fire crews then fought the blaze from outside the building, noting the presence of chemicals and propane bottles inside. Explosions could be seen and heard as propane tanks ruptured. No injuries were reported from the fire or explosions. Officials said the smoke posed no major toxicity risks to the public. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. According to its website, Nox-Crete makes a chemical coating and deactivator that keeps curing concrete from bonding to forms. It also makes liquid floor hardeners, joint fillers, curing and sealing compounds, and water repellents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal Bureau of Land Management is collecting public comment until Wednesday on a big north-south electricity transmission project that Nevada’s main utility, NV Energy, says is a key to its plan for a statewide renewable energy network. The project, dubbed Greenlink West, would stretch about 350 miles to connect electricity facilities near Las Vegas in southern Nevada and Yerington in the north by the end of 2026. It would generally run parallel to and east of the California state line. Conservationists and protesters say they do not want to see that much public land disturbed, and members of a tribe adjacent to the route say the transmission lines would adversely affect culturally significant land. Barbara Durham, tribal historic preservation officer for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, told the Las Vegas Sun that disturbed areas could include former village sites and areas where tribal ancestors found food and traded objects. Timbisha Shoshone homelands are in Nevada’s Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda counties and California’s Inyo, Kern, San Bernardino and Mono counties. “We would prefer that they go through already existing areas that have been disturbed,” Durham said. “No matter which way they go, they’re going to find the same thing.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: Fireworks shows at a popular beach were canceled for Memorial Day weekend and put on hold for several weeks because endangered piping plovers are nesting there. Local officials hope they can still have fireworks on the Fourth of July at Hampton Beach, which is close to the Massachusetts border. Hampton Beach Village District Chairman Chuck Rage said two nests were found on the beach. Piping plovers are endangered in New Hampshire and threatened nationally. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Endangered Wildlife Program has been monitoring and protecting breeding piping plovers and their habitat on the seacoast since 1997. The sighting of endangered piping plovers prompted officials to cancel fireworks shows at the beginning of the summer season at Hampton Beach last year, too. The small birds nest in the sandy dunes at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. The number of nests is expected to reach a new record in the state this year, with 16 in total, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The fireworks shows will resume when the eggs hatch and the plovers abandon their nests on the beach, which could take about a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewton: Paddlers who want to camp overnight along the Delaware River within a national recreation area must now have a reservation and pay a fee. An increase in visitors to the area who choose to stay overnight has prompted the move. The 62 primitive river campsites within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area will cost $16 per site, per night. Starting in 2015, the park piloted a similar system for six of the sites known as Alosa. This new change brings all river campsites under that system. “Falling asleep and waking up at a primitive boat-in campsite along the banks of a nationally designated scenic and recreational river is a unique and special experience, particularly within one of the most densely populated areas of the country,” said Elizabeth Winslow, fee program manager. Because the Water Gap is part of the National Park Service, the recent announcement by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that entrance fees at state parks are being lifted this summer does not apply. The Water Gap does not charge an entrance fee but does have several areas, such as boat launches and beaches, which have user fees. Winslow said there are several concerns about the primitive sites, such as flooding, resource protection and operational issues, that have reduced the number of official river campsites in the past 20 years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As nearly 3,000 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Monday, federal forest officials worried about future flash floods, landslides and destructive ash from the burn scar. The nearly 8-week-old fire was surrounded by containment lines cut and scraped around half of of its perimeter, enclosing 493 square miles of forested mountains and foothills east of Santa Fe. A Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team has started publishing data from its post-fire assessments. Micah Kiesow, team leader and a soil and watershed program manager with the Santa Fe National Forest, said steep mountain slopes had acted like a sponge before the fire. “Post-fire in some of these areas, especially the high soil burn severity areas and the moderate, we’re looking at now a steep slope that’s more like a parking lot,” Kiesow told the Santa Fe New Mexican. He said that could signal an “extreme change in watershed response” during monsoon season. Flooding presents another problem for communities near burn scars with ash flowing into rivers and streams, according to Kiesow. Many water treatment facilities aren’t equipped for the expensive, time-intensive process of filtering ash. Experts say ash and debris can harm water quality with high levels of nitrates and phosphorus.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A black bear wandered into the city, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet off the ground Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net. The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile from the Capitol. The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones and single-family homes. Albany police tweeted out several pictures of bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap. Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city. Police closed off the street off for a few hours as the state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican legislation that supporters argue would give parents more say over their children’s public schooling and health – but that critics say would intimidate and harm LGBTQ youth – headed to the state Senate floor after another affirmative committee vote Tuesday. The “Parents’ Bill of Rights” legislation includes a provision that would prevent instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school curricula for kindergarten through third grade. Schools would have to notify parents about changes to their child’s health and services that they are receiving, such as psychological treatment, or before they could change a child’s name or pronouns in records. LGBTQ activists likened these provisions to those in a Florida law opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Several urged GOP lawmakers Tuesday to stop the measure, saying more young people would have their sexuality revealed against their will. Other youth will keep their sexuality hidden, increasing further the threat of suicide, opponents said. “This bill proposes forced outing of queer kids,” said the Rev. Vance Haywood, senior pastor of St. John’s Metropolitan Community Church in Raleigh. “It’s creating an environment where we’re telling folks that it’s not OK to be yourself. You have to hide parts of who you are.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The longest-serving member of the state Senate declined to comment Tuesday on whether he’s the subject of an ongoing investigation following a report that he’d traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg had previously announced plans to resign Wednesday, six months before the end of his term. “There is a time,” Holmberg told the Associated Press on Tuesday when asked about why he was abruptly ending his 46-year career. Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from Holmberg’s home in November. “The rain will stop one of these days, and things will go on,” he said, declining to elaborate. Homberg said he planned on attending a luncheon with some current and former lawmakers Tuesday. He plans on turning in his state-issued computer and legislative credentials that include access to the state Capitol on Wednesday. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four times, he chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio students would have to take a self-defense class to graduate from high school if a bill introduced Tuesday by two Republicans in the state House becomes law. “Young women between the ages of 16-19 are the most vulnerable to be sexually assaulted,” Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Township, said in a statement. “This training will also provide opportunity for development of relationships between students and their local law enforcement and school resource officers.” Called the Student Protection Act, House Bill 639 would require incoming freshmen in public and private schools to complete self-defense training as part of their health education starting in the 2023-2024 academic year. The instructors would have to be school resource officers or certified self-defense instructors. “Physical, emotional or sexual abuse and assault are never okay. These behaviors should never be tolerated or go unreported,” Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, said in a statement. “Reinforcing this message with our young people, while equipping them with defensive tactics and proactive strategies will help them protect themselves and avoid dangerous situations.” She added that self-defense training could also help students identify early signs and symptoms of mental health issues and potentially aggressive behavior in their peers. Young said the bill has been in the works for months, and the timing of its introduction soon after a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, was coincidental.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s cannabis regulator was busy last week working on final implementation of a “seed-to-sale” tracking system, the latest major update as it prepares to be reformed as a stand-alone agency this fall. The changes represent a watershed moment for the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority in its nearly four-year history. After launching in 2018, the agency struggled to keep up with the exploding industry that quickly boasted more dispensaries than any other state in the country and has been plagued with black market activity, while also supporting over 380,000 licensed cardholders who regularly purchase more than $64 million of medical cannabis products monthly. Now under the guidance of its fourth executive director, the agency continues to expand its personnel and oversight duties. Seed-to-sale, which went into effect Thursday, means every product sold to a consumer should theoretically be traceable back to its literal roots – a capability officials claim will create a safer and more legitimate industry. The marijuana authority’s independence from its current place in the state Health Department won’t happen until Nov. 1, but work is already happening to hire its own personnel to handle administrative positions, human resources and payroll.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: Officials in Clackamas County said Tuesday that they have finished duplicating the majority of primary election ballots that were rejected by vote-counting machines because of a printing error that resulted in blurred barcodes on tens of thousands of ballots. Elections officials were forced to transfer the voter’s intent from a spoiled ballot to a fresh one that could be read by the machines. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. Elections officials expect to finish tallying the vote by the end of the week and to certify all election results by June 13, the state’s deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: On Roosevelt Boulevard, where 10% to 13% of the city’s traffic fatalities happened each year prior to the pandemic, plans to redesign the city’s “corridor of death” – as some residents and safety advocates call Roosevelt – could be gaining traction. Studies show Black communities have been hit even harder by a national surge in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosevelt Boulevard is a chaotic, almost 14-mile maze that passes through some of the city’s most diverse neighborhoods and census tracts with the highest poverty rates. Driving can be dangerous, but biking or walking can be even worse, with some crosswalks longer than a football field and taking four light cycles to cross. “You would not design a street or a road like that today,” said Christopher Puchalsky, policy director for Philadelphia’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. “It feels like an expressway, but it’s in the middle and between neighborhoods.” The city is hoping for federal money to begin a long-term, billion-dollar redesign of Roosevelt outlined in a study released in 2019, as well as to fund a series of smaller projects to improve safety at high-fatality stretches on the road by 2025.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee, the Rhode Island State Police and the state Department of Education have asked every school district to complete a comprehensive survey of potential emergency hazards. The effort, announced at the State House on Tuesday, is aimed at identifying potential school safety issues and addressing any necessary repairs or upgrades. Through the School Building Authority, the Department of Education will approve up to $500,000 in emergency funds for each district to make additional security upgrades. They will be reimbursed once the work is completed. Approximately $25 million is available statewide. McKee said the country is still processing the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed by a lone gunman. Since then, he said, there have been 12 new mass shootings across the nation. “No one thing alone will end gun violence,” McKee said. Limiting high-capacity magazines and banning assault weapons will help reduce that risk, he said. “The safety of our children must be the highest priority,” the Democrat said. Every school superintendent will conduct walkthroughs of buildings, including reviews of doors and windows, car access, landscape features, lighting, alarm and camera systems, and communications systems.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hurricane season officially starting Wednesday, state emergency officials want residents to prepare. Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Hurricane Preparedness Week began Sunday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is emphasizing this year that people know their evacuation zone, how to prepare their home to ride out a storm and what highways they need to take to evacuate with the slogan “Know Your Zone, Prepare Your Home, Remember Your Route.” Preparing a home not only includes checking hurricane shutters and roofs but also making sure to have the right kind and right amount of insurance, the agency said. And it’s not just coastal homes that need preparation. Recent hurricanes to hit South Carolina have brought massive floods inland and can also bring tornadoes and high winds well away from the coast. Health officials said residents should also make sure their COVID-19 boosters and vaccinations are up to date and include masks and other disease-fighting items in their hurricane kits in case they need to evacuate to areas where there is high spread of disease. Four hurricanes have directly or indirectly impacted South Carolina in the past six years. Meteorologists are predicting an above-average number of hurricanes and tropical storms this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican candidates in state House races are raking in unprecedented amounts of campaign cash ahead of next week’s primary election. And a handful of ultra-competitive contests in the Sioux Falls area are driving that trend. A review of campaign finance reports filed this week by dozens of state House candidates in legislative primary races statewide found that dozens have brought in tens of thousands of dollars ahead of the June 7 election. And of the 10 candidates reporting the highest fundraising totals, more than half are seeking office in Sioux Falls or the surrounding area. Three of the top seven fundraisers come from a single contest that could tip the scales in an intra-party power struggled that’s pitted two factions of the state GOP against each other.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: After years of a stalemate, the Shelby County Commission is once again poised to consider funding new voting machines. County commissioners have in the past voted down a similar arrangement, voicing support for hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If approved, the agreement would spend $5.8 million on new machines from vendor Election Systems & Software LLC, known as ES&S, having the equipment fully operational by the August 2022 general election; $2.4 million of those funds would be reimbursable by the State of Tennessee. “We are at risk for the election that’s coming up in August, so that’s why we’re trying to move forward with having a process by which hopefully having this new equipment will achieve the outcome that it’s intended for,” said Shelby County Commission Chairman Willie Brooks Jr. Voters would then be able to choose at the polls between a paper ballot and an electronic ballot. The ballot marking machines will not allow voters to overvote and are accessible for voters with disabilities. The machine used to count votes can tabulate both printouts from the ballot marking machines and paper ballots that have been filled out by hand. It will also catch if someone has overvoted on a paper ballot, asking the voter if they want to move forward.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials are warning beachgoers to stay away from an overly friendly dolphin off North Padre Island. The marine mammal has gotten a bit pushy in the water off the island about 20 miles east of Corpus Christi, according to a press release from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Biologists report the animal is showing more aggressive behavior, separating children from their parents in the water, and isolating swimming pets from their owners,” the release said. The problem is that people have been feeding, swimming and playing with the dolphin for more than a year despite warnings from biologists, law enforcement and residents to stay away from it, according to the release. It said the dolphin “has become so used to humans that it now seeks out people, boats, and any form of interaction.” The mammal also has wounds caused by boats, and there are concerns about its safety, officials said. People are being asked to leave the dolphin alone. Boaters are asked to avoid stopping if the dolphin comes too close and to slowly move away. Swimmers are being asked to leave the water if they see the dolphin, the release said. “While the dolphin may seem friendly, this is a wild animal with unpredictable behavior,” according to NOAA.\n\nUtah\n\nMonument Valley: Federal officials signed an agreement with leaders of the Navajo Nation on Friday that provides funding for clean drinking water infrastructure for reservation residents and resolves questions about long-standing Navajo claims to water rights in the drought-stricken U.S. West. The signing formalizes the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement, which became law in 2020 as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. As part of the agreement, the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation $210 million for drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County – the part of the 27,000-square-mile reservation that lies in Utah. Many Navajo homes lack running water. Residents often fill containers at public taps or rely on water deliveries from volunteer organizations. Utah, which was also party to the agreement, will pay the Navajo $8 million as part of the settlement. “We had two real problems in our state. One was the Navajo Nation had claims to the Colorado (River) that would impair Utah’s water rights,” U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The other concern we had was about half the Navajo Nation residents (in Utah) didn’t have running water.” The settlement also quantifies the Navajo Nation’s water rights, quelling Utah’s anxieties.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to the city Sunday, after being canceled or shortened the past three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times, and they looped the half-marathon course twice. More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon, while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont, was first across the finish line, and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California, resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Authorities said two women were missing Tuesday after a group of people in rafts and on paddleboards went over the Bosher Dam on the James River a day earlier. WWBT-TV reports 12 people were involved in the accident Monday afternoon. WAVY-TV reports the dam has a 12-foot drop, and water levels have been high. Images of the search show the river seemingly placid above the dam but roiling below, with some of the group’s paddleboards and inflatable rafts caught in the currents below the rush of water. One of them managed to reach a nearby house for help. Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said kayakers in the area helped to rescue nine more. But Segal said two women were unaccounted for despite a very thorough search. Crews searched for the two women until dusk, and the search resumed Tuesday morning, Henrico County police said in a news release. Police said they have worked with friends and families of Lauren E. Winstead, 23, of Henrico County, and Sarah E. Erway, 28, of Chesterfield County, listing them as missing. Police warned that the river is at dangerous levels in some areas and that anyone entering the river should be extremely cautious.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A cougar attacked a 9-year-old girl who was playing hide-and-seek at a church camp, seriously wounding her and sending her friends running in fear. Lily A. Kryzhanivskyy and two other children were playing in the woods Saturday at the camp near the small town of Fruitland, northwest of Spokane. Lily jumped out to surprise her friends when the cougar attacked, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Adults rushed to help and found the girl covered in blood. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she had surgery for multiple wounds to her head and upper body. Lily was released from the intensive care unit Monday and remained hospitalized in stable condition, the department said Tuesday. Following the attack, adults staying at the church camp found the young male cougar and killed it. “We are extremely thankful for this little girl’s resiliency, and we’re impressed with her spunk in the face of this unfortunate encounter,” Fish and Wildlife Police Capt. Mike Sprecher said. “It happened fast, and we are thankful that the adults at the camp responded so quickly.” Tests completed over the weekend showed the animal did not have rabies, the agency said. Cougar attacks on humans are rare. There have been just two fatal attacks on humans in Washington state in the past 100 years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAlum Creek: Guided hikes, exhibits and interactive programming will greet guests during the weekend’s grand opening of the Claudia L. Workman Wildlife Education Center, officials said. The event Saturday is being hosted by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and the Forks of Coal State Natural Area Foundation. Those who attend the free event in Alum Creek can tour the 9,500-square-foot building, explore the 102-acre property and attend shows presented by the West Virginia Raptor Rehab Center, the Division of Natural Resources said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to having everyone come out and experience all that we have to offer, including ‘Touch a Snake’ and ‘Bird ID’ activities,” said Ashley Anderson, the agency’s park activities coordinator. The opening fulfills the vision of the center’s namesake, Claudia Workman, whose husband donated the land in 2015 so a nature-based education center could be built. The center has five main areas that include an introduction to Forks of Coal State Natural Area, an aquarium and reptile exhibit, a wildlife management area, a habitat management area and a wildlife observation area. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday beginning June 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOshkosh: The judge presiding over a case involving a violent altercation in a Wisconsin high school postponed the trial after defense attorneys argued that public sentiment related to the school shootings in Texas could taint the jury pool. Grant Fuhrman, accused of stabbing a high school resource officer multiple times with a barbecue fork in Oshkosh in 2019, is charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During a struggle, the officer shot the then-16-year-old student. Neither of them was seriously injured, and the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Fuhrman’s attorneys filed a motion to delay last week, four days after an 18-year-old entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot 19 children and two teachers. The defense said their client could not get a fair trial in the current environment. The request said the Texas case would have been on the minds of every potential juror if the interview process had started Tuesday as scheduled. “The length of time between the outside influence and the trial is critical. Here that time frame is mere days,” the motion said. Judge Daniel Bissett granted the delay and scheduled a status hearing for July 7.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A record haul in super PAC spending has poured into the race for the state’s sole U.S. House seat this year, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. More than $1 million has been reported to federal officials in such spending, with much of it aimed at unseating Rep. Liz Cheney, who angered many other Republicans with her stance against ex-President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The spending total by independent expenditure-only political committees has already more than doubled Wyoming’s previous record, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/14/joshua-trees-flirty-juror-free-vasectomies-news-around-states/50834573/", "title": "Joshua trees, flirty juror: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The federal government on Wednesday said the state of Alabama illegally discriminates against children in foster care with behavioral and emotional disabilities. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state’s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into “segregated and inferior educational programs,” a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Students with disabilities in Alabama’s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state’s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will defend every child’s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.” The department’s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been “working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state’s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a “lightning round” if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month’s general election. Candidates responded by raising “yes” or “no” signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised “yes” signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised “no” signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions – or even entirely new constitutions – that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year’s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced “based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,” Culshaw said in a statement. “No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper’s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,” she wrote. Hooper’s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness’s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The sounds of the DC and Marvel cinematic universes will be on display this weekend as the Fort Smith Symphony offers its “Symphonic Superheroes” concert. “It’s an exciting weekend because we have so much going on,” said John Jeter, symphony conductor. The concert is slated to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center. Music from the movies “Robin Hood,” “X-Men,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Wonder Woman,” “Mission Impossible III,” “Captain America,” “Batman/The Dark Knight,” “Transformers,” “Black Panther” and “Iron Man” will be featured. “It’s all very, very exciting stuff,” Jeter said. “The kids will really love it.” There is prominent brass and percussion parts in the symphony, adding drama to the sound, with African and Japanese percussion instruments in the mix too. The symphony will be followed by an after-party for audience members at the Bakery District with live music by the Kool Cats Jazz Quartet. And on Monday, fifth graders may get to see their first symphony with “Earquake” concerts for schoolchildren at the ArcBest PAC. It will be a busy day for the orchestra Monday, with the Indigenous composer chamber music concert at Propak on Garrison at 7 p.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission’s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. “I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,” Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week’s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado – the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute – were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday’s ceremony with Biden but didn’t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House’s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn’t on board with the plan. The tribe’s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: Two police officers shot dead Wednesday night were apparently drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence, authorities said Thursday. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been “a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene” in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured. Police said suspect Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was shot dead, and brother Nathan Brutcher was wounded. The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. “I heard a whole war going on behind me,” said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Anyone planning to drive through the city on Interstate 95 south this weekend will need to find a different route starting Friday morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation said. As part of the ongoing “Restore the Corridor” project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday. Drivers coming from Pennsylvania should use I-495 south to bypass Wilmington. All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the “final stretch of major work.” Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. “The end is within sight,” McLeod said. A similar closure of I-95 north is slated for the last weekend of October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources – sewage, chemical runoff and litter – made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades­long effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state’s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An Atlanta-area sheriff stands accused of punishing detainees by having them strapped into a restraint chair for hours even though they posed no threat and obeyed instructions. Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men’s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure – attracting both fans and critics – since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain – charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An Oahu project aimed at at-risk youth has won a $20 million grant in a global challenge from the Kellogg Foundation, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Multiple nonprofit agencies running out of the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center will receive the money over the next eight years, providing services surrounding a juvenile correctional site, according to the outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks will likely start operating in early December, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Wednesday. Connie Flohr, manager of the Idaho Cleanup Project for the Energy Department’s Office of Environmental Management, told state officials the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory has successfully completed test runs with a simulant material. “We have every confidence that we will be operating in December,” she told members of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission during an online meeting. The commission makes recommendations to the governor regarding policies to support the viability and mission of the Idaho National Laboratory and other nuclear industries in the state. Commission members, appointed by the governor, include state lawmakers, local government elected officials, university officials and others. The lab, one of 17 Energy Department national labs, is the nation’s top advanced nuclear energy research lab and one of the state’s largest employers with about 5,000 workers. It’s a huge economic driver in the state, especially in eastern Idaho, bringing in millions of federal research dollars.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Seven months after it purchased a former Pillsbury Mills plant, the nonprofit group responsible for clearing the property provided a first look at progress made on the site Wednesday prior to a public meeting. Chris Richmond, president of Moving Pillsbury Forward and a former Springfield fire marshal, hosted the tour of the vacant site, showing off a series of buildings deemed safe for showcasing to small groups. Richmond displayed several artifacts found during cleanup of the property conducted over the summer, including tools, a map of the property from 1966, handmade grain scoops and chairs, and an old Pillsbury’s Best flour sack. “The wrenches are the kind you would have seen pre-World War II,” Richmond said. “I’m sure these are 75 years or older.” Richmond and his organization completed their purchase of the property in March, with environmental testing and cleanup of the site being conducted throughout the summer. The property was home to a thriving grain and flour plant that had thousands of employees at its peak in the 1950s before a significant decline. When Pillsbury sold the plant to Cargill in 1991, about 350 workers were there, with 200 of them being transferred to Tennessee as part of a company restructuring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge’s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general’s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that “there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court – all the justices were appointed by Republican governors – did not explain its decision. The order, signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said “a majority” of the court agreed with its provisions but gave no further details.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Domestic violence deaths in the state are on the decline this year after spikes in 2020 and 2021. Between January and August, 12 people were killed in domestic violence incidents, the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced. That compares to 17 deaths over the same period in 2021. Iowa had seen a spike in domestic violence fatalities over the prior two years, according to figures collected by the attorney general’s office. There were 17 deaths in all of 2020 – at that time the most Iowa had seen in a decade. More violent still was 2021, with 20 deaths in total. The deadliest year on record since 1995 was 2006, with 22 killings. State officials have attributed the 2020 and 2021 increases to the stresses on families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the Attorney General’s Crime Victim Assistance Division, noted that people in unsafe relationships had fewer options to cope with them under lockdown conditions. “Some victims can’t leave their homes, and services haven’t been as accessible,” Tibbetts Murphy said in a news release. “These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Alex Red Corn was dining out with his children one day in Salina when a bus full of student-athletes from Liberal High School pulled up and showed his children the kind of discrimination that still exists in dozens of Kansas high schools. “I was sitting at an Applebee’s, and the Liberal Redskins came into town,” he said. “A whole bus full of Liberal Redskins-themed stuff was surrounding us at the restaurant, and my kids were there, and there was a level of discomfort there.” But that’s a daily reality for the estimated 10,000 Kansas students who are Native American and either attend or are in the same athletic leagues of schools with disparaging, racist Native American imagery, said Red Corn, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Kansas State University and a member of the Osage Nation. Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Startup bourbon producer Jackson Purchase Distillery is boosting its investment. The company will increase its distilling operation investment in Fulton County in western Kentucky to nearly $26 million and create 54 full-time jobs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Jackson Purchase’s project has grown from an initially planned investment of $8.76 million and 30 jobs. Last year, the company’s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor’s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. “Kentucky’s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,” Beshear said. “This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.” The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Transparency in reporting incidents of violence and other problems at the city’s long-troubled jail has improved recently, but only slightly, a federal judge told sheriff’s office officials Wednesday. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff’s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. “We still have no information as to what’s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,” North said shortly before ordering the sheriff’s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A former Navy SEAL who’s seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree apologized for comparing federal fisheries regulators to rapists, saying the statement was “over the top.” Republican Ed Thelander was called out during a debate Wednesday evening for remarks he made earlier in the day attacking the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a rally for Maine’s lobster industry. “NOAA wants to rape you and your family, and they are saying pick a child,” he said. “You don’t negotiate with a rapist, and that’s what’s happening.” Pingree said during the debate that Thelander’s comments were not productive and dragged the discussion “down into the gutter.” “My comments were over the top, and I apologize for that,” Thelander said. “I’m very passionate about it. I love those families. I’m seeing the struggles they have, and nothing has been done about it.” Pingree, who lives in an island community on North Haven, disputed Thelander’s claim that nothing was being done as Maine officials fight regulations aimed at protecting right whales that could harm lobstermen. “Don’t say I’m not passionate about it,” she said. The debate in Maine’s 1st Congressional District touched on immigration, the economy, energy, abortion, education and other topics.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court’s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed’s defense. Phinn ordered Syed’s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee’s family asked the Court of Special Appeals – Maryland’s intermediate appellate court – to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn’t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee’s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family’s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee’s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn’t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Common, America’s oldest public park, is getting a multimillion-dollar makeover that includes an expanded visitors’ center, more restrooms, additional sports facilities, and even a sit-down restaurant at the famed Frog Pond, city officials announced Wednesday. The goal is to make the 50-acre swath of green space in the heart of the city more welcoming, convenient, fun and accessible for both city residents and tourists. “Boston Common’s gorgeous tree-lined paths and open spaces have hosted so many moments marked in history, from shaping our collective conscience to celebrating our communities,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “We’re excited to be sharing a plan that honors the Common’s history, reflects the community’s vision, and creates a space that will be more accessible, more resilient, and more inclusive for generations to come.” The Common was founded in 1634 and draws millions of people per year. It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm. It was also the site of huge protests in 2020 against police brutality.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors raised concerns Wednesday about a female juror who apparently has been smiling at one of three men on trial in connection with a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Judge Thomas Wilson said he, too, noticed it and pledged to pay “close attention” to the juror. He said the expressions didn’t appear to be a reaction to testimony. “She is in my direct view,” Wilson said. “So I am often looking right at her while I’m listening to the witness testify. … I’ve seen smiles come out of her face. Not great big smiles but more of a small smirk.” The juror has been looking at Paul Bellar, 24, who was a member of a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen. Bellar, Joe Morrison and Pete Musico are charged in state court with providing material support for a terrorist act. The trial has lasted eight days so far. “Since the start of the trial – and we’re prepared to offer sworn testimony on this from two different witnesses – there’s been nonverbal communication” between a juror and Bellar, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin. He suggested that Bellar sent a signal Wednesday by clenching his fists and shaking them in an “affirmative way.” But Bellar’s attorney, Andrew Kirkpatrick, said that was a misinterpretation: Bellar was excited because the lawyer offered him Skittles candy for his birthday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing fraudulent insurance claims for a staged arson he attempted to portray as a politically motivated attack. Federal officials said Denis Molla, 30, of Brooklyn Center, falsely reported to law enforcement in September 2020 that someone had lit his camper on fire and that three unknown males were near his home when he heard an explosion. Molla told officials his garage door was vandalized with a spray-painted Antifa symbol and the words “Biden 2020” and “BLM.” He claimed his camper was targeted because it displayed a Trump 2020 flag. Police discovered that Molla started his own property on fire and spray-painted the graffiti on his own garage. He then submitted multiple insurance claims seeking coverage for the damage to his garage, camper, vehicles and residence caused by the fire, court documents show. Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company. Molla also received more than $17,000 from individual donors via GoFundMe. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he’ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as “harm reduction” that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it’s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need “harm reduction” tools in the short term. “The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,” Edney said. “Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri is offering free vasectomies to uninsured patients in Springfield on Nov. 4 and in Joplin on Nov. 5. Vasectomy appointments will be offered from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. To be eligible, patients must complete a pre-screening exam by Nov. 3. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading Missouri to ban abortions, PPSLR saw demand for male sterilization procedures increase. “Since the Dobbs decision, we have seen an increasing number of male-bodied people coming and requesting this service,” Dr. Margaret Baum said. “We performed 142 vasectomies in 2021; already this year we’ve done close to 200 in 2022, and the year’s not out yet.” Baum said patients from across the state have been traveling to the clinic in St. Louis. In May, she began to provide vasectomies at the Springfield Planned Parenthood health center. Baum performs female sterilization procedures as well. “It’s just really important that these services are offered without judgement, without stigma, so that people who are informed about the procedure can make a good decision and decide if it’s the right thing for them, their relationship and their family,” Baum said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year. Commissioners agreed last month to consider a new color scheme. The predominantly blue logo is shaped like a hexagon and is meant to look like information is coming in through a prism and being reflected out as knowledge in four colored triangles. The rejected logo had triangles colored an orange-red, yellow, medium green and bright blue. The new logo has triangles colored red, bright yellow, yellow-green and a more muted blue – all pulled from the state seal on the Montana flag.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Average ACT scores for this year’s high school graduates across the state hit their lowest point in decades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The mean composite score on the college entrance exam for seniors in the class of 2022 was just 19.8, dropping below 20 – the maximum score is 36 – for the first time since 1991, according to the newspaper. Nebraska education officials said a downward trend in scores began five years ago, meaning it can’t be chalked up solely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Less than a month before Election Day, 14 members of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt’s family sent a letter endorsing his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. “We staunchly believe that Catherine is well equipped with her own ‘Nevada grit’ – a quality that she will take forward in representation of our home state for six more years across the halls of Congress,” the letter said. First obtained by The Nevada Independent, the letter does not mention Laxalt by name. Instead, it talks of Cortez Masto’s understanding of “the daily realities of dogged hard work” and mentions her experience in public education as well as her commitment to law enforcement. The family members also wrote that Cortez Masto’s career demonstrates she is “an authentic advocate of Nevada.” It marks the second time that some of Laxalt’s family has endorsed his opponent. During his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2018, a dozen family members endorsed Democrat Steve Sisolak in an op-ed to the Reno Gazette-Journal. That letter more explicitly criticized Laxalt, saying he “leveraged and exploited” the family name throughout his campaign.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: The state Department of Environmental Services issued an immediate boil-water order Wednesday for customers of the Rye Water District after samples detected E. coli bacteria. The department wrote in its advisory Wednesday: “All consumers are being notified by the system and DES staff is working with the system to resolve the situation.” The Rye Water District was beginning the process of notifying district customers Wednesday afternoon. District superintendent Arik Jones noted that the district had yet to determine ways to assist affected users, such as by providing them with bottled water. Rye residents are distributed water by three purveyors, according to Jones: the Rye Water District, the city of Portsmouth and the Aquarion Water Company. The Department of Environmental Services’ boil order affects Rye Water District customers living in town only, he said. “This does not affect Aquarion customers,” Jones said. “It does not affect anybody served by Portsmouth.” The Rye Water District services roughly 1,600 connections and about 4,000 total customers. Jones said the boil-water advisory does not include Greenland residents, whom the district serves using Portsmouth water.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lawmakers unveiled new legislation Thursday to rewrite the state’s firearm carry laws after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights. Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn’t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other “character of temperament” concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expert in the field of Indigenous art has been named as the executive director of the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture. Pollyanna “Polly” Nordstrand, who is Hopi, will take on her new role next month. She will oversee a team of curators, anthropologists and archaeologists who are responsible for the preservation and interpretation of objects and works of art that represent Native people from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. “It is an exciting time to step into this leadership position as MIAC envisions its place as a 21st century museum with new exhibitions and expanded partnerships with tribal communities,” she said in a statement. Nordstrand, selected following a national search, is coming from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, where she was its first curator of Native American art. In New Mexico, she’ll manage an anthropology library and archives as well as the Center for New Mexico Archaeology, the state’s archaeological repository. Nordstrand began working in the museum world around 1990 as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act came into effect. She said her approach to museums has been shaped by the increasing collaboration between tribes and institutions, and she has advocated for more equity and inclusion in museums.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions. The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby’s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state’s motion. Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts. The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn’t ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square. Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect. “My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Two history-making Black politicians and country music star Eric Church were among the six latest recipients of the state’s highest civilian honor announced Thursday. On Nov. 15, Gov. Roy Cooper will present the North Carolina Awards, which were created over 60 years ago to recognize significant contributions to the state and the country in several fields. Church, a native of Granite Falls, has received many Grammy nominations, among other industry awards. Other new recipients include U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, of Warren County, who was the first African American woman to represent North Carolina in Congress when she took office in 1992. She was also the state’s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington’s government by white supremacists.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: More than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosive materials have been recovered in a residence in northwestern North Dakota, authorities said Wednesday. Police said multiple chemicals and powders were also found in the apartment in Williston, located in the North Dakota oil patch near the Montana border. No arrests have been made, although police say they have identified a person of interest. Bomb squads from Williston, Minot and Bismarck were disposing of the explosive materials at the Williston landfill. The process was suspended Wednesday afternoon due to high winds and fire danger. Police said explosions could be heard in some parts of the city as the devices were detonated.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which a probate judge rejected a transgender woman’s request to correct her birth certificate, leading to a split in court rulings and guidance on the issue. Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge’s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman’s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio’s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said. The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 Tuesday to accept the Clark County case.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A district attorney debate took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the Republican candidate accused his Democratic opponent of being complicit in the disappearance and possible murder of two people. Kevin Calvey, an Oklahoma County commissioner, made the accusation toward the end of the hourlong livestreamed event. “Two Oklahomans are missing and may have been murdered because Vicki Behenna was willing to submit fake documents to a federal court to get her crooked client out of prison,” Calvey said to audible gasps in the auditorium. Behenna, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, denied the accusation. “It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Calvey would make these statements,” Behenna said. “He is a career politician who has created a false narrative for his own political gain. This is something politicians do. This is not something a district attorney does.” Earlier in the debate, the two clashed over who is to blame for the problems at the aging Oklahoma County jail and the prosecution of police officers for fatal shootings. Both questioned each other’s integrity and fitness for the job throughout what was their only scheduled debate. They agreed that the death penalty should be rarely sought and that possession of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in at least four counties – Douglas, Klamath, Lane and Columbia – have complained to local election officials about people knocking on their doors, questioning residents and looking for evidence of 2020 voter fraud. Klamath County Clerk Rochelle Long issued a statement last month after residents called her office asking if the group was from the elections office, KGW reports. “I wanted to make it clear they were not from our office,” Long said. “We don’t go door to door. We don’t ask you how you voted.” Long warned that people may seem official and identify as from an integrity group. Long couldn’t point to any one person or group responsible for the effort. Election officials across the country have received similar complaints about people going door to door hunting for proof the 2020 election was fraudulent. While ex-President Donald Trump continues to argue the election was stolen, a mountain of evidence shows otherwise. “What these folks are doing is simply out trying to gather data in an unofficial way, and then unfortunately we’re seeing people misusing that data to try and spread the big lie,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “The election in 2020 was safe and secure in all 50 states.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two supporters of then-President Donald Trump arrested after driving a Hummer with guns and ammunition to a site where votes were being counted in November 2020 were convicted of weapons charges Wednesday but acquitted of election interference. Prosecutors argued that Vets for Trump co-founder Joshua Macias and co-defendant Antonio LaMotta, both of Virginia, planned a mass shooting in Philadelphia as the outcome of the presidential election remained uncertain. However, Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons rejected that theory, finding the men guilty only of bringing weapons to the city without a permit Nov. 5, 2020. LaMotta is separately charged with federal misdemeanor offenses stemming from his alleged illegal entry of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Both men remain free on bail pending a scheduled sentencing in December, when they face a possible sentence of probation to 18 months in jail, defense lawyer William J. Brennan said. “The commonwealth has presented no evidence to show that they came here to interfere with an election,” Brennan, who represents Macias, said after the one-day nonjury trial. “They came, they stared at a building, they talked to some police officers, and they didn’t bother anybody.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island police departments are poised to spend $16million in state and federal grants to equip police officers with body cameras and cover the costs of managing and operating the equipment. The architects of the Statewide Body-Worn Camera Program announced the grant awards to 42 police organizations Wednesday as Rhode Island moved closer to a deployment of 1,773 cameras – roughly a camera for every front-line police officer, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha. “That is a lot of law-enforcement officers (who) will now have the tools to bring us into the century in which we are operating,” Neronha said. State police Col. Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. “Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,” he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin’s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. “Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission – proposed by Navigator CO2 – would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission’s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2’s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. “It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,” said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a “strong case” to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to “accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.” “It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,” he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver’s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an “intoxicant,” had glassy eyes and kept saying, “Yes, sir,” at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car – who was not named – said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker’s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman’s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker’s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker’s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn’t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party’s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning – that he took issue with the moderator. Owens’ absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn’t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people’s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah’s entire congressional delegation. “I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,” he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise’s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.\n\nVirginia\n\nDinwiddie: Three students and a teacher were taken to hospitals Wednesday after a fire broke out during a demonstration in a high school chemistry classroom, officials said. When the fire broke out in the classroom at Dinwiddie High School, the fire alarm was pulled, and all students were evacuated from the building, Dinwiddie County Public Schools officials said in a statement. A teacher was taken to a local hospital, and three students were taken to VCU Medical Center, officials said. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. One student was treated at the scene and released. The cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said. Students were dismissed early, and Thursday was designated an asynchronous learning day, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Poor communication, deception, bad judgment and a lack of leadership contributed to tension, violence and killings in Seattle in 2020, according to a review of the city’s response to racial injustice demonstrations that year. Seattle’s inspector general, Lisa Judge, released the 81-page review Tuesday. It focuses on 23 days in June, shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to protests across the U.S., The Seattle Times reports. Earlier reports by her office looked at the Seattle Police Department’s crowd control policies and on rebuilding community trust. On June 8, 2020, police abandoned the East Precinct building in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood in an attempt to defuse tension with protesters. The demonstrators used the opportunity to declare an eight-block “cop-free” zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The inspector general’s office concluded the occupation revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the city administration, led by then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, and police department, led by then-Police Chief Carmen Best. It also found police brass misled the public, exaggerated dangers posed by protesters to justify leaving the precinct, and employed a racist ruse in an apparent attempt to frighten and intimidate thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Students in kindergarten through 12th grade across the state have been invited to enter the First Lady Student Ornament Competition this fall. First lady Cathy Justice is asking all students to participate in the 18th annual event. It is open to students in public and private schools as well as those who are home-schooled. Students are asked to create a “Nutcracker”-themed ornament for a tree to be displayed at the Culture Center in Charleston during the holidays, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice’s office. There will be four divisions according to grade, and a winning class will be chosen from each division. The winning ornaments will be donated in January to the West Virginia State Museum. The four winning classes will receive a gift card to help buy supplies for their class. The ornaments and Christmas tree will be unveiled in early December in conjunction with Joyful Night. Entries may be mailed to Elizabeth Yeager, Department of Arts, Culture and History, The Culture Center, 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305. Include phone number, email, mailing address, teacher name, school and class. The ornaments must be received by Nov. 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials estimate the state’s wolf population currently stands at about 970 animals, demonstrating that a much-maligned February 2021 hunting season had little impact on the population as a whole. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Department of Natural Resources officials released their latest population estimates at a board meeting last month and said they estimate between 812 and 1,193 wolves currently roam the state, with 972 likely the best estimate. Conservationists feared that a February 2021 hunting season would devastate the population after hunters killed 218 wolves in just three days, about 100 more wolves than the DNR allowed. Conservationists and wolf lovers called the hunt a slaughter. But the new numbers indicate the season had little effect on the population, which stood at roughly 1,100 wolves before the hunt began. The DNR planned to hold another hunt in November 2021, but a Dane County judge placed that season on hold in October 2021. A federal judge this past February restored protections for gray wolves across most of the country, preventing states from holding wolf hunts. Wisconsin’s current wolf management plan, which dates back to 1999, calls for capping the population at 350 wolves. The DNR is working to update the plan but hasn’t released anything yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nGreen River: A new soda ash mining operation is planned near an existing site outside the city, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. A subsidiary of the Ciner Group, based in Turkey, plans its new Project West development not far from the Pacific Soda mine and said it expected to bring in up to 2,000 temporary jobs during construction, with 300 permanent positions once the mine is operational, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/05/deepening-drought-fish-sticks-around-pistol-pete-news-around-states/50805425/", "title": "Deepening drought, fish sticks around: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state has set a November execution date for a man convicted in the 1988 murder-for-hire killing of a pastor’s wife. The scheduled execution follows criticism over the state’s last two lethal injection attempts, including one that was called off after the execution team had trouble finding a vein. Kenneth Eugene Smith, 57, is set to die at Holman Correctional Facility on Nov. 17, according to a Friday order from the Alabama Supreme Court. Smith was sentenced to death for the killing of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett, a 45-year-old grandmother and pastor’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith was one of two men who were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. Elizabeth Sennett was found dead March 18, 1988, in the couple’s home in Colbert County. The coroner testified that she had been stabbed eight times in the chest and once on each side of the neck. The pastor killed himself a week later. Smith maintained it was the other man who stabbed Elizabeth Sennett, according to court documents. Smith was initially convicted in 1989, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 1992. He was retried and convicted again in 1996.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Acting state Revenue Commissioner Deven Mitchell has been chosen as the new chief executive officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. The announcement was made Monday by the fund’s board. The corporation said in a statement that the selection “is contingent on the successful negotiation of a salary and benefits package” and that a start date has not yet been set. Mitchell has called Alaska’s nest-egg oil wealth fund the state’s “trump card” as a renewable source of revenue, the Anchorage Daily News reports. His message to the board was that he would not chase short-term cash yields, as the fund has been invested for long-term growth. He also said he doesn’t see the CEO’s role as second-guessing investment decisions made by the corporation’s chief investment officer or as overriding his decisions. Earnings from the fund traditionally have been used to pay annual dividends to residents. Since 2018, earnings also have been used to help pay for state government. Mitchell last month stepped down as the state’s debt manager and executive director of the Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority when Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed him to be the acting Department of Revenue commissioner.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An abortion clinic has come up with a way for patients who can end their pregnancy using a pill to get the medication quickly without running afoul of a resurrected state law that bans most abortions. Under the arrangement that began Monday, patients will have an ultrasound in Arizona, get a prescription through a telehealth appointment with a California doctor, and then have it mailed to a post office in a California border town for pickup, all for free. While not as easy as before an Arizona judge ruled that a pre-statehood law criminalizing nearly all abortions could be enforced nearly two weeks ago, the process saves an overnight trip to a major California city with an abortion clinic. And it is more accessible than the previous workaround used by Camelback Family Planning in Phoenix, which was to have a doctor in Sweden prescribe the pills and a pharmacy in India mail them to Arizona. That could take up to three weeks. Ashleigh Feiring, a nurse at the clinic, said the cost of the pills will be covered by the Abortion Fund of Arizona, which is helping women pay for out-of-state access to abortions. Women can use a pill for an abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy. Pills and surgical abortions were legal until about 24 weeks until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June.\n\nArkansas\n\nNorth Little Rock: Authorities say three people have died after a fire early Tuesday at a North Little Rock apartment complex. The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. at an apartment near Shorter College, authorities said. North Little Rock Fire Department Capt. Dustin Free told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that three adults died in the blaze. The fire, which was extinguished by about 7 a.m., was contained to one apartment but caused the second floor of the building to collapse onto the first, Free said. “This was an all-hands-on-deck situation,” he said. “We work every day to save a life, but sometimes we are notified too late. The firefighters came in and tried to stop the fire aggressively.” The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The past three years have been the state’s driest on record, and officials said Monday that they’re preparing for the streak to continue. The official water year concluded Friday, marking an end to a period that saw both record rainfall in October and the driest January-to-March period in at least a century. Scientists say such weather whiplash is likely to become more common as the planet warms. It will take more than a few winter storms to help the state dig out of drought. Though it’s impossible to predict with certainty what the winter will bring, “we are actively planning for another dry year,” said Jeanine Jones, drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources. Jones spoke alongside state climatologist Michael Anderson about the just-completed water year. The water year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 so that the rainiest winter months are recorded together. Snow that falls in California’s mountains typically provides one-third of the state’s annual water supply, but last year snow levels were far below average by the end of the winter. The Colorado River, another major source of water for Southern California, is also beset by drought, threatening its ability to supply farmers and cities around the U.S. West.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man survived a bear attack in his own backyard when he fired at the animal and scared it away after it threw him to the ground, state wildlife officials said. The attack occurred Saturday night in the small town of New Castle, Colorado Parks and Wildlife area manager Kirk Oldham said in a news release. The man went into his backyard after hearing a noise and encountered the bear, which threw him to the ground, officials said. He then threw up an arm to protect his face while grabbing a gun with his free hand and firing three shots, they said. It’s unknown whether the bear was hit by the bullets. The man told Parks and Wildlife that he had seen the bear in his yard the previous two nights. Heavy rain made it difficult for Parks and Wildlife officers to find and follow a blood trail and bear tracks as they searched for the animal, the news release said. They were still searching Monday. The man, whose name was not released, was treated at a hospital for minor injuries to his hand and arm and bruising on his chest, the release said. It’s the second bear attack in the western Colorado town in the past three months as bears prepare for hibernation, Oldham said. In August, a bear charged a woman and swiped at her, lacerating her arm and back. She recovered, and a mother bear and cub were euthanized, The Denver Post reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by the Connecticut State Police Union in its challenge of a police accountability law that allows public disclosure of certain state trooper personnel files and internal investigation reports. At issue were documents in internal probes that end with no finding of wrongdoing. The union argued the 2020 state law violated the 2018-2022 troopers’ contract by stripping away its exemptions from state freedom of information laws and allowing such documents to be publicly released. Union officials say troopers oppose the law because it allows records involving unfounded allegations to become public, possibly tarnishing a trooper’s reputation despite no findings of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court did not say anything about the case in rejecting it among a host of others, as is typical. The decision upholds rulings by lower federal courts that upheld the state law. Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union, said the decision is going to have a chilling effect. Proponents of the 2020 law, which included many other reforms, said it answered the calls for reform, including accountability and transparency, after the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Elevated lead levels in water were found at nearly 50 schools, prompting the Delaware Division of Public Health to advise shutting off at least one school’s drinking water supply in New Castle. Water samples were taken from 25 locations at the Wallace Wallin School in the Colonial School District last year and on multiple occasions throughout the summer, with all but three coming back with elevated lead levels. The results prompted the school to shut off its drinking water supply throughout the building at the beginning of the school year and utilize bottled water while the state continues to test the water quality and determine a plan for remediation, said Ted Lambert, director of facilities for the school district. The Wallin School is one of 47 schools across the state that tested positive for elevated levels of lead, according to results released by the state last month. Wallin’s highest results were over 12 times the maximum acceptable level in a staff break room. Lead levels from a water fountain outside a classroom at the school came back nine times higher than acceptable levels. According to federal standards, acceptable levels of lead in water must be lower than 0.015 milligrams per liter; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes says there is no safe blood level for young children.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With an ambitious goal of ending generations of racial discrimination, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a plan Monday to boost Black homeownership, hoping to place 20,000 families into their own homes by 2030, WUSA-TV reports. “We know we want to add more homes, but we want to be intentional about making sure people can afford those,” Bowser said in the announcement at the Howard Theatre. According to a report gathered by the Black Homeownership Strike Force, only 34% of D.C.’s Black residents owned their own homes in 2019, compared to 49% of white residents. The task force pointed to a history of discriminatory practices that have prevented Black families from attaining property and generational wealth. Bowser’s plan attempts to correct both. “These recommendations are ambitious but are imminently doable if we all work together,” said Vanessa Perry with the Housing Finance Policy Center. The task force issued 10 recommendations including using the mayor’s allotted $10 million down payment to help families buy and maintain homes and rezoning neighborhoods to allow for more multifamily housing. “I am standing before you as a testament that homeownership is possible,” Brittney Freeman told the crowd at the Howard. “I am indeed my ancestors wildest dreams.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPolk City: A 21-year-old deputy appears to have been fatally shot by friendly fire from deputies with whom he was serving a warrant in central Florida early Tuesday, authorities said. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Deputy Blane Lane was shot in the left arm and chest at a trailer in Polk City while serving a warrant with three other deputies on a suspect wanted for failing to appear on a felony drug charge. Shots were fired after deputies discovered the suspect with what appeared to be a handgun pointed at them but actually was a BB gun. Two of the deputies fired their guns, and “the round that struck Lane came from one of their firearms,” the sheriff’s office statement said. The deputy, who Sheriff Grady Judd described as one of the youngest on the force, was taken to a hospital, where he died “despite valiant efforts,” the sheriff said. The suspect, Cheryl William, also was hit multiple times. She was taken to a hospital where she was in stable condition. She faces a felony second-degree murder charge, among other charges, the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office planned to hold a line-of-duty death funeral with full law enforcement honors for Lane.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The prosecutor investigating whether ex-President Donald Trump and his allies broke the law trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state is seeking search warrants in the case, a sign that the wide-ranging probe has entered a new phase. The revelation came Monday in a court order filed by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury seated to help the investigation. In an order sealing any search warrants and related documents from being made public, McBurney wrote that District Attorney Fani Willis’ office is “now seeking to obtain and execute a series of search warrants, the affidavits for which are predicated on sensitive information acquired during the investigation.” Disclosure of the information could compromise the investigation, McBurney wrote, “by, among other things, causing flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and intimidation of potential witnesses.” It could also result in risks to the “safety and well-being” of people involved in the investigation, he wrote. It wasn’t immediately clear who the targets of the search warrants are or whether any search warrants had yet to be approved by a judge.\n\nHawaii\n\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam: The commander of the task force responsible for draining fuel from a World War II-era storage tank facility that leaked jet fuel and poisoned Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year said Monday that he’s exploring ways to get community feedback. Rear Adm. John Wade told reporters at a news conference he may establish an advisory group, but he’s not sure yet what form it will take. He said getting input from the community will help him be more responsive. He said Hawaii’s elected officials told military leaders that it would be valuable for them to give the community a voice in their work. “I don’t have the structure yet. It’s still a work in progress, but I think it’s something that’s important,” said Wade, the commander of Joint Task Force Red Hill. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Wade’s appointment last month. In November, jet fuel spilled from a drain line at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, flowing into a drinking water well and then into the Navy’s water system serving 93,000 people in and around Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Nearly 6,000 sought medical attention for ailments like nausea, headaches and sores. The military put about 4,000 families in hotels for several months. Wade said he’s started reaching out to Hawaii’s congressional delegation and other local leaders.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge has ordered the state and its prison medical care provider to pay more than $2.5 million in legal fees to a transgender inmate who sued after she was denied gender confirmation surgery. The cost, however, will not come out of taxpayer dollars. Instead, it will be covered by Corizon Correctional Healthcare under a separate agreement with the state. Adree Edmo sued the state and the Idaho Department of Correction’s health care provider, Corizon, in 2017, alleging they were violating her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment by denying her gender confirmation surgery. Edmo identifies as female, but she had long been housed in the men’s prison while she served a 10-year sentence for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy. In her lawsuit, she asked a judge to order the state to allow her to change her name, provide her with access to gender-appropriate clothing, transfer her to a women’s correctional facility and provide her with gender-confirmation surgery. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled in 2018 that the state must provide Edmo with the surgery and said that continuing to deny the treatment would place her at risk of irreparable harm. The state appealed Winmill’s ruling, and it was two more years before she received the gender confirmation surgery, becoming the second person in the U.S. to undergo the surgery while incarcerated. She was transferred to a women’s prison to serve the remainder of her sentence and was released in 2021.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Cook County judge on Monday threw out convictions for eight more people whose cases were linked to a notorious former Chicago police sergeant who regularly framed people for drug crimes they didn’t commit. Judge Erica Reddick vacated the convictions and sentences of the men in response to motions filed jointly by their attorneys and the Cook County State’s Attorney Office. The action followed the dismissal of 44 convictions in April and brought to 237 the number of vacated convictions in recent years linked to former Sgt. Ronald Watts and his tactical unit, State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said. Watts, a Black sergeant, led a team that for nearly a decade until 2012 planted drugs or falsely accused residents of a public housing complex and others who were visiting or simply happened to be in the area. Watts and another officer pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing money from an FBI informant. Watts received a 22-month prison sentence. “Vacating these convictions provides just a fraction of relief for those who spent time in prison, away from their families, and we will never be able to give them that time back,” Foxx said. “We will continue to review these cases as we seek justice for all his victims.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: At the start of the pandemic, the number of people killed in homicides across the state as a result of domestic violence jumped 180%, as shutdowns and stay-at-home orders sometimes led to unintended consequences such as locking people in with their abuser. But while businesses, schools and workplaces have reopened, and building capacities have returned to normal, experts say domestic violence homicides have not decreased as much as they expected. In the past decade, Indiana has averaged 55 to 60 deaths from domestic violence annually, according to the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. From June 2020 to July 2021, domestic violence homicides jumped to 98. The coalition tracks such deaths through news media and advocacy organizations that report when a person dies as a result of domestic violence. It often means the numbers are much lower than reality, which makes the rising number of deaths recorded in the past two years more concerning. The coalition’s latest data show there hasn’t been a corresponding reduction in homicides from domestic violence as shelters returned to full capacity and social distancing requirements loosened. Seventy-seven people from 2021 from late June this year died in Indiana from domestic violence.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state board on Monday rejected claims for $1 million payments for 52 prison inmates who were given six times the proper dose of COVID-19 vaccines last year. The three-member State Appeals Board, which considers state legal financial obligations, unanimously denied the claims from inmates who received the extra doses in April 2021. The 52 inmates who each sought a $1 million payment were among 77 prisoners at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison who had been given overdoses of the Pfizer vaccine by prison nursing staff. The board – made up of State Auditor Rob Sand, State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen – accepted the recommendation of the Iowa attorney general’s office lawyers to reject the claims. The lawyers advised that under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, “the state is immune from claims arising out of administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.” The mistaken doses occurred after the vaccine was delivered in concentrate form that was supposed to be diluted with saline solution. Two nurses were fired after the incident. A spokesman for the union representing prison staff said the overdoses happened after the prison abruptly switched from using the Moderna vaccine to the Pfizer version.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Enrollment in the state’s public universities and colleges is on a downward trend that started before COVID-19 but surged as more teenagers have pursued other options after high school. Headcount enrollment, or the raw number of individual students across the Kansas Board of Regents system, decreased by 1% overall, according to the Regents’ count released Thursday. Meanwhile, full-time equivalent enrollment – calculated by dividing the total number of credit hours taken by 15 hours for undergraduates and 15 for graduate students – fell by a slightly lower amount of 0.9%. In a statement, Regents chair Jon Rolph, Wichita CEO of the Thrive Restaurant Group, said the board acknowledges the declines but is working as a system to reverse the trend. “Our system is taking decisive action to reverse declining enrollments, better serve students and ensure that our state has the workforce needed to grow the Kansas economy,” Rolph said. “Initiatives such as our general education package and implementation of student success initiatives will help our system serve and graduate more students.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: While the battle over a voter referendum that will determine the future of abortion rights in Kentucky has drawn considerable attention, it is not the only constitutional amendment on the ballot this fall that could have a large political impact on the future of the state. Constitutional Amendment 1 is a rather lengthy, 744-word ballot referendum that essentially would give more power to the General Assembly – letting legislators call themselves into a special session and potentially extending regular sessions to end later in the year. Currently, only a governor can call legislators into a special session, in which they may pass bills that are within the parameters set by the governor. The Republican supermajority that pushed for the ballot referendum wants to be able to initiate special sessions with legislation of their choosing, while Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear wants to retain this power in the governor’s office. Under the proposed amendment, the Legislature could be called into a special session by a joint proclamation of the House speaker and Senate president, though they could only meet for a maximum of 12 days per calendar year in such sessions. Kentucky is one of just 14 states in which only the governor can call the legislature into a special session.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An outspoken Christian conservative attorney has asked a federal appeals court to revive a pastor’s damage claims against state officials over long-expired COVID-19 restrictions. A federal judge this year dismissed minister Tony Spell’s lawsuit against Gov. John Bel Edwards and others over enforcement of the ban. Spell drew national attention for his flouting of the restrictions early in the pandemic at his church in Central, near Baton Rouge. One of Spell’s attorneys is Roy Moore, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice and U.S. Senate candidate, who insisted in arguments this week before a panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the state had no authority whatsoever to restrict church gatherings. Panel members appeared skeptical of that claim in arguments Monday. But they raised the question of whether Spell’s church was unfairly restricted, compared with other public gathering places, such as shopping mall food courts. “They have treated us differently,” Moore said. “But the basis of our argument is there is no jurisdiction to limit a church attendance.” Spell has had some legal victories in his fight with the state. Louisiana’s Supreme Court threw out state charges against him in May, ruling 5-2 that restrictions in place at the time violated Spell’s freedom of religion.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: The Kennebunkport Heritage Housing Trust, a local nonprofit organization whose mission is to build 25 affordable or “attainable” homes in town by 2025, has completed one neighborhood and is now actively seeking properties on which to build a second and third, according to Executive Director Larissa Crockett. Heritage Woods, the completed neighborhood, includes six new homes, all purchased and now occupied. One morning last month, Crockett stood on Briggs Way – named after Patrick Briggs, the president of KHHT – and said the new homes there are designed to accommodate the way people live today. “Inside, they have really bright, open, sunny, airy, shared spaces,” she said, looking at the duplexes and single homes in view. Tanya Alsberg and Jennifer Armstrong are an example of two people whom KHHT has helped attain their own home in Kennebunkport. In April 2021, Alsberg and Armstrong stood at the edge of an excavated, gravel-filled hole and dreamed. Now, at the very same site, they live in their own home, thanks to KHHT. They bought and moved into the place in February. “We’re kind of crazily happy,” Alsberg said. “Every single day, we do the happy dance. Now that we’re here, it has changed our lives. ... It’s a lovely home.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Johns Hopkins University scientist who created a website to track COVID-19 cases worldwide is the recipient of this year’s Lasker award for public service. The $250,000 awards, announced last week by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, recognize achievements in medical research. The public service award went to Lauren Gardner, an engineer who studies the spread of diseases. She worked with her lab team to develop the COVID-19 tracker as the coronavirus began spreading worldwide in January 2020. The dashboard became a key resource and now tracks global cases, deaths, vaccines and more. Through it all, the team has made the tracker freely available to the public. The dashboard set “a new standard for public health data science” and helped inform both personal decisions and policy, the Lasker Foundation said in a release.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former Northeastern University employee who said he was injured when a package he was opening on campus exploded last month was charged Tuesday with fabricating the incident. Jason Duhaime, formerly the new technology manager and director of the university’s Immersive Media Lab, was charged with “conveying false and misleading information related to an explosive device” and then lying to federal investigators, federal authorities said. “This alleged conduct is disturbing to say the least,” U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said at a news conference. “Our city, more than most, knows all too well that a report or threat of an explosion is a very serious matter and necessitates an immediate and significant law enforcement response, given the potential devastation that can ensue.” Duhaime told investigators the hard plastic case exploded when he opened it Sept. 13, causing “sharp” objects to fly from the case and injure his arms, but his arms only had superficial marks, and there was no damage to his shirt or signs the case had been near an explosion, investigators said. The case also contained a rambling yet “pristine” typed note full of misspellings and exclamation points that railed against virtual reality, referenced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and threatened to “destroy” the lab. And investigators found a word-for-word electronic copy stored in a backup folder on a university computer in Duhaime’s office – written just hours before he called 911.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A judge dismissed charges Tuesday against seven people in the Flint water scandal, including two former state health officials blamed for deaths from Legionnaires’ disease. Judge Elizabeth Kelly took action three months after the Michigan Supreme Court unanimously said a different judge acting as a one-person grand jury had no authority to issue indictments. Kelly rejected efforts by the attorney general’s office to just send the cases to Flint District Court and turn them into criminal complaints, the typical path to filing felony charges in Michigan. “Simply put, there are no valid charges,” Kelly said. Kelly’s decision doesn’t affect former Gov. Rick Snyder because he was charged with misdemeanors, and his case is being handled by a judge in a different Flint court. But he, too, was indicted in a process declared invalid by the state Supreme Court. In 2014, Flint managers appointed by Snyder took the city out of a regional water system and began using the Flint River to save money while a new pipeline to Lake Huron was being built. But the river water wasn’t treated to reduce its corrosive qualities. Lead broke off from old pipes and contaminated the system for more than a year. Separately, the water was blamed for an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, which typically spreads through heating and cooling systems.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two of the four former police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights during the May 2020 restraint that killed him were scheduled to begin serving their federal sentences Tuesday. The Bureau of Prisons typically would assign J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao to a federal facility, but authorities had not publicly said where they would go. They are scheduled to go to trial on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter later this month. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said it anticipated Kueng and Thao would be transferred into its custody for the trial, but further specifics were not provided for security reasons. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill issued an order Monday saying the sheriff’s office must provide the men with access to three sets of clothing for the trial – as well as for two hearings scheduled for later this week – further suggesting that they will be in local custody. Kueng, Thao and Lane were convicted earlier this year of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under former Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee for 91/ 2 minutes while handcuffed and facedown on the street. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Forty years after Mississippi University for Women started enrolling men, its president says the school should consider choosing a more inclusive name. Previous attempts to remove “women” from the name, including the most recent one in 2009, have brought strong backlash from alumni of the school, nicknamed the W. Men make up about 18% of the 2,700 students at MUW. In a letter to alumni, President Nora Miller said the university is creating a task force to examine a name change, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Miller said she received a letter in May from the Deans Council at the university, acknowledging the current name presents “challenges.” “I assure you, no matter what happens, we maintain our historic commitment to academic and leadership development for women, forever embracing our status as the first state-supported college for women in the United States,” Miller wrote in the letter sent Sept. 28. The president of MUW in 2009, Claudia Limbert, proposed changing the name to Reneau University to honor Sallie Reneau, who wrote to the Mississippi governor in the mid-19th century to propose a public college for women. That renaming effort fizzled amid opposition from outspoken graduates.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A $40 million tax credit package for farmers and other agricultural businesses neared passage Monday, when a committee voted to send the bill to the full state Senate. The bill was expected to come up for a final Senate vote Tuesday. The measure extends several agricultural tax credits that expired and creates some new tax credits, including breaks for gas stations that sell biodiesel and fuel with a higher percentage of ethanol. The legislation also would expand government loan programs for farmers in the state. The Republican-led Missouri Legislature passed a bill with similar provisions during the regular legislative session this year, which ended in May. But GOP Gov. Mike Parson vetoed the measure, citing a two-year sunset attached to the tax credits that he said was too short. He also said the bill unconstitutionally included a provision on recycled asphalt shingles, violating a rule against including multiple topics in the same legislation. Parson called a special session – primarily focused on cutting individual income taxes in the state – and tasked lawmakers with extending the agricultural tax breaks for at least six years. Lawmakers last week sent Parson a bill to cut individual income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge struck down as unconstitutional three laws that restricted voting in the state, saying there was no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that the 2021 Republican-sponsored laws ostensibly were targeting. The laws ended same-day voter registration, imposed new identification requirements on students and restricted third-party ballot collections. The restrictions were put on hold in April under a temporary injunction later upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. Election officials declined to say if they would appeal the latest ruling to the state high court. And with the election just over a month away, it’s uncertain if justices would render a decision before Nov. 8. Native American tribes that sued over the laws argued the student ID and ballot collection measures would hurt voters on remote reservations, where many people live far from polling places and are dealing with poverty and other challenges. Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, who oversees elections in the state, requested the voting measures last year as Republicans around the country changed voting laws in the wake of the November 2020 election. The moves followed claims made by ex-President Donald Trump and parroted by his supporters that the election was stolen.\n\nNebraska\n\nHalsey: Progress has been made in containing a large Sandhills wildfire where one firefighter died while fighting the flames, which also destroyed much of a popular youth campsite and threatened a small village, officials said Tuesday. The Bovee Fire in west-central Nebraska’s remote Thomas County was 30% contained Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team, which has taken over management of the scene. Favorable weather conditions, including high humidity, temperatures in the 60s and some rainfall, are helping fire crews contain the grasslands blaze that was sparked Sunday afternoon and ballooned to 15,000 acres, or about 24 square miles, within six hours. The fire destroyed the main lodge and cabins of the Nebraska State 4-H Camp, as well as an observation tower in the Bessey Ranger District of the Nebraska National Forest. Purdum Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief Mike Moody died Sunday after suffering an apparent heart attack while battling the fire, officials said. Officials ordered the evacuation of the nearby village of Halsey and shut down a stretch of Nebraska Highway 2 as smoke from the fire cut visibility. The highway was reopened by Monday. Officials have said the fire was “human-caused” but have not released details.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A $20,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever killed five wild horses in eastern Nevada late last year, the Bureau of Land Management announced Monday. BLM officials said the National Mustang Association pledged to double the previous $10,000 reward in the case. Authorities said five mortally wounded horses were discovered Nov. 16 in Jakes Valley, about 30 miles west of Ely. They said the horses all were located within 600 yards of each other about 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 50, and an aborted fetus was attached to one of the dead animals. The BLM is investigating and prosecuting the killings as part of the enforcement of the Wild Horses and Burro Act of 1971.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed COVID-19 mobile vaccination clinics and a home-based vaccination program. “As we move into the fall and winter, we want to make sure everyone has access to the updated COVID-19 booster doses that better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variants,” Patricia Tilley, the state’s director of Public Health Services, said in a statement Tuesday. Three mobile vaccination vans are available to provide free COVID-19 inoculations, both primary series and updated booster doses. Public and private clinics will be available statewide. The home-based program visits any part of the state to provide free COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses to those individuals who are unable or have difficulty leaving their home or have been advised by a medical provider that their health or an illness could worsen by leaving their home. The programs are funded through the American Rescue Plan and will run through March 2023. Groups can schedule a mobile vaccination clinic at on-sitemedservices.com/van or by calling (603) 826-6500, and residents can make an appointment for a home-based COVID-19 vaccine or a booster dose at on-sitemedservices.com/vaccine or by calling (603) 826-6500.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Assembly approved a revised version of a state child tax credit Monday, fixing an error in the legislation that would have delayed payments for two years. The Legislature passed the program in June, and Gov. Phil Murphy signed it into law, providing a refundable credit of up to $500 per year for each child under the age of 6. The program was a response by Democrats to soaring costs of living and closer-than-expected state elections last fall. But a drafting error in the initial legislation meant the credit could not be claimed until the end of the 2023 tax year, and families would not get the benefit until 2024. Monday’s vote by the Assembly moved the eligible tax year forward, so the credit will be available next year. The state Senate approved the fix last week. The program will cost the state $135 million to $156 million annually, according to a state fiscal analysis released last week. The credit is $500 per child for families earning up to $30,000 a year. The benefit decreases by $10 for every $1,000 increase in yearly family income, until it reaches a minimum of $300 per child for a household earning up to $80,000, according to the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Pete’s Most Wanted Salsa, a new product bearing the image of New Mexico State University mascot Pistol Pete, celebrated its launch last week with a party at La Posta de Mesilla, and the university says more branded products will soon be joining a growing family of licensed NMSU merchandise. “There’s a realm of possibilities out there, and as long as it’s a good-quality product, I don’t see why this thing won’t keep expanding,” NMSU athletics director Mario Moccia said. Sales of NMSU-licensed beer, wine and whiskey are reportedly robust. Precise data was unavailable, but non-apparel licensed products – including the alcoholic products but also its other consumable and non-consumable items such as lawn chairs and tents – totaled approximately $116,700 in the last fiscal year. And the university’s licensing company stated in a recent report that NMSU ranked second among college institutions with licensed alcoholic products, including the first collegiate-branded spirit, Pistol Pete’s Six Shooter Rye Whiskey. Moreover, NMSU ranked fifth in sales of consumable licensed products among colleges and universities, according to the Collegiate Licensing Company/Learfield Licensing Partners, which licenses university-branded products\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Giant tents for temporarily housing migrants arriving in the city are being moved to an island off Manhattan from a remote corner of the Bronx, after storms raised concerns about flooding at the original site. Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday that the city’s humanitarian relief center will now be on Randall’s Island, which sits in the waters between Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. It’s connected by five bridges to the three boroughs, and people can take buses or walk off the island to reach the city’s subway system. The center’s tents had been put up in a parking lot at Orchard Beach, in the northeast part of the Bronx on Long Island Sound, where access to public transportation is limited. Images online showed water ponding at the site following rainfall over the weekend. In a statement announcing the change, Adams said while the city could have made the original location work, moving the center “is the most efficient and effective path forward.” The city’s plan for Orchard Beach had been met with concern by immigration advocates, who cited its inaccessibility among other reasons, and that concern extended to the new location. “The city must look to other solutions instead of tent cities, where our clients will be isolated, vulnerable to extreme weather, and far from public transportation and other critical services,” the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The State Board of Elections directed county election officials Monday not to engage in signature matching when reviewing absentee ballot envelopes this fall after a judge rejected the GOP appeal of a state board ruling prohibiting the practice. According to a directive sent to county election directors from the board’s legal counsel Paul Cox, the judge’s ruling maintains the status quo outlined in state law, which requires that all absentee voters fill out their ballots in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. Absentee ballot request forms in North Carolina must also include a date of birth and either a driver’s license number or the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. The North Carolina Republican Party had filed motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the state board from enforcing its declaratory ruling that prevented county election officials from comparing signatures on absentee ballot request forms and return envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Superior Court Judge Stephan Futrell ruled from the bench Monday afternoon, denying the party’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preventing the use of signature matching in the 2022 general election, state board spokesperson Pat Gannon said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A trial has been set in a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that allege the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The bench trial is scheduled for June 12, 2023. A bench trial means the verdict is up to the judge alone. The lawsuit filed in February by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe alleges that North Dakota’s new legislative map violates the Voting Rights Act. The Legislature during its special session last fall approved the map, based on updated census data. The map includes the new state House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argues the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the non-reservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleges the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. A federal judge in July dismissed the state’s argument that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. Tim Purdon, an attorney for the tribes, said about half of the 14-member GOP-led redistricting committee will be called as witnesses in the trial. He would not name them.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The nation was shocked when a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim was forced to obtain an abortion in Indiana after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. But in the months since, court records detailed at least two other minors who traveled out of state for abortions because Ohio banned doctors from performing the procedure after cardiac activity was detected. New data from the Ohio Department of Health offers some insight: In 2021, 538 children ages 17 and younger legally obtained abortions in Ohio, including 57 who were younger than 15 years old. That represents 2.5% of the 21,813 abortions performed in Ohio last year. The state does not track how many abortions were performed on victims of rape and incest. The age of consent in Ohio is 16 years old. The Ohio Department of Health report offered a snapshot of abortion access in Ohio before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and the state’s six-week ban took effect. The “heartbeat bill” is now on hold, blocked temporarily by a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge. The number of abortions performed in Ohio increased by nearly 6% in 2021, the second year in a row of increased abortions. Of the 21,813 abortions performed in 2021, 20,716 were for Ohio residents, and 1,097 people came from other states.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Human Services has implemented a 25% rate increase for providers who work with some of Oklahoma’s most vulnerable individuals as part of the agency’s push to eliminate its 13-year waiting list for developmental disability services. DHS on Saturday bumped its provider reimbursement rates to increase pay for a variety of medical professionals, including nurses, speech therapists, group home employees, direct care staffers who help developmentally disabled Oklahomans, and those who help low-income seniors. An official from a Sallisaw-based provider that serves Oklahomans with intellectual and developmental disabilities said this is the largest one-time rate increase nationally. Sheree Powell, government liaison at Sequoyah Enterprises Inc., said the reimbursement rate increase is key for providers to recruit and retain the best employees as businesses across the state have increased wages due to the pandemic and related worker shortage. The Legislature this year earmarked $32.5 million in new appropriations for DHS to clear its developmental disability services waiting list. Roughly one-third of that funding will go toward the provider rate increase. The boost brings hourly wages from about $9.50 to $12, DHS Interim Chief of Staff Samantha Galloway said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A jury has awarded a racial justice demonstrator more than $1million in a federal lawsuit she filed against the city in 2020 accusing officers of violating her civil rights. Eleaqia McCrae, a Black woman, sued the city and the police department, accusing police of intentionally targeting Black people with deadly force during the protest, which followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police officers in May 2020. The jury found McCrae proved that Officer Robert Johnston shot her in the eye and chest with rubber bullets and violated her “Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to excessive force.” McCrae said the bullets caused permanent vision loss and a chest injury. The jury also found she did not prove by “preponderance of the evidence” that Johnston violated her First Amendment right to lawful assembly or that he committed battery against her. She was awarded $250,000 in economic loss and $800,000 in non-economic loss, the jury verdict documents said. McCrae’s attorney, Kevin Brague, said in the lawsuit that McCrae attended a demonstration May 31, 2020, and after nightfall, people unrelated to the march arrived and began throwing objects. McCrae said she, her sister and a friend were kneeling at the front of the march when she was shot twice.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A judge has barred enforcement of an executive order signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last week banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. Common Pleas Judge Joshua Roberts on Monday ordered Philadelphia “permanently enjoined” from enforcing the order after a legal challenge, citing Pennsylvania state law that prohibits any city or county from passing gun-control measures, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The Gun Owners of America, on behalf of several state residents, filed a lawsuit immediately after Kenny’s order, the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits. Attorneys for the city had cited its role as a property owner managing its facilities, saying that distinguished the order from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. Andrew Austin, who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he was gratified by the court’s quick action. But he said it was “in large part because the law is so explicit: The city is not allowed to regulate possession of firearms in any manner.” “It is unfortunate that the mayor and city are willing to waste their time and taxpayer money on these type of ‘feel-good’ measures,” Austin said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With the “Superman Building” as a backdrop and an unsheltered woman surrounded by her belongings just yards away, more than 50 protesters gathered at Burnside Park on Monday to demand that Gov. Dan McKee declare a state of emergency and take more action to provide immediate shelter to Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness. “It’s your friends. It’s your neighbors. It’s your relatives. These people are not a separate category of human beings. They’re people who need help,” said Eric Hirsch, a Providence College professor who’s spent three decades advocating for people without housing. At last count, there were 405 people living without shelter in the state, not factoring in others who are staying with family and friends, said Hirsch, co-chair of the state’s Homeless Management Information System Steering Committee. The protest came as McKee and state Secretary of Housing Josh Saal participated in Crossroads Rhode Island’s Celebration of Housing to highlight “record investments in housing.” The event touted $12 million in state and federal money for the development of Crossroads’ Summer Street Apartments in Providence, a 176-apartment complex that will provide current residents of the Crossroads Tower with one-bedroom units that include private bathrooms and full kitchens.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Every year, law enforcement agencies across the state turn in crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a voluntary basis. The optional nature of this self-reporting can leave gaps when comparing crime data from the FBI to local agencies. “You likely have seen news stories where a crime was solved or an investigation was supported or a missing person was found. It was a crime analyst who connected those dots,” said Michele Covington, executive director of USC Upstate’s Greenville programs and an associate professor of criminal justice. “When you see crime trends, and an agency is able to trend downwards, there’s usually an analyst behind that.” The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on the U.S. criminal justice system, compiled a report of which agencies fully reported, partially reported, or neglected to report crime data for the 2021 calendar year. Eighty-five percent of South Carolinians saw their jurisdictional law enforcement agency fully report 12 months of 2021 crime statistics to the FBI, despite only 30% of agencies in the state fully reporting. The largest agencies in the state by population coverage not to fully report were the York County Sheriff’s Office, Charleston Police Department and Aiken County Sheriff’s Office. Most of the major agencies missing data were located in the Midlands and Lowcountry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Native Americans who plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota receive on average 11 years longer in prison than their white counterparts, according to an analysis and investigation of court records spanning 10 years. But prosecutors and judges called into question the sample size and said several factors go into sentencing decisions, such as criminal histories and the specific nature of the crime. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader pulled data from the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, filtering by charged convictions made by offenders who were Native American. The data only captures those who pleaded guilty and/or avoided a trial, reflecting the majority of convictions in the state during the past decade. The data also excludes those who were given life sentences. A total of 84 offenders pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota during the past 10 years, according to the data. Of those cases, 44% were white, 32% were Native American, 16% were Black, and 7% were Hispanic or Latino. Four of the 84 received a life sentence, according to the data. None of the four were Native American. White people convicted of first-degree manslaughter on average were sentenced to 35 years in prison, Native Americans to 46, Black people to 40 years and Hispanics to 42.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that derailed a federal dam during an epic battle over Endangered Species Act protection in the 1970s, is no longer considered imperiled, officials announced Tuesday. The fish held up construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee for more than two years as biologists and others fought to protect its only known habitat, the free-flowing Little Tennessee River. The battle, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court and beyond, is still sometimes cited as an example of environmentalist overreach, although the reality is much more complicated. The dam eventually was built, with snail darters collected and transplanted into other rivers. They were also later discovered in several additional streams. Snail darters went from being considered an endangered species in 1975 to a threatened species in 1984 as they continued to recover. Three years ago, the Center for Biological Diversity, Jim Williams and Zygmunt Plater petitioned to remove the fish from federal protection altogether. Williams is the biologist who listed the snail darter as endangered. Plater is the attorney who sued to protect it. The U.S. Department of the Interior on Tuesday announced the snail darter’s official removal from the federal list of threatened and endangered wildlife.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man accused of killing 22 elderly women in the Dallas area and stealing jewelry and valuables has been linked by DNA evidence to one of the deaths, a prosecutor said Monday. Billy Chemirmir, 49, is on trial for capital murder in the death of 87-year-old Mary Brooks. It’s Chemirmir’s third trial. His first trial, in the smothering death of 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris, ended in a mistrial last November when the jury deadlocked. He was retried and found guilty in April and sentenced to life without parole. If convicted in Brooks’ death, he’ll receive a second sentence of life without parole. Prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin said in opening statements that while presenting evidence in the deaths of Brooks and Harris, he would also show that DNA links Chemirmir to the death of 80-year-old Martha Williams. Chemirmir has maintained his innocence. His attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf Monday but declined to make an opening statement. His arrest was set in motion in March 2018 when Mary Annis Bartel – 91 at the time – told police that a man had forced his way into her apartment at an independent living community for seniors, tried to smother her with a pillow and took her jewelry.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Five years after they allegedly snuck into a pig farm and recorded video of themselves smuggling two piglets away from what they said were inhumane living conditions, two animal rights activists are set to face a jury trial this week despite protests about a mistake made during Monday’s jury selection process. Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, the two remaining defendants facing charges from the 2017 incident, could face more than 10 years in prison on charges of felony burglary and theft. They were part of a group of five people who reportedly recorded a series of disturbing videos at Circle Four Farms in Milford, Utah, where owner Smithfield Foods was operating one of the country’s largest pig farms. The other three people charged in the case struck plea deals earlier, but Hsiung and Picklesimer pursued their cases, saying they hoped they could raise awareness about animal cruelty at factory farms and potentially set new precedent if a jury determined they were justified in taking the piglets because they feared for the animals’ lives. Jury selection in the trial was set to start Monday at the 5th District Courthouse, but there was controversy even before the trial could begin after defense lawyers protested they had not received information on prospective jurors and asked for a mistrial.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The state Health Department has confirmed five cases of Legionnaire’s disease in Franklin County, including one death, but the source of the infection is unknown, it said Tuesday. The cases were reported between Aug. 12 and Aug. 29 and appear to be clustered in the St. Albans area, the department said. The death was in a person in their 70s, it said. The general risk to residents is very low: Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria do not get sick, the Health Department said. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Air-conditioning units for large buildings, hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains or plumbing systems are common sources of infection, officials said. Symptoms, which start two to 14 days after exposure, can include a cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath and headache, the department said. The disease is not contagious and almost never spreads from human to human, the department said. People with symptoms who live or work in Franklin County are encouraged to contact a health care professional. Those age 50 and older who smoke or formerly smoked, have chronic lung disease, or have a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Higher prices at the grocery store mean more and more people in the area are relying on food banks to feed themselves and their families. The Thomas Jefferson Area Food Bank has been packed, its warehouse holding rows of pallets of canned goods stacked to be packed into kits for seniors or distributed to members of the community who need emergency food. As of late, it’s also held lines of people. “This is the one day this week where it hasn’t been crowded,” said the food bank’s partner engagement manager, Joe Kreiter. Rising food costs are being blamed. Prices swelled 11.4% between August 2021 and August 2022, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index report Michael McKee, CEO of the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, which partners with the Thomas Jefferson Area branch, said the organization served 110,000 people in July, an increase from 106,000 in June. He expects the upward trend to continue. High rent in Charlottesville and Albemarle County and a lack of affordable child care often leave little room in a family’s budget, McKee said. Single mothers, seniors and children are the three groups who depend on food-assistance programs the most. Food banks used to provide emergency food assistance, but they’ve become a regular source of food for low-income people, Kreiter said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amazon has sued the state’s labor agency following disputes with regulators over citations and fines imposed on the company for worker safety issues. In the lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court for the Western District of Washington, Amazon asked a judge to prohibit orders from the Washington Department of Labor & Industries to remedy any types of workplace hazards during the company’s pending appeal over the citations. Amazon argued in the lawsuit that the agency has not proven any of its allegations and that requiring companies like it to remedy alleged hazards before that happens violates the due process protections under the 14th Amendment. Matt Ross, a spokesperson for the agency, said the department is aware of the lawsuit and will review it along with the state’s attorney general’s office. The agency had said in March it inspected an Amazon warehouse in Kent, Washington, and found workplace processes that “create a serious hazard for work-related back, shoulder, wrist, and knee injuries.” It said workers were expected to perform tasks, such as lifting and carrying items, at a fast pace that heightened the risk of injury. Amazon’s warehouse injury rate has been higher compared to other warehouses, which CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged earlier this year and said the company was attempting to improve.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A voucher program that would provide parents state money to pull their children out of K-12 public schools is blatantly unconstitutional and would disproportionately affect poor children and those with disabilities, a lawyer representing parents who sued the state argued Tuesday in West Virginia’s Supreme Court. The Hope Scholarship Program, which was passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature last year and would have been one of the most far-reaching school choice programs in the country, “negatively and intentionally” impacts West Virginia’s system of free schools, lawyer Tamerlin Godley told justices during oral arguments. “It decreases enrollment and thus funding,” said Godley, who is representing two parents of children who receive special education supports in West Virginia public schools. “It utilizes public funding for subsidizing more affluent families that have chosen private and home-schooling, and it silos the poor and special needs children who cannot use the vouchers.” Signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice last year, the program was set to go into effect this school year but was blocked by Circuit Court Judge Joanna Tabit in July.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Legislature took mere seconds Tuesday to reject Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ call to create a way for voters to get a chance to repeal the state’s 1849 abortion ban, even as Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voiced support for letting the people decide the issue. The move by Evers is the latest by Democrats in the battleground state to turn the Nov. 8 election into a referendum on abortion. But Evers’ GOP opponent, Tim Michels, Johnson and other Republicans are focusing instead on crime and public safety in arguing that Democrats have failed to keep the state safe. “What people want to talk about (is) reducing crime, they want to talk about reducing inflation, they want to talk about getting more money in their pocket, and they want better schools in Wisconsin,” Michels said at a campaign stop in Baraboo when asked for his reaction to the Legislature’s action. A Marquette University Law School poll last month showed both the state’s governor and U.S. Senate races to be about even, while a majority of voters support abortion rights. The Wisconsin Senate convened for all of 15 seconds, to gavel in and adjourn, the special session called by Evers to pass a constitutional amendment that would create a pathway for an up-or-down vote on the state’s abortion ban.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An owl at the Teton Raptor Center has tested positive for avian influenza, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. It’s the first case of the deadly disease this fall in Teton County, and the great horned owl was euthanized humanely, the center said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/13/show-choir-haiku-stairs-teton-bighorns-news-around-states/41224419/", "title": "Show choir, Haiku Stairs: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The mayor on Tuesday criticized a state law forbidding the majority-black city from removing or altering a Confederate monument as well as a new proposal to fine cities $10,000 a day for violations. “We’re saying protect something that is a slap in the face to black residents of this city, that are 74% of this city, the fourth-blackest city in America. You want to have a statue that is commemorating relegating black people to being property and slaves,” Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin told reporters. Birmingham faces a $25,000 fine for erecting a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot obelisk honoring Confederate veterans. The mayor made the comments in Birmingham on the same day lawmakers in Montgomery debated a proposal to increase the fines for violating the law.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A veteran long-distance musher has won the 2020 Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race. Brent Sass crossed the finish line Tuesday afternoon in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, to win the 1,000-mile race, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Sass, 40, also won in 2015 and 2019. “This was a slog, there’s no doubt,” he said at the finish line. “I’ve run 13 Yukon Quests and broke trail 10 times more (in this one) than in any of the other races put together.” Michelle Phillips of Tagish Lake, Yukon, finished second four hours after Sass. Sass got down on the ground and rolled in the snow with one of his wheel dogs before standing up and working his way down the line, petting each dog. He fed them all steak chunks, starting with leaders Morello and Woody, the latter of whom had never been a leader before, Sass said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a 2016 state law barring anyone but a family member or caregiver from returning another person’s early ballot will remain in effect while the state appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The order from the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals means the law banning so-called ballot harvesting will remain in force through the March 17 presidential preference election. Only Democrats are voting in that election after the Republican Party chose to forego a primary. The appeals court last month found the law and a separate practice of throwing out ballots if a voter went to the wrong precinct have discriminatory effects on minority voters. The ruling also said the ballot harvesting ban was enacted with discriminatory intent. State Attorney General Mark Brnovich plans to ask the high court to overturn the decision.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A black state lawmaker plans to introduce legislation next year aimed at changing police tactics after officers drew guns on her and another black politician who had called 911 to report they were being harrassed. At a news conference Monday, Democratic state Rep. Vivian Flowers, from Pine Bluff, recalled the Feb. 3 incident outside a Little Rock fundraiser for state House candidate Ryan Davis, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Flowers and Davis said they were talking to each other on the sidewalk when two white residents questioned why the two politicians were in the neighborhood. They and one of the residents told police they then heard a gunshot. The resident also confirmed she had yelled at the pair to leave and subsequently told them to “drop dead.” Officers arrived with their guns drawn on Davis and Flowers, according to a police report.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: It’s a girl. The Los Angeles Zoo announced this week that its staff have determined the sex of a Western lowland gorilla that was born Jan. 18. The baby had spent three weeks “bonding and clinging tightly to her mother,” a zoo statement said. The baby, who doesn’t yet have a name, is the first gorilla born at the zoo in more than 20 years. She’s the first child for 25-year-old N’djia, who came to the zoo in 2018 from the San Diego Zoo as part of a breeding project. The father is a 32-year-old named Kelly. Western lowland gorillas are considered critically endangered because of poaching, diseases and habitat loss. “Every birth is a celebration, both in zoos and in the wild,” said Candace Sclimenti, curator of mammals at the L.A. Zoo. “We are thrilled about this baby because she will provide additional attention to this critically endangered species.” Mom, dad, baby and two other gorillas can be viewed at the park’s Campo Gorilla Reserve.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. immigration officials are asking a federal judge to force the city to turn over information about three men accused of crimes who are subject to deportation after Denver refused to comply with its order to do so. In a continued escalation of the conflict between federal officials and so-called sanctuary cities, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed a complaint in Denver federal court Thursday asking that a judge enforce administrative subpoenas it issued to the Denver’s sheriff department last month for information such as addresses, identification and arrest reports on the two Mexican nationals and a Honduran. Accusing ICE of seeking the information for “political reasons,” Denver said it would not comply with the subpoenas unless a judge determined they were appropriate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Police will soon begin distributing clean syringes and glass pipes in what are being called “harm reduction kits” to residents who use drugs. The kits, to be offered to those discharged from the New Haven police lockup, are also expected to include information about care and treatment options, Brillo pads to use as filters for smoking crack cocaine, sterilizing pads, cotton, condoms and a tourniquet, among other items, city officials said, according to The New Haven Register. “While many think that the primary responsibility of police is to protect and enforce the laws, for us in New Haven, the primary responsibility is the protection and the preservation of life,” police Chief Otoniel Reyes said. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, commissioner of the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said New Haven is the first department in the state to distribute such kits.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Federal authorities have filed a lawsuit seeking judgment against an Italian shipping line for damage allegedly caused by one of its ships to a jetty along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Delaware said the costs of repairing damage to the jetty could exceed $3 million. Defendants in the lawsuit include the Grimaldi Group SpA and its Atlantic Container Line shipping company. Also named in the lawsuit were Capt. Colleen Moran and the vessel Atlantic Conveyor. Federal officials said the Reedy Point North Jetty was damaged in February 2017 when it was hit by the ship as it was being piloted by Moran. The jetty is a navigation structure at the confluence of the canal with the Delaware River.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton’s bill on D.C. statehood Tuesday, sending H.R. 51 to the House floor for the first time since 1993, WUSA-TV reports. The vote was split down party lines, 21-16. The passage of the D.C. Democrat’s bill marks the first time in 27 years that members of Congress will vote on the possibility of the district becoming the 51st state, giving D.C. one House member and two senators. “We emphasized today what supporters of statehood already knew coming in: D.C. statehood is constitutional, we have a plan in place to make it happen, and it is the only way to fix the injustice of denying more than 700,000 Washingtonians a vote in Congress,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “It is fitting that this historic vote happened in the midst of Black History Month, for I dare say – achieving D.C. statehood would be black history.”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Two dolphins have been found with gruesome, life-ending injuries along the Gulf Coast in recent weeks, and federal authorities are offering a reward of up to $20,000 to help solve the case. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one dolphin was discovered dead in waters off Naples late last week. Officials said the animal had received bullet or stab wounds – possibly both. Also last week, the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge found a dolphin with a bullet in its left side along Pensacola Beach in the Panhandle. Experts believe the two deaths might have stemmed from humans feeding the animals. When dolphins learn to associate people and boats with food, they can expose themselves to dangerous situations. NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information that leads to those responsible. Anonymous tipsters can call 1-800-853-1964.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A firefighter is set to be suspended next week for actions he took while trying to save a 95-year-old woman from a blaze. Atlanta Fire Department Capt. Daniel Dwyer was among the firefighters responding to a house engulfed in flames last June when he entered the home by himself, located resident Sally Skrine on the ground and pulled her to safety, video from the scene showed. Skrine later died from her injuries, news outlets reported. But a “notice of final adverse action” prepared last week by the department ordered Dwyer to be suspended without pay for four days, citing his decision to enter the home alone as a breach in the safety policy of “no freelancing,” according to the complaint obtained by WXIA-TV on Monday. An official for the firefighters’ union told WAGA-TV that Dwyer made a “split-second” decision to go in and save Skrine without waiting for reinforcement because of the intensity of the fire.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city has requested proposals from private organizations interested in providing managed, fee-based access to its famed Haiku Stairs. The city announced Tuesday that any interested party would need to restore, maintain and operate the Oahu staircase that attracts 4,000 people annually. “Haiku Stairs is a significant asset to the people of Oahu and it should be better managed, with a safe and controlled entry point that doesn’t intrude on the surrounding neighborhood,” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said in a statement. The stairs are part of a World War II-era military installation that has been officially closed to the public for decades. The attraction is still visited daily by hiking enthusiasts, and area residents have complained that some hikers trespass and vandalize their properties. The staircase has also caused injuries and costly rescues of hikers who ignore security guards and trespassing signs to climb it, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men who combined spent nearly 40 years in prisons for crimes they didn’t commit testified Tuesday in favor of state legislation that would compensate the wrongly convicted. Christopher Tapp and Charles Fain told lawmakers on the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee that they left prison with no resources after DNA evidence proved their innocence. Both had been convicted of murder. “Being in prison is as horrible as you can imagine, and being there when you are innocent is that much worse,” Tapp, who spent 20 years in prison, told lawmakers. Fain spent more than 17 years incarcerated, mostly on death row, where he spent 23 hours a day in a small cell. The legislation brought forward by Republican Rep. Doug Ricks would pay $60,000 a year for wrongful incarceration and $75,000 per year on death row. The committee won’t vote on whether to send the legislation to the full House until Thursday.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois Education Association on Tuesday released a report that shows Illinoisans do not have high regard for public schools outside their own communities. The association indicates in its State of Education report that 1,000 Illinois residents taking part in a poll gave a grade of “C-” to public schools, although they gave their local public schools an “A” or “B” grade. The report indicates more than half of those polled believe teachers are paid too little. Many also said they wouldn’t advise family members to become teachers. There are about 2,560 teacher positions open in Illinois. “The State of Education Report tells us we have a long way to go when it comes to fixing the teacher shortage,” IEA President Kathi Griffin said. “The people of Illinois have spoken. We need to invest in our public schools, give our educators a louder voice at the table and truly put our students first.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBristol: A traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit on life in rural America will be on display at northern Indiana’s Elkhart County Historical Museum until mid-March. The exhibit, “Crossroads: Change Comes to Rural America,” includes photos depicting farms, forests, small towns and rivers from Alaska to New Hampshire. Visitors can also hear residents talk on video about their experiences. Museum officials have added local touches for display alongside the exhibit, including information about a family that settled in Elkhart County in 1858 and changes in agriculture, according to the South Bend Tribune. The display runs until March 15. Admission is free. Museum director Julie Parke said museum officials are excited to “spark conversations we think are important to have about the intersection of urban and rural, the tensions between agricultural and manufacturing.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Students in the Hawkeye State could soon be singing and dancing their way to meet their physical education requirements. A bipartisan bill advanced by a Senate subcommittee Tuesday would add “show choir” to the list of extracurricular activities that could excuse high school students from physical education class, just as athletics does. “This is a sport unto itself,” said Sen. Liz Mathis, D-Hiawatha, among the bill’s sponsors. “The physical exertion – no doubt about it, it should be exempt.” Currently, Iowa law requires students to participate in physical education classes each semester they are in school. But students involved in athletics can get exemptions. If the bill became law, high school principals could excuse students from the PE requirement if they’re participating in show choir for the time equivalent to PE classes and if the student needs to enroll in classes that wouldn’t otherwise be available to them.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A study reveals that universities in the state pay their instructors less compared to schools of the same size with similar programs in other states. The latest figures from the Kansas Board of Regents show state university instructors who are full-time and spend at least half their time teaching made on average $13,796 less than instructors at comparable universities in the 2019 fiscal year. In other words, instructors made 86 cents for each dollar their out-of-state peers earned. The previous year, Kansas faculty made 84 cents for every dollar paid to their peers, KCUR-FM reports. Educators say state funding for universities has fallen behind rising education costs, and they say smaller paychecks make it harder to recruit and retain talented professors. Wichita State’s provost, Rick Muma, blamed the pay gap on state funding.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Knox: The Army has selected Fort Knox for a new corps headquarters, which will bring 635 additional soldiers to the central Kentucky post, federal officials announced. The Army plans to activate V Corps Headquarters by October 2020, officials said. “Fort Knox was chosen based on time required to facilitate activation of the headquarters, cost, the ability to facilitate future expansion if required and minimizing disruption to other, current missions at the installation,” according to a letter of notification from the Pentagon, The News-Enterprise reports. The move came at the request U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Rand Paul and U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, according to a joint statement from the three Tuesday that said the headquarters is needed for national defense and to support U.S. forces and operations in Europe. In addition to boosting the post, the headquarters is expected to have a positive effect on nearby towns.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A lawsuit seeking to return federal protection to the real bears that inspired teddy bears has been thrown out by a federal judge. The people and environmental groups who sued in 2018 didn’t provide any evidence to back up their claims that they would be hurt by the decision to remove Louisiana black bears from the “threatened” list, wrote District Judge John Bates of Washington, D.C. Bates didn’t rule on the merits of the case itself, only on whether the plaintiffs had legal standing to sue, attorney Paula Dinerstein of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said Tuesday. That group, the Sierra Club, the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper organization, Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West and individual plaintiffs are considering their next step, Dinerstein said. Louisiana black bears are the largest and rarest of 16 American black bear subspecies. President Teddy Roosevelt’s refusal to shoot one in 1902 inspired the first “teddy’s bears.” The subspecies once roamed Texas and Mississippi but now is found only in a few areas in Louisiana. It was put on the “threatened” list in 1992 and removed from it in 2016.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal regulators don’t believe a state plan to reduce risk to endangered whales goes far enough, and that means fishermen could face more restrictions. Maine officials submitted a plan to the federal government designed to meet a requirement to better protect rare North Atlantic right whales from entanglement in lobster fishing gear. The whales number only about 400 and can die if ensnared in the gear, which is used to trap one of Maine’s best known and most valuable natural resources. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified the state in a Jan. 10 letter that its proposed package of measures would result in no more than a 52% reduction in risk to the whales. The required goal is 60%, said the letter, which was written by Michael Pentony, regional administrator for NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service’s Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Police have recovered a statue taken from the Salisbury Zoo, with the help of an accidental hero canine. The pooch who found the statue, Ghost, was honored by Mayor Jake Day and the Salisbury City Council for his valiant deed. Ghost was near the Salisbury City Dog Park with his owner when he found the missing statue. Ghost then alerted his owner, who notified police of its discovery. The statue of a great blue heron was announced stolen last week in a tweet from the Salisbury Police Department. Capt. Rich Kaiser, a spokesperson for Salisbury Police Department, said the statue was returned to the zoo with “some damage.” For his superb detective skills, Ghost is being honored with the “Goodest Boy Award.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A ballot question that would let convenience stores and other food stores in the state sell beer and wine is drawing criticism from some researchers and substance abuse coordinators who say it could result in more crime and alcohol consumption. The question would let local authorities issue licenses allowing food stores to sell wine and malt beverages to be consumed off the premises. The new licenses would be in addition to existing licenses issued for the sale of alcoholic beverages and would not include the sale of hard liquor. David Jernigan, a professor of health law and policy at the Boston University School of Public Health, said there is a close tie between the easy availability of alcohol and crime. He said because Massachusetts – and Boston by extension – has limits on the number of alcohol outlets, the relationship between alcohol outlets and violent crime is weaker than in many other cities.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A white woman who used racial slurs as she attacked a black car salesman at a dealership has avoided a jail sentence despite a tearful appeal from the victim for time behind bars. Shelly Hueckel of Nashville, Michigan, was sentenced Tuesday to two years of probation by Judge Paul Sullivan. Hueckel was convicted in December of misdemeanor assault but cleared of ethnic intimidation, a felony. Before the Kent County judge handed down Hueckel’s punishment, Terrence Smith tearfully asked that the maximum sentence be imposed. The misdemeanor conviction is punishable by up to 93 days in jail. “I was … assaulted for no reason and called a (N-word) over and over again at that point. I took every ounce of strength in me to restrain myself from defending myself, and I did it: I stood tall through an incredibly hard moment,” Smith recalled. Hueckel allegedly struck Smith repeatedly, knocking off his glasses while shouting racial slurs.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCollegeville: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is launching a new program to encourage anglers to switch to lead-free fishing equipment as a way to save the state bird, the loon. The campaign was created with money from the federal government’s settlement with BP over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service awarded Minnesota agencies more than $6 million from the settlement to help support its loon population after researchers found traces of oil and the chemicals used to disperse the spill in the feathers, eggs and blood of birds in Minnesota. About $1.2 million will go toward the public awareness campaign called “Get the Lead Out” over the next three years. While some states have total or partial bans on the use of lead sinkers and jigs, Minnesota’s lead-free campaign is voluntary.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State senators clashed Tuesday before passing a bill to let the state auditor see tax returns to verify the income of people enrolled in Medicaid or other public assistance programs. Supporters said the plan is designed to ensure people are not receiving benefits if they earn too much money. But critics questioned the timing and said Mississippi is looking for waste in the wrong place. The debate happened days after Auditor Shad White announced that the former director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services and five other people had been indicted on charges tied to misspending of millions of public dollars that should have been spent to help poor people. White, a Republican, called it the largest public embezzlement case in Mississippi in at least 20 years. “The timing is awful,” said Republican Sen. Josh Harkins of Flowood, sponsor of the bill that passed Tuesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson: State legislators debated a measure Tuesday that would ban public colleges and universities from offering in-state tuition to students living in the U.S. illegally. Schools in the state now risk losing state funding if they offer students with “an unlawful immigration status” anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. That’s because of restrictions that lawmakers have placed on state funding in recent years through the budget process. Suburban St. Louis Republican Sen. Bob Onder’s bill would enshrine that budget policy in law. Democratic Sen. Lauren Arthur, who worked as a Kansas City teacher before joining the Legislature, said she previously taught students brought to the U.S. illegally as children who call Missouri home and questioned the public benefit of discouraging those students from staying in the state amid a labor shortage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and several religious groups, including the Missouri Catholic Conference, also spoke out against the proposal Tuesday.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The state has revoked 85 specialty license plates that have not been chosen or renewed by at least 400 drivers in the previous year, the state Motor Vehicles Division said. The license plates discontinued in January include some whose extra fees raise money for high school booster clubs, several high schools, animal shelters, youth sports leagues, environmental groups and other nonprofit groups. The Bitter Root Humane Association has 377 plates on the road, said treasurer Linda Williams. So for being 23 plates short, the association will lose the approximately $7,000 the license plates brought in, Williams told ABC Fox Montana. The Humane Society of Western Montana faces the loss of about $10,000 in annual funding, said development manager Katie Hofschield. A law passed last year allows people with discontinued plates to keep them until it’s time to renew their registration.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Lincoln-Lancaster County Genealogical Society needs a new home for its 8,000-piece collection. The collection has been housed at the Union College library for the past 30 years. But the college has decided to turn the collection space into a student tutoring center, said Michael George, the genealogical society president. The society has until mid-March to find a new place, or the collection will go into storage. “If all of our stuff is in boxes, it takes away from one of our core missions,” society board member Prudence Sadler told the Lincoln Journal Star. The collection includes items such as a 1924 Tobias telephone directory, the book “Abie to Yutan: Nebraska’s pictorial history” and an index to the marriage records of Lancaster County from 1866 to 1893. Sadler said the society wants to keep the collection local but has looked at locations outside of Lincoln and Lancaster County.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Air National Guard Base has proposed replacing its 25-year-old fleet of big turboprop planes that can carry troops or cargo with newer aircraft that are better for their firefighting capabilities. The base in Reno has proposed replacing its eight C-130H aircraft with the newer C-130J model, KTVN-TV reports. “They have a lot of hours on them, and we have a difficult time coming up with maintenance parts at times in the supply chain,” said 152nd Airlift Wing Commander Col. Jacob L. Hammons. Multiple senators have sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett requesting the planes to help firefighting efforts throughout the western U.S. The newer aircraft model provides crews with better performance and safety, Hammons said. “You’re low to the ground, you’re at heavy weight, and you’re at slow air speeds, all in a constrained environment where there is fire present,” Hammons said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nClaremont: A deer stranded on a chunk of ice on a river that caused bystanders a lot of anxiety made it across the water, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said Tuesday. Col. Kevin Jordan said an officer saw deer tracks coming out of the Sugar River onto the bank in Claremont early Tuesday. “I don’t think people are aware that deer are pretty good swimmers,” Jordan said. For hours Monday, passers-by watched the deer sitting on the ice and wondered if she could be rescued. Jordan said a rescue attempt was risky, as it could stress out the deer, and an attempt to tranquilize the animal might startle her. “She’ll jump in the water, and we’ll lose her,” he said. Officers decided to wait the situation out, hoping that with the cover of night and fewer people around, the deer would feel safe enough to swim out on her own. As for how the deer got on the ice, Jordan said she likely was pursued, probably by coyotes.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFort Lee: The state’s political scene needs, among other things, better sexual misconduct prevention training to stop widespread misogyny, according to nearly a dozen witnesses who spoke Tuesday at the first public meeting of a roving panel addressing the mistreatment of women. The Workgroup on Harassment, Sexual Assault and Misogyny in New Jersey Politics session held Tuesday in Fort Lee was the first of what are expected to be at least three public meetings. The panel is chaired by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg and included Democratic Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, and 11 other women from across New Jersey politics. Weinberg set the panel up after a December report on NJ.com that cited dozens of instances of misconduct, including groping, unwanted advances and even assault. Tuesday’s hearing lasted over two hours and heard from nine women and one man.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A plan to spend $100 million to fix dams throughout New Mexico – the state with the highest percentage of high-hazard dams in the country – passed its first test Tuesday amid an urgent call to upgrade the facilities over worries about the loss of life. The New Mexico Senate Conservation Committee voted 9-0 to move along a measure that would add funding to address the state’s dam infrastructure that advocates say is in dire need of repairs. Sen. Pete Campos, D-Las Vegas, said the state had no choice but to get started soon on fixing dams or risk a tragedy in the future. He said the $100 million request would only cover about a third of the cost of fixing the state’s dams. Sen. Bill Soules, D-Las Cruces, said the state should spend the money to fix its dams while it has revenue from an oil and gas windfall. “We may not have the money later,” Soules said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: As jail populations continue to plummet across the state, New York’s governor is proposing to allow counties to opt into regional lockups instead of solely operating their own facility. The legislation from Gov. Andrew Cuomo is one in a long list of policy proposals included within his state budget proposal, on which lawmakers continue to hold hearings this week. The governor’s office says the legislation will allow counties to lower costs by not maintaining their own separate facility. Newly released data from the state shows that New York’s total jail population plunged by 30% from January 2019 to last month. Most of that decline has come in the past few months, something reform advocates say is tied to the rollout of a state law that eliminates cash bail for the wide majority of misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The fate of a Confederate statue torn down by protesters was thrown back into uncertainty Wednesday when a judge overturned a settlement by the University of North Carolina’s governing board that gave the monument to a Confederate heritage group along with money to preserve it. Judge Allen Baddour ruled in Orange County court that the Sons of Confederate Veterans didn’t have standing to bring the lawsuit that led to the hastily arranged deal that gave them possession of the statue known as Silent Sam, along with $2.5 million to maintain it. He vacated the settlement and dismissed the underlying lawsuit brought by the SCV. Critics had questioned how the deal was quietly struck between the Confederate group and the UNC Board of Governors in a way that allowed the lawsuit and settlement to be filed in quick succession and then approved by Baddour just before Thanksgiving.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The U.S. Commercial Service says that excluding oil, the state exported more than $2.2 billion worth of products last year, which is nearly an 11% decrease from 2018. The state’s export decline was led by soybeans and machinery, including farm implements. Soybean exports decreased 55% between 2018 and 2019. Data shows North Dakota exported about $30 million worth of soybeans in 2019, down from $66.9 million the year before. The value of machinery dropped from $652 million to $488 million, a 25% decrease. Some exports of crops saw an increase, including the state’s durum, wheat and corn. Crude oil, the state’s largest export, made up about 67% of North Dakota’s in total exports in 2019, down slightly from 2018.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A fiscal analyst has warned lawmakers that a proposal to make it harder to raise the state income tax could harm Ohio’s bond rating. At issue is a proposed constitutional amendment that would impose a supermajority requirement in both chambers for the General Assembly to raise such taxes. States with similar supermajority requirements have seen their credit ratings lowered, Zach Schiller, research director at the nonpartisan organization Ohio Policy Matters, told the Senate Ways and Means Committee Tuesday, according to Gongwer News Service. “It would constrain the state’s ability to fund critical programs, limit policymakers’ options during recessions and undermine the democratic process,” Schiller said. Lower bond ratings can affect the rates at which governments can borrow money, among other things.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt and Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell unveiled the state’s new brand Wednesday after a months­long creative process that started last summer. The colorful new logo and tagline that implores people to imagine all of the state’s possibilities will appear on state agency websites, tourism efforts and new “Welcome to Oklahoma” signs. In future years, the logo also may appear on license plates. A handful of new welcome signs at various entry points to the state will be installed starting Thursday. The colorful elements of the logo, inspired by nature, form a circle intended to highlight Oklahoma as a hub at the center of America. The tagline “Imagine that,” which also will be used on promotional materials, attempts to convey what makes Oklahoma unique as a state that defies expectations, provides opportunities and lets people dream about their potential, Pinnell said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: People seeking winter vistas of the north Oregon coast will need to find them elsewhere as Ecola State Park near Cannon Beach has been closed indefinitely. The park is closed south of the Indian Beach day-use area, after a large section of the Crescent Beach trail slid over the cliff, damaged the entrance road and disconnected the park’s main waterline over the weekend, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department said. The affected section of road is an old repair made of compacted gravel, damaged as the hillside beneath the road gave way. That same landslide also cut off all running water in the park. Visitors at Ecola on Sunday were all escorted out safely, officials said. The state parks department said visitors can still access the park’s Indian Beach day-use area via the Tillamook Head Trail but can’t travel farther south into the park.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A court this week will consider a legal challenge by three transgender women to a two-decade-old state law that prohibits people who have committed serious felonies from ever changing their names. Commonwealth Court will hear oral arguments Thursday in the lawsuit brought by plaintiffs who live as women but are unable to change their masculine first names because of a 1998 state law designed to prevent fraud. Pennsylvania law requires anyone convicted of a felony to wait at least two years after completion of their sentence to apply for a name change, and those convicted of certain more serious felonies are permanently barred from changing their names. People have a fundamental right to control their own names, and that can’t be overridden by a legal presumption that felons are engaging in fraud when they seek a name change, the women’s lawyers wrote in a court filing in May.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Most of the state’s municipalities have websites that do not use the domain name for government entities, according to a WJAR-TV report. The television station reviewed websites for Rhode Island’s 39 municipalities and found that 29 of them use a domain name that does not end in .gov. Cybersecurity experts recommend using .gov for security and so that residents know they are on a legitimate government website. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, when told of the findings, said she would contact the 29 municipalities and offer federal funding that has been allocated to Rhode Island to make the switch. She said it’s a good investment because of the risk of cyberattacks. The Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns said municipalities would welcome the opportunity to make their websites and networks more secure, especially if the program helps defer costs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster tapped a retired U.S. Army major general Tuesday to be his second choice to run the state’s new Department of Veteran’s Affairs. Maj. Gen. William Grimsley of Beaufort came highly recommended before McMaster chose state Rep. Bobby Cox to lead the agency in December. So after Cox was found ineligible under a state law preventing a lawmaker to run an agency created during his term, the governor said Grimsley was an easy second choice. Grimsley, 62, served in the Army for 33 years, finishing his military career as senior commander at Fort Hood, Texas, and chief of staff of the United States Strategic Command. Grimsley is currently president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Foundation and a coach and trainer at strategic planning firm Broomfield Creek.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Native American groups opposed to the Keystone XL oil pipeline told state lawmakers Wednesday that Gov. Kristi Noem’s plan to restore criminal penalties for encouraging riots would result in peaceful protesters being silenced. The Republican governor proposed updates to the so-called riot-boosting laws after a judge struck down efforts last year to allow the state and counties to prosecute disruptive demonstrations against the pipeline. Several Indian tribes in the state opposed the bill, putting a strain on the governor’s relationship with the tribes. The new proposal sailed through a House committee on Wednesday, as Native American groups testified, prayed and protested at the Capitol. Lester Thompson, chairman of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, said the First Amendment already protects a person’s to protest, and the law would put protesters in a defensive position, vulnerable to laws that do not make it clear what constitutes violence during a riot. “It could be me raising my fist,” said Derrick Marks, a committee member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe. “Is that considered riot boosting? Is that considered violence?”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A proposal to include feminine hygiene products during the state’s annual sales-tax holiday faced resistance Tuesday from lawmakers concerned about the lack of limit on such purchases. The legislation is the latest evolution of a push to eliminate the so-called tampon tax on items such as tampons and menstrual pads. The bill would allow these products to be tax-free during Tennessee’s three day weekend when certain goods – ranging from $1,500 computers to $100 clothing items – can be purchased tax-free. The weekend is held the last Friday in July, when most families are preparing for the new school year. Republicans inside the GOP-dominant Statehouse have pushed back against proposals to remove the “tampon tax.” “I would think since it’s a sales tax holiday, there’s really no limit on the number of items anybody can purchase,” said Sen. Joey Hensley, a Republican from Hohenwald. “I don’t know how you would limit the number of items someone could purchase.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Lawyers for the suspect in a shooting at a Walmart that left 22 people dead waived a federal bond hearing and the reading of the indictment Wednesday, as survivors of the attack teared up and consoled one another. Patrick Crusius, of Allen, Texas, is already being held without bond on state charges. His attorneys waived a reading of his 90-count federal indictment in which he was charged with hate crimes in the shooting, which targeted Latinos in the border city of El Paso. He has also been charged with capital murder under Texas state law. Attorney David Lane asked a federal judge to waive a bond hearing for Crusius, 21, who is already being held without bond on the state charges under tight security at the El Paso County jail. Crusius stood silently by Lane and showed no emotion as his attorney took questions from a federal judge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State lawmakers say they won’t consider proposals that could censure or recall U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney following his vote to convict in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson said the GOP caucus decided not to advance either proposal following a “robust debate” behind closed doors. Instead, Wilson will be presenting a citation thanking the president for his administration’s work on issues “critical to Utah.” The citation will also urge Congress to put the contentious process behind them. Utah Senate leaders have already signaled support for that ide, but little appetite for publicly rebuking Romney. Romney returned to Utah the day after his vote, which set off a wave of national GOP anger, to explain his decision to legislative leaders. That seemed to mollify some concerns from lawmakers, one of him had introduced a resolution to publicly rebuke him.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott has vetoed a bill that would have increased the state’s minimum wage. In a message sent to lawmakers, the Republican governor said raising the minimum wage to $12.55 an hour by 2022 from the current $10.96 could end up decreasing employee hours and increasing the costs of goods and services. “I believe this legislation would end up hurting the very people it aims to help,” Scott said in a statement issued by his office. When the minimum wage bill passed the House, it did not have enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto. State Sen. Tim Ashe, a Democrat and progressive who supported the increase, said the governor’s decision “wiped out nearly $5,000 in income” for Vermonters struggling to get by. “Make no mistake, this is a battle between the Governor and the tens of thousands of Vermonters who don’t seem to fit into his hollow affordability slogan,” Ashe said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state House and Senate passed sweeping energy legislation Tuesday that would overhaul how utilities generate electricity and, supporters say, move the state from the back of the pack to the forefront of renewable energy policy in the United States. Critics, though, warned that the legislation, drafted privately by a group that included industry representatives and environmental advocates, strips state regulators of some oversight and leaves ratepayers on the hook for what could be excessive costs. The measure, called the Clean Economy Act, lays out a plan to get Virginia to 100% renewable generation. The House version would demand that goal be met by 2045, and the Senate’s version sets a deadline of 2050, in line with a goal Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam set in an executive order in September.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state House has passed a measure that would ban race-based discrimination against hair texture and hairstyles. The measure passed on a bipartisan 87-10 vote Wednesday and heads to the Senate for consideration. If passed by the Senate and signed by Gov. Jay Inslee, Washington would join three other states with such a ban: California, New York and New Jersey. The bill amends the Washington Law Against Discrimination so that the term “race” includes traits historically associated or perceived to be associated with race, including hairstyles like afros, braids, locks and twists. Under the measure, people could file claims with the state’s Human Rights Commission if they believe they were discriminated against because of their hair.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Educators would have to teach students about suicide prevention under a bill passed Wednesday by the state Senate. Lawmakers voted 33-0 to approve the bill, which would require that teachers, students and other school officials get training on suicide prevention and awareness. Sen. Ryan Weld, a Brooke County Republican, sponsored the measure and described a “grim” set of statistics on the rising rates of youth suicide. Figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show suicide was the eighth leading cause of death in West Virginia in 2017, the most recently available data. Nationally, suicide was the second leading cause of death among people between the ages of 10 and 24. The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates for consideration.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly approved a bill Tuesday that would make bestiality a felony. Having sex with an animal is a misdemeanor under current law. The bill would create a new crime punishable by up to 121/ 2 years in prison. Sentences would vary depending on the circumstances, such as whether the animal dies and whether a child is present or coerced into sex with an animal. Convicts would have to register as sex offenders. The measure’s author, Republican Sen. Andre Jacque, introduced the same bill last legislative session after a Town of Eaton man was convicted of molesting a horse. The Assembly passed the bill, but it died in the Senate. This time around, the Senate approved the bill on a voice vote in October with no debate. The Assembly passed it on a voice vote late Tuesday evening, also with no debate. The measure goes next to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ desk.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State officials plan a series of public meetings to help them determine how to protect the last bighorn sheep in the Teton Range. They’re seeking recommendations from the public on an issue that could lead to closing off more areas in western Wyoming to backcountry skiing. Research suggests backcountry skiing displaces sheep from some of their best habitat, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Bighorn sheep used to be abundant in the Tetons but now number only about 100. They’re divided into two subpopulations that don’t mingle. Wyoming Game and Fish Department wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch says the agency seeks specific recommendations from the public on how to help the sheep. The public meetings will be held in February, March and April.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/13"}]}

There's a reason you may be unfamiliar with the 24-year-old if you only follow the NBA: He hasn't played a game in the NBA this season.\n\nIn fact, McClung has only appeared in two NBA games in his career, with the Chicago Bulls in December 2021 and Los Angeles Lakers in April 2022. McClung has spent this season in the Philadelphia 76ers' organization, playing for the G League's Delaware Blue Coats.\n\n\"I'm super grateful for this opportunity,\" McClung said afterwards. \"I think a lot of guys in the G League probably deserve this light that I just got. I'm very appreciative and I hope I represented well for them, and I really appreciate the NBA giving us this opportunity.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the NBA's new slam dunk champ:\n\nWho is Mac McClung?\n\n\"It kind of feels ever since the beginning I was the underdog, even when I was younger,\" McClung said after the dunk contest.\n\nMcClung has been known as a prolific dunker since his standout career at Gate City High School (Virginia). During his time at Gate City, he toppled state scoring records held by the likes of Allen Iverson and JJ Redick and won the 2018 BallisLife All-America Game Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nMcClung attended Georgetown University for two seasons, where he averaged 14.2 points per game, before transferring to Texas Tech. He averaged 15.5 points per game in his lone season with the Red Raiders in 2020-21. He eventually declared for the NBA draft, though he went undrafted. He split 2021-22 bouncing between the Lakers and Bulls organizations, but was still named G League Rookie of the Year after averaging 21.6 points, 7.6 assists and 6.6 rebounds per game. McClung has averaged 19.1 points in 18 games in the G League this year.\n\n\"I'm not really worried what other people think, good or bad. I'm just staying the course. My goal is to make an impact in the NBA, and I'm just going to keep working until that happens,\" McClung said.\n\nDame Time!:Trail Blazers' Damian Lillard wins 3-point contest at NBA All-Star Saturday Night\n\nHere's how he won the Dunk Contest on Saturday night:\n\nFirst round\n\nThe Pelicans' Trey Murphy III got the action started and got teammate Jose Alvarado involved on his first dunk – Alvarado \"stealing\" the ball and throwing an alley-oop pass off the backboard to Murphy for a 360 dunk. Murphy placed third with his dunk.\n\nThe Knicks' Jericho Sims showed off his vertical as he put his arms through the hoop. He received the second-highest score.\n\nKenyon Martin Jr. required a few attempts, but eventually put down a nice dunk. Still, he received the lowest score on the first pass.\n\nMcClung posted the best score of the first round, recording 50s across the board for his dunk. He took the ball out of the hands of a man who was sitting on another squatting man's shoulders, leaping over both to stuff the ball home after touching it off the backboard.\n\n\"That's (what) I was banking on, the slow-motion video. I knew (touching the backboard) would be hard to see, but I'm glad everybody saw it after the slo-mo,\" McClung said.\n\nMartin brought out his father, longtime NBA standout and former first overall pick Kenyon Martin, for his second dunk that involved a unique ball. He required a few attempts but eventually had another nice dunk.\n\nMurphy showed off his athleticism with extreme ball movement on his second dunk.\n\nSims' second dunk involved a prop envelope he attached to the net. When he opened it, it revealed the No. 50 (Sims was given a 47.8 by the judges).\n\nMcClung nearly recorded another perfect score on his second dunk, getting 50s from all but one judge.\n\nFinal\n\nMurphy kicked things off by throwing a windmill down after throwing the ball to himself.\n\nMcClung answered by jumping over someone and dunking after a double-pump, earning another round of 50s from the judges.\n\nMurphy's second dunk was nice, but McClung answered in emphatic fashion. Sporting his high school jersey, McClung closed down the competition with another 50. He did Vince Carter's iconic \"It's over\" motion after the dunk – \"I loved Vince Carter,\" McClung said afterward – and received the trophy minutes later.\n\n\"I think something took over me. I don't know what that was. But I wasn't really even thinking in the moment,\" McClung said of his reaction. \"It was just kind of something that happened, to be honest with you.\"\n\nMcClung said he'd be willing to return to compete next year. \"If you guys will have me, I'll be back,\" he said on the court.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/basketball/2023/04/26/two-way-contract-nba-g-league/11531621002/", "title": "What is a two-way contract in the NBA? Here's how Mac McClung is ...", "text": "Mac McClung made history as the first G League player to participate in the NBA dunk contest.\n\nFour days before his dunk contest victory, news broke that McClung had signed a deal that put him on the roster of the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nBut McClung is also on the roster for the Delaware Blue Coats. In fact, his dunk contest victory significantly boosted ticket sales revenue for the 76ers' G League affiliate team, according to Blue Coats executives.\n\nSo what's going on here? Here's how McClung and other early-career players can be on two rosters at once.\n\nMaking history:G League player Mac McClung wins slam dunk contest at NBA All-Star Saturday Night\n\nWhere will Ja Morant's NBA career go? The choice is up to him.\n\nWhat is a two-way contract?\n\nIn the NBA, a \"two-way contract\" is a relatively new option that allows developing players to simultaneously be rostered on an NBA team and its G League affiliate. Each NBA team can have two players on this type of contract, according to the G League.\n\nAs of March 2023, an NBA team is permitted to have 15 players on official contracts during the regular season, plus two players on two-way contracts, expanding each team's roster to 17 player slots, according to the NBA.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean more reserves suited up on the bench. An NBA team can still only have 15 \"active\" players listed for each game, according to the NBA.\n\nThere are also limitations to being a two-way player. Only players with three or fewer years of NBA service are eligible for two-way contracts, and players in two-way contract slots are only eligible to be active in a maximum of 50 games with their NBA team, according to the G League. These players spend the rest of the season with their team's G League. If their team does not have an affiliate, they will be sent to play with another team's affiliate, according to SB Nation.\n\nOnly two NBA teams, the Portland Trail Blazers and the Phoenix Suns, do not have G League affiliates for the 2022-2023 season, according to the G League.\n\nNBA players of the future:Top prospects competing in the 2023 NCAA Tournament\n\nNBA players under two-way contracts\n\nHere are the NBA players under two-way contracts for the 2022-2023 season as of March 2023, according to the NBA G League:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/02/20/nba-all-star-weekend-game-takeaways/11305187002/", "title": "NBA All-Star Weekend takeaways: Did Mac McClung revive dunk ...", "text": "SALT LAKE CITY – NBA commissioner Adam Silver made an interesting comment during his All-Star Weekend news conference.\n\n“This has been the single-most competitive season in our history, as a measure of team records in terms of the closeness, measured by wins and losses around the season,” he told reporters. “I think that’s a reflection of the incredible quality of play we have in this league.”\n\nIn the wide-open Western Conference, nine games separate second place from 13th place, and nine teams are .500 or better.\n\nAnd even though Denver is five games ahead of second-place Memphis, Phoenix’s acquisition of Kevin Durant and Dallas trading for Kyrie Irving have made the West even more compelling. Golden State might be in the final days of its dynasty and LeBron James could miss the playoffs for a second consecutive season – something he hasn’t done since his first two seasons in the league two decades ago.\n\nNEXT STOP:Russell Westbrook plans to sign with Clippers after contract buyout from Jazz\n\nWON'T HAPPEN:Charles Barkley is thought-provoking but wrong about impending NBA lockout\n\nIn the East, Boston is in first place but just a half-game ahead of Milwaukee, three games ahead of Philadelphia and five games ahead of Cleveland. At least 12 teams in the East are competing for a spot in the playoffs.\n\nThe final seven weeks should be fun.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the 2023 NBA All-Star Weekend:\n\nLoad management remains hot topic\n\nAt just about every NBA All-Star Weekend event you attended, load management was a burning topic. Now, if a player is injured, that’s different. But as The Athletic’s Joe Vardon noted, in a recent two-game stretch in Cleveland, Golden State’s Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins (injured) and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo didn’t play.\n\nWhile Silver acknowledged some fan discontent, he said, “The suggestion I think that these men in the case in the NBA somehow should just be out there more for its own sake, I don’t buy into. … Our stars are not missing that many games for resting. I mean, we have injuries. I think we would all agree that’s a separate issue. But sort of as a measure of single games missed, it’s not that bad.”\n\nNational Basketball Player Association executive director Tamika Tremaglio said players want to play, intimating players are told by training staffs that they should take a game off.\n\nBehind the scenes, the NBA and NBPA are discussing potential solutions, such as financial incentives and tying All-NBA, MVP and other major awards eligibility to games played. “We hear it from our fans when players aren’t there. We think we can do a better job, but we don’t have a specific solution yet,” Silver said.\n\nMac McClung re-energizes dunk contest\n\nMac McClung, the 24-year-old dunking sensation who is on a 10-day contract with the Philadelphia 76ers, gave the slam dunk contest a much-needed boost with his aerial moves. Aaron Gordon and Zach LaVine did similar in 2016.\n\nBut it also took a guy battling to stick on a roster who has appeared in just two NBA games and none this season. Can McClung jump-start the event so that it regains its status as a must-see Saturday night event during All-Star Weekend, and will he return for next year’s event?\n\nSome of the NBA’s biggest stars and best dunkers do not participate, and Memphis’ Ja Morant and Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards are on record saying they won’t participate in the dunk contest. There already is a financial incentive, including $100,000 for the dunk contest winner.\n\n“There are currently provisions in the CBA that address participation in All-Star Saturday Night. They don’t require players to dunk. And I’ve understood that,” Silver said. “I think that it would be an awkward position to say to a player: You must enter the Dunk Contest.\n\n“Interestingly enough, the dunk contest, despite the criticism I hear, has continued to be the most popular event on Saturday night. …\n\n“I recognize that in the old days, there was a bit more of a tradition of certain superstars who wanted to participate in the Slam Dunk.”\n\nFuture of the NBA on TV\n\nSilver said that once the league and National Basketball Players Association reach a deal on a new collective bargaining agreement (which is expected), the NBA will turn toward negotiating a new TV deal. The current nine-year, $24 billion deal with ESPN/ABC and Warner Bros. Discovery Sports expires after the 2024-25 season, and the league will seek a lucrative deal, impacting players’ salaries and the value of franchises.\n\nWho will the league's TV partners be? It has been reported that NBC could jump back into NBA TV rights, but a more likely scenario is a new deal with ESPN/ABC and Warner Bros. (TNT, NBA TV) plus a new streaming option with a company like Amazon or YouTube. High-ranking officials from ESPN, Warner Bros., Amazon and YouTube attended All-Star Weekend. Amazon has a deal with the WNBA, and Amazon vice president of global sports video Marie Donoghue worked at ESPN for nearly two decades.\n\nNext frontier in watching sporting events\n\nIn a nondescript office park near the University of Utah campus, a small group of reporters glimpsed what tech investors believe is the next big thing in viewing live sporting events: immersive reality.\n\nCosm, based in Salt Lake City, developed a viewing experience that makes it feel like you are a fan in attendance. But instead of a wearing virtual reality headset, you are watching in 8K and on a massive LED-dome screen. Cosm calls it shared reality because the idea is to watch with friends and other sports fans in a theater-style venue where you can also purchase food and drinks.\n\nCosm announced a partnership with the NBA on Thursday and plans to open its first venue in Los Angeles near SoFi Stadium and Intuit Dome in the spring of 2024, followed by another venue in Dallas. After watching clips of NBA and college football games in a brief demo, it is an amazing viewing experience. This technology can be applied to other events such as concerts. Cosm has not released price points for entry, but CEO Jeb Terry said he wants to ensure it’s an affordable experience.\n\nWho will win the East and West?\n\nSilver is correct. It’s competitive in the NBA this season. But how many teams have a legitimate chance to win the championship?\n\nThe consensus among league executives is that Boston, Milwaukee and Philadelphia can win the East. Cleveland All-Star Donovan Mitchell said the Cavs are part of the group, but they might be a year away from true contention,\n\nIt’s murkier in the West with Durant and Irving trades. Denver and Memphis are 1-2, but the Suns and Mavs now see an avenue to reach the Finals with the addition of two stars, and there are whispers that the Los Angeles Clippers are going to be dangerous once March gets here and Kawhi Leonard buckles down for the stretch run. Five weeks ago, New Orleans was in third place, but injuries, including Zion Williamson’s, have dropped the Pelicans to seventh.\n\nHow does a Denver-Boston NBA Finals sound?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/02/18/mac-mcclung-soars-to-slam-dunk-title-at-all-star-saturday/69920245007/", "title": "Mac McClung soars to slam dunk title at All-Star Saturday", "text": "TIM REYNOLDS\n\nAP\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Mac McClung might have single-handedly restored the shine on a dunk contest that has been widely panned in recent years.\n\nMcClung, the 6-foot-2 Philadelphia guard on a two-way contract, defeated New Orleans' Trey Murphy III in the finals of the dunk contest, culminating an NBA All-Star Saturday that may have finally answered the question as to whether what used to be the league's signature event can be glitzy again.\n\nMcClung had the answer: Absolutely.\n\n“I'm truly blessed and grateful for the NBA giving me this opportunity,\" McClung said.\n\nA 540-degree dunk — not a 360, but a 540, him doing one-and-a-half rotations in the air, a move more reserved for figure skaters and skateboarders than basketball players — was his third perfect score of the night out of four dunks. By the time the judges' scores came up it was already decided. Everyone in the building knew he'd already won.\n\n“It's over,\" McClung said.\n\nIt was. And he immediately committed to defending his title at Indianapolis at All-Star Saturday next year.\n\n“If you guys will have me, I'll be back,\" McClung said.\n\nThe final score, not that it mattered, was McClung 100.0, Murphy 98.0.\n\nHis is an unbelievable story: McClung has played mostly in the G League, where he ranks 36th in scoring this season at 19 points per game. He was undrafted in 2021 after spending three college seasons at Georgetown and Texas Tech. He was signed by Golden State last year but never played in a regular-season game for the Warriors, and spent a little time on USA Basketball’s World Cup qualifying team last year as well.\n\n“Ever since the beginning, I was the underdog,\" said McClung, who put on a Gate City jersey — his high school and hometown in Virginia, population 1,600 — for the final dunk. “Proving others right instead of others wrong brings a little more satisfaction.\"\n\nPhiladelphia would become his third NBA team, and he hasn't even played for the 76ers yet. He played in one game last season for the Chicago Bulls, one other game for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe has three NBA baskets.\n\nHe had four dunks on Saturday night. A guy with more dunks than actual NBA field goals might have saved the dunk contest.\n\n“Give this man his flowers, man,\" TNT commentator Kenny Smith said.\n\nMcClung set the tone for the night — he leaped over two people, took the ball out of the hands of one of them, tapped it on the backboard and then threw down a reverse slam.\n\nAnd that was just for starters.\n\nRiding the momentum of that perfect dunk, he wound up hoisting the — and former 76ers star — Julius “Dr. J\" Erving.\n\n“I'm super happy,\" McClung said.\n\nMcClung was nearly perfect on his second dunk as well; four judges gave him a perfect 50, Lisa Leslie gave him a 49 as the only dissenter, but it didn't matter — he was already assured a spot in the final round against Murphy.\n\nNew York's Jericho Sims gave himself a 50 on his second dunk, where he attached an envelope to the net, pulled it down after the dunk and displayed “50\" to the world. No judge agreed, and his two-dunk score of 95.4 wasn't good enough to make the final round.\n\nAlso eliminated after Round 1: Houston's Kenyon Martin Jr., with a score of 93.2.\n\n3-POINT CONTEST\n\nDamian Lillard represented his school and his brand, doing them both proud.\n\nLillard, the Portland star, won the 3-point contest by topping Indiana teammates Buddy Hield and Tyrese Haliburton in the final round.\n\nLillard wore a Weber State jersey with “Dolla” on the back. Weber State is his college; he performs music under the name Dame D.O.L.L.A. And when he got the trophy, he had a Blazers warmup shirt on for that moment.\n\n“They say the third time’s the charm,” said Lillard, who got his first 3-point title in his third try at the event. “And I’m happy that it happened here. It’s a perfect situation. I’m happy that I did it in my home, coming back here to Utah.”\n\nLillard won the final round with 26 points. Hield had 25 and Haliburton scored 17.\n\nLillard played his college games in Ogden, Utah, about a half-hour outside of Salt Lake City. And the historic ramification of finally getting a 3-point title wasn’t lost on him.\n\n“The best shooters in the history of our game, most of them have one of these,” Lillard said as he held the trophy. “I just wanted to get it done at least one time. And now I have it, so I can retire from it.”\n\nHaliburton won the first round with 31 points. Lillard had 26, and Hield had 23.\n\nEliminated in the first round were Boston’s Jayson Tatum, Utah’s Lauri Markkanen, Miami’s Tyler Herro, New York’s Julius Randle and Sacramento’s Kevin Huerter.\n\nSKILLS CHALLENGE\n\nUtah got a win to open All-Star Saturday night.\n\nThe Jazz — a roster composed of Utah players Jordan Clarkson, Walker Kessler and Collin Sexton — won the Skills Challenge on Saturday night, prevailing in two of the three competitions.\n\n“It feels good, especially to do it in front of the home team,” Sexton said.\n\nThe Rooks were second, with Orlando’s Paolo Banchero, Detroit’s Jaden Ivey and Houston’s Jabari Smith Jr. getting 100 points.\n\n“I had a lot of fun just doing that even though we took the L,\" said Banchero, who was part of the winning squad in Friday's Rising Stars games. “It was really fun getting out there in front of the fans. Skills Challenge, watched that all the time growing up during All-Star Weekend. So being a part of it was great.\"\n\nThe Antetokounmpos were third, with Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Alex Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday — a fill-in for injured Milwaukee Bucks teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo — getting shut out.\n\nThe Rooks won the team relay for 100 points, after having the best time on a course where teams had to complete a 35-foot outlet pass, do downcourt dribbling, a short jumper, a left corner 3-pointer and then a dunk at the other end.\n\nNext up was the team passing event, won by the Jazz — giving them 100 points — after they were the most accurate in a series of 35-foot outlet passes, 20-foot bounce passes and 25-foot chest passes.\n\nIt ended with the Team Shooting event — worth 200 points — with the Jazz prevailing there to clinch the win.\n\n“We did it for Utah, man,” Clarkson said.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2023/02/14/nba-announces-all-star-saturday-night-participants/51288499/", "title": "NBA announces All-Star Saturday night participants", "text": "AP\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is teaming up with his brothers once again on All-Star Saturday.

The league has not yet announced any format changes.\n\nThe first 66 All-Star Games all had the East vs. West format. The last six have seen the leading vote-getters from each conference serve as captains who got to draft their teams; LeBron James served as one of the captains all six times, with Giannis Antetokounmpo the other captain three times, Kevin Durant twice and Stephen Curry once.\n\nThe last four All-Star Games have used a target score at the end of games, ensuring that the matchup ends on a made shot. Fourth quarters have been untimed; the winner is the first team to reach whatever the leading team had after three quarters, plus 24 points — the 24 is a nod to Kobe Bryant’s last jersey number.\n\nThe first year of the target score format saw a fourth quarter that was incredibly dramatic. Last season’s game, however, was almost completely uncompetitive and became a disaster in terms of television ratings — in part because some of the biggest names like James, Antetokounmpo, Durant and Curry all missed much or all of the All-Star Game because of injury.\n\n“I mean, it’s fun to kind of get out there and do some dunks and stuff like that,” Utah's Lauri Markkanen said after last season's All-Star Game. “But we’re all competitors. I think everybody would enjoy too if we just play against each other and it gets competitive.”\n\nLeague officials said last week that they have been stressing to players the importance of improving the quality of the All-Star Game. It has been a talking point for years, as has the slam dunk competition — which got a serious shot in the arm last season when Mac McClung put on a show for the ages.\n\n“When you turn on an NBA All-Star Game, I think people expect to see some competition,” said Joe Dumars, the league’s executive vice president and head of basketball operations. “There’s a happy medium somewhere between a hard-fought playoff game and what you saw last year. … When you have the reaction that fans had and people had around the game and just visually, it matters because it didn’t make the product look good.”\n\nIt’s unclear when the league will finalize any All-Star Game changes.\n\n“We’ve lost sight a bit that it’s about the game at the end of the day,” Silver said.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/thunder/2024/01/30/okc-thunder-jalen-williams-chet-holmgren-cason-wallace-named-nba-rising-stars/72413165007/", "title": "OKC Thunder: Williams, Holmgren and Wallace named NBA Rising ...", "text": "The OKC Thunder's Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren and Cason Wallace have been selected to play in the NBA Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star Weekend in Indianapolis on Feb. 16.\n\nThe Rising Stars Challenge is a four-team tournament that consists of 11 rookies, 10 sophomores and seven NBA G League players.

They were up 108-101 when Embiid was whistled for plowing into Evan Mobley while making a jumper.\n\nAs Cleveland fans began to celebrate Embiid's apparent disqualification, Sixers coach Doc Rivers immediately challenged the call, which was overturned after a replay review and the superstar was allowed to stay on the floor.\n\n“I thought he flopped,\" Rivers said. “I called that one right away. I didn’t even look at my (replay) guy. I thought there was a good chance they would overturn it. I didn’t think they would foul Joel out on that.”\n\nAfterward, Embiid said he was confident the call would be changed.\n\n“I thought it was a good call (to overturn),\" Embiid said. \"I never extended my arm. Right before the hit, you could see he was already starting to flop. I watch basketball every day and I was pretty confident they would call it the other way.”\n\nCavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff saw it differently.\n\n“It’s clear as day that’s a charge,\" Bickerstaff said. “There’s no doubt about it. The call was made on the floor. He stands between him and the basket. Evan laid it all out on the line. Guys ought to be reward for that. If you stick your nose in there and scarifce your body, you should be rewarded for the correct play.”\n\nBickerstaff wasn't satisfied with the explanation he received from officiating crew of John Goble, Nick Bucher and Derek Richardson.\n\n“They said there wasn’t enough contact to be a charge,” said Bickerstaff. \"I mean, there’s a 300-pound man who bowls through your chest, it’s a charge. It’s that simple.”\n\nWith Embiid in foul trouble, the Cavs attacked the rim and closed to 110-107 before Maxey drained a 3-pointer and the 76ers made five straight free throws in the final 51 seconds to close it out.\n\nPhiladelphia went 2-1 vs. Cleveland and wins any tiebreaker for playoff seeding.\n\nCaris LeVert scored 24 points and Donovan Mitchell added 21 for the Cavs, who were playing the second night of a back-to-back. Cleveland was without center Jarrett Allen, who missed his third straight game with a bruised right eye.\n\nThe Cavs have tried various defensive schemes — double- and triple-teams, shadowing — to try and slow the versatile Embiid, a rare big man who can play out on the perimeter and inside.\n\n“This is a unique human being we're talking about,” Bickerstaff said before the game. “We'll keep throwing things at him and see if something sticks.”\n\nIt didn't start well for Cleveland as Embiid drew two fouls on the Cavs in the first 43 seconds.\n\nBut although he was giving up 65 pounds, Mobley showed no fear while guarding the massive center and he got plenty of help as the Cavs collapsed on Embiid any time he touched the ball near the hoop.\n\nEmbiid made his trips to the foul line count, sinking all 10 attempts. Harden went 9 of 12 from the line.\n\n“Not taking anything away from those guys, they’re phenomenal basketball players and they know how to play within the rules,” Bickerstaff said. “I was with James for four years in Houston and he’s a master at manipulating he rules, and Joel does the same.”\n\nTIP-INS\n\n76ers: F Jalen McDaniel (bruise hip) missed his first game this season with an injury after being hurt Sunday against Washington.

A win would put the U.S. on the brink of clinching a spot in the 32-team field for next year’s World Cup, and probably would mean the Americans need to win just one of their final four qualifying contests to get the job done.\n\nA loss wouldn’t doom hopes, but would make the task of qualifying a bit more challenging.\n\n“We know what’s at stake,” U.S. qualifying coach Jim Boylen said after Thursday’s 105-71 over Uruguay in Las Vegas, before he and the team rushed out for a red-eye flight to Miami and then a connection to Colombia. “I think this group will enjoy playing on the road.

Southern comfort food blended with tastes of other longitudes and latitudes summarizes the UBK menu: gumbo to salmon, surf 'n' turf pasta to honey garlic pork chops, and gumbo worthy to stand with anything from south Louisiana. Hands-on warm service, where co-owners will likely stop by to ask about your meal, and variations on down-home standards such as mac 'n' cheese and sweet potato fries, make patrons feel at (a slightly better version of) home.

He and Nadia Holguin co-own other Phoenix restaurants, including James Beard Award nominee Bacanora, but opening Cocina Chiwas in February 2023 was especially personal, a chance to play with the flavors of their childhoods. Bright Mexican seafood aguachiles and seasonal salads shine ahead of the main event: wood-fired parrillada featuring tender skirt steak carne asada, sweet-spicy al pastor and chorizo con papas served with diner-style rice and beans and fresh corn tortillas.

Since Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson, known for founding 21c Museum Hotels among other ventures, opened Barn 8 in 2020, the place has become a go-to for locals and visitors alike. And why not? What could be more Kentucky than tables available inside horse stalls and surrounded by stacks of bourbon barrels? While the 19th-century structure maintains the frame of a barn stuck in time, the space is modernized with decor, artwork, leather chairs and upscale details. From the seasonal menu, consider the cast iron cornbread, which requires a 15-minute wait to be made from scratch, and go from there. Simple dishes such as house-made bread, spaghetti and burrata shine, while the pork loin and duck breast entrees are favorites. Dessert options also change frequently, but a banana date cake is a top recommendation during the winter. − Amanda Hancock, The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.)\n\nDetails: 835 E.

When he arrived in New Orleans, he found familiar flavors. The city’s Creole cooking, like the food he grew up eating, often relies on layered, slow-cooked dishes. At Dakar NOLA, his first restaurant, Mbaye mines the connections between the two cuisines. Guests sit at communal tables, and the prix fixe dinner is as much a performance as a meal. With each course, Mbaye comes out of the kitchen and offers a story. The intensely flavored black-eyed peas with palm oil, for example, were inspired by the last meal fed to enslaved Africans before crossing the Atlantic. His jollof rice, an African staple, is delicious evidence of the origin of Louisiana’s jambalaya.

Big mistake. Paterson has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country and some of the most delicious Middle Eastern eats. The best of them all? Al-Basha, a quarter-century-old Palestinian restaurant, which arguably offers the best hummus in the region, if not, well, the planet. Scoop it up with torn pieces of warm, fluffy pitas. They are reason enough to trek to Al-Basha. But then again, nearly every mezze item is a standout: the crisp falafel, the flavor-packed muhammara, the creamy labneh, the refreshing tabbouleh.

The result is dishes such as a 45-day dry-aged tomahawk steak, cooked for three hours near indirect flame and finished on the grill.

Opened in September 2021, Ma Der has been named to top-restaurant lists by The New York Times and Bon Appetit, and Chanchaleune received his second James Beard nomination in 2023, becoming a finalist for Best Chef: Southwest. The menu more than satisfies with family-style service that allows guests to sample various Laotian dishes at a wallet-friendly price point. Freestyle Fridays and regular pop-ups bring new and off-menu ideas and collaborations to the table. The crispy rice salad, grilled beef and laab (available in a vegan option) are must-haves, and keep an eye on the daily specials, which are delicious flavor bombs unique to each weekday. — JaNae Williams, The Oklahoman (Oklahoma City)\n\nDetails: 4533 Baltimore Ave, Philadelphia, Pa.; 215-921-6558, alifamilyrestaurants.com\n\nDoro Bet restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the life-changing fried chicken.\n\nNot everyone can claim to have invented a cuisine. But before Mebruka Kane made her first batch of berbere-spiced, wafer-crisp and unendingly juicy Ethiopian fried chicken in the spring of 2021, it’s fair to say nothing like it existed in the world. “Fried chicken is not traditional in Ethiopia,” she said. But her American-born children loved Chick-fil-A, so she added her own twist. Sure, you could die of tender heartbreak while tasting Kane’s fresh-built shawarma or long-simmered doro wot chicken leg at Doro Bet, the clean-lined West Philly fast-casual Ethiopian chicken house Kane shares with her sister, Hayat Ali. But it’s their fried chicken that made them famous for hundreds of miles: breaded with the nutty pop and crackle of teff and tapioca flours, marinated in buttermilk with earthy-fiery berbere spice mixed by a sister in Ethiopia. Like it mild? The gentle turmeric in the mild “alicha” fried chicken, also found in Doro Bet’s heavenly collards, will soothe you into submission. Even better, for those long denied their fried chicken fix? It’s all gluten-free. − Matthew Korfhage, The News Journal (Wilmington, Del.)\n\nDetails: 6326 Greenhill Road, New Hope, Pa.; thespeckledegg.net\n\nThe Speckled Egg Cafe restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the ever-changing menu of breakfast and lunch.\n\nOpen Tuesdays and Saturdays at Rice’s Market, The Speckled Egg Cafe feels like stepping into a cozy kitchen where customers are welcomed like long-awaited houseguests. The laid-back and charming owners, Tony Artur and Chef Megan Loos, originally opened their cafe in 2021 across the river at the Golden Nugget Antique Flea Market before landing at Rice’s in 2022. The cafe features a regularly changing menu of breakfast and lunch items, showcasing the pair’s creativity at turning locally sourced ingredients into unexpected dishes. Recent specials have included sticky pork belly congee, tomato eggs Benedict atop a zucchini waffle, and a honey-brined chicken thigh on creamy mascarpone polenta. And if it's available, don't miss their sought-after rosewater-glazed sesame doughnuts. − Michele Haddon, The Intelligencer (Pa.)\n\nDetails: 2535 E. Market St., York, Pa.; 717-846-9302, vietthaimarketstreetcafe.com\n\nViet Thai Cafe restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this pioneer of Asian fusion dining in central Pennsylvania.\n\nA pioneer of Asian fusion dining in central Pennsylvania, the Viet Thai Cafe has grown under the care of the same family since 1996. Originally trying to run a neighborhood diner serving American food, Yen Nguyen suggested to her son Hoa that they try cooking what they know. Yorkers tasted Thai food for the first time and kept coming back with the personal touch of the family. Today, in a larger location, daughter Jennifer and Joseph DiMarcello, who started as a dishwasher in 1998 and married into the family, manage the restaurant with Jennifer's brother Francis. They offer a large menu of Vietnamese, Thai and Loa fusion and a sushi bar. − Lena Tzivekis, York Daily Record (Pa.)\n\nDetails: 4349 South County Trail, Charlestown, R.I.; 401-642-7350, slyfoxdenrestaurant.com\n\nSly Fox Den Too restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this spot where Sherry Pocknett became the first Indigenous female chef to win a James Beard Award.\n\nTucked away in a rural corner of Rhode Island, the red façade of Sly Fox Den Too looks more like a home, with a little herb garden and a lot of picnic tables, when visitors first drive up to it. Chef Sherry Pocknett opened the cozy spot in 2021, and just two years later she became the first Indigenous female chef to win a James Beard Award. The menu is a reflection of Pocknett’s cultural roots and creativity, with dishes like Fire Cracker Shrimp & Nausamp topped with a spicy garlic sauce, the Three-Sisters Succotash with an East Coast mix of corn, squash and beans, and the Cape Coddah’ featuring cranberry walnut hotcakes. Restaurants where you can order authentic Indigenous cuisine are rare, and this spot will leave you wishing there were more of them. — Katie Landeck, The Providence Journal (R.I.)\n\nDetails: 272 Westminster St., Providence, R.I.; 401-383-3813, gifthorsepvd.com\n\nGift Horse restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends local catch served in a convivial environment with a U-shaped bar.\n\nThe prominent U-shaped bar makes clear Gift Horse is meant to be a social environment. Guests have views of the raw bar, the busy kitchen and the bartenders making their drinks. Ben Sukle’s restaurant has a clean, modern look that pairs perfectly with chef Sky Haneul Kim’s menu. The focus is on the local catch served in dishes ranging from seafood towers to smoked fish dip with puffed seaweed chips, along with a huge lineup of oysters on the half shell. Caviar and doughboys is an homage to the state's deep-fried savory treat. The smoked scallop rolls spiced with jalapeños will make you forget lobster rolls. Paired with desserts like a cake in a cup and refreshing cocktails, Gift Horse makes a meal to remember. − Gail Ciampa, The Providence Journal (R.I.)\n\nDetails: 318 N.

What’s all the fuss about? At Potchke, chef Laurence Faber, an alum of Tennessee's renowned Blackberry Farm, explores his roots in Ukraine through delicious food with a story in a relaxed environment. Babkas, lox bagels and matzo ball soup are among fan favorites at this pop-up-turned-permanent fixture of Knoxville’s dining scene. — Ryan Wilusz, Knox News, Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nDetails: 2305 12th Ave. S., Nashville, Tenn.; locustnashville.com\n\nLocust restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends exceptional dumplings, clams on buttery toast and oysters with far too much caviar.\n\nEverything about Locust is disarming by design. The chefs, who will also turn out to be your affable, knowledgeable servers, shout boisterous “Hellos!” from the open kitchen as you walk through the door. The 36-seat dining room of blond wood and big windows feels airy and open. The soundtrack ranges from The Pogues to Pantera. You might be encouraged to have a bracing shot of horseradish vodka at lunchtime. You should. James Beard-nominated chef Trevor Moran is behind the tiny restaurant with the huge following, all chasing after a menu so mutable it could change a couple of times in one day. But you can bet on reliably excellent tartare to roll in toasted nori, exceptional dumplings, and some other sumptuous thing such as clams on buttery toast or oysters with far too much caviar. But beyond the stellar ingredients and obvious talent is an X-factor that makes Locust special: It's a really fun place to be. − Mackensy Lunsford, The Tennessean (Nashville)\n\nDetails: 5811 Manor Road, Austin, Texas; 512-270-8021 mumfoodsatx.com\n\nMum Foods Smokehouse and Delicatessen restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the brisket, ribs and sausage that make Mum one of the best barbecue joints in the city.\n\nGeoffrey Ellis’s Mum Foods has been drawing lines for more than a decade, beginning with local farmers markets. But late last year, the chef opened a full-size restaurant serving, yes, his market-famous brisket and pastrami, but also peppery pork ribs, fiery sausage links, corned beef and more. The brisket, ribs and sausage make Mum one of the best barbecue joints in the city, and the corned beef and pastrami sandwiches make it one of the city’s best delis. The pastrami is popular, but the coriander-buzzed corned beef is my favorite. It’s steamed to a tender finish but doesn’t hit the smoker, giving it a purer, beefy, deli meat taste. Stacked high, draped with Swiss cheese and served on a slightly malty and sweet house-made sourdough rye, it makes for the perfect sandwich. − Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman (Texas)\n\nDetails: 939 S.

You see it in the handwritten notes left at your table on a special-occasion dinner. You feel it in the vibrant dining space filled with perky potted plants and dozens of duck figurines tucked into the decor. You taste it in the ever-evolving menu, where dishes like Filipino-style pork belly lechon kwali with peanut kare-kare, Haitian beef short rib joumou and chicken-fried oyster mushrooms with Nashville hot sauce share space in artful cohesion. A 2022 James Beard Award semifinalist for outstanding restaurant, the eatery effortlessly doubles as an after-work hangout or a celebration spot where everyone can feel at home. — Rachel Bernhard, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nOther restaurants that make our food team swoon\n\nThough most of the restaurants on our list are in the communities in or near where we live and work, our writers love to travel, and when they do, they seek out great meals.\n\nThe following are places our writers continue to crave, months after vacation is over.\n\nDetails: 3655 S. Grand Ave. Unit C9, Los Angeles, 213-986-9972, holboxla.com\n\nDoes a restaurant need to be white-tablecloth fancy and over-the-top expensive to earn national accolades? No, and certainly not if that restaurant is Holbox. The counter-service eatery in a Los Angeles food hall serves fresh California seafood inspired by chef-owner Gilberto Cetina’s native Yucatan Peninsula. Cetina, a 2023 James Beard finalist for Best Chef: California, opened the restaurant in 2017 in South Central LA’s Mercado La Paloma. Eight restaurants share a common dining area in the converted garment factory that also houses shops and nonprofits. The Holbox menu features dishes such as Ceviche Mixto with Yucatan octopus, wild Mexican shrimp and Baja striped bass; house-smoked kanpachi tacos with queso Chihuahua, salsa cruda, avocado and peanut chili oil; and Camarones al Mojo de Ajo with roasted local shrimp, garlic butter, cilantro rice, black beans and grilled bread.\n\nDetails: 3127 Fillmore St., San Francisco Calif.; 415-440-0460, ateliercrenn.com.\n\nAt Atelier Crenn, chef and owner Dominique Crenn unites her French heritage with California’s natural bounty to create an unforgettable 14-course pescatarian tasting menu. As the first female chef in the United States to earn three Michelin stars, Crenn is dedicated to providing guests with a unique experience while taking care of the planet. Atellier Crenn is a meat- and dairy-free restaurant with produce supplied by Crenn’s Bleu Belle Farm in Sonoma. Opened in 2011, the restaurant underwent a four-week makeover in early 2023, resulting in a modern dining room with warm wood accents and elements that evoke California’s natural beauty.\n\nDetails: 259 E. Broadway, Manhattan; 646-692-8300, ernestosnyc.com\n\nLet’s begin exactly as you should at Ernesto’s, a darling Basque restaurant that has wowed critics and diners alike since it opened nearly four years ago in a rather remote part of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Order the restaurant’s signature dry, 5-finger Martini, a delicious concoction made with two kinds of sherry and blanc vermouth, garnished with three plump olives on a thin skewer. Leisurely enjoy your drink and then slowly move on to those delectable bar snacks called pintxos: cheesy, shredded chicken croquetas; skewers of sweet and spicy green peppers, green olives, and umami-rich anchovies called gildas; spicy house-made Basque sausage; and that Insta-famous mound of crisp, house-made chips covered with Iberico ham. You can make a meal out of these small plates − and many do − but then you’d miss out on the roasted meats and grilled fish that in the hands of chef Ryan Bartlow may have you swooning. The menu changes frequently. Many of these dishes may no longer be available when you show up. No matter. When a chef is this talented, your only worry is how many dishes you will be able to eat.\n\nDetails: 2350 E. Union St., Seattle; 206-391-8140, communionseattle.com\n\nThey call it Communion for a reason. Chef-owner Kristi Brown’s grandmother was a deacon and a pastor, and her mother was a church pianist, so the name of this “Seattle Soul” restaurant pays homage to her religious roots. But the restaurant itself brings about communion, a convergence of spirits. It’s about people coming together, feeling intimate and close in this space − all copper and rich blues and browns − and about bringing Seattle itself to the table. Brown, a caterer for many years before opening the restaurant in 2020, has created her own style of cuisine by sourcing ingredients from her city’s neighbors, including immigrants from Southeast Asia and East Africa. She combines that with culinary influences from her childhood and local ingredients − especially seafood − and turns out delightful dishes like coconut clams with Laotian sausage, coconut milk and lemongrass, and a seafood-and-panko stuffed trout with a decadent Bernaise sauce.

A luscious and impressive crème brûlée.\n\nConsidering Harry's 10-ounce cut of prime rib alone regularly starts at $27.95, soup or salad is about $8, and dessert costs about the same, this is a terrific deal.\n\nHarry's owner Xavier Teixido says the dine-in only special (no substitutions, please) is a way for the restaurant to celebrate its 30th anniversary and to thank customers for their longtime patronage.\n\n\"It’s a great deal and we see it as a way to promote Sunday family dining,\" Teixido says.\n\nA once-a week-restaurant special can feel like a gift that eateries give to their loyal customers. The offers – many include prime rib, lobster and tacos – also are an excellent way to lure in and seduce new patrons.\n\nFickle food flirts are constantly on the prowl for the latest culinary experience. But few diners can resist a bargain.\n\nOf course, you can always find a deal-of-the-day on Groupon. But if you don't feel like using that middleman service, we've hunted down a number of interesting promotions and specials at restaurants throughout the state.\n\nFeby's Fishery in Wilmington has long offered lobster night specials on Monday and Wednesday nights beginning at 4 p.m. For $19.99, patrons receive a 1 1/4 pound whole lobster and two side dishes. Reservations are suggested.\n\nThe 3701 Lancaster Pike seafood restaurant also offers a $39.99 all-you-can-eat Dungeness crab special on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and \"buck-a-shuck\" raw oysters on Fridays.\n\nIf tacos are more to your liking, $1 will get you a beef taco (soft or hard) on Thursday evenings at the Touchdown Restaurant in Dover. Chicken tacos that night are $1.25, and steak tacos are $2 for the dine-in only deal. Normally, tacos at the sports-themed eatery at 1666 S.

The special, from 3 p.m. until the 3838 Kennett Pike cafe closes, includes $2 tacos and $5 margaritas.\n\nThe taco selections vary. In January, five different tacos were available at the special price including slow-roasted beef short rib tacos with chipotle salsa verde, queso fresco and radishes and chili verde chorizo tacos with cotija cheese, pickled manzano pepper and red onion.\n\nA special $8 appetizer featured on Thursday was a plate of crisp fingerling potato \"nachos\" topped with pepper jack cheese, serrano peppers, red onion, cilantro and avocado.\n\nBe forewarned: Seats fill up fast.

We're offering something at this price that says you don't need to be a millionaire to go [to Harry's].\"\n\nTeixido said the meal deal has been so successful, he decided to offer it on Sundays throughout the year.\n\nWeekly specials tend to do well at Harry's, Teixido said. On Wednesday nights, all bottled wine is half price. This is another good deal considering the restaurant is known for having one of the best wine cellars in the state. Although not every bottle is available at a discount, the restaurant has more than 50 wines available at half the usual cost.\n\nHalf-priced oysters also are available at the bar every Thursday beginning at 11:30 a.m.\n\n\"They are kind of niche days,\" the restaurateur said. While Friday and Saturday nights have long been busy nights at Harry's, Teixido said he chose Sunday as the day to offer the prime rib special as a way \"to rebuild\" that day.\n\n\"We want people to be aware of us again. We want to make a point. It brings people in and they bring other people in,\" he said.\n\nThe special also is a way for the restaurant to introduce Harry's new executive chef Michael Heaps.\n\nThe chef, a Pittsburgh area native who has worked at a five-star resort in Colorado, Del Frisco's of Philadelphia, the Sullivan's Steakhouse chain, and a private club in Seattle, started at the restaurant in November.\n\nHeaps replaces longtime Harry's Hospitality Group executive chef and partner David Leo Banks.\n\nTeixido and Banks ended their almost 30-year culinary partnership in October 2017. Banks is now the sole proprietor of the Harry's Seafood Grill and Harry's Seafood Market operations that he and Teixido co-owned at the Wilmington Riverfront. Teixido continues to own and run Harry's Savoy Grill and Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon in Trolley Square.\n\nSome more culinary changes could be coming soon at Harry's and its banquet offerings in the ballroom.\n\n\"It's nice to have fresh eyes,\" Teixido said about Heaps.\n\nAt the Stone Balloon Ale House in Newark, executive chef Robbie Jester offers another hard-to-beat bargain.

Substitute soft drinks for the alcoholic beverages and the cost is $25.\n\n\"We offered that since we've opened almost three years now. It is amazingly busy,\" said Jester. \"In my opinion, it's the best deal in Newark.\"\n\nThe \"Cheap Date Night\" menu changes every three or four weeks, said Jester, well-known for his appearances on Food Network programs, including a 2016 episode of \"Beat Bobby Flay,\" where his dish of shrimp scampi bested the celebrity chef in a head-to-head cook-off.\n\n\"It's a creative collection of things I make or the guys in the kitchen come up,\" Jester said.\n\nThe Wednesday special includes a choice from about three to four bottles of white or red wine and sometimes an occasional sparkling wine.\n\nEntrees have included everything from braised short rib tostadas to blackened salmon alfredo to chicken calzones with arugula salad. Dessert can include monkey bread pudding with white chocolate sauce, deconstructed blueberry pie or beignets. And there's always a selection of ice cream from Hockessin's Woodside Farm Creamery.\n\nJester said reservations are highly recommended. \"It starts at 4 p.m. when we open and it goes until we run out of things,\" he said. \"It's a full restaurant by around 6:30 p.m.\"\n\nCorner Bistro at 3604 Silverside Road in Talleyvlle now has a special dish every night of the week.\n\nMonday is salmon and shrimp paella ($18), while Tuesday is the night for bistro chicken and waffles ($15). Fish and chips ($16) are served on Wednesdays, lobster risotto ($18) is reserved for Thursdays, and ahi tuna three ways ($22) is served on Fridays.\n\nSaturday is the night for homemade meatloaf ($16); and homemade lasagna ($16) is made on Sundays.\n\nOwner Mickey Donatello says he started the new daily specials a couple weeks ago when he introduced a new menu.\n\nDonatello said the specials keep the restaurant interesting and evolving. The lower price offerings also might change some diners perspectives.\n\n\"I feel like people think we're too fancy, I want us to be more down-to -earth,\" Donatello said. He likes that there are now many comfort food specials, such as Fish and Chips on Wednesdays.\n\n\"Who doesn't like fish and chips?\" Donatello said, adding Dogfish Head is used in the beer batter.\n\nThe lasagna served on Sundays is made from Donatello's own recipe. Why Sundays? Why not? \"My kids love lasagna,\" he said.\n\nDonatello said the daily specials also are the restaurant's kitchen way to do \"R&D\" or research and development. If dishes become popular, they might eventually become a permanent part of the menu.\n\nOne such dish is Corner Bistro's homemade meatloaf.\n\n\"The meatloaf is incredible. We wrapped it with bacon and with a smoky barbecue sauce,\" he said.\n\nAnother winner has been the ahi tuna three ways. The first fish is served as Hawaiian poke, Donatello said, and a second version is encrusted with black and white sesame seeds. The third serving of tuna comes with Korean kimchi.\n\n\"It's a beautiful, beautiful dish,\" Donatello said.\n\nLooking for even more dining deals?

In 2019, Bardea on Market Street was named one of the country's best new restaurants. In 2022 chef/co-owner Antimo DiMeo, who co-owns the modern Italian restaurant with Scott Stein, was named as a semifinalist for Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic region. The partners also run two stalls — a pizzeria and a taqueria — in Wilmington's DECO Food Hall at 10th and Orange streets in Wilmington, and Bardea Steak, a high-end steakhouse next door to Bardea Food & Drink. It's another city restaurant worth your time. Favorite Bardea Food & Drink dishes include the burrata pop tart, any pasta dish, the heritage chicken, or the fish of the day.\n\n101 Coastal Highway, Fenwick Island; (302) 537-4790; onecoastal.com\n\nChef/owner Matt Kern's two-year-old Sussex County, farm-forward restaurant has been flying under the radar, but it recently has gained nationwide attention following Kern's 2024 nomination by the James Beard Foundation as one of the best chefs in the Mid-Atlantic region.

One Coastal, a beach, dinner-only restaurant isn't just for summer diners; it's open year-round.

While he previously operated his own restaurant and a catering company, Lhulier found winning success with customers when he teamed with Bill Irvin to open Snuff Mill in 2021. The snug spot is both sophisticated and charming. (Irvin's brand-new The Brandywine Restaurant also is worth a visit.) Reservations at Snuff Mill are highly suggested, though walk-ins can sometimes find a seat at the bar.

Some may remember it as the former home of Jerry's Seafood and even early as the Rose & Crown, but the restaurateurs have made it their own. The concept is an oyster house that pays tribute to the “oyster craze\" of the 18th and 19th centuries, and there are modern touches as well at this \"tavern by the sea.\" Start with the Mure Margarita which gets its heat from the addition of ghost pepper tincture and then dive into one of the seafood towers.

Lee renovated a Victorian home, an 1899 structure built two years before the assassination of President William McKinley, and added polished, ladylike decor that manages to be contemporary and chic without delving into frumpy, elderly auntie furnishings. The restaurant, which earned James Beard nods in 2019 and 2020, reopened in February after a January break with a new menu, cocktails, craft beers and wine, desserts and updated decor.

In 2022, Hoffman was chosen by the James Beard Foundation as a semifinalist for the Best Chef award in the Mid-Atlantic region along with Antimo DiMeo of Wilmington's Bardea Food & Drink. The Hoffmans, who operate the restaurant out of a historic, 1922 farmhouse, are well-known for putting interesting twists on their menu items. There is seating for 60 including two dining rooms, a front porch and a bar. Hoffman's winter dinner menu includes a trio of deviled eggs, seared Massachusetts sea scallops, grilled Hudson Valley duck breast, and \"beef and butter noodles,\" prime rib with hand-cut farfalle.\n\n421 N.

In 2020, the couple brought aboard Executive Chef Dwain Kalup whose stellar cooking at the former Domaine Hudson earned him a spot on the 2017 semifinalist list for James Beard's Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic region. At Domaine, Kalup was known for turning out some of the finest and most elegant food in Wilmington, if not the state. La Fia loyalists know to turn out for the bargain Wednesday prix fixe dinners which include three courses for $40. Kalup's enticing menu on these nights includes choices like black mission fig toast, roasted maitake mushrooms, Brazilian fish stew, saffron spaghetti alla Chitarra and white chocolate mascarpone mousse.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com or 302-324-2861 and follow her on X (Twitter) @pattytalorico Sign up for her Delaware Eats newsletter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2019/07/18/our-top-5-favorite-delaware-restaurant-crab-cakes/1742941001/", "title": "Best restaurant crab cakes in Delaware: We took your suggestions ...", "text": "Is summer really summer if you don't eat a crab cake?\n\nAlmost every successful restaurant in the state has some kind of dish with crab meat. It's a staple of Mid-Atlantic cuisine, especially in Delaware since the blue crab is common in local tidal waters.\n\nWe embarked on Great Delaware Crab Cake search last summer and throughout the fall. We asked readers to share their favorite places in the First State. Emails and voicemails poured in with more than a hundred suggestions. We checked out the top recommendations.\n\nDuring our search, we had some hit-and-miss places. And not every contender made the cut. For example, early in our search we really enjoyed the crab ball at Gilligan's Restaurant and Bar in Lewes, but it got nudged out by other cakes.\n\nHere's a look back at our Top Five favorites:\n\nUniversity of Delaware, 400 David Hollowell Drive, Newark; 302-737-0900; courtyard.marriott.com/courtyard-experience/\n\nIs it strange that our favorite place to get a crab cake is at a hotel restaurant on the University of Delaware's campus in Newark?\n\nWe've been hearing about these crab cakes for years, and when we finally tried them, well, yep, they easily deserve the numerous awards they have received.\n\nThe $26 crab cake dinner (two cakes and two sides) is available at the hotel's bistro at the Courtyard by Marriott off Del. 896. Just so you know, the bistro serves breakfast and dinner, no lunch.\n\nThese gluten-free cakes, bigger than your palm, are made with all lump crab meat and a secret all natural binding ingredient.\n\nYou can eat them at the hotel bistro (dinner only) but, when all is said and done, it is a hotel bistro. Who really wants to eat there?\n\nBut you can order dinners to-go, and pick them up in the bistro.\n\nWeirdly enough, the crab cakes are not listed on the online bistro menu. (We called and, yes, they do offer crab cakes every day from 5 to 10 p.m.) I guess it's a secret menu item that only selfish shellfish lovers know about.\n\n1904 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Dewey Beach, 302-260-9945; deweybeachbar.com/\n\nWoody's owner Jimmy O'Conor is a proud Maryland native and he knows what makes an excellent crab cake.\n\nThe Woody's crab cake is not really a cake, nor is it a ball. It opens almost like a flower with crab meat petals. The cake is broiled an appealing nutty brown hue.\n\nThis is no stingy helping and there are no shreds of meat. It's as if someone just picked steamed blue crabs and shared all the best, precious lump meat. The only discernible flavor in the cake is crab, and few, if any, spices or herbs.\n\nHAVE YOU TRIED?: 20 (and more) classic Delaware eateries you shouldn't miss\n\nIt's also very affordable for the quality of this excellent crab cake. A Woody's crab cake sandwich is $17.50 and includes a flavorful, toasted brioche bun, a side of homemade Old Bay potato chips and a pickle spear.\n\n777 Delaware Park Boulevard, Stanton, 302-994-2521; delawarepark.com/dining/legends/\n\nSeriously? A racetrack/casino? In Stanton? For crab cakes?\n\nFor real. Crab cakes have been made and served at Delaware Park since Maryland businessman and developer William Rickman, who had an interest in thoroughbred racehorses, reopened the site in 1984, according to Delaware Park President Bill Fasy.\n\n“Crab Cakes Delaware Park” are the signature entree at Racing Legends, a Victorian-style restaurant that looks like it hasn't had much of an update since it opened in 1996.\n\nYou can also get Delaware Park-style crab cakes in the At The Rail Wine Bar and Grille at the White Clay Creek Country Club. The golf course and clubhouse are operated by, and on the grounds of, Delaware Park.\n\nThe Racing Legends restaurant, which most people just call \"Legends,\" is on the second floor slot level next to the escalator. The website says \"Proper Dress Required,\" though most everyone I saw looked casually attired.\n\nThe sweet, broiled cake more than lived up to its reputation The crab cake (which you can also get fried) is all jumbo lump meat with a hint of rich, creamy-tasting binder that has, perhaps, the suggestion of mustard. Make no mistake: The binder is not filler, it just holds the crab meat together.\n\nOUR NEW SEARCH: Vote for Delaware's favorite pizza\n\nThis is not a huge cake - it was roughly the size of a palm (or at least my palm). Fasy says the crab cakes are 5 ounces.\n\nThe crab cake entree, which comes with two cakes, two sides and a salad, just says \"market price.\" (In July, the two crab cakes entree was listed online for $32; just one was $19.)\n\nYou need to be 21 or older to gamble at Delaware Park, but not to dine at Legends. Don't want to eat there? A colleague told me she sometimes orders take-out crab cakes.\n\n720 Justison St., Wilmington Riverfront, 302-652-3474; bigfishriverfront.com/\n\nI've had hit-or-miss meals previously at Big Fish Grill Wilmington Riverfront, but the jumbo lump crab cake ($16.95 for one, $25.95 for two) I sampled last summer was a winner.\n\nThe broiled, lightly seasoned cake was beautifully browned, and the inside had just enough creaminess to keep the jumbo lumps together. Bravo, Big Fish.\n\n283 Front St, Leipsic; (302) 674-9724\n\nThe Sambo's crab cake, which we got fried, is indeed a thing of beauty. It's nearly all meat and the kitchen doesn't seem to monkey around with many spices.\n\nMy one slight quibble was that the fried cake almost tasted too bland. I liked it better when I ate an excellent French fry, sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning, and then took a bite of the crab cake.\n\nAt $14, Sambo's crab cake sandwich, served on a soft potato bun, was the most inexpensive one I've tried recently. A pal and I briefly thought about adding lettuce and tomato (50 cents extra) to the bun, but decided that sometimes vegetable extras make a sandwich too mushy.\n\nWe kind of regretted our decision after hearing someone say the produce was locally grown. I highly recommend a side of Sambo's terrific homemade potato salad ($2).\n\nKeep in mind, Sambo's is cash-only, and it has a tavern license. That means no children. Seriously.

Taking his place is Brian Cooper, who formerly worked at Cinghiale Osteria in Baltimore.\n\nD'Amico left Harry's Savoy Grill in 2015 when he became a partner and helped open Metro Pub & Grill, the Middletown eatery owned by the RM Hospitality Group.\n\nHe was on board to create two more restaurants, but he parted ways with the hospitality group in January 2017. After a few months of going through some serious health issues, he emerged as head chef at the Bayard House in Chesapeake City, Maryland.\n\nD'Amico filled in for Kalup at Domaine Hudson this past October when Kalup got married. The chefs had worked together at Harry's Savoy Grill. Kalup encouraged D'Amico to apply for the Domaine Hudson job when he decided to relocate to Arizona.\n\nThe chef said he has already seen patrons whom he has known from his previous restaurant jobs and from appearing at local culinary events.\n\n\"I'm just being myself. I'm just going to concentrate on cooking,\" D'Amico said.\n\nDomaine Hudson is considered one of the state's best restaurants. In 2017, Kalup was a semifinalist for a James Beard Award for Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic region. Beard Awards are widely considered the country's highest culinary honors. D'Amico has previously been a James Beard Award semifinalist when he was executive chef of Eclipse Bistro on Wilmington's Union Street.\n\nD'Amico has already tweaked or replaced several items from Kalup's menu. Gone is the Allen Brothers Coulotte Steak, a lean cut also known as a top sirloin cap. In its place is Allen Brother New York Strip Steak ($39) with roasted cippolini onions, horseradish cream, buttermilk onion rings and pinot noir reduction.\n\nThe pan-roasted whole fish remains, but instead of branzino, D'Amico is serving a strawberry grouper.\n\n\"It's a beautiful fish,\" he says of the delicate-tasting white meat swimmer that's also known as Calico Grouper,\n\nPastas, all still made in house, have been revised.\n\nThe kabocha squash stuffed tortellini has been 86'ed for rabbit tortellini ($15/$28) with oyster mushrooms, pine nuts, and golden raisins. Farro stracci has been pushed aside for herb cavatelli with tomato broth, shaved garlic and parmesan curls ($13/$25).\n\n\"There's no egg in the cavatelli. If you eliminate the cheese curls, it could be a vegan dish,\" the chef said.\n\nD'Amico started his cooking career at the former Positano, a 10-table critically acclaimed Northern Italian restaurant in Wilmington. At that time, he worked with Javier Matamoros, who is now Domaine Hudson's General Manager/Maitre'd.\n\nHe also has worked with Sommelier/General Manager Roger Surpin at the Hotel du Pont.\n\n\"It's good to be back in Wilmington,\" D'Amico said last week while sitting in Domaine Hudson's dining room.\n\nD'Amico is hosting an Inaugural Chef's Dinner at the restaurant on March 4, beginning at 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe five-course dinner, $85 per person, will feature wines by Stolpman Vineyards and will be presented by California winery owner Peter Stolpman.\n\nTo see the menu and make reservations, visit www.domainehudson.com/events/\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nKEEP READING\n\nWilmington shooting victim died in front of his children, family says\n\nReports end nudist gatherings at Delaware club\n\nChesDel restaurant bows out after 38 years", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/food/2024/02/15/how-usa-today-chose-restuarants-of-the-year-for-2024/72155160007/", "title": "Here's how we chose our 2024 USA TODAY Restaurants of the Year", "text": "Those of you who have been with me since I started this journey covering dining in Oklahoma a little over a year ago know how proud and passionate I am about the things our state has to offer.\n\nOne thing we don't always get is a fair shake when it comes to recognition and accolades, but that has started to shift as we've more consistently become part of national conversations about food and dining.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}]}

The THC oil, mixed with coconut oil, was used to create the baked goods.\n\nThe goods would then be sold for $5 to $15 apiece to clients who picked them up at Nunn's apartment. Sometimes, Nunn made deliveries on his skateboard, according to the documents.\n\nMarijuana-laced brownies and similar concoctions have been popular for years – and have exploded in states that recently legalized marijuana use and embraced professionally manufactured marijuana edibles.\n\nIn Nunn's hometown of Washington, D.C., a measure permitting the use of up to two ounces of marijuana and the possession of up to three marijuana plants went into effect in 2015.\n\nBut in Delaware and most other states, marijuana and its edible products are illegal. Delaware decriminalized possession of marijuana last year, but only for up to an ounce for personal use.\n\nNunn has been charged with dealing LSD, dealing marijuana, possession of a controlled substance (LSD), possession of drug paraphernalia, and two counts of receiving stolen property (town and park signs). He faces a maximum of five years in prison on the most severe of the drug dealing charges.\n\nThe University of Delaware's graduation is Saturday morning.\n\nPolice said they first caught on to the enterprise when he and another person were stopped for trespassing while walking on Creek Road in the area of the Pomeroy pedestrian bridge in White Clay Creek State Park May 8, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nNunn said that a backpack the other person was wearing was actually his and gave consent for the officer from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to search it, the affidavit said.\n\nInside the backpack was 15 individually packaged gel-like substances shaped like rabbits weighing 460 grams. Nunn admitted the substance was marijuana, and a test confirmed that, the affidavit said.\n\nNunn told police that he sells the edible marijuana for $10 to $15 per package, and they were being shipped to him in Delaware via the United States postal service from Colorado, according to the affidavit.\n\nNunn was released and charged three days later.\n\nThen, police were granted a warrant to search his apartment in the 200 block of E. Main St. a few weeks later.\n\nOfficers from the Newark Police Department Street Crimes Unit and DNREC executed the search on May 20 and learned the extent of the operation.\n\nThey found marijuana-infused gummy candies still in the rabbit-shaped molds in his bedroom refrigerator; one Froot Loop's bar laced with marijuana; green marijuana-laced popsicles in a mold in the freezer; LSD in tin foil nearby; a metal jar containing raw marijuana and a digital scale in the bathroom; a Nylon zipper pouch with $466 in drug proceeds; and a Magical Butter machine in the kitchen area/living room, the affidavit said.\n\nAlso inside was a heater sealer, plastic tubing and other paraphernalia, such as pipes, bongs, molds and vaporizers, the affidavit said.\n\nSTORY: Marijuana 'edibles' pack a wallop\n\nSTORY: In Sussex, heroin crime increased nearly 2,000%\n\nSTORY: Police seek help in ID'ing man wanted for thefts\n\nIn all, police found 62 doses of LSD and 3,522 grams of raw and edible marijuana – and signs for \"The Bakery,\" indicating the purpose of the marijuana business, the affidavit said.\n\nNunn was arrested and waived his Miranda rights at the scene and then again at Newark Police headquarters, the affidavit said.\n\nDuring an interview with police, he laid out how the \"The Bakery\" worked. He explained that he would use the THC oil extracted in the machine to create the goods.\n\n“Nunn admitted to using Snapchat to communicate with customers that he had new product for sale,\" the affidavit said. \"Nunn told me that his phone probably contained drug transaction information.”\n\nHe also admitted to driving to D.C. to obtain the raw marijuana for his operation and to making his deliveries both on his skateboard and in his car, the affidavit said.\n\nNunn told police he purchased his car last year with money he got from selling drugs and mentioned he recently traveled to Cuba, Belize and Miami, the affidavit said.\n\nNunn was taken into custody and arraigned at the Justice of the Peace Court 2.

Walters, who has been with the state police agency for almost seven years. He remains suspended without pay or benefits, though has not been terminated.\n\nOfficials said one of the victims did not participate in the prank and that Walters was on duty when the incident occurred. He turned off his body camera during the assault, officials said, but a program in the device meant it was only capturing video. There was no audio.\n\nOfficials released Walters' body-cam video, showing him walking up to the back of a Delaware State Police SUV that was holding the handcuffed boy. Another trooper backs out of the way as Walters strikes the boy in the face.\n\nWalters then walks around the SUV until he again comes to where the boy is being held and flashes a light at the teen, who turns his body to face the inside the vehicle. Walters hits the button to turn his body camera on, activating its audio.\n\n\"You sure about that?\" Walters is heard saying.\n\n\"Please tell me what I did? Please tell me what I did?\" the boy asks.\n\nWalters was charged with second-degree assault, a felony; deprivation of civil rights, a felony; two counts of third-degree assault, misdemeanors; and two counts of official misconduct, also misdemeanors.\n\nAttorney General Kathy Jennings said Tuesday that the man \"chose to extract his own form of personal justice\" by \"embarking on a violent rampage.\"\n\n“As a mother and grandmother, the footage in this case is hard to watch,\" Jennings said Tuesday. \"As a prosecutor, the constitutional violations are stunning.\"\n\nState Police Col. Melissa Zebley apologized to Walters' victims on Tuesday, saying the agency recognizes \"the gravity of the situation.\"\n\n\"We assure you all that we are taking every possible step to prevent such things from happening in the future,\" she said.\n\nA state police spokesperson said the agency will be looking to see if other officers violated policies.\n\n\"When an incident involving the Delaware State Police occurs, we follow a bifurcated process,\" Sgt. India Sturgis, a police spokesperson, told Delaware Online/The News Journal Tuesday. \"First and foremost, we prioritize the criminal investigation as was announced today. The next step in the process is for DSP to identify any potential policy violations committed by troopers on the scene.\"\n\nWhat happened to these teens?\n\nWalters was off duty and on his way home when he saw a 17-year-old boy near the entrance to his Elsmere neighborhood on Aug. 17, according to the indictment. Believing the boy was up to wrongdoing, Walters confronted him, causing a verbal altercation, court documents say.\n\nWalters called Elsmere police, who picked up the teen and took him to his home in the nearby development of Lancaster Village.\n\nThe teen was not charged, but the indictment says the following day Walters looked up the teen on the state’s law enforcement information database that contains addresses, pedigree and background information.\n\nA few days later, on Aug. 21, a 15-year-old boy and his friends were pranking homes in Elsmere by knocking on doors, then running away also known as “ding-dong ditch.”\n\nAbout 8:30 p.m. that day, the 15-year-old kicked Walters’ door, which startled the trooper’s girlfriend. She then called Walters, who was on duty.\n\nWalters drove toward his home, calling Delaware State Police troopers and other police agencies for assistance, the indictment said.\n\nPolice said this was reported as an attempted home invasion, sending out the state police helicopter and various K-9 units.\n\nWhile at his house, the indictment said Walters spoke to a witness who told him several juveniles had run past him and toward Taft Avenue – the street where the 17-year-old boy from the Aug. 17 incident lived.\n\nWalters and a Newport Police officer went to the home of the 17-year-old boy and, at gunpoint, removed them from the house, according to the indictment. The 17-year-old and his friend had not been involved in the ding-dong ditch prank.\n\nThe teens were forced to the ground, where one can be heard on body camera video saying, \"Please help me,\" and calling for his mom.\n\nThe teen's family said they were held in hot police cars for hours before they were released. The mother of the 17-year-old boy was told it was all a \"misunderstanding,\" Delaware Online/The News Journal previously reported.\n\nThe 17-year-old's mother said Walters had been knocking on doors in her Lancaster Village development and that he told one of the neighbors that someone had tried to break into his home.\n\n\"Some kids were over in the other neighborhood playing [ding-dong ditch], and they hit a door that belonged to a state trooper police officer,\" the mother said an officer told her. \"Your son is not on the video. He has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHer son was released after being detained for about four hours with police not providing an incident report.\n\nThe indictment claims Walters left the scene after handcuffing the 17-year-old because a state police trooper had detained the 15-year-old boy and his friends near Taft Avenue and DuPont Street.\n\nWhen Walters arrived, the indictment said, the 15-year-old was face-down on the ground as another trooper was trying to handcuff the teen.\n\nWalters then struck the 15-year-old in the back of the neck and head with his knee, according to the indictment.\n\nWith the 15-year-old’s hands cuffed behind him, another trooper took the boy to a state police SUV and was placing him in the rear passenger seat. That’s when the indictment said Walters turned off his body-cam, walked to the police vehicle and struck the boy’s face twice, causing an orbital fracture.\n\nDelaware's public corruption watchdogs\n\nWalters' charges come as the state Department of Justice's Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust − the agency charged with investigating use-of-force by law enforcement and the state's top public corruption watchdogs − recently underwent a shakeup in staffing and leadership.\n\nThe division is supposed to be staffed by four deputy attorneys general, as well as inspectors and paralegals. But departures left the division with one deputy attorney general earlier this year, requiring it to borrow attorneys from other DOJ divisions.\n\nThere are now two deputy attorneys general: the division's new director, Dan McBride, and Zoe Plerhoples.\n\nThe agency has prosecuted not only police officers, but also public officials. This includes:\n\nAnother black eye for the badge\n\nWalters' indictment adds to the growing list of Delaware law officers who have been recently charged with or convicted of crimes.\n\nSamuel Waters, a former Wilmington police officer who was captured on video slamming a man’s head into a store wall in 2021, was indicted last year by a New Castle County Superior Court grand jury. Waters' charges include two felonies that carry a sentence of up to 13 years in prison. In June, Waters was found guilty of misdemeanor charges of assault and official misconduct. He has not been sentenced.\n\nFormer Wilmington Police Sgt. Kecia M. Rosado pleaded guilty in May to assaulting another city officer during a domestic incident in 2021. Rosado was sentenced to one-year probation.\n\nJames MacColl, a former Wilmington police officer, was indicted in early 2021 on multiple felony charges after prosecutors said he tampered with and lied about the gun he used to shoot an unarmed 18-year-old two years prior. In March, a jury found him guilty of a felony for lying about the gun he used to shoot Yahim Harris. MacColl was sentenced to a year of probation and 150 hours of community service for the felony lie and a misdemeanor official misconduct guilty verdict.\n\nBrandon Cooper, a former Wilmington police officer, was charged with sending nude photos to a teenage girl he met while on duty in 2021. He pleaded guilty to lewdness, official misconduct and possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced in December to 90 days home confinement.\n\nLast year, Michael Carnevale, a former New Castle County police corporal, pleaded guilty to repeatedly pulling a 16-year-old girl's hair and dragging her by the handcuffs in 2021 while she was on her stomach. He was sentenced to one year of probation.\n\nDelaware State Police trooper James D. Boyda was placed on six-month probation after he pleaded guilty last year to illegally using a criminal justice computer system to find New Jersey vehicle information for a friend.\n\nEdwin Ramirez, a former Delaware State Police corporal, was indicted in 2021 in a fraudulent traffic warning scheme. He pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and official misconduct in October and was sentenced to a year of probation and 33 hours of community service — one hour for every false e-warning he filed.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299 or eparra@delawareonline.com.

A 40-year-old man, Elijah Crawford Sr., also was arrested for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person when the juvenile was taken into police custody, said Sgt. Andrea Janvier, a spokeswoman for Wilmington Police Department. Officers arrested the 16-year-old, whose name was not released, early Wednesday morning in Elsmere after city police developed him as the shooting suspect in gunfire that injured two people last Friday, Janvier said. The 15-year-old was shot multiple times in the stomach and in the lower extremity, and a 22-year-old woman was shot in the left leg, she said. The teen was charged with two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, three counts of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and two counts of conspiracy. Inside the home, police found a Ruger .30-caliber revolver with four rounds of ammunition, a Strum .22-caliber revolver with six rounds of ammunition, 16 live rounds of .45-caliber ammunition and 17 16-gauge shotgun shells. The teen was taken to the New Castle County Detention Center after failing to post $120,000 cash bail. Bail information and a photo of Crawford was not available Wednesday afternoon.\n\nELEVATED CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS: Wilmington firefighters responding to reports of a house fire detected a carbon monoxide leak with occupants inside a nearby home, an official said. Elevated carbon monoxide levels were detected in the basement of a home on the 600 block of N. Harrison St., Battalion Chief James Jobes said. Initially, fire crews responded to the block for a reported fire, however, upon arrival, no fire was found, Jobes said. Fire crews encountered an activated carbon monoxide detector at the scene and immediately deployed gas-detection meters inside the home, Jobes said. Emergency responders were able to determine the carbon monoxide leak stemmed from the basement of the home, Jobes said. A check of the adjacent home on North Harrison Street revealed a gasoline-powered generator running inside the residence, Jobes said. Firefighters began to ventilate both properties and removed four occupants for evaluation, Jobes said. Three of the four occupants were evaluated on scene but refused further medical attention. One person was taken by private vehicle to St. Francis Hospital for additional medical evaluation. City fire crews turned the property over to Wilmington License and Inspection, which will continue to investigate.\n\nNew Castle County\n\nPOLICE IDENTIFY PEDESTRIAN KILLED: A man killed in a fatal crash Tuesday on Kirkwood Highway in Milltown, has been identified as 47-year-old Ronald C. Salcedo, state police said Wednesday. State police troopers and paramedics were called at 11:44 a.m. Tuesday to Kirkwood Highway (Del. 2) and Limestone Road (Del. 7) for the report of a pedestrian hit, said spokesman Master Cpl. Jeffrey Hale. The crash involved a minivan and a man, he said. Salcedo was taken to Christiana Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Hale said. Salcedo was using a marked crosswalk when he entered into the path of a 2006 Dodge Caravan, driven by Phillip A. Perkins, 57, of Middletown, police said Tuesday. Perkins had a green light traveling in the eastbound direction of Kirkwood Highway when the crash occurred.

Malik McCauley, 28, of Elkton, Maryland, was driving a 2007 Chrysler 300 along Churchmans Road near Stanton about 12:05 a.m. when a state trooper on patrol in the area observed the vehicle traveling at a “high rate of speed,” said Master Cpl. Jeffrey Hale, a spokesman for the state police. As the Chrysler stopped at the intersection of Del. 4 for a red light, the trooper also noticed the windows on McCauley’s vehicle had “extremely dark tinting,” Hale said. A traffic stop revealed McCauley did not possess a valid driver’s license or motor vehicle insurance, police said. A search of McCauley outside his vehicle revealed 16 grams of heroin hidden inside of his pants, Hale said. Additionally, $6,944 in suspected drug sales was found by the state trooper in McCauley’s pocket, he said. McCauley was arrested and transported to Troop 2, Glasgow, where he was charged with possession of a controlled substance (tier 5 quantity) possession with the intent to deliver a controlled substance and operating a motor vehicle with improper window tinting. He was arraigned and committed to the Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington for lack of $80,000 secured bond.\n\nKent County\n\nSUSPECT INARMED ROBBERY ARRESTED: After nearly a year on the run, Dover police arrested a man charged with the armed robbery of two women last August using a gun and a knife.

Michael Carnevale, whose probation will be suspended upon completion of anger management courses, community service and the surrender of his police training certificate, declined to comment following his sentencing Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe two video clips released Thursday show Carnevale dragging the girl from the chain of the handcuffs fastened behind her back. The girl, who was resisting, appears to have fallen before Carnevale started dragging her while she was on her stomach.\n\nA second clip also shows him dragging the girl to a holding room before she dropped to the ground. He was then joined by another officer who helped shove her into the room.\n\n\"The actions of Mr. Carnevale seen in the video are not within the policies and procedures of the New Castle County Police and do not reflect the values and standards of the division,\" Col. Joseph Bloch, county police chief, said in a statement. \"Although I am disgusted that this incident took place, I am pleased that through the hard work of the Department of Justice – Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust and our internal investigators, Mr. Carnevale was held accountable for his actions and will never serve in law enforcement again. \"\n\nCarnevale also agreed to never seek employment or serve in a law enforcement capacity in the future.\n\nUSA TODAY OPINION — POLICING THE USA:Deputizing gone wild: Federal task forces give state and local cops ridiculously broad immunity\n\n\"The New Castle County Division of Police prides itself on the relationships we have built within the communities we serve,\" Bloch said. \"I am hopeful that our immediate response to this incident demonstrates our commitment to holding ourselves accountable and builds upon the public trust that we have established over many years of dedicated service.\"\n\nThe investigation into Carnevale's actions began on Aug. 31 after a fellow officer who witnessed the excessive use of force reported it to a commander, county police said.\n\nAccording to a Delaware Department of Justice release, the incident occurred on Aug. 30 when the girl became disorderly and resistant while she was at the police station.\n\n\"The evidence revealed that Carnevale repeatedly pulled and attempted to lift the victim by her hair, and dragged her in a prone position nearly 50 feet along the ground by the chain of the handcuffs fastened behind her back,\" the Justice Department's statement said.\n\nCarnevale, who had been with the department since 2005, completed a single-page crime report detailing a video arraignment, but did not mention any resistance by the victim or any police use of force, the Justice Department said. Carnevale also did not complete a use-of-force report.\n\nCarnevale was suspended pending the outcome of the internal investigation and retired from the police department on Oct. 3 — prior to the end of the department's investigation and before any disciplinary action could be taken.\n\nThe former officer was indicted in December on three misdemeanor charges: offensive touching, official misconduct and falsifying business records.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to offensive touching, which carried a maximum sentence of 30 days in prison and a fine. His other charges were dismissed in exchange for his guilty plea, which occurred a few days before his trial was scheduled to start on Monday.\n\nHis sentence came immediately after he pleaded guilty on Thursday.\n\nCarnevale's indictment was among the first of several incidents in which a string of Delaware officers have been charged with crimes while they were on the job.\n\nA few months after Carnevale's December indictment, the Delaware Department of Justice indicted former Wilmington police officer Samuel Waters with eight crimes, including two felonies: tampering with public records and perjury. Also indicted in March was another former Wilmington officer, Brandon Cooper, who faces charges of sexual solicitation of a child.\n\n\"We continue to be proud of the kind of work that the Division of Civil Rights and Public Trust is doing with minimal resources,\" Mat Marshall, a Justice Department spokesman, said on Thursday. \"Above all else, we are thinking of the victim and the victim's family today.\"\n\n'Really a lack of transparency around these policing issues'\n\nAdvocates of police transparency say Carnevale's case is an example of why Delaware's Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, also known as LEOBOR, needs to be revised.\n\n\"Certainly we are happy that this incident was investigated, that the officer was indicted and eventually pled guilty to this assault on the 16-year-old young woman,\" said Mike Brickner, ACLU of Delaware's executive director. \"But we also know that there is really a lack of transparency around these policing issues that Delaware's LEOBOR law is the most extreme in the country when it comes to transparency.\n\n\"Members of the public just do not have a right to information about police disciplinary matters.\"\n\nLEOBOR requires that police disciplinary actions in Delaware be kept secret from public disclosure. In many cases, the public learns of these incidents only from civil lawsuits, in which citizens sue police for causing physical injury or damages.\n\n'WE MUST NOT NORMALIZE THIS':Hundreds attend funeral for Jayland Walker after Akron, Ohio, police killing\n\nIt took the public a little over three months to learn about the incident involving Carnevale.\n\nOther states allow for public records requests from regular citizens or watchdog organizations like the ACLU, Brickner said.\n\n\"Other jurisdictions that do, especially those that have community oversight boards, they do things like periodically report out data and other statistics, how many police disciplinary cases there have been,\" he said. \"Again, we just don't know that information here in Delaware because so much of it is secret and generally law enforcement is not out there proactively sharing that information.\"\n\nDelaware lawmakers have proposed revising LEOBOR twice, but their efforts have gone nowhere.\n\nContact Esteban Parra on Twitter @eparra3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2021/10/14/university-delaware-student-charged-bb-gun-incident-dies-after-jailhouse-medical-emergency/8450784002/", "title": "University of Delaware student charged in BB gun incident dies after ...", "text": "A University of Delaware sophomore who was arrested last week after police say he threatened several people with a BB gun died following a \"medical emergency\" that began in prison, Delaware State Police said.\n\nJust before 11 p.m. on Oct. 7, corrections officers at Howard R.

His parents say he was bullied", "text": "This story explores suicide, including a mother and father's struggle after their 13-year-old son took his life. If you are at risk, please stop here and contact 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline for support.\n\nCOVINGTON, Ind. -- On the afternoon of the worst day of Terry Badger II's life, the text message from his son never came. \"Hey dad, I'm home. Going to do my homework. I'll see you here in a little bit.\"\n\nThirteen-year-old Terry Badger III sent those words, or some variation of them, every single afternoon to his dad at work, just like the morning messages Terry sent without fail that said, \"I'm up. Getting ready for school. Love you.\"\n\nHis dad got the morning message from Terry on March 6. But not the afternoon one.\n\nThat was odd. Terry was home from school. His mom, Robyn, had dropped him off just after 3 p.m. then left for a quick run to the gas station. She had no reason to think she shouldn't leave Terry alone. There were no signs.\n\nOn the car ride home, Terry had acted like he always acted, smiling, happy, nothing out of the ordinary, Robyn said. He talked like he always talked, about his plans to get his homework done so he could go to the baseball field at 4:30 p.m. to practice batting with his dad and some friends.\n\nBut Terry wasn't really thinking about batting practice or homework on that car ride home, his parents later found out. He wasn't thinking about texting his dad after school. His parents found that out when they watched the video Terry recorded just after 3 p.m. on March 6. Their son was in a very dark place.\n\nTerry believed, in those moments, his life wasn't worth living.\n\nThere were kids at Covington Middle School, the family alleges, who bullied Terry every day, asking if he shopped at Goodwill, calling him a \"fatass,\" making fun of his shoes, laughing at his haircut, telling him he was worthless.\n\n\"I get picked on every (single) day and I hate my life,\" Terry said in the video. \"You can thank (Terry listed his bullies' names) for this.\" Then Terry turned off the video and put his phone down.\n\nMinutes later, Robyn got home from the gas station and walked into Terry's room. \"I pray that no parent ever has to see ...,\" Robyn said, unable to say the words, \"what I saw.\"\n\nShe knew there was \"absolutely, not a chance\" that the call to 911 would save her son's life. But Robyn called 911 anyway, hysterical and screaming. Then she called Terry's dad at work.\n\nAll Badger heard was Robyn shrieking and screaming words he couldn't understand. \"The only way I knew what happened,” he said, ”was the city cop got on the phone and he told me.\"\n\nBadger ran out of work and sped toward his house. He pulled into the driveway of his Covington home and he saw the police officer standing on the porch with tears streaming down his face.\n\nTerry Alan Badger III was dead by suicide, five months short of his fourteenth birthday.\n\n\"And there was nothing I could do,\" Badger said. \"I'm still trying to wake up from a nightmare.\"\n\n'It just overtook him'\n\nTerry and Robyn Badger are sitting on a couch holding hands, wearing red T-shirts with the words \"Hittin Dingers TB3 44,\" the nickname and number for Terry. They are sitting, talking about their son with blankets draped over them. They can't sleep at night, their loss is still so raw and the tears are hard to stop.\n\nBadger's quilt is crafted from jerseys that Terry wore, from the time he stepped onto a baseball field at the age of 2. Robyn's blanket is covered with a massive photo of her and Terry at a baseball tournament last season. He was starting to look like a young man.\n\nTerry was a baseball phenom. There had been talk in Covington about moving Terry up to the varsity team this spring as a seventh grader, said his grandpa, the eldest Terry Badger. He was a third baseman and pitcher who could throw 71 miles an hour and who batted .400 last season, including a home run that sailed more than 300 feet.\n\nTerry had 27 home runs in his career. He signed and saved every one of those balls. He had too many championship trophies to count, too many to fit on the shelves in his bedroom. Terry was looking forward to the upcoming season playing for Indiana Nitro Gold, the top travel team in the Westfield organization's 13U age division.\n\nThe Badgers had so many hopes and dreams for their only son. But now they have one horrific memory, a memory they are fighting to keep from overshadowing all the good ones.\n\nTerry and Robyn will never go back to live in that house, the white house with a green and yellow bird feeder hanging on a tree in the front yard and a creek flowing in the back, a creek where Terry loved to set minnow traps and one day came home with a family of snakes.\n\nThat house, it once was filled with so much happiness. Now it only brings heartache.\n\nThe Badgers are living with Terry's grandparents, Terry and Mary Badger, as they look for a new home. \"I can't go back in there,\" said Robyn. Not after what she saw.\n\nTerry and Robyn said they knew their son was being bullied. He talked to them about it. \"I just tried to make him stronger, you know, let that stuff go, take it as a grain of salt, walk away, that kind of thing,\" Badger said. \"And it just overtook him.\"\n\nThere was the time Terry got a haircut, went to school the next day and was taunted. That night at 11 p.m. he told his dad he needed a different haircut. \"I'm like 'Buddy, I'm not cutting your hair. There is nothing wrong with it,’\" Badger said. \"'It's fine.'\"\n\nTerry knew it wasn't fine, not if he didn't change something. \"Dad, I'm not going back to school. I'm not getting made fun of anymore,\" he said. Badger re-cut Terry's hair as the clock neared midnight so he would go back to school. The kids found something else to pick on.\n\nHis $150 pair of Nike Air Max shoes. The kids made fun of those. Terry came home from school furious, threw them into his closet and never wore them again, his parents said.\n\nNot wearing those shoes didn't stop the taunts. Terry was 5-3 and weighed 150 pounds. He and his dad had recently started lifting together and \"you could see the chisel and the chest starting to form,\" Badger said, \"just a solid chunk of boy.\"\n\nThat's not what the kids who bullied Terry called him. They called him a \"fatass,\" his parents say. They made fun of his clothes. One day he wore sweatpants and a Purdue T-shirt, the college baseball team he dreamed of playing for. Nothing was good enough. \"Hey, you shopping at Goodwill?\" Badger said the kids asked Terry.\n\nWhen Robyn picked Terry up from school March 6, he was smiling.\n\n\"He had a good poker face,\" Robyn said. \"As parents, we asked Terry every day, 'How's school?' You have to really pay attention. You don't have a clue what's really going on inside of their heads ... until it's too late.\"\n\n'I hope it stops all the hate'\n\nThe bullying started when Terry was young, in elementary school, his parents say. It was severe enough in middle school that Badger had a meeting with Covington school officials to see what could be done to make things better for his son.\n\nThat meeting might as well have not happened, the family says. The kids continued to torment Terry.\n\nIndyStar reached out to Brady Scott, superintendent of Covington Community School Corporation, and asked if officials at the middle school were aware Terry was being bullied and, if so, had anything been done to help Terry, to prevent the bullying.\n\n\"Regarding (the bullying allegations), we have responded to those allegations by launching an independent investigation into the situation at hand,\" Scott wrote in an email to IndyStar. \"At Covington Schools, any time an incident is reported by students, we investigate and follow up as our policy directs our staff should.\"\n\nScott said the school community \"continues to mourn and heal from this tragedy. Covington schools continue to provide support to both students and staff in need.\"\n\nWhen asked if any changes were being made in school policies for bully prevention due to Terry’s death, Scott responded: \"Any potential changes that could come about would be a reflection of our independent investigation. Covington Schools is always looking for areas in all facets for continual improvement.\n\n\"Lastly, we continue to support one another through this tragedy and mourn the loss of one of our own. We also recognize that there is a student mental health crisis, not only in Covington, but across the country that we will continue to help our students deal with moving forward.\"\n\nThe visitation for Terry was held at noon March 12 at the Covington Middle School gym. The family asked attendees to wear sports gear or their favorite team's shirt to celebrate Terry's life.\n\n\"People were lined up two blocks back from the gym and it was that way for four hours,\" Badger said. \"It was definitely overwhelming, but we appreciated everything and I know he did, too.\"\n\nBadger said at his son's funeral, the family heard stories of all the wonderful things Terry had done, many they didn't know about. Since his death, they have received dozens of letters, emails and phone calls.\n\n\"The day after, I mean the day after, we had a parent contact us that their son (a junior at Covington High) had said the same thing,\" Badger said. That his life wasn't worth living. Terry saved their son's life, the parents told Badger.\n\nThey have received messages from Alaska, Oklahoma, \"all over the world,\" Badger said. \"People that don't know us. He's made a change already. He's doing his work through the whole nation and I hope we don't forget it, we just keep marching with it and it stops all this hate.\"\n\nTerry's grave is in Mount Hope Cemetery in Covington. Tony Badger, Terry's uncle, picked out his plot. No one else in the family could bring themselves to do it.\n\nThe mound of fresh earth is covered now by mementos of Terry's life. A baseball created from white and red roses sits on a stand draped by a black ribbon that reads: \"Remember TB3 No. 44Ever.\"\n\nOn the grave is a Wiffle Ball. Terry loved to crush that ball in the backyard with his cousins. There is a baseball and a miniature basketball. Terry was a point guard who could read the court like no one else, said his grandpa.\n\nTerry's grave backs up to sprawling farm fields. \"Here, he gets to see both fields all the way around, have deer coming through all the time,\" said Tony. \"He would love it here.\"\n\nTerry loved to hunt deer. He got an 8-point buck with a crossbow this season. He loved to hunt squirrels, mushrooms and wanted to hunt coyotes. He loved to fish. He still holds the family record, a 41-pound catfish. He loved the Crunchwrap Supremes from Taco Bell. He loved singing in the shower. He loved life.\n\nUntil he walked into school.\n\n'I watched my brother's soul leave his body that day'\n\nUncle Tony is pissed. Excuse his language. He is angry. He hasn't had time to truly grieve the loss of a nephew he called T-Money who was \"the best kid you would ever meet.\"\n\nHe isn't mad at Terry for what he did. He is mad about everything leading up to that afternoon. He is mad at the people who failed Terry. He is mad that a kid who always wanted to help everyone else, whose dream of playing for the St. Louis Cardinals wasn't that far fetched, who made people feel like the world was a happy place, could be gone from this earth.\n\nTony is mad that as he stood in front of the house where Terry took his life, he looked at his brother \"and I watched my brother's soul leave his body that day.\"\n\nTony said he asks himself over and over, \"Why in the (expletive) didn't he call me that day? Like why didn't he call and say, 'Hey Uncle Tony, can I come over?'\"\n\nHe has been fighting to come to terms with all of it as he tries to be a rock for his brother, Robyn and Terry's older sister, Zoe. As he tries to be there for his wife, Summer, and their three children who adored their cousin Terry. And as he tries to be there for his parents, who should never have lost a grandson.\n\nTony sat in his truck pulled on the side of a street overlooking Covington Youth Baseball's major league field on an early morning last week, where a video board flashed photos of Terry.\n\nThe photos were put up for a march the town of 2,700 people held in memory of Terry just days after his death. Three street blocks full of people marched through Covington down to the baseball fields, where a candlelight vigil was held and 44 balloons were set off.\n\nTony sat above that field last week, stared at the video board and listened to Terry's favorite song, \"Dear Sons,\" by Hosier.\n\nDad, why does things happen in life the way they do? I don't know, son, but remember this. Everything in life happens for a reason\n\nStand strong, my sons, and always be great. Listen up and pay attention. Don't listen to what the naysayers say\n\nThat song, which was played at Terry's funeral, the words to that song \"sound just like T-Money,\" Tony said. The naysayers. Stand strong. Why do things happen in life.\n\nIf his parents could talk to Terry one more time, his dad said he would tell him how much he loved him.\n\n\"Yes,\" Robyn said. \"I would squeeze him as hard as I could and just smell him, take in his smell.\"\n\n'He was going to take care of mom and dad'\n\nTerry was born in Danville, Ill., 12 miles from Covington, weighing 5 pounds, 3 ounces. He was a tiny being who grew big and strong and, who his parents say, made a monstrous impact.\n\nHe loved to make people laugh, said Robyn. And he loved meeting new people, said Badger.\n\n\"He would shake your hand and ask your name and he would wait for you to say just a little thing about you that he would remember,\" Terry's dad says, crying. \"He touched several people in many different ways.\"\n\nAfter Terry's death, his teammates told Badger life lessons they learned from Terry, \"how to be strong and work through adversity, how to work through mistakes.\"\n\nThere was the baseball game when Terry's team was down 15 or 16 runs, ready for their last at bat in the bottom of the last inning. \"I wasn't in the dugout, but a couple of kids have told me that we were down, our heads were down, we weren't talking,\" Badger said. \"And Terry came in the dugout and told them, 'Get up. We're going to win this game.' And we came back and won.\"\n\nThose teammates said Terry taught them \"that there is always a positive out of a negative, how to be friends, how to be a team, how to laugh, how to love and how to have fun,\" Badger said. \"And how to dream.\"\n\nTerry had big dreams for his modest family. Badger is a mechanical tech at Dynamic Components in Danville. Robyn is a manager at McDonald's. Terry had plans to make life better for his parents.\n\n\"He was going to the MLB to play for the Cardinals,\" Robyn said. \"He was going to take care of mom and dad. He said that ever since he was little.\"\n\nTerry always asked his parents what kind of car they wanted when he became a professional baseball player. He wanted a Lamborghini.\n\n\"He always asked if we wanted to live by ourselves or live in the basement of his house,\" Badger said. \"He always had different things on his mind but it was always about family. It was always about trying to take care of somebody.\"\n\nAnd that is why Terry's death, and how he died, is such a cruel, tragic irony for the family.\n\n\"He was always trying to be the protector,\" his dad said. \"If he saw kids getting picked on, he would stop that. He didn't like it. He wanted to be friends with everybody and just go out and play.\"\n\n'I just wish that I could talk to you again, somehow, some way'\n\n\"That was his last bat,\" Robyn says, pointing to Terry's brand new white bat lying on the living room floor next to a pair of new white batting gloves. Terry had picked it out just weeks before he died. He never got to use that bat.\n\nTerry has come to Badger in a dream just one time since he died. \"The only thing he said to me was, 'I miss you coach.'\" Badger coached so many of his son's teams. And he plans to coach again.\n\n\"That's what he wants me to do,\" he said. \"I've got to do it for him and his buddies, his Nitro team.\"\n\nBeyond all the sadness, the Badgers say, there is some peace in knowing that Terry isn't hurting every day, feeling so badly about himself.\n\n\"I know he's not struggling anymore and he's happy, he's got friends there,\" Badger said. \"He's able to play baseball on a golden field.\"\n\nThe Badgers are faithful people. They believe they will see their son again. \"He'll be waiting on us,\" Badger said, \"with his hand out.\"\n\nTerry's parents have a song they listen to over and over, \"Beat You There,\" by Will Dempsey. It brings them great comfort.\n\nDon't cry for me; I'm alright; Yeah, I'm better than you know ... And this life can be a shorter ride; So don't waste it on sorrow ... And just hold on to those moments; And the memories we shared ... We're both headed for the same place anyway ... I just beat you there\n\nHonoring TB3\n\nThe Badger family is pushing for Indiana lawmakers to pass House Bill 1483, authored by Rep.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/politics/us-embassy-kyiv-closure/index.html", "title": "US closing embassy in Kyiv and moving remaining diplomats to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States is closing the US Embassy in Kyiv and “temporarily relocating” the small number of remaining diplomatic personnel in the country to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, “due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday.\n\n“I have ordered these measures for one reason – the safety of our staff – and we strongly urge any remaining US citizens in Ukraine to leave the country immediately,” Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe moves comes days after the US ordered the vast majority of US government employees to leave the country and announced that consular services at the US Embassy would be suspended as of Sunday amid fears of an imminent Russian invasion, even as US officials stressed they remain committed to trying to find a diplomatic outcome.\n\nAlthough Moscow has said it is open to negotiation, State Department spokesperson Ned Price noted Monday that “it remains unclear to us whether Russia is interested in pursuing a diplomatic path as opposed to the use of force.”\n\nA source familiar with the matter told CNN that a Russian attack on Ukraine sometime this week is more likely than not. But if Russia does not make a move this week, the source noted, it does not necessarily mean it won’t happen – Russia can maintain its current force posture for quite some time.\n\nPrice said the decision to move all remaining diplomats from Kyiv to western Ukraine was made because the State Department felt it was “absolutely necessary” due to the “distinct possibility, perhaps more real than ever before, that Russia may decide to proceed with military action.”\n\n“We are basing our assessment on what we are seeing on the ground with our own eyes, which is a continued and unprovoked Russian buildup on the border of Ukraine and no accompanying evidence of de-escalation,” he said at a briefing at the State Department, noting that Lviv’s location “affords it a degree of protection that other places in Ukraine may not have.”\n\nPrice said there had been “great deal of meticulous planning that went into” relocating the embassy “and as a testament to that, for example, we did not have to destroy any valid passports.”\n\n“We have undertaken prudent precautions when it comes to sensitive documents, sensitive equipment, but just can’t offer a whole lot of detail there,” he said.\n\nA senior State Department official said Saturday that US diplomats had gotten rid of classified information in recent days in preparation of the embassy draw down.\n\nPrice noted that if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to invade Ukraine, “There would be widespread human suffering.”\n\nUS officials have repeatedly called on American citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, warning that a Russian invasion come at any moment, including as soon as this week.\n\n“What we are trying to do publicly is be transparent to American citizens that they should leave Ukraine immediately, because there will not be a military evacuation in the event of an invasion,” National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.\n\n‘Intention to return’\n\nPrice said the Ukrainian National Guard Police will guard the US Embassy in Kyiv, adding, “It is certainly our intention to return to that embassy in Kyiv just as soon as it is safe for us to do so.” The staff relocated to Lviv include the “core” diplomatic team, including charge d’affaires Kristina Kvien and they “will remain engaged with Ukrainian government coordinating on diplomatic efforts,” Price said.\n\nThe source familiar told CNN that they believe the gap between the US and Ukraine when it comes to the likelihood of a Russian attack is narrowing – Ukraine has been skeptical that such an invasion is imminent, but in private conversations they have been more focused on expressing concerns about how the US’ warnings about an invasion have impacted them domestically, politically and economically.\n\nBlinken spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Monday – their second conversation in a matter of days – and stressed the US and allies’ “commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including its economic and financial stability.” The two discussed macro-financial support, according to Kyiv, and the Biden administration is considering offering up to $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine amid concerns over a potential Russian invasion, multiple sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe US has also had conversations with Moscow in recent days. Blinken spoke with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ahead of President Joe Biden’s call with Putin.\n\n“On our call, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russians are working on a response to the paper that we sent to Moscow more than two weeks ago, proposing concrete areas for discussion,” Blinken said Saturday, adding that “it remains to be seen if they’ll follow through on that, but if they do we’ll be ready to engage together with our allies and partners.”\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov late Monday told CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen that Putin is “willing to negotiate,” saying the Ukraine crisis was only one part of Russia’s larger security concerns.\n\nEarlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Putin he saw a “chance” for diplomatic dialogue with the West over Russia’s security concerns, saying he recommended such efforts continue.\n\nAs of Monday, the US had yet to receive that response from Moscow, Price said, “and in order for this to bear fruit, it will also have to take place in the context of de-escalation, and that is just not something we’ve seen to date.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting Monday.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-12-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia intensifies strikes around Ukrainian capital as it warns US ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nThe Russian assault across Ukraine raged Saturday as explosions were heard in Kyiv and fighting intensified around the capital. Hours later, Russia warned the United States that it would fire on weapon shipments to Ukraine, raising the risk of direct confrontation between Moscow and a NATO country.\n\nA number of major cities are under pressure as Russian strikes hit civilian structures. Smoke rose east of the river in Dnipro early on Saturday where CNN journalists felt at least two explosions and saw the cloudy remnants of what looked like anti-aircraft fire.\n\nA large swath of Makariv, a village 30 miles west of Kyiv, has sustained significant damage from apparent Russian airstrikes.\n\nCNN geolocated and verified the authenticity of photos, posted to social media Saturday, which show major damage to apartment complexes, schools and a medical facility. One of the more stark images from Makariv shows a large hole in the northern wall of an apartment building from a military strike. Many of the buildings in the photos have sustained damage on their northern facades, evidence that points to military strikes that hit them as being Russian.\n\nIn Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, local landmark Hotel Ukraine was hit overnight. “I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,” Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday.\n\nThe northern city, which is close to the Belarus border, has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a week and video from the city showed the collapsed floors of the hotel as well as widespread damage from missiles and airstrikes.\n\nChaus said civilians were dying from the strikes, which brought down the city’s electricity network. “Many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military,” he said, saying the city has “no electricity, almost no water, gas, and heat.”\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly claimed that Russian forces are not targeting civilians.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Saturday address the whole country was now a front line. “A few small towns just don’t exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone.”\n\nZelensky said negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “must begin with a ceasefire,” adding that Ukraine has lost about 1,300 troops as of Saturday. CNN has been unable to independently verify these numbers.\n\nLater Saturday, Zelensky said that he was grateful for international support but urged allies to provide more aid.\n\n“I keep reiterating to our allies and friends abroad; they have to keep doing more for our country, for Ukrainians and Ukraine. Because it is not only for Ukraine, but it is for all of Europe,” he said. “The evil which purposefully targets peaceful cities and ambulance vans and explodes hospitals will not stop with just one country if they have the strength to keep going.”\n\nThe US and NATO say they’re taking steps to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops, and they have continued to provide Ukraine with security assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. But the US and NATO have also tried to avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden emphasized that point on Friday, that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO.\n\n“We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,” Biden said after reiterating the US’ full support to its NATO allies and promising that the US will defend “every inch” of NATO territory.\n\n“I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians’ lives,” he added.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday warned the US against transferring weapons to Ukraine, saying convoys with foreign weapons would be considered “legitimate targets.”\n\n“We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but these are actions that turn the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,” Ryabkov said Saturday on the Russian state-run Channel One, according to state-owned RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nDetermined resistance\n\nIn Ukraine, Russia has faced defiance from the public in the past two weeks. On Saturday, several hundred people swarmed the city hall in the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol following the detention of its mayor, Ivan Fedorov, by armed men the day before.\n\nShortly after Fedorov’s detention, the Russian-backed Luhansk regional prosecutor claimed Fedorov had committed terrorism offenses, allegations that Zelensky called a “crime against democracy” on Saturday.\n\nThe Zaporozhye regional administration said Saturday a new mayor had been installed. Galina Danilchenko, a former member of the Melitopol city council, was introduced as the acting mayor on local TV, according to a statement from the regional administration posted on Telegram. In her televised statement, Danilchenko said that her “main task is to take all necessary steps to get the city back to normal.”\n\nShe claimed there were people still in Melitopol who would try to destabilize “the situation and provoke a reaction of bad behavior.”\n\n“I ask you to keep your wits about you and not to give in to these provocations,” she said. “I appeal to the deputies, elected by the people, on all levels. Since you were elected by the people, it is your duty to care about the well-being of your citizens.”\n\nIn Kyiv, Russia’s advance has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces. On Saturday, the UK’s Ministry of Defence’s latest intelligence assessment said the bulk of Russian ground forces were about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the center of the Ukrainian capital.\n\nIn Berestyanka -- 10 miles west of the airbase -- a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees. Maxar Technologies\n\nMaxar satellite imagery taken on Thursday showed that the 40-mile Russian column northwest of Kyiv had largely dispersed and regrouped. But the intelligence assessment warned, “this is likely to support a Russian attempt to encircle the city. It could also be an attempt by Russia to reduce its vulnerability to Ukrainian counter attacks, which have taken a significant toll on Russian forces.”\n\nThe north and northeastern cities of Chernihiv and Sumy, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and Mariupol in the south, remain encircled by Russian forces, the ministry added.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official in the southern region of Kherson, now in Russian control, has said that the “occupiers” are pressing the regional council to agree to a referendum on the area’s “independence” from Ukraine. There’s been no word from the Russian side about any referendum plans.\n\nSimilar referendums were held after Russian-backed separatists took control in 2014 of parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. People’s Republics were later declared in both regions.\n\nUkraine’s state-operated nuclear energy company said Saturday that Russian officials had arrived at Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, demanding to take control of the facility.\n\nZaporizhzhya has been occupied by Russian forces for more than a week now, with Energoatom previously claiming its employees had been forced to work at “gunpoint.” Chernobyl nuclear power plant is also under the control of Russian forces.\n\nDespite the onslaught, Zelensky claimed on Saturday that Ukrainian forces are inflicting the “biggest blow to Russia’s army in decades,” saying that 31 Russian tactical battalion groups had lost capability, and more than 360 Russian tanks have been lost.\n\nZelensky added that groups of Russian troops were surrendering to Ukrainian forces, but that Russia is now recruiting fighters, reservists, conscripts, and mercenaries to “outnumber” Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia’s losses include Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, the third Russian general to have been killed by Ukrainian forces, a Western defense official confirmed on Friday. He was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense’s website, and the Western official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict.\n\nDeteriorating conditions\n\nAs Russia sustains losses, its bombardment of the country continues to degrade living conditions in several areas. Officials are now racing to send aid and evacuate citizens from encircled cities.\n\nUkrainian officials announced a fresh attempt to secure at least 13 evacuation corridors from different cities, despite reporting that only a few civilians could leave the previous day.\n\nAddressing the besieged city of Mariupol, Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces would guarantee a ceasefire along an evacuation corridor so supplies could enter, and civilians can leave.\n\nUkrainian emergency employees and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9, 2022. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nWith relatively clear skies over Mariupol, new satellite imagery taken Saturday morning from Maxar showed the extent of the damage there, including some caused by military strikes reported earlier in the week.\n\nIn Mariupol’s western neighborhood of Zhovteneyvi, a large – still smoldering – crater was seen near the Okko gas station. Smoke appeared to be rising from an apartment complex across the street. The roofs of warehouses down the street also appeared to have large holes from military strikes.\n\nWithin the apartment complex, several buildings seemed to have sustained significant damage. A debris field was seen surrounding some of the buildings with a large smoke plume.\n\nJust northwest of the gas station, an additional satellite image showed impact craters dotting a snow-covered field. Vehicle tread marks were also seen. Just more than a mile south, in an industrial area in the Primorskyi neighborhood, a large fire was seen raging.\n\nThere was some good news amid the destruction. A pregnant woman, whose rescue from the Mariupol maternity hospital this week was captured in a viral AP photo, gave birth to a baby girl, her family told CNN.\n\nMariana Vishegirskaya was among a number of women at the Mariupol maternity hospital who survived the shelling.\n\nHer aunt Tatiana Liubchenko said the baby was named Veronica but she was worried about the situation in the city. “We got the information that the water and food of the people there are running out and we are very worried, because the green corridor is not opened and the Russians do not allow, the food does not come. And it’s so cold there right now so they can’t get warm,” Liubchenko said.\n\nThe fighting has displaced around 2 million Ukrainians in the country, the UN said Friday, and 2.5 million people have fled its borders.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Olga Voitovych Tara John", "Tim Lister", "Olga Voitovych", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2022/03/02/beware-10-russia-ukraine-scams-via-email-phone-and-social-media/9342759002/", "title": "10 Russia-Ukraine war scams hitting you via email, phone and ...", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict is nearly 6,000 miles from our border, but it’s probably already affecting you here at home.\n\nYou probably see a hit to your 401(k) and financial portfolio. As those go down, gas prices are going up. Tap or click here for simple ways to find the best gas prices in your area.\n\nWhenever there's an event of mass impact, hackers, scammers and thieves take advantage of the situation.\n\nNote that scammers will contact you via calls, text, email or social media. If you have anyone older in your family, they are very susceptible to falling for these scams. Share this post with them on your social media or email this post with a link.\n\nHere's a list of scams we can expect to see as the Russia-Ukraine war heats up:\n\n1. Help, help, I’m stuck here\n\nHere’s an all-too-common trope: A scammer pretends to a family member or friend, claiming to be stuck somewhere and in need of money. One of the most common examples of this is the “grandparent scam,” in which a thief impersonates an older person’s grandchild and claims to be saddled with an expensive repair bill or even stuck in jail.\n\nIn this case, you may hear from a close contact who says they are stuck in Ukraine or Russia. Maybe they need money for a plane ticket out or claim to have lost their passport. They’ll raise the stakes, too, telling you they got robbed or all the banks are closed.\n\nThe scariest part is how easy it is to manipulate photos to back this up. A clever criminal can easily show your loved one in the Ukraine or Russia to make you believe it. Always check in with your loved one through another means of communication. For example, if they are texting, send an email or, better yet, give them a call.\n\nSPOT THE FAKES: How to tell if a photo has been manipulated\n\n2. We need your support now more than ever\n\nIn times of crisis, we turn to others for help or step up to assist. You need to be extra-vigilant about donating money to GoFundMe pages or other relief efforts right now. Scammers use our kindest instincts against us to steal money through fake aid campaigns.\n\nIf you are donating money through an organization like the American Red Cross, for example, be sure you’re on the actual Red Cross site and not a cleverly disguised phishing site. It’s easy to copy the look of a website and steal official logos. The real tipoff is the URL. Don’t rely on a link you received from someone or clicked on social media; navigate to the official website yourself.\n\n'IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER ON PEOPLE':How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE? These apps and websites can help you send money\n\n3. But it looks and sounds SO real\n\nToday's deepfake technology makes it easier than you'd believe in producing high-quality videos or audio clips of a public figure saying or doing something that never happened in real life.\n\nAs you encounter videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other political figures on social media or YouTube, keep your guard up. If the video is designed to make you angry or act in some way, it very well may be a disinformation campaign at work.\n\nRemember, disinformation videos are designed to look natural. It's not uncommon for these videos to use computer-generated image technology and paid actors.\n\nTap or click here to listen to my podcast on how the lies that spread on social media can change history.\n\n4. I have money, lots of money\n\nThis one is a twist on the old Nigerian Prince scams. Someone with a lot of money needs to move that money to leave the country – but they can’t do it without your help. Of course, you’ll need to pay transfer fees. If you receive such a message, report it as spam and delete it.\n\nScam texts aren’t just annoying. They’re one more way for tricky scammers to trick you into giving up your information or your money. Tap or click for tricks to spot scam texts and your best defense against them.\n\n5. I can show you how to time the market\n\nIn times of strife, there’s always someone looking to make a buck. The stock market and cryptocurrency are down, and that presents an opportunity – at least that’s what a crook wants you to believe. The same goes for pitches you get to invest in stocks from cybersecurity companies to ammunition.\n\nHere’s the truth: Anyone that who reaches out to you unsolicited with financial advice is in it to make money themselves.\n\n6. If I could just give my loved one a proper burial\n\nThe funeral scam surfaces during national tragedies, natural disasters and wartime: Pleas for money to bury deceased family members or money for plane tickets to attend a funeral. It’s easy to see why people fall for this ploy.\n\nEmotions take over, and you want to help. Treat emails or other communications with caution, and don’t send money directly to someone you don’t know through a payment app or website.\n\n7. I’m defending your freedom\n\nFraudsters won't just play on your emotions to help others. They will appeal to your sense of patriotism too. Think twice if you hear from someone claiming to be an American soldier stuck in Ukraine.\n\nThe American service personnel con may ask you for money, help get a message to their family, or supplies. Similarly, these requests can come from someone claiming to be a Ukrainian or Russian soldier too.\n\nRELATED: 5 silly mistakes putting your online privacy and security at huge risk\n\n8. Do as I say or else\n\nCybercriminals often use urgency to push us to make bad decisions. When you’re feeling flustered, you may do things you wouldn’t in a calmer state. That’s why phony calls threatening jail time from the IRS work so well.\n\nThat's also why fake emails or calls from your boss or a higher-up at your company work too. They almost always have an urgent tone, asking you to send money or information right now.\n\nIf you receive an unusual request, contact this person in another way to verify the request.\n\n9. It looks so legit\n\nGas prices are going up, and you can bet fake sites and apps that tell you where the lowest gas prices are in your area will be coming out of the woodwork. Don’t trust anything new that pops up.\n\nInstead, go with an established option you can trust. I like Waze and GasBuddy for this purpose. Tap or click here for a direct download link for GasBuddy and steps on how to use it.\n\n10. I will love you until the end of time\n\nRomance scams are incredibly effective. The FBI says victims of romance fraud lost $1 billion in 2021 – and that's just what was reported. Why do they work so well?\n\nWhen we’re falling in love or just attracted to someone, our defenses are down. We don’t want to believe that a beautiful woman or charming man isn’t who they say they are.\n\nBe on the watch for anyone who tells you they need to leave Ukraine or Russia immediately because of the war, and they want to build a new life with you. This scammer will send you photos, videos and even start sexting with you. Then, the money requests start for food, rent, and airline tickets to come to see you.

Markets across the globe plunged.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON INVASION\n\nAttacks and explosions have been reported throughout Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, where air sirens rang out Thursday morning and afternoon. Russian forces appeared to be encircling the city and looked poised to invade, Ukraine’s deputy interior minister told CNN.\n\nOfficials in the country believe Russia’s plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.\n\nIn a video statement late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said he believes “enemy sabotage groups” had entered Kyiv and that he was their No. 1 target. His family, he said, was the second target.\n\n“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said, adding he was staying in the government quarter.\n\nUkraine’s democratically elected government remains intact, but has declared state of emergency that will begin Friday.\n\nIn an emotional speech Thursday afternoon, Zelensky called on world leaders for support, warning that if Ukraine doesn’t get help now, “war will come knocking at your door tomorrow.”\n\nAccording to preliminary figures, 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed since the invasion began early Thursday, Zelensky said, with another 316 soldiers wounded.\n\nIn a declaration signed late Thursday, Zelensky ordered a general military mobilization “in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations.” At the same time, the country barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'This morning has gone down in history': Ukrainian president addresses nation amid Russian invasion 04:38 - Source: CNN\n\nWestern leaders were united in their swift and strong condemnation of Russia’s military action.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had “committed an assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace.”\n\n“Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,” Biden said\n\nBiden announced a raft of new sanctions to punish Moscow, some of which limit Russia’s ability to do business using important global currencies such as the dollar and the euro and target Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.\n\n“Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” said Biden.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war” and said it put “countless innocent lives” at risk.\n\n“Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,” he said. “NATO allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. It is a blatant violation of international law, an act of aggression against a sovereign independent and peaceful country.”\n\nNATO will increase land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank, the security alliance said in a statement.\n\nRussians give their rationale for invasion\n\nPutin had kept the international community on a knife’s edge for months, as the world watched and waited to see what exactly the Kremlin planned to do with the estimated 150,000 troops it deployed on Ukraine’s borders.\n\nAfter repeatedly denying any plans to invade Ukraine, Putin said in a televised address early Thursday that Russia would be conducting a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains Donetsk and Luhansk, the separatist-held regions that Moscow recognized as independent on Monday – in violation of international law.\n\nPutin said earlier this week he was ordering troops to the breakaway enclaves to act as “peacekeepers.”\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told foreign journalists that the “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine are among the objectives of Russia’s military action in the country.\n\n“Ideally, Ukraine should be liberated, cleansed of Nazis, of pro-Nazi people and ideology,” Peskov said, though he refused to say if that meant regime change in Kyiv. The Russian claim of a need to “denazify” Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless. Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, is Jewish.\n\nThe Russian strongman urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government.\n\n“Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,” he said, but threatened “those who may be tempted to intervene” on Ukraine’s behalf.\n\n“Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,” he said.\n\nResidents refuel at a gas station in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nInvasion launched before dawn\n\nThe first blasts were heard at around 5 a.m. local time Thursday, and it quickly became clear that Moscow’s military assault was not limited to eastern Ukraine.\n\nCNN teams on the ground heard explosions in and near multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv; the second-largest city, Kharkiv; Odessa; and distant firing from Zaporizhzhiya.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev, near Kharkiv, on February 24, 2022. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUkrainian officials said on social media that Russia was staging attacks far and wide, shelling control centers such as airfields and military headquarters in Kyiv and Kharkiv. The Russian military has, according to a senior US defense official, been targeting “military and air defense” targets, meaning “barracks, ammunition warehouses, nearly 10 airfields,” the official said.\n\nImages released by Zelensky’s office showed large explosions to the east of Kyiv with huge columns of smoke rising into the air. At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nZelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing “exceptionally” in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine’s north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the scene of Europe’s worst nuclear disaster.\n\nUkraine’s borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. The Russian military claimed Ukraine’s border service “did not provide any resistance” and claimed to have “suppressed” Ukraine’s air defenses. CNN was not able to immediately verify either of those claims.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian tanks roll past CNN reporter as they appear to head toward Ukraine (February 2022) 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nThree military facilities in the western Lviv region were attacked, according to the regional governor.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN that Ukrainian troops had retreated from “fierce fighting” with Russian forces for control of the strategic Antonov air base on the outskirts of the Kyiv but were staging a counterattack. Earlier Thursday, large numbers of helicopters dropped Russian troops at the air base to secure it, he said.\n\nA CNN team spoke with Russian airborne troops on the perimeter of the air base, only about 20 miles from the heart of the capital, and heard exchanges of fire with Ukrainian forces.\n\nCivilians hide in subway stations amid fighting\n\nThe violence near the capital forced families to crowd into subway stations, as city authorities issued an air raid warning and urged residents to seek shelter underground. Across the country, Ukraine’s subway stations are doubling as bomb shelters, as the assault continues and fears of strikes grow.\n\nHeavy traffic could be seen clogging roads heading west out of the capital as dawn broke, while further east, near the Russian border, the mayor of Kharkiv urged citizens not to leave their homes.\n\nUkrainians have largely remained divided about the possibility of a Russian invasion, hoping that the military buildup was just the latest in Moscow’s mind games. After months of ratcheting up tensions, the wide-scale military assault still came as a shock – especially in Kyiv, where residents had, until Wednesday, continued to go about their daily lives as foreign governments withdrew their diplomatic staff from the capital.\n\nA local resident sits in a car while preparing to leave Mariupol, eastern Ukraine. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\n“You wake up at 5 a.m. to a totally new reality, and you find out the world is no longer the safe place you imagined,” one woman in Kharkiv told CNN.\n\n“I can’t believe it’s happening, really.”\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time, and the capital went dark late Thursday as residents left the streets deserted and either switched off their lights or drew their curtains.\n\nWhile major details about the incursion – including total casualties – remain shrouded in the fog of war, UK military intelligence earlier said more than 80 strikes had been carried out against Ukrainian targets, while a senior US defense official said the Russians had launched more than 160 missiles.\n\nRussia also deployed 75 fixed-wing heavy and medium bombers in the initial attack and initiated “some ground incursions” into Ukraine from Belarus, northwest of Kyiv, the US official added.\n\nThe Russian military released a statement Thursday claiming it was not targeting Ukrainian cities, saying “the civilian population is not at risk.” Still, many Ukrainians chose to leave the capital, while others hunkered down in shelters.", "authors": ["Matthew Chance Nathan Hodge Tim Lister Laura Smith-Spark Ivana Kottasová", "Matthew Chance", "Nathan Hodge", "Tim Lister", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/europe/ukraine-war-status-intl/index.html!", "title": "Donbas: It's nearly three months since Russia invaded Ukraine ...", "text": "Photos: Russia invades Ukraine Cars burn after a Russian military strike in central Kyiv, Ukraine, on October 10.

Support staff and administrative positions would also be reduced and all of the district's expenditures would be frozen.\n\nThe district is trying to get the word out by hosting community meetings to explain what it's asking for.\n\nThe district took its bid for synthetic turf athletic fields off of the ballot, but kept the rest of the request the same. It is asking voters for an extra 28 cents per $100 of assessed value in order to support the regular operating budget and is asking for money to fund a capital project, which would cover work on three school buildings and the demolition of a school that has been empty since 2010.\n\nThe capital project would cost local property owners just over $19 million, but it wouldn't actually increase the taxes they've been paying because it would pick up where a large capital project, passed in 2005, left off. That was a $63 million project that renovated two schools, built three new ones, demolished one, relocated the district office and purchased a transportation facility.\n\nSTORY: The path to college for first-generation students\n\nSTORY: Essay make Concord valedictorian momentarily famous\n\nThe last time that the district asked for a referendum and won was in 2012 and, at that time, it had planned to get through three years before putting up another one, Holodick said.\n\n\"We got an additional year out of that referendum,\" he said, since it has now been four years, each of which typically brings increases in expenses for staff and energy.\n\nThe district has also lost revenue from industrial tax payers totaling $1.4 million, Holodick said.\n\nSince 2013, the Evraz steel plant in Claymont closed, Astrazeneca consolidated its operations and Chemours closed its Edge Moor plant.\n\nHolodick will be giving the presentations at each community meetings, accompanied by other administrators, and will take questions, he said.\n\nContact Saranac Hale Spencer at (302) 324-2909, sspencer@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @SSpencerTNJ.\n\nINFORMATIONAL MEETINGS\n\nScheduled for 7 p.m. on:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/04/29/delaware-schools-struggle-proposed-cuts/100565074/", "title": "Delaware schools struggle with proposed cuts", "text": "Jessica Bies, and Matthew Albright\n\nThe News Journal\n\nEducators and parents are up in arms over $37 million in budget cuts to public schools proposed by Gov. John Carney and vow a fight in the General Assembly to stop them.\n\n\"At some point in time, we have to look at our future and stop robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Jeff Day, who is running for a spot on the Christina school board and has children in the Appoquinimink district.\n\nCarney has said he would rather not be making any cuts but said \"shared sacrifice\" is necessary in the face of the state's nearly $400 million budget deficit.\n\n\"These are extremely modest cuts in the scheme of things, and other cabinet agencies are being cut a lot more,\" Carney said. \"All we're asking is that our school boards do a little more to run a little more efficiently.\"\n\nSTORY: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nSTORY: Fear spreads through Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nThe cuts are only 1.5 percent of the state's $1.37 billion public school budget, the governor noted.\n\nAbout $15 million of the cuts will come straight from school districts' operational funds, money that generally isn't used to pay teachers but covers training, technology and other administrative costs.\n\nAn additional $22 million will come from something called the \"education sustainment fund,\" which is used for a much wider range of services like math and reading specialists, after-school programming and paying staff salaries over the summer, before tax receipts come in.\n\nCarney's plan would allow districts to make up the $22 million cut by giving school districts a one-time shot at raising property taxes – without asking their voters in a referendum. It would need the approval of the General Assembly.\n\nThat would leave only a $15 million cut spread over the entire system, the governor reasons.\n\nBut school board members say the decision to raise that so-called \"match tax\" would put them in the painful position of losing money or outraging taxpayers at a time when many school boards already are struggling to pass referendums.\n\nSchool board members also say the property tax increases would unfairly burden taxpayers in property-poor districts.\n\n“It’s foolish, I think, and a fool’s errand when the state is facing a big deficit like it is, to argue the state shouldn't cut education,\" Appoquinimink school board President Richard Forsten said. “Times are tough and everyone needs to tighten their belts … but if we’re going to do it, it needs to be fair.”\n\nA tight timeline\n\nThe General Assembly has until June 30 to debate the state budget, and school districts have only until July 13 to get tax warrants to their local counties, giving them little time to ponder a final decision on the match tax.\n\nThe dilemma for superintendents and principals is that state law mandates any teacher laid off must be notified no later than May 15.\n\nSTORY: Carney proposes tax hikes, spending cuts in state budget\n\nSTORY: Delaware's budget hole deepens by $35.6 million\n\nDistricts will need to plan for cuts they aren't even sure are coming. That means they might be sending pink slips to employees they might not need to fire.\n\nConversely, the cuts may deepen and they may have dip into their reserves or get rid of school programs.\n\nRep. Melanie George Smith, D-Bear and chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, acknowledges the timing is tough for districts. But she said it's too early in the General Assembly to give a final ruling.\n\nLawmakers still have to settle the thorny question of how much to cut and how much to raise revenue. Carney has proposed an equal balance of tax increases and spending cuts, but lawmakers don't have to follow that rule.\n\nWhile there's little appetite among lawmakers to balance the budget with nearly $400 million in tax increases — thus avoiding cuts entirely — they could lean a little heavier on taxes than Carney did. They could expand Carney's proposed increases to the income tax, corporate franchise tax and tobacco tax. Or they could impose other hikes, like expanding the lodging tax or adding to the alcohol tax.\n\nThat could mean the proposed cuts to education would vanish or diminish.\n\nThis revenue issue is perhaps the biggest question looming over the current General Assembly. And Smith said her committee won't know how to handle education cuts until that question is answered.\n\n\"We on JFC can't say what we're going to do until our 62 colleagues decide what kind of revenue we have to work with,\" Smith said.\n\nShe said it's also possible her committee will find other, less painful places to cut education spending.\n\n\"The question isn't how much we're cutting; the question is what we're cutting,\" she said. \"We can find places to cut spending that don't affect direct instruction.\"\n\nBut \"there really are no easy answers here,\" George cautioned.\n\nIf state government were to avoid education cuts, it would have to make deeply painful cuts elsewhere. Education makes up about one-third of the budget.\n\nThe only other part of government that is anywhere near that size is health and social services, on which the state spends about $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues below graph.\n\nSchools have been taking up a greater share of the state budget each year because state officials are required by law to increase funding as the number of students in public schools grows. As a result, the number of education employees in Delaware has grown significantly even as the number of other government workers has declined.\n\nSTORY: Gov. John Carney: Fix budget, update Coastal Zone Act\n\nIn 2009, there were 16,877 school district employees — as of this February, that number had grown to 19,422. During the same period, the number of other state government employees shrank from 14,103 to 13,338.\n\nWhile Carney has insisted he does not intend for schools to cut staff, salaries are the biggest part of every district's budget. Which has several of them looking at layoffs.\n\nTo tax or not to tax?\n\nThe cuts are worse if school boards don't impose the referendum-less \"match tax.\"\n\nFor instance, Christina School District is estimating total losses of about $5.86 million — $3.9 million of which it could potentially recover via the match tax.\n\nThat means raising taxes 7.3 cents per $100 of assessed property value. For example, a home in Windy Hills, Newark, recently sold for $224,000 has an assessed property value of $63,700 and would face a potential annual property tax increase of $46.50, according to district records.\n\nIn comparison, Christina’s last referendum, held in 2016, raised taxes by 30 cents, an increase of about $191 per year on a similarly valued home.\n\nEven if the district ultimately decides to raise taxes without voter approval, it still would have to make about $2 million in cuts, according to Christina Financial Manager Bob Silber. Due to timing considerations, it's also making plans for the full $5.9 million.\n\nCausalities could include the district's Montessori Program, which has an enrollment of about 60 students and was recently re-committed to by the school board. Another option is to discontinue elementary instrumental music and elementary and secondary string music classes.\n\nThe cuts seem large, but for some school districts, reductions are compounded by the fact they already planned on making large ones next year.\n\nTake Indian River, which days before Carney released his budget had outlined $1.72 million in reductions.\n\nThough it recently passed a $7.35 million referendum, the district has been struggling financially and planned on reducing the amount of paid coaching staff for athletics and some salary reductions, including eliminating non-athletic extra pay for extra responsibilities.\n\nThe plan was to streamline programs, not eliminate them. But now, with Indian River facing a total of about $3.4 million in cuts, the scope of that original budget reduction plan could change. Passing the “match tax” would raise taxes about 12.5 cents per $100 of assessed property value, Superintendent Mark Steele told residents during a recent \"town hall\" held on Facebook Live.\n\nSTORY: Colonial takes another shot at referendum, warns of cuts\n\nSTORY: Indian River School District faces $3.4M in cuts\n\nFor Colonial, which is holding a referendum June 6, there's even more on the line.\n\nThe district's last referendum, in February, was voted down, which means the district was already considering cuts.\n\nShould the June referendum also be defeated, Colonial is preparing to implement over $4 million in reductions for the 2017-2018 school year, including 120 layoffs. The budget cuts add roughly another 50 layoffs, bring the total to 170.\n\nThose estimates are based on the total cuts the district could see in the budget — about $3 million — and does not include the match tax.\n\n\"The idea of the referendum is really to make us whole,\" Colonial Superintendent Dusty Blakey said. \"To keep us at our operating level currently.\"\n\nShared sacrifice\n\nOther school districts, like Appoquinimink, are approaching the education cuts a little differently. The district is considering reducing transportation costs, reducing its budget for substitute custodians and eliminating up to 17 teachers, among other things.\n\nForsten, the school board's president, seems to realize cuts, if not inevitable, are likely. He's trying to prepare for them.\n\nHe and the district's financial director, Charles Longfellow, are working to ensure that even if the district has to raise taxes, it's doing so in a way that's fair to local residents.\n\nBecause the way Carney has proposed doing it, that's not fair, Forsten said.\n\nHe said because the cuts aren't based on districts' property tax bases, some Delaware homeowners will have to pay only a little bit more in taxes each year, while homeowners in districts like Appoquinimink would shell out a pretty significant chunk of change.\n\nForsten used Brandywine, which like Appoquinimink is facing about $3 million in total cuts, as a comparison.\n\nIf Brandywine and Appoquinimink both had to cover the total $3 million, he said, the taxes in Appoquinimink would be higher.\n\nIn Brandywine, a home valued at $63,700 would face annual property tax increase of about $56. In Appoquinimink, where rates needed to be raised more because there's less taxable property, taxes will go up by about $95.\n\nForsten thinks the formula for calculating the cuts needs to be changed, so residents all pay roughly the same.\n\nAt a board workshop Wednesday night, not all agreed.\n\nChristina's Day says instead of suggesting changes to how the cuts are made, school boards throughout the state should be rallying against any cuts at all.\n\n\"Don't roll over, acquiesce and say, 'Yes, Dover, if you give us the authority to match tax, we'll use it,'\" Day said. \"Otherwise, they'll just keep doing this.\"\n\nHe also thinks resources given to school districts should be the same across the state, and that Appoquinimink should be fighting to eliminate the cuts altogether instead of looking out for its \"best interests\" and making sure it doesn't have to pay significantly more in taxes than Brandywine or Christina.\n\n\"I think we should be fighting so that all kids in the state are not hurt by this budget,\" Day said.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

School referendums splinter communities", "text": "Matthew Albright, and Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nVoters are set to consider three referendums statewide that would would raise almost $500 million.\n\nSchool district officials say they're forced to ask for money because of the state's complex funding system.\n\nThe regular referendums have sparked tension among voters who are asked to fund education.\n\nSpring is the time of year when education turns into politics, when school districts give residents a choice: Vote to raise property taxes or face teacher and program cuts.\n\nNobody — not seniors, not parents, not even school officials who say the money is desperately needed — like asking for a tax hike.\n\nSchool supporters and parents bemoan the fact that educators and parents are forced to campaign for referendums, rather than focus on teaching children.\n\nWhat's frequently misunderstood by citizens is that referendums are often intended only to keep the status quo, supporters say. But Delaware's complex school funding system has made it difficult to convince voters the increases are necessary to cover growing student enrollment and maintenance costs.\n\n\"There's so much time and energy that has to be poured into it, it's just hundreds and hundreds of man hours,\" said Eve Buckley, a Christina School District parent who is one of the volunteer leaders in an effort to pass that district's referendum on Wednesday. \"And it's time you're using just in hopes of staying where we are, maybe getting a little better, not providing some big new idea. The process is a real drain.\"\n\nBrandywine and Cape Henlopen also are seeking voters' approval that day. The three referendums combined would raise almost $500 million.\n\nThe success of those votes comes down to whether district officials can coax enough parents with children in public schools to go to the polls. They must outnumber those who don't feel they have a stake in the schools or who feel districts should do more to prove they deserve a tax increase.\n\n\"If I go to my boss and haven't done what I'm supposed to ... I don't ask for a raise,\" said Susan Welsh, who wants to see Christina begin to improve student test scores and find efficiencies before she votes in favor. \"I love my child enough to vote 'no' and hold them [the district] accountable to raising the ranking before I give them a raise.\"\n\nDistrict supporters say referendums aren't a luxury. They are a necessity.\n\nMoney that pays for schools is a mix of state, federal and local funds. While the state's portion grows as districts enroll more students, the local portion comes from property taxes that don't increase to match growing costs.\n\nIf districts don't get the money to cover those costs, the results can be demoralizing, Buckley says.\n\n\"You want to think you're part of a community that is at least reasonably supportive of public education, and then something like what happened last year takes place,\" she said. \"And then you start to worry about this negative feedback loop, where people think the district isn't worthy, so then we have to cut budgets. And that means the schools suffer, and the perception only gets reinforced.\"\n\nActing Christina Superintendent Bob Andrzejewski says its dangerous to leave districts without a steady, reliable base of funding.\n\n\"There are no reruns when it comes to education,\" he said. \"If a student misses out on important educational services because there's no money, you can't go back and make that up later.\"\n\nChristina is seeking about $16 million, which would amount to roughly $192 a year more in taxes for the average homeowner, according to the district. That money would be used to plug some of the holes left after the district slashed $9 million from its budget last year and would also add some new programs.\n\nBrandywine is asking taxpayers for money to cover operating expenses, for work on school buildings and to put synthetic turf on its athletic fields. It estimates that an average home-owner would pay an extra $243 per year for the next three years and $206 per year after the $1.7 million turf project will be done. The district needs $19.3 million for the building projects and $9.5 million for operating expenses.\n\nThe referendum in Cape Henlopen is a little different – it is asking voters for money that would be used strictly for building two elementary schools and doing work on two others, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999. The total cost for the project is $154.5 million, but local taxpayers are being asked to shoulder $48.4 million of it.\n\nSwaying the public\n\nThe base of the bloc that typically votes against referendums is believed to be older residents who don't have children, don't directly benefit from the tax increases and are often on fixed incomes.\n\nOlder residents vote more than younger residents. And low-income families are less likely to vote than more affluent families, who may not send their children to traditional public schools, Buckley said.\n\nThat stacks referendums against the districts.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge, no question,\" Buckley said.\n\nIn Christina's first referendum last year, when voters slapped down a tax increase by an almost three-to-one margin, turnout in more affluent suburban areas dwarfed turnout in poorer urban areas.\n\nSTORY: Robocalls used in Christina schools referendum\n\nSTORY: Wilmington redistricting plan advances on shaky ground\n\n\n\nIn five polling places in Wilmington, there were a total of 258 votes. At a single suburban polling place – McVey Elementary, just off the University of Delaware campus – more than 556 people voted.\n\nThe vote failed 2,119 – 6,076.\n\nWhen Christina took a second shot with a smaller referendum last year, the district made more energetic efforts to get the word out to voters, and turnout evened out somewhat. The referendum failed again, but this time by less than 900 votes out of more than 11,000.\n\n\"The support's there,\" said Brian Stephan, a parent with two children in Christina and co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee. \"It's just tapping into it and letting them know where to be and what you're voting for.\"\n\nPart of the problem, supporters say, is that the state's school finance system is so complicated.\n\nStephan points out that school referendums are the only time residents get to choose whether to tax themselves. For other taxes, elected representatives choose when to raise rates; citizens vote those representatives out if they don't like their choices.\n\n\"It's the one chance that people get, so they tend to vent some of their frustrations,\" he said. \"It doesn't just become about school taxes, it's all taxes. And that makes it hard for us.\"\n\nReferendum opponents do frequently bring up other tax proposals.\n\n\"The governor wants to put more money in for the gas tax, he wants to give more money to the casinos,\" said Marie Lulfs, a 76-year-old Christina resident. \"Everybody wants more money, and where are they getting it from? The taxpayer.\"\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nNobody knows the impacts of a failed referendum quite like Christina parents and teachers.\n\nAfter voters twice rejected tax increases last year, the district made more than $9 million in cuts, laying off 78 teachers and 14 aides.\n\nStephan's daughter's first-grade class has 37 students, far more than last year.\n\n\"That has been an extreme challenge for her teacher and for her,\" Stephan said. \"You can just tell when she comes home from school.\"\n\nSupporters like Stephan say it is hard to make voters understand that operating referendums don't necessarily mean a district is seeking new goodies. In some cases, like Christina's, they are simply asking for enough money to preserve the level of services.\n\nAbout 55 percent of Christina's budget comes from state funding, while 38 percent comes from local property taxes (the rest comes from federal sources).\n\nThe state's share of school taxes grows as the district adds students, but the property tax revenue doesn't always do so.\n\nUnlike many states, school taxes don't automatically adjust for inflation. So when costs of things like fuel and electricity go up, the money a district gets from property taxes buys less and less.\n\nIf more of the budget goes toward overhead, there is less available for educational programs.\n\nThat argument hasn't convinced some referendum opponents.\n\n\"They got $20 million five years ago – it didn't do anything,\" said Welsh. \"So what's this $16 million going to do? There's no proof in the pudding.\"\n\nA better system?\n\nMichael Griffith, who studies school finance issues at the Colorado-based Education Commission of the States, said local school funding mechanisms vary widely from state to state. When it comes to picking the best method, he said figuring out \"the one true religion is probably easier than this.\"\n\nMost states require voter approval for school tax increases, he said. But many allow districts the choice to occasionally raise taxes by a small amount, usually tied to an inflation rate, without going to voters.\n\n\"If you believe in public education, as we do, the quality of our childrens' educational experience should not depend on a vote,\" Andrzejewski said. \"There are very few states left in the country that require referendums for operating expenses.\"\n\nAndrzejewski, who was previously Red Clay superintendent and has worked on several referendums, argues the state should move to a similar system. Delaware's vo-tech school districts, he points out, are given the ability to raise taxes up to a certain cap before getting the General Assembly's approval.\n\n\"There is a politically accepted, viable model that Delaware already has,\" Andrzejewski said. \"School board members are elected officials just as the General Assembly is. They should be trusted to make a prudent financial decision on behalf of the community.\"\n\nFor taxpayers, Andrzejewski said a system like this would allow districts to raise taxes gradually over time, instead of periodically hitting them with one big increase all at once. Inflation rates are typically under two percent; by contrast, Christina is looking for a 21 percent increase in its tax rate.\n\nThere are two big caveats, Andrzejewski says.\n\nFirst, school board members should be required to get financial training and should be penalized if they don't.\n\nAnd second, districts should still be required to go to referendum for major new programs or building campaigns.\n\nAre schools 'electioneering?\n\nAnother problem is Delaware districts are sometimes accused of employing underhanded tactics to get the votes they need.\n\nThe same day Christina's first referendum failed in 2015, Red Clay passed one. Almost immediately, some residents cried foul.\n\nMany Red Clay schools held parent engagement events on the night of the vote in their buildings, which serve as polling places. Several older voters said those events crowded parking lots, denying them parking spaces that were close enough for them to make it in to vote. It also boosted turnout among parents.\n\nAn ACLU of Delaware lawsuit over those claims is still making its way through the courts. Red Clay maintains that it took sufficient steps to provide enough parking and argued it frequently holds events at schools to keep parents engaged in their kids' education.\n\nSTORY: Christina School District takes third try at referendum\n\nSTORY: UD to make SAT optional\n\nState Sen. Karen Peterson, D-Stanton, received numerous complaints from constituents.\n\n\"Last year's Red Clay district referendum was the poster child for what's wrong with the whole system,\" Peterson said. \"There was so much electioneering that went on inside the polling places that it was just an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nPeterson says this isn't the first time a district has been accused of electioneering, referencing a so-called \"Pizza-gate\" incident a few years ago in which Smyrna schools threw pizza parties at schools on referendum night.\n\n\"I couldn't stand inside a polling place and hand out pizza if you voted for me,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson has proposed a bill that would change how districts go out to referendums.\n\nFirst, schools could only seek one referendum a year, at the same time as school board elections. That would save the state Department of Elections money and force districts to make one pitch for what they really need.\n\nThe fact that districts often come right back with referendum requests if a previous one fails upsets many opponents.\n\n\"If you say 'no' once, I mean 'no,\" Lulfs said. \"You don't have to keep shoving it down my throat.\"\n\nPeterson's bill would also have referendums conducted via mail. That would make more voters aware of the issues, she said, and prevent the inherent problems in having polling places that directly benefit from the results of a vote.\n\n\"We don't have to worry about all this going on at the schools,\" she said.\n\nWhile Peterson argues these changes would make the system fairer, she agrees with some school supporters who say broader change is a good idea.\n\n\"These districts can get in a really bad place, because this is money they really do need,\" she said. \"But you're asking people to vote for a tax on themselves. Something has to change.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428, or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.

Thomas Wagner Jr. “At the end of the day, if you are the board, it is your responsibility.”\n\nAmong the processes questioned were unauthorized use of the board president’s signature stamp to approve transactions, a payroll process controlled entirely by the CFO “that severely lacked documentation and review” and an abundance of in-state meals that did not appear to meet the criteria provided by the state’s Budget and Accounting Manual.\n\nSeveral employees stated they were forced to share log-in credentials into the state’s accounting system, which is a violation of the state’s computer usage security policies, according to the audit.\n\nSeveral types of purchases were deemed inappropriate or questionable based on a lack of supporting documentation. Those included a Teacher of the Year ceremony held at Baywood Greens for approximately $7,000, Alex and Ani bracelets totaling $352 for certain district office staff and a Tiffany & Co. bracelet for $380 as a recognition gift to Superintendent Susan Bunting.\n\nIn December 2015, the auditor's office received complaints on its fraud hotline about alleged financial misconduct by district CFO Patrick Miller. The audit of the district’s $50 million annual budget began shortly after Miller was placed on leave April 24. Miller later submitted his resignation, effective June 30.\n\nSTORY: DuPont to end pension contribution for active employees\n\nSTORY: Student breathalyzers anger Smyrna parents\n\nWhen the audit was launched for the time period of July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016, district officials did not reveal what led to Miller’s involuntary leave or the state of the audit itself. On Thursday, district grant writer David Maull said comment would be reserved until a Friday morning briefing at the district office in Selbyville.\n\nWagner said Bunting and the Indian River School District were very cooperative during the investigation.\n\n“They accepted the findings and want to fix the problems in the district,” Wagner said. “Dr. Bunting has asked for our help. I think in a year and a half from now, Indian River will be running smooth and fine. She seriously wants to fix the problems.”\n\nThe findings come less than a week before Indian River School District's referendum seeking additional local funding for school security programs, technology, textbooks, student organizations and measures related to enrollment growth.\n\nWagner waved off any suggestion the timing was political, saying people are going to think what they want.\n\n“The two don’t equate to each other. We just try to put the facts out there in a timely manner,” he said.\n\nIn the Nov. 22 referendum, the district is seeking a tax increase of 49 cents per $100 of assessed property value to raise $7.35 million in operating funds.\n\nThe district has experienced budget issues because of enrollment growth, including an increase of 296 students from last year, giving the district 10,467 students. Enrollment has grown an average of 3 to 4 percent every year since 2010.\n\nThe Indian River School District was formed in 1969 through the consolidation of several smaller districts and now is the fifth-largest district in the state. There are eight elementary schools, three middle schools, two high schools and three special service schools over 365-square miles.\n\nFurther findings from the audit revealed that Miller made a payment of $20,343 to the Indian River Volunteer Fire company, and another for $32,500 to the Boys & Girls Club of Oak Orchard/Riverdale. The CFO served as board president for both organizations.\n\nThe audit also found “the District’s processes centralized around the CFO’s review and approval of financial transactions due to the District’s complete trust in him. This blind trust resulted in the CFO’s work not being reviewed and the complete absence of policies and procedures, amongst other issues discussed in this report. Because of these deficient internal controls, an environment in which employees were intimidated and afraid to speak up or report concerns was created.”\n\nMiller also had been audited in his previous job as business manager of the Brandywine School District. He faced criminal charges as the result of that audit and resolved his legal troubles by entering a no contest plea before Superior Court Judge Carl Goldstein.\n\nSettlement of those charges came after he began his new position with the Indian River School District.\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

All three of those proposals – for a tax increase to support the regular operating budget, for funding to cover the cost of the building project and for money to install synthetic turf fields – were bundled together in a single vote that was rejected by a very slim margin in March. The district decided last month to present the same plan again, without the synthetic turf project.\n\nDistricts can go out for a referendum twice in a one-year span, according to Anthony Albence, director of the New Castle County Office of the Board of Elections. Last year, the Christina School District was in a situation similar to the one Brandywine is in now – its first bid for an increase in taxes to support its operating budget failed, so it went out for a second one. That one failed, too. But, this past March, Christina got its 21-percent tax increase passed.\n\nBrandywine has a $174 million budget for the next school year, but will have to slash $8 million if the referendum doesn't pass, according to Superintendent Mark Holodic\n\nRead more here.\n\nDel. sues massage parlors owner in prostitution sting\n\nDelaware prosecutors are suing the owner of four massage parlors who was caught in an undercover police investigation into prostitution in 2014.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday seeks $700,000 in civil penalties from Smyrna resident Da Zhong Wang, 52, for violating state racketeering laws.

By the time polls closed at 8 p.m., more than 320,000 votes had been cast statewide.\n\nAbout 77,000 of those came from early voting.\n\nWhile the election is an important one nationally with Republicans expected to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives ‒ as of 11 p.m. Tuesday, it remained a tossup which party will control the U.S. Senate ‒ races in the First State this year were largely uncontroversial.\n\nThis differed from the 2020 election, where a Delaware man was vying for the presidency and Lauren Witzke attempted to unseat U.S. Sen.

John Carney and other elected officials, including Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, praised the female representation among the statewide races, including state auditor, attorney general and treasurer.\n\n“We call this the woman wave,” Carney said at the watch party.\n\nTwo hours after Delaware polls close, only one race called\n\nTwo hours after the polls closed in Delaware, the only race called was the U.S. House of Representatives ‒ for incumbent Lisa Blunt Rochester.\n\nAs of 10 p.m., 469 of 516 precincts had reported and about 303,500 votes had been counted.\n\nMaryland elects first Black governor\n\nBestselling author Wes Moore has become Maryland's first Black governor.\n\nHe faced Trump endorsee Dan Cox.

Among her legislative priorities are reversing climate change and providing affordable health care. She also campaigned on codifying abortion rights and hailed her role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which she says will help Delaware families by lowering prescription drug prices and energy costs.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nPolls close in Delaware, elsewhere across the country\n\nPolls in Delaware and elsewhere nationwide closed at 8 p.m., though as of 8:20 p.m., only Delaware early votes (both absentee and in-person) had been reported.\n\nThe early votes show U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester clinching the seat as expected, with 66% of the early vote. Her Republican opponent, Lee Murphy, received 33% of early votes.\n\nIn a similar percentage breakdown, incumbent Attorney General Kathy Jennings received 64% of the early vote while Republican Julianne Murray received 36%.\n\nState auditor Democratic candidate Lydia York is leading over her Republican opponent Janice Lorrah in early voting, 65% to 35%, respectively.\n\nState auditor candidate makes her rounds on Tuesday, some voting machines acting up\n\nBefore stopping by the Skyline Middle School polling location, Democratic candidate for state auditor Lydia York visited one of the Delaware Democrats offices in Pike Creek to thank volunteers who were running the phones Tuesday.\n\nYork said while she is still anxious to know the results, she’s been encouraged by the high voter turnout as she visited polling sites up and down the state.\n\nThat turnout was represented at the nearby Skyline Middle School, where candidates and volunteers said they saw lines extending along the sidewalk until about 11 a.m. The wait time could be about an hour at its longest Tuesday morning, but voters were in and out quickly around 4:30 p.m.\n\nMorgan Wright, an intern with Common Cause Delaware ‒ which leads the Election Protection Program to make sure everyone can vote without any barriers ‒ said the morning backup was due in part to technical difficulties. When someone touched a candidate’s name on the screen, it would highlight a different name. Usually that name was under the same party, Wright said, but navigating that technical challenge still resulted in some delays.\n\nWright and volunteer Christine DeBrabander will stay at Skyline until the polls close at 8 p.m. to ensure everyone can vote and the doors stay open until closing time.\n\nOne of the voters who showed up at Skyline as dusk was arriving was Adam Woo, who said he's been bringing his children with him to vote since they were newborns.\n\nHe always comes out to vote, but politics today have especially motivated him to vote Democrat.\n\n“The Republican Party has just gone full fascist and, whether you're leftist or liberal, you have to just fight that. So it's not about any issues anymore,” he said.\n\n— Emily Lytle\n\nWhat to watch for in New Castle County\n\nThe two legislative races to keep an eye on in New Castle County are the county sheriff and county council District 2 positions.\n\nVying for sheriff are incumbent Scott Philips, a Democrat, and non-partisan affiliate John Machurek.\n\nMachurek previously ran as a libertarian candidate for governor in 2020, Delaware attorney general in 2014 and for District 16 of the state House of Representatives in 2012. Machurek lost all of the races in landslide numbers.\n\nPhillips has served as New Castle County Sheriff since 2019. Prior to being elected, he had 13 years of experience as deputy sheriff and another 10 years in law enforcement with New Castle County police as a patrol officer and detective.\n\nIn the New Castle County Council District 2 race, Republican Jamie Collins is challenging Democratic incumbent Dee Durham.\n\nDurham has held the seat since 2018. A long-standing conservationist, the Democrat has sponsored legislative action aimed at getting Delaware closer to its energy goals, including requiring new homes in New Castle County to be equipped with electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Collins’ website, the Republican challenger is running on a campaign advocating for job creation and projects to “energize the County” while respecting the environment. Collins also plans to propose a resolution for the state to begin capturing revenue from online sports gambling.\n\nCollins is known partly for his late father, Richard T. Collins. The elder Collins was elected state auditor in 1974 and New Castle County Executive in 1980.\n\n— Molly McVety\n\nResidents reiterate: Voting is 'our civic duty'\n\nA slow but steady trickle of voters came out to cast their ballots at the Route 9 Library and Innovation Center in New Castle on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's our civic duty and it's necessary, especially with what's going on in our country today,\" one voter said.\n\nDionne Daniels, 47, felt this urgency when she came out to vote. She hasn't voted in a general election since Barack Obama was on the ballot, but said it's important now that she makes her voice heard.\n\nDaniels said Delawareans should come out to vote, even though it's not a presidential election. If not, someone may be elected who doesn't look out for \"everyone's best interests.\"\n\nAt the nearby polling place of DeLaWarr State Service Center, one Black voter said she's casting her ballot because \"our people died for it.\"\n\nBoth the library and the state service center had lines of paint or tape in the parking lot 50 feet away from the doors. Non-voters, including pollsters, media or potential voter intimidators, had to stay behind them. However, no one else was waiting outside.\n\nIn Elsmere, it was relatively quiet outside the fire hall and Baltz Elementary School, but a small and contingent of individuals streamed into and out of Town Hall.\n\nAfter voting, Abar Brown walked out with a look of determination and a message: “Everybody needs to vote today.”\n\nWas there any particular issue that concerned the seven-year resident of the town? No, just everything that is making headlines, including abortion, he said.\n\nBrittany Christian, 37, moved to Elsmere almost a year ago from Philadelphia and said she was voting to have a voice.\n\n\"I don't want to be in the position where I'm complaining about things going on around me, but not actively participating and making it better,\" she said. \"I'm not really one to complain, but I love to do my part. I'm just excited to participate.”\n\n— Hannah Edelman and Anitra Johnson\n\nNearly 200,000 votes cast by midday Tuesday\n\nAs of 12:30 p.m. on Election Day, 195,955 Delawareans had voted in the election, with 116,549 people voting in person on Tuesday, according to state officials.\n\nSo far, New Castle County, the most populated county in Delaware, is leading the number of people who have cast ballots. Registered Democrats are also outpacing their Republican counterparts. So far, 51,262 registered Democrats have voted compared to 42,843 Republicans.\n\nNearly 77,000 ballots were cast during early voting in Delaware, according to election data.\n\nElection officials reported that 76,977 Delawareans voted from Oct. 28 to Nov. 6 – both in the form of absentee ballot and in-person early voting. This makes up roughly 10% of registered voters.\n\nThis is the first election in which the state allowed for early voting. A total of 55,532 ballots were cast in person during this voting period, with the most taking place in Sussex County. Democrats also outnumbered Republicans by about 12,000 votes.\n\nThe only option available to Delawareans is to vote in person, either early or on Election Day, or vote by absentee ballot. In order to vote absentee, a resident must provide a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person.\n\nEarlier this fall, the Delaware Supreme Court found voting by mail and registering to vote on Election Day to be unconstitutional. Both of these were previously allowed during the primary in September but are now no longer options for Delawareans.\n\nUnlike other states, Delaware is expected to tally its votes quickly. In the 2020 election, results were first reported about 15 minutes after polls closed. About 90% of results were in by 10:15 p.m., according to the Associated Press.\n\nElection officials can start counting absentee ballots the Friday before Election Day, but the state cannot release counts until after the polls close at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\n— Meredith Newman\n\nSussex County voter turns heads in military truck\n\nVoters trickled in steadily at Georgetown Elementary School around noon on Tuesday, with at least one making a head-turning entrance.\n\nTim Collard of Milton pulled up to the location in a military truck with flags that said \"Biden Sucks\" and \"Trump 2024.\" He said he bought it from a government surplus sale.\n\n\"It's been in parades but it's also a work truck, sort of,\" Collard said. \"At least I tell my wife that.\"\n\nAlso voting at Georgetown Elementary – though for the other party – was 69-year-old Michael Makowski, who said he feels the country is at a \"crossroads.\"\n\n\"We can either take the bad route and become more authoritarian or try to maintain the democracy we have,\" Makowski said. \"I voted Democratic because I think the Democrats are more concerned with preserving the democracy than Republicans.\"\n\nThe future of the country was also top-of-mind for voters in Brandywine Hundred in New Castle County.\n\nShelly Towler, who cast her vote at Brandywine High School, said the direction the Republican Party took under former President Donald Trump led her to recently re-register, changing her party from Republican to Independent.\n\n“The party stands for nothing that I used to think it stood for,” Towler said.\n\nShe came to the polls with the Supreme Court’s recent reversal of abortion rights on her mind. She’s also discouraged by the Republican party’s attitude toward voting rights and the integrity of democracy.\n\n“It’s a huge embarrassment. We are supposed to be the example?” Towler said. “It’s just going backwards in time.”\n\nA steady stream of voters followed Towler to the polls on a brisk morning as crunchy leaves blown by the wind scratched the school parking lot. The school is one of several polling places in the fifth state senate district, which a Democrat won in 2020 for the first time in more than 40 years.\n\nAt nearby Emmanuel Presbyterian Church, Dennis Quill said he voted for Democrats down the ballot. The country needs to ensure individuals’ right to an abortion, Quill said, and he’s disappointed by the partisan justices on the Supreme Court, a body he is in favor of broadening or term limits.\n\n“I wouldn’t vote for a Republican if my life depended on it,” Quill said.\n\nQuill said he hopes voters realize “things aren’t as bad as people think” and are motivated to support candidates who can keep the nation from a deeper slide. But he’s more focused on races in neighboring states and the national landscape than Delaware, where he expects Democrats to win easily.\n\nPaul Donohue will just be happy when political ads are off his TV. Like Quill, he says “it doesn’t really feel like Delaware has any impact races.” But that hasn’t kept other races, like the battle between John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz for Pennsylvania’s Senate seat, off his screen.\n\n“I find it pretty upsetting that they’re all mean,” Donohue said. “They don’t talk about the issues much, they just attack each other. I’ll be thankful when it’s over.”\n\n— Brandon Holveck, Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nWhat to watch for in Sussex County\n\nThe most-watched races in Sussex this year will likely be the Senate District 6 and Representative District 20 races.\n\nDistrict 6 Republican Sen. Ernie Lopez is retiring this year, and District 20 Republican Rep. Steve Smyk is giving up his seat to run for Lopez’s. Both seats are longtime Republican strongholds in a county where only one legislator, House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, is a Democrat.\n\nSmyk faces Democrat Russ Huxtable and Gwendolyn Jones (Non-Partisan Delaware) in the Senate District 6 race. In the Representative District 20 race, Democrat Stell Parker Selby and Republican Dallas Wingate are running.\n\nIn Representative District 20, as of this month, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 8,423 to 7,742. There are also 5,444 independents. That’s compared to 9,802 Democrats, 9,591 Republicans and 6,430 independents in 2020.\n\nIn Senate District 6, there are 18,942 Democrats, 15,770 Republicans and 11,471 independents. In 2020, there were 10,282 Democrats, 8,229 Republicans and 5,751 independents.\n\nSenate District 6 includes Rehoboth Beach, Lewes and Milton. Representative District 20 includes most of Lewes, Milton and parts of Georgetown.\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nVoters struggle to get to polling location due to road blockage\n\nVoters near Townsend were unable to get to Blackbird Community Center Tuesday morning due to Verizon blocking the road.\n\nAn election day spokesperson later told Delaware Online/The News Journal that \"elections has indicated that it is aware and is in the process of addressing the blockage.\"\n\nSteady turnout at the polls Tuesday morning\n\nAcross the state Tuesday morning, polling locations saw a steady stream of voters.\n\nThere was a line outside Clayton Fire Company just before the polls opened at 7 a.m. Among the first voters was Diana Dede.\n\nShe said the issue she’s been following the most has been the debate about guns, saying “it’s just important to me to vote.”\n\nPaul Skreenock, also one of the first in line, said he didn’t come to the polls for a specific issue or candidate but because “it’s my civic duty.”\n\nIn Wilmington, there was only one voter at the Delaware Technical Community College polling place just after 8 a.m. On the outside, the only sign that it was Election Day was the red poster indicating the entrance to the polling place.\n\nTwo seniors walked out of the voting area as a reporter walked in. According to a poll worker, this was the calm after a morning rush when the polls opened at 7 a.m. There were no issues with the voting machines, as the process took less than a minute.\n\nAbout an hour later in Dover, the parking lot at East Dover Elementary wasn't busy as residents turned out to cast their vote. Yolanda Poe, 53, of Dover, said her decision to vote was, in part, to set a precedent for her grandchildren.\n\n“For centuries as Black people, we couldn't vote and women couldn't do anything,\" Poe said after casting her vote. \"Now we have the right to, so it's important that we do something.\"\n\nIn front of the elementary school, she took a selfie with Kerri Evelyn Harris, a candidate for Delaware State Representative. Harris, shivering from the cold, was the only candidate greeting voters outside the school at 9 a.m.\n\nAn older woman who slowly walked toward the school’s entrance to vote told Harris: “Keep warm!”\n\nTo the north in Talleyville, a handful of residents were voting at Springer Middle School at 10 a.m.\n\nOne poll worker said about 170 people had voted so far Tuesday morning, but about a half-dozen more walked in less than five minutes after the poll worker gave his estimate.\n\n— Ben Mace, Isabel Hughes, Andre Lamar, Meredith Newman\n\nWhy Lee Murphy thinks he can upset Lisa Blunt Rochester\n\nA Republican hasn’t represented Delaware in Congress since 2011, but Lee Murphy, the party’s challenger to Lisa Blunt Rochester, is confident that will soon change.\n\n“I’ve lived here a long time,” Murphy said by phone Monday. “I’ve seen Democrats rule the state, Republicans be in power. For many years in this state, Republicans and Democrats worked together, but that recently hasn’t been the case. I just believe one-party rule, especially over a long period of time, isn't healthy for everyone.”\n\nMurphy, who voted Tuesday morning at Hillcrest-Bellefont Methodist Church off Marsh Road just outside of Wilmington, said his No. 1 issue is the economy. Voters he’s spoken with are hurting from record inflation and are concerned about oil prices ahead of the winter months, he said.\n\nREAD:3 takeaways from the Blunt Rochester-Murphy U.S House debate\n\nIt’s an issue he hopes energizes voters to seek change.\n\nBlunt Rochester won Delaware’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016 after fellow Democrat John Carney left the office to seek the governorship. Murphy has run in each election since, challenging Scott Walker unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 2018 before losing to Blunt Rochester in the general election in 2020.\n\nThe indicators once again point in Blunt Rochester’s favor.\n\nA poll conducted by the University of Delaware Center for Political Communication published in October found 50% of registered voters plan to vote for Blunt Rochester and 33% support Murphy.\n\nBlunt Rochester’s campaign has raised almost $2.7 million, about nine times as much as Murphy’s.\n\nMurphy pointed to the Delaware Supreme Court’s ruling against vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration as a reason for optimism. Without the COVID-19 measures that expanded absentee voting by mailing ballots to registered voters in 2020 and the following two years of Joe Biden's presidency, Murphy believes he’s better positioned this year compared to previous runs.\n\n“This election is very much a referendum on Joe Biden, which is bad for the Democrats,” Murphy said. “The landscape has definitely changed.”\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nWhat to watch for on Tuesday\n\nWhile Delaware races may be lower-stakes this year than in past years, elsewhere across the country there are a number of hot races that many are watching.\n\nHere are some that will determine what the country looks like moving forward:\n\nPennsylvania races to watch\n\nIn neighboring Pennsylvania, all eyes are on the U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nThe outcome of the Senate race, between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Dr. Mehmet Oz, could determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, ultimately affecting issues like abortion rights and the economy, among others.\n\nFor the governor’s race, Democratic candidate and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro faces Doug Mastriano, a far-right Trump-endorsee who has supported the former president’s lies that the election was stolen.\n\nMIDTERMS ARE HERE:Midterms are less than a week away. Here are the key races in Delaware\n\nMaryland races to watch\n\nIn Maryland, bestselling author Wes Moore, who would become the state’s first Black governor if elected, is facing another Trump endorsee, Dan Cox. Cox has also promoted the former president’s lies about the election. During the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, Cox tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence was a “traitor.”\n\nMoore is seen as the favorite to clinch the gubernatorial election in Maryland.\n\nNew York races to watch\n\nTo Delaware's north, it's unlikely that the traditionally blue state of New York will look much different after Tuesday. Still, the governor's race between Gov. Kathy Hochul ‒ the state's first female governor who took over following disgraced Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation last year ‒ and Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin isn't a shoo-in.\n\nHochul's lead over Trump-backed Zeldin has narrowed in recent weeks, according to Politico's election forecast.\n\nGeorgia races to watch\n\nMany eyes are on Georgia's governor's race this year, a repeat matchup between Gov. Brian Kemp and gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams.\n\nRecent polls show Kemp ‒ no longer the overseer of Georgia's elections as he was during the 2018 race ‒ leading by seven percentage points. Still, Abrams was able to mobilize many voters in 2018, something she hopes to carry with her this year.\n\nKEMP VS ABRAMS:In second debate, Georgia candidates Kemp and Abrams argue over abortion, gun control\n\nJust as anticipated, though slightly more contentious, is Georgia's U.S. Senate race.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock is facing Trump-backed Herschel Walker, an anti-abortion advocate who, in recent weeks, has repeatedly denied that he paid for two women to have abortions years ago. The women recently came forward with the claims that Walker impregnated them and then paid for the medical procedures.\n\nEarlier in his campaign, Walker revealed that he fathered four children by four different women, a striking contrast to his public admonishments about absentee fathers and his previous contention that he had three children, USA Today reported.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, the race is quite close, with Walker leading Warnock by about one percentage point.\n\nArizona races to watch\n\nArizona's gubernatorial race remains a toss-up, but it will be closely watched.\n\nPolls are showing election denier Kari Lake slightly ahead of incumbent Democrat Gov. Katie Hobbs, though that may not mean much. The veracity of polls often depends on what entity is conducting them, what their methods are and whether they have a partisan lean.\n\nPOLLS AREN'T ALWAYS ACCURATE:Polls in Arizona's Senate and governor's races: Don't count on them\n\nThe outcome of the gubernatorial race will have important implications ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nLake, a former local Fox News anchor who now markets herself as an anti-media Republican, has repeatedly reiterated the baseless claim that Trump won the 2020 election in Arizona. She's also said she would not have certified President Joe Biden's election if she were governor at the time.\n\nFlorida races to watch\n\nAs in many other states, Florida's key contests are the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races.\n\nIncumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will likely be a presidential contender in 2024, is facing off against Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor-turned-Democrat who represented Florida in the U.S. House of Representatives until August of this year. He resigned to focus on the governor's race.\n\nDELAWARE'S MIGRANT PLANE THAT WASN'T:'No reports of anyone arriving' after rumors of DeSantis' incoming migrant plane\n\nOn the U.S. Senate side of the midterms, Republican Marco Rubio, a senator since 2011, is facing off against Democrat Val Demings. Polls show Rubio with a more than eight percentage point lead.\n\nOhio races to watch\n\nThis election cycle, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan ‒ who is vying for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat ‒ has out-raised many other Senate hopefuls across the nation.\n\nREAD:Tim Ryan is raising more than J.D. Vance. Can he counter national GOP spending?\n\nYet it remains to be seen whether Ryan's cash flow will be enough to secure him the race against Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance.\n\nGot a story tip or idea? Send to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com.

Phil Murphy to replace colorful, controversial Chris Christie.\n\nThe developments continued as the state moved closer to legalizing marijuana and banning plastic bags. And New Jersey's legal arguments convinced the Supreme Court to clear the way for sports betting across the land.\n\nEvents unfolding in South Jersey reflected national themes such as the opioid crisis, reflections on race and the push to raise the minimum wage. Many of these stories will have an impact beyond 2018:\n\nCamden landmarks come down\n\nThe long-anticipated — and for some, long-dreaded — demolition of iconic Camden High began early in the year. A number of legal challenges could not save the century-old \"Castle on the Hill,\" which school district officials maintained would be too expensive repair.\n\nThe district did solicit feedback from Camden High students, alumni, staff and city residents on a design for the new school, which is set to open in 2021. The recommended concept for the state-of-the-art learning academy will pay homage to the old school.\n\nAs 2018 drew to a close, another high-profile Camden site also faced a transition. A demolition contract was awarded in December for Campbell's Field, which housed the Camden Riversharks independent baseball team through 2015. The stadium, which struggled with attendance over 15 seasons, will be reduced to rubble by spring.\n\nThe site, owned by the Camden County Improvement Authority, has most recently been used by Rutgers University–Camden's Division III Scarlet Raptors baseball team. Going forward, the waterfront property will house athletic fields and facilities for Rutgers University–Camden and the City of Camden.\n\nBurlco goes blue\n\nDemocrats gained ground in the 2018 midterm election — and that trend was evident in South Jersey. Traditionally Republican Burlington County elected two Democratic freeholders and a Democratic county clerk.\n\nDemocrats also picked up two council seats each in races in Evesham, Mount Laurel, Maple Shade and Moorestown, and Evesham's next mayor will be Democrat Jaclyn Veasy, replacing the GOP's Randy Brown, who declined to run for re-election.\n\nDemocratic newcomer Andy Kim defeated incumbent Rep. Tom MacArthur, a Republican, in the state's 3rd District, which includes much of Burlington and Ocean counties. And state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat, won South Jersey's 2nd District, where Republican U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo is retiring.\n\nThe political shift left just one Republican, the 4th District's Chris Smith, among New Jersey's 12 congressional districts.\n\nFestivals come and go\n\nRising costs motivated organizers of the Mercer County Italian American Festival to move the event to Burlington County after 18 years. The vast three-day festival had its South Jersey debut in September on the 65-acre Burlington County Fairgrounds in Columbus. Visitors had access to an Italian Market craft fair, a \"food piazza\" and wine and beer gardens; entertainment and a kids' zone. The festival is known for a 50/50 raffle with a generous jackpot; the 2018 winner took home $9,249.\n\nFor the first time in two decades, Haddonfield will welcome a new year without its traditional First Night celebration. Organizers announced in August that they had retired the family-friendly event, which featured fireworks and performances at downtown venues. Citing declining interest in the festival, organizer and former Haddonfield mayor Jack Tarditi said the borough will look into other ways to usher in the new year.\n\nFootball firing draws heat\n\nFor years, the Camden Catholic football team was best known for being a winning program with a long tradition. That all changed in April, when five-year head coach Nick Strom made stunning allegations of racial bias following his firing. Strom, who is white, said officials had an issue with him because he had too many black players on his team.\n\nA number of players protested Strom's firing, and some left the program.\n\nOfficials denied the racial accusations, but the story drew national attention and spurred leadership changes at the school. The coach hired to replace Strom, Cody Hall, resigned in November. Interim coach Gary Onuekwusi took over the program after that.\n\nThe story was one of several racial controversies at South Jersey schools that spurred discussion, ramifications and soul-searching over the past year.\n\nCherry Hill High School East's principal apologized for \"inappropriateness\" of wording on prom tickets that urged students to \"party like it's 1776\" at the National Constitution Center. African-American groups complained that the phrase was insensitive because it referenced a period when blacks would have been slaves.\n\nHaddonfield Memorial High's boys lacrosse season was canceled as state civil rights officials investigated a report of a racial slur. Sterling High School said one of the lacrosse team members hurled the offensive insult during a track meet.\n\nAnd state wrestling official Alan Maloney, who used a racial epithet to describe a fellow ref in 2016, drew outrage again when he ordered a Buena High wrestler to cut his dreadlocks or forfeit a match. A video of the incident catapulted the controversy into a national story. The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association and the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights are investigating the matter. At an emergency meeting called by the Buena Regional Board of Education, Superintendent David Cappuccio Jr. said he notified the NJSIAA that Buena wrestlers would not participate in matches where Maloney was officiating.\n\nMore to minimum wage\n\nGov. Phil Murphy has urged the state legislature to establish a $15-per-hour minimum wage for New Jersey.\n\nBut hospitals that are among the state's largest employers aren't waiting for a mandate.\n\nCooper University Health Care committed in November to raise its minimum wage to $15. Two weeks later, Jefferson Health said it would meet the $15 threshold in 2019. And Virtua announced in December it would bump its minimum wage to $15.15.\n\nA spokesman for Inspira Health has said the South Jersey health system also is working to raise its minimum wage.\n\nThe health-care industry isn't alone in paying workers more.\n\nEnergy-technology firm Holtec, which moved its South Jersey campus from Mount Laurel to Camden in 2017, will introduce a $15 minimum wage at its three U.S. plants on Jan. 1.\n\nAmazon also was among the New Jersey employers that raised its minimum wage to $15 in 2018.\n\nNarcan availability expands\n\nFirst responders from Cooper University Hospital were called to 5,000 confirmed or suspected overdoses in 2017. That staggering number points to the opioid crisis throughout Camden County, and helped spur a partnership between county officials and area hospital systems to distribute the opioid antidote naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan.\n\nLaw enforcement and health-care systems each have a role in the initiative, announced in March. Cooper Health, Jefferson Health New Jersey and Virtua Health will buy naloxone in bulk, saving the county 50 percent. The Camden County Prosecutor's Office will then distribute the antidote to police departments throughout the county as needed.\n\nThe Camden County effort mirrors those that have been underway in other parts of South Jersey since 2015.\n\nInspira Health and Jefferson supply law enforcement agencies and police departments in Gloucester County with the opioid antidote. Virtua Health, Deborah Heart and Lung Center and Lourdes Health System work with Burlington County police departments and law enforcement to provide naloxone.\n\nMedical marijuana sites double\n\nNew Jersey has just six dispensaries to serve the 38,000 patients enrolled in its medical marijuana program. But the state Health Department solicited applications in the fall so it could double the number of sites.\n\nDemand was strong — nearly 150 applicants from across the country and Canada competed for the six new slots. The state announced its selections in December, including the two applicants that would serve South Jersey.\n\nColumbia Care New Jersey can now apply to grow and dispense medical marijuana in Vineland. And MPX New Jersey can apply to grow marijuana in Galloway Township and dispense the medication in nearby Atlantic City.\n\nBoth Vineland and Atlantic City had demonstrated their support for medical marijuana programs.\n\nIn November, Vineland residents approved a referendum to allow medical marijuana grow facilities and dispensaries in the city.\n\nAnd the MPX application included letters of support from the Atlantic City Mayor's Office and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.\n\nOther South Jersey towns reacted to the prospect of medical marijuana sites by changing zoning laws, and adopting ordinances either supporting or opposing local pot facilities.\n\nEDA approves tax breaks\n\nThe state's Economic Development Authority backed tens of millions of dollars worth of incentives to keep or lure business in South Jersey.\n\nThe beneficiaries included Camden Yards Steel, which received $5.4 million in tax breaks to keep 32 jobs and create eight new jobs in Camden; and Union Packaging LLC, which picked up a $10.6 million incentive while considering a move from Yeadon, Pa., to Camden that would bring 65 jobs to the city.\n\nBusiness services firm Corcentric is getting a $1.4 million incentive to expand to a new Cherry Hill facility, adding 20 jobs.\n\nGobrands Inc., a company that expanded its goPuff convenience delivery service to South Jersey when it opened a Cherry Hill warehouse last summer, earned a $39 million tax break to centralize its operations near Rowan University. The company is promising to bring 600 jobs to the 300,000-square-foot facility on Route 322.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has typically been a big industry in other parts of the state, but an $8.4 million EDA incentive could bring specialty medication firm Chemistry RX to Camden. The Philadelphia company could create 56 jobs by moving to the former city library on Federal Street.\n\nProject targets rundown Camden area\n\nRecent years have seen a development boom along the Camden Waterfront and in the \"eds and meds\" corridor around Broadway. But the Camden County Improvement Authority is now targeting one of Camden's oldest neighborhoods for redevelopment.\n\nThe stretch of Haddon Avenue in the city's Gateway area is pocked by abandoned homes and vacant lots. The CCIA said developers \"may propose (a) mixed-use residential concept.\" However, county spokesman Dan Keashen described the request for bids in September as an \"exploratory process\" and said the county would await concepts before speculating on the future of the neighborhood.\n\nA redevelopment agreement could be signed within the first few months of 2019. In the meantime, the county also is pursuing a study on potential major redevelopment along Haddon Avenue in in the Gateway, Whitman Park and Parkside neighborhoods.\n\nStruggling mall gets plan\n\nIt was once among South Jersey's thriving shopping areas. Now it's a ghost town, even during the holiday season.\n\nSo what will become of Voorhees Town Center, formerly the Echelon Mall?\n\nMonths after the township's planning board advanced a plan to allow eminent domain at the site, a conditional redeveloper was named. Brandywine Financial Services Corp., a Philadelphia-area real estate company, is expected to transform the mall into a mixed-use center with housing and entertainment attractions.\n\nSheri Berkery: @SheriBerkery; 856-486-2673; sberkery@gannettnj.com\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/04/28/scenic-manor-bringing-319-new-homes-mulberry-knoll-road-lewes/7201473002/", "title": "Scenic Manor bringing 319 new homes to Mulberry Knoll Road in ...", "text": "Over 300 new homes are coming to the southern side of Mulberry Knoll Road in Lewes.\n\nIt's a bucolic stretch of road off Route 24 that typically sees just 280 vehicles daily, according to a 2019 traffic study.

The Tuscaloosa City Council unanimously extended a moratorium that began in January 2019 during a meeting last week. The prohibition on permits for large-scale student housing projects will last at least until May 2022. The votes came at the urging of Mayor Walt Maddox, who said more work was needed to create rules and regulations to prevent such developments from becoming a drain on the city of about 101,000. “We’re also exploring some ideas on how do you fairly assess what these developments are costing in terms of city expenses, but we would appreciate a little bit more time to work through this,” he said. Bryan Winter, an attorney who has represented developers, said restrictions adopted last year to slow the spread of student housing already have made it difficult to move ahead with projects that will bring jobs and additional tax revenue. “They’ve already effectively tried to kill any outside investment in Tuscaloosa,” Winter said. “These rules and the moratorium are designed to discourage significant outside investment and revitalization in Tuscaloosa.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A comprehensive fiscal policy for the state “must be negotiated and agreed to as whole” and not taken up piecemeal, according to a report from a legislative working group that was charged with making recommendations for the special session that opened Monday. Pieces to which the report said the group agreed as necessary parts of a comprehensive approach include restructuring Alaska’s oil-wealth fund, limiting what is drawn from it and providing constitutional certainty for a dividend for residents. Other elements include a new dividend formula, new revenues, budget cuts and a “healthy” state infrastructure budget, as well as spending cap revisions and possible changes in how the constitutional budget reserve fund works. Lawmakers faced with deficits in recent years have relied heavily on the budget reserve fund, which requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to access. The report said that working group members “do not support addressing only one or two issues to the exclusion of others.” It said members recommended considering two approaches to the perennial debate over dividends: placing in the state constitution a dividend formula or constitutionalizing the promise of a dividend that would be based on a formula in law.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A metro-area school district can keep its mask requirement for now, despite a new state law barring such mandates, a judge ruled Monday. Judge Randall Warner declined to immediately put the brakes on the Phoenix Union High School’s mask mandate, but he’s allowing teacher Douglas Hester to proceed with his lawsuit against it. Warner said the new law surrounding school mask mandates doesn’t take effect until Sept. 29, rejecting Hester’s claim that the statute has been in force since the Legislature approved it in late June. The law didn’t get the two-thirds approval needed to take effect immediately. While the ruling rejected Hester’s bid to stop to the district’s policy, Warner made an observation that could prove helpful to the teacher. The judge said Arizona law gives school boards the authority to protect students. But he also said the district failed to cite a legal authority showing the Legislature overstepped its bounds with the new law. Warner noted the law’s effective date is weeks away, saying that “many things could change in that time.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reached another new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations Monday as thousands of students headed back to school. The state reported 46 new coronavirus patients in hospitals, bringing the total to 1,459. That surpasses the record high the state reached last week. The state’s COVID-19 deaths increased by 31. Arkansas’ virus cases and hospitalizations have been skyrocketing in recent weeks because of the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The hospitalizations spiked as the school year began for thousands of students, most of whom will be required to wear a mask following moves by dozens of districts after a judge blocked the state’s mask mandate. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced Friday that she’s appealing the ruling against the mandate ban. “As many children across Arkansas head back to school today, I am praying for a safe and productive year,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has said he regrets signing the ban into law, tweeted Monday. The governor has said he agreed with the judge’s decision. There are only 22 intensive care unit beds available in the entire state, the Department of Health said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nQuincy: Firefighters are keeping an eye on a lone, emaciated bear cub that may have lost its mother to the country’s largest wildfire. The pointy-eared cub has been seen rambling solo along a mountain road burned by the Dixie Fire near Taylorsville, peering through brush and leaping through plants covered in fire-retardant chemicals. “Generally when you see them with a sow or a mother bear, they’ll stay with the mother bear and run off,” said firefighter Johnnie Macy, who was deployed from Golden, Colorado, to battle the fire. “This bear hasn’t done that, so because of that we think that the bear’s orphaned as a result of the fire.” Macy said Sunday that the team has been monitoring the cub for several days to determine if it is an orphan. A wildlife rescue team was waiting to extract the emaciated cub from the burn-scarred area. Macy called the situation “heartbreaking” but said it is “Mother Nature taking its course.” Earlier this month, a bear cub with burns to its paws and nose was rescued from a fire in eastern Siskiyou County in California. Also this month, an injured cub tunneled out of a Lake Tahoe wildlife care center where he was being treated for burns sustained in a wildfire. The bear has since been spotted in the wild.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Visitors lining Rocky Mountain National Park’s Moraine Park Road and Horseshoe Park shoulder to shoulder while taking in the elk bugling this fall might be asked to mask up. The National Park Service announced Monday that it is immediately requiring visitors, employees and contractors to wear a mask inside all park service buildings and in crowded outdoor spaces regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status or community transmission levels. The park service said the new requirement follows the latest science and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Visitors to national parks are coming from locations across the country, if not across the world,” park service Deputy Director Shawn Benge said in the news release. The requirement will be in effect until further notice and applies to all NPS buildings and public transportation systems. It also applies to outdoor spaces where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as narrow or busy trails and overlooks. Moraine Park Road and Horseshoe Park attract large crowds of visitors to see elk in September and October, necessitating the park to stage rangers and volunteers in those areas to keep visitors a safe distance from the elk. The park’s shuttle service stations often are crowded, as are some of the more popular overlooks along Trail Ridge Road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new use-of-force training program that will be required for all police officers in the state will emphasize “moral courage,” empathy and deescalation in an effort to reduce fatal shootings and other violent acts by officers. Officials believe it is one of the first use-of-force training programs in the country to be mandated across an entire state. Most police departments provide their own such training to officers based on state laws, which can result in patchworks of different standards and interpretations, said Keith Mello, police chief in Milford, Connecticut, and chairman of the state Police Officer Standards and Training Council. “We wanted to do something different and unique, and that is to create one single standard, one policy, one sheet of music by which police officers will be guided in making use-of-force decisions, and one training program,” Mello said at a council meeting during which the training program was unanimously approved. All of the more than 8,000 law enforcement officers in the state must take the four-hour training program by Dec. 31, 2022. They can apply for an extension of the deadline to April 1, 2023, at the latest. The council includes law enforcement officials, policy experts and people who have been negatively affected by the criminal justice system.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A school board postponed its monthly meeting Monday after members of the audience refused to wear face coverings. About 40 minutes after the Brandywine School District Board meeting was set to begin, Board President John Skrobot told the room of about 75 people that the meeting would have to be rescheduled because so many people in the crowd weren’t wearing face coverings. Superintendent Lincoln Hohler cited Gov. John Carney’s universal mask mandate as the reason the meeting could not proceed unless everyone put on face masks. Several school boards, including Appoquinimink and Milford, have faced lengthy public comment periods in recent weeks with parents and community members voicing concerns about students being required to wear face coverings in classrooms. Officials apologized to those in attendance and watching on Zoom seeking information about returning to school, saying they would get that information out in the coming days.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: All health care workers in the city are required to get fully vaccinated under an order from Mayor Muriel Bowser, WUSA-TV reports. Health care workers must have at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 30, officials said. Employees who qualify for a health or religious exemption can opt out of the shots. The new policy applies to licensed, certified and registered health professionals; EMS providers such as paramedics and emergency medical technicians; and unlicensed health care workers, such as patient care technicians, personal care aides and environmental service staff. Bowser has also announced that D.C. government employees, including teachers at public schools, will be required to take COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. Government workers have until Sept. 19 to get fully inoculated, Bowser said. Unvaccinated employees who qualify for a health or religious exemption or who choose not to be vaccinated will be required to take a weekly coronavirus test. If they do not comply with the new policy, they will be subject to job penalities.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A judge refused Tuesday to close pretrial hearings to the media and public in the case of the man accused of killing 17 people in a 2018 high school mass shooting. Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer rejected a motion by defendant Nikolas Cruz’s lawyers claiming that intense media coverage jeopardizes his right to a fair trial. Scherer did not elaborate on her reasons for denial, saying she would detail them in a written order later. But Dana McElroy, attorney for the Associated Press, said it was the correct decision. “It allows access to all of the hearings and filings in this case of great public concern, which is both contemplated and required by the Constitution,” McElroy said after the hearing. Several media outlets, including the AP, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News and CNN, had challenged the closure motion. Cruz’s lawyers contended that open hearings might publicly reveal inadmissible evidence that will never be heard at trial and that news coverage could otherwise create bias among jurors. The Florida Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that pretrial hearings are presumed to be open in most circumstances and can be closed only when there are no alternatives available except moving the trial elsewhere in the state. Prosecutors insist the trial must take place in Broward County.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Test scores fell for students across the state last year, amid questions about what the scores mean with few students taking the standardized tests in some districts. State officials said they believe the scores would have been worse if the missing students had also taken the tests, but they also deemphasized the weight they’re putting on the scores considering class disruptions stemming from COVID-19. The Georgia Department of Education released the annual Milestones test results Monday. Students in third through eighth grades as well as high schoolers take the tests. Federal law requires most of the tests, and the U.S. Department of Education insisted that students take them, despite two requests by Georgia State Superintendent Richard Woods to cancel tests for the second year in a row. “These are traditional tests that are designed to measure student performance in a traditional classroom environment,” Department of Education Chief of Staff Matt Jones said. “And we all know that this past year was anything but traditional. Students and teachers had to deal with an ever-changing environment.” Normally, test results would be used to create report cards for schools and districts with letter grades. That won’t happen this year because Georgia and other states got waivers from the federal accountability requirement.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who works as an emergency room doctor on the Big Island, says a minority of unvaccinated people are pushing the state toward another lockdown. “I say we are two to four weeks at this rate from seeing major adjustments in what we’re able to do,” Green said. “It’s a small minority that is otherwise condemning society to a lockdown and potentially large-scale death. No one wants to close down businesses, no one wants to put in curfews, no one wants to curtail regular life or schools, but we have to keep people alive.” Green said all intensive care beds at the Hilo hospital are full – more than half with COVID-19 patients – and as of Sunday 58 of the 68 ICU units at Honolulu’s Queen’s Hospital were occupied, Hawaii News Now reports. In total, Green said 300 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, and of those, at least 270 were unvaccinated. Protesters showed up outside Green’s condo over the weekend. “I’m probably going to be taking care of them in the hospital with my colleagues because they’re going to catch COVID,” Green said. “Those very individuals are condemning everyone in society to a much larger lockdown.”\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A federal judge says a discrimination lawsuit filed against the University of Idaho by a UI College of Law professor can move forward. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill rejected a request from the University of Idaho to throw out the lawsuit last week, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Professor Shaakirrah Sanders was hired to teach at the College of Law in 2011 and and in 2018 became the first African American to achieve the rank of full professor at the school. She filed the lawsuit several years ago, alleging that she was unfairly denied an associate dean position in 2017, that she faced a variety of unfair conditions and terms of employment, and that school officials retaliated against her when she complained about the treatment. The University of Idaho asked the court to throw out the lawsuit before it went to trial, contending in part that Sanders failed to file the complaint on time and that she failed to show there was a valid dispute about the facts of the case. In his ruling first reported by the American Bar Association’s ABA Journal, Winmill rejected the university’s argument, noting that UI’s Office of Civil Rights and Investigations received at least 35 reports of sexual or racial discrimination at the College of Law during a nine-year period starting in 2011. Those complaints triggered a formal review.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Federal pandemic relief money will be funneled into a $10 million grants program to aid the rebound of tourism in the Prairie State. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity said last week that the grants will be handed out to organizations that are starting or enhancing tourism attractions or festivals planned for this year or next. The money comes from the American Rescue Plan Act, doled out to states to help them recover from the economic damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until funds are depleted. Projects most closely aligned with Commerce and Economic Opportunity guidelines will be funded. Grants will range from $10,000 to $1 million. They will require a local matching amount. The Tourism Attraction and Festivals Grant program will develop new attractions or improve existing ones across the state. It is available to a variety of sources including museums, businesses, events, performances and festivals.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor gave his support Monday to the growing number of school districts across the state issuing mask mandates for students and staff as they try to head off more COVID-19 outbreaks. Several of the state’s largest school districts in the Indianapolis area began requiring masks for indoor areas this week after starting the school year without such requirements, reacting to a growing number of coronavirus infections among students as the more transmissible delta variant continues surging. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said he would continue his policy of allowing local officials to impose mask rules and other steps to stem the coronavirus spread even as several school boards have faced vocal – and sometimes misleading – opposition to such actions. “I think the schools that are putting mask mandates into place are making a wise decision when the facts warrant it,” Holcomb said. “I’m not surprised by the pushback, having lived through the last year and a half.” Holcomb’s stance differs from that of Republican governors in Florida, Texas and other states that have issued statewide orders prohibiting mask-wearing mandates in schools.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A new schools superintendent is apologizing for plagiarizing parts of a welcome letter she sent to district families, acknowledging she copied several phrases word-for-word from a similar letter a New York superintendent authored in 2017. Dr. Christine Trujillo, who started last month as superintendent of public schools in Gilbert, Iowa, admitted that her Aug. 10 back-to-school letter copied from a 2017 letter by Superintendent Gerard Poole of the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District in New York. “I made a mistake and an error, and I apologize for that,” she told the Associated Press in an interview Monday evening. Trujillo said she was in a hurry to get the letter out while preparing for the school year. Her letter to parents misstated the district for which she worked and the time of year, copying these sentences from Poole: “It is an exciting time for the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District, and I’m looking forward to the year ahead. Please accept my best wishes for a happy and healthy summer.” Hours later, she sent a revised letter that deleted those lines without explanation but still kept several other phrases copied from Poole. A district parent notified the AP of the similarities.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Top Republican legislators are accusing Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration of illegally spending at least $86 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds by not getting their approval first. Kelly’s office on Tuesday did not immediately respond to a letter from Senate President Ty Masterson, House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., and the chairs of the House and Senate budget committees. In the letter sent Monday, the lawmakers threatened to “explore all necessary legal actions” if she does not seek approval from leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature before state agencies spend relief dollars. Their dispute centers on relief funds that agencies received before the state’s current 2022 budget year began July 1. The four Republicans contend that a budget measure approved by lawmakers and signed by Kelly in May required an advisory committee’s review and legislative leaders’ consent for any spending starting July 1. “Respect for the rule of law compels you to cease your attempt to circumvent the will of the people as expressed by the Legislature and approved by your own hand,” the Republican lawmakers wrote. Kelly’s office contends the spending in question falls under a plan legislative leaders approved in June 2020, allocating $1.8 billion in federal relief funds.\n\nKentucky\n\nSouthgate: Building on the former Beverly Hills Supper Club site is about to start, but the area where the Cabaret Room stood before fire destroyed the popular dinner club will become a memorial fountain honoring the 165 people who died. Nothing besides memorials has been put at the supper club site in Southgate since the May 28, 1977, fire that left 165 people dead. Survivors and witnesses have said the night still haunts them. Construction will start before the end of the month on an assisted living center, apartments and homes at the former Beverly Hills Supper Club site, according to a release from the builder Monday. In November 2020, attorneys for the developer, Ashley Builders Group, and a group of descendants of fire victims resolved a lawsuit with an agreement to allow building on part of the property. The agreement included a deed restriction to not build on the former Cabaret Room, where most people died in the fire. Plans for a permanent memorial fountain for the Cabaret Room were agreed upon. The Edgewood-based building company and Vision Realty Group have finalized the sale of the property. The planned $65 million Memorial Pointe residential community on the 80-acre site will include a memorial that will be donated to the city of Southgate once it is completed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man sentenced to life without parole for stealing a wallet is free after serving 12 years. New Orleans prosecutors agreed to dismiss a habitual offender sentencing enhancement against 65-year-old Henry Phillips, and he was released Monday, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Phillips was convicted in 2009 of purse-snatching after prosecutors said he swiped a man’s wallet from a McDonald’s counter and then pretended to have a gun when he was confronted. He stole $20 before he was arrested half a block away. Prosecutors under former District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro invoked his two prior robbery convictions to give him a sentence of mandatory life without parole, according to the newspaper. Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams’ office revisited the case as part of a larger project to review old sentences. “This case could have been a petty theft charge, but it was sentenced like a murder,” Phillips’ attorney, Colin Reingold, of the Promise of Justice Initiative, said in a statement. “In order to restore any sense of trust in our criminal legal system these cases have to be rooted out and purged.” In a letter to the court, the victims of the wallet-snatching said the incident did not damage their lives or emotional well-being, and they backed Phillips’ release.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Despite the pandemic limiting access to lawmakers, corporate and political interests working to influence the State House spent $4 million on lobbyists in 2021. Pharmaceutical companies, cable companies, electric utilities, hospitals and casinos were the handful of companies spending the most on lobbyists. Advocates against youth smoking and the chemical industry were also included, the Portland Press Herald reports. According to disclosure reports filed with the Maine Ethics Commission, Jim Mitchell, an attorney with a longtime presence at the State House, made over $312,000 for his work before the Legislature in the first six months of the year, making him the highest-paid individual lobbyist in Maine. Mitchell’s clients include Comcast Cable Communications, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Central Maine Power Co. and New England Clean Energy Connect LLC, the newspaper said. The lobbying report also further underscores the revolving-door relationship between state government for both elected and appointed officials and the lobbying industry in Maine. Former state lawmakers were paid thousands for working to influence their former colleagues and incumbents on a range of issues, the newspaper said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: At least 180 Afghan nationals are expected to arrive in the state amid a U.S. effort to evacuate allies from Afghanistan as the Taliban takes over the country. Maryland is prepared to receive even more refugees from Afghanistan as chaos embroils the country during the U.S. troop withdrawal, Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday. “Many of these Afghan citizens – our allies – bravely risked their lives to provide invaluable support for many years to our efforts as interpreters and support staff, and we have a moral obligation to help them,” Hogan said in a statement. The effort is part of “Operation Allies Refuge,” a program that provides Special Immigrant Visas to Afghans and Iraqis who assisted in U.S. efforts during military actions there. Democratic President Joe Biden set an Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan and end the conflict that began after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. “The chaotic and heartbreaking scenes out of Afghanistan over the last several days – with innocent civilians running for their lives in fear of the Taliban – is the result of a rushed and irresponsible withdrawal,” the Republican governor said in Monday’s statement. Hogan’s office said Maryland is “ready and willing to receive more” Special Immigrant Visa recipients.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Old North Church, a site pivotal to the freedom of the nation, is the same place where slave owners and traders once worshipped. Now, with a $75,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities announced Tuesday, the foundation responsible for the preservation of the church campus and the visitor experience plans to overhaul its educational programming to better reconcile and integrate those ties to slavery. “We’ll be able to address what I call the paradox of the Old North Church,” said Nikki Stewart, executive director of the Old North Foundation, which is distinct from the active Episcopal congregation that still uses the site for religious services. “People see us as a symbol of liberty and independence, but the reality is that the church benefited from the enslavement of Africans.” For example, the famous steeple was financed in part by the sale of logwood, the harvesting of which was dependent on slave labor, she said. The church, built in 1723, is known to generations of schoolchildren as the place where in 1775 two lanterns in the steeple signaled that the British were heading to Concord and Lexington “by sea” and set Paul Revere on the ride that ignited the American Revolution.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Jazz Festival announced Tuesday that it will shift to an all-virtual format for this year’s event, which runs Sept. 3-6. No audiences will be present for the performances, which will be streamed and broadcast live and free from closed, indoor sound stages at the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center. Shows will air on Detroit public radio and television and stream on the festival’s social media channels and website, as well as the DetroitJazzFest LIVE! app. “We’ve followed the COVID-19 numbers on a daily basis,” said Detroit Festival Foundation president and artistic director Chris Collins. The event – the world’s largest jazz festival that is free to attend – is typically held outdoors in downtown Detroit each Labor Day weekend. “Last year, we had great success with the virtual element of our festival,” Collins said. “We built custom soundstages in the Marriott complex, in major ballrooms with 20-foot ceilings and 26,000 square feet of space – huge, well-ventilated rooms. We limited it to performers and essential workers, the sound engineers and photographers and such … about 10 people. So there’s a great amount of control and security that puts the health and safety in proper perspective. A million viewers tuned in from 32 countries to watch the outcome.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A former U.S. Navy diver who helped efforts to search for bodies in the treacherous waters of the Mississippi River after the I-35W bridge collapse in 2007 has returned his awards to protest the Line 3 oil pipeline. John Miller, 39, a native of Monticello who now lives in Hawaii, asked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to stop construction on the pipeline replacement project until lawsuits challenging its approval play out in court, the Star Tribune reports. He spoke at an event Monday evening near the site of the bridge disaster, which killed 13 people and injured 145 others. Earlier Monday, Miller returned a commendation ribbon and pendant he received for his service, as well as a certificate of commendation from then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty. He said he grew up fishing and hunting and wants the pristine lands in northern Minnesota left alone for generations to enjoy. “The last time I came back to the Mississippi in distress was to help clean up after a disaster, and this time I come to do everything I can do to help prevent a disaster,” he said. Opponents say the new Line 3 will risk oil spills in waters where Native Americans harvest wild rice, and it will exacerbate climate change. Enbridge says the new pipeline, which replaces its aging current Line 3, is a safety enhancement that will restore its original capacity.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: Most of the state’s soybean crop is looking good, and so are prices, but some areas are still replanting acres that were flooded in June, Mississippi State University Extension Service experts say. Soybean specialist Trent Irby said 82% of the crop appears in good or excellent shape. Most of the state’s soybean crop was planted at normal times ranging from as early as late March through June after wheat harvest, he said. But he said soybeans were still being planted in mid-July and even late that month, leaving total acreage a big question. “Several areas around the state received big rain events during June that resulted in substantial flooding,” Irby said. “There were also areas impacted days later as rivers and creeks got out and flooded fields.” Agricultural economist Will Maples said prices are good, largely driven by a strong export market. “New crop November soybean futures averaged $13.72 per bushel for the week ending July 23, which is 35% higher than this time last year,” Maples said. “In early June, the November contract reached as high as $14.60 per bushel.” Maples said international demand for U.S. soybeans is expected to remain strong. “At this time of year, the soybean market is trading on the weather. Any weather disruptions on yield could have a price effect,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The summer surge of COVID-19 is causing a spike in deaths in the state, including 124 reported Tuesday. The state health department said 86 of those deaths were discovered in the agency’s weekly examination of death certificates from across the state, with one tracing to June, 52 to July and 33 to earlier this month. But 38 of the deaths were new, an unusually high one-day total. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Tuesday, Missouri ranked fourth in per capita deaths over seven days – and that doesn’t include the 124 additional deaths. The delta variant of the coronavirus began ravaging the state in June, causing a big rise in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Experts lay much of the blame on Missouri’s low vaccination rate. The CDC says just 50.2% of Missourians have initiated vaccination, compared to 59.8% of all Americans. Concerns about the spread of the virus have prompted the cancellation of Ozarks Pridefest for the second straight year. Organizers announced the decision Monday, citing the “overwhelming number of hospitalizations caused by COVID-19.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Blackfeet Reservation east of Glacier National Park implemented a mask mandate Monday after 18 cases of COVID-19 were identified in recent days. The mandate comes even as about 90% of reservation residents are fully vaccinated. In addition to a mask requirement, the tribe announced that its offices would be closed to the public, and it suspended nonessential travel for tribal programs. The travel restriction does not apply to tourists. The Blackfeet Reservation has allowed tourists to return this summer after last summer it closed to visitors to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The tribe’s announcement comes as Montana is experiencing increased spread of COVID-19, with several hot spots including Flathead Valley on the western side of Glacier National Park. The state announced 473 new cases Monday, bringing the number of active cases in Montana to more than 2,700. The state had 191 COVID-19-related hospitalizations on Monday – a number last recorded in January. Of the state’s eligible population, 49% of residents are fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, state health officials reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nSt. Paul: A state trooper shot and killed an 80-year-old man who pointed a rifle at officers after a dispute with a neighbor in the eastern Nebraska town of St. Paul, authorities said. The shooting happened shortly after 12:30 p.m. Saturday while officers were investigating an incident in which one man fired a gun during a dispute with a neighbor. Officers from the Nebraska State Patrol, Howard County Sheriff’s Office and St. Paul Police Department all responded in the town about 23 miles north of Grand Island. The Nebraska State Patrol said the officers found a man holding a rifle near a garage about 10 minutes after they arrived in the neighborhood. The man, identified as John Vogel of St. Paul, didn’t comply with commands to drop his gun and instead raised his rifle. The Nebraska State Patrol said a state trooper then fired his weapon twice, wounding Vogel. Officers gave him first aid until paramedics took him to a local hospital, where he died. The Nebraska State Patrol is investigating the shooting.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Vaccine verification at major venues emerged Tuesday as a coronavirus fighting front, with Las Vegas’ biggest trade conference following the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders in announcing they’ll require attendees to prove they’re inoculated. The Consumer Technology Association, sponsor of the CES gadget show, said it will require attendees in January to be vaccinated to enter venues including the expanded Las Vegas Convention Center, Mandalay Bay and Sands Expo center. “We understand vaccines offer us the best hope for stopping the spread of COVID-19,” Gary Shapiro, association president and CEO, said in a statement. “We are taking on our responsibility by requiring proof of vaccination to attend CES 2022 in Las Vegas.” The announcement came a day after Gov. Steve Sisolak said indoor venues with 4,000 or more attendees will be allowed to opt out of the state’s mask requirements if they opt in to a program ensuring that attendees have inoculations. The state vaccination rate topped 60% for the first time Tuesday for people ages 12 and older who have received at least one dose. State health officials said 49.5% of residents have been fully vaccinated. In the Las Vegas area, the figures ticked up a notch to 60.7% and 48.6%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Repeat drunken drivers who seriously injure or kill others will face longer prison sentences thanks in large part to a mother’s advocacy after the death of her son. Gov. Chris Sununu on Monday signed the Tyler Shaw Law, named for a 20-year-old Concord man who died in April 2018. It allows judges to hand down longer prison sentences to those convicted of negligent homicide who have previous drunken driving convictions. At the bill signing, he thanked Shaw’s mother for telling her story, the Concord Monitor reports. Beth Shaw said her experience with the criminal justice system showed her how broken it is. “I could not walk away without trying to make a change to honor Tyler and all the families who have lost loved ones to drunk driving,” she said. The driver who killed Tyler Shaw was sentenced to six to 12 years in prison. The crash marked his third arrest for driving while intoxicated. Former state Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, sponsored an earlier version of the bill, which was set aside during the coronavirus pandemic. Rep. Daryl Abbas, R-Salem, refiled the bill this year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A woman who killed her abusive ex-fiance can proceed with a lawsuit that claims her rights as a domestic violence victim were violated when a county prosecutor publicly identified her, an appeals court ruled Tuesday. The suit alleges the woman’s civil rights were violated in 2016 when former Warren County Prosecutor Richard Burke identified her after a grand jury declined to indict her. A lower court had dismissed the suit, saying the prosecutor was informing the public about the completion of a criminal investigation. According to court documents, the woman’s ex-fiance drove from Florida to New Jersey to confront her, armed with a handgun, knives, zip ties and duct tape. After sexually assaulting her, tying her up and threatening to kill her, he allegedly told her to kill him with his own gun, or else he would shoot her. She shot him in the shoulder, and he died at the scene. The lawsuit alleged that after the grand jury declined to indict her, Burke disclosed the results of the investigation, as well as her identity, “for the purpose of political and/or personal gain.” The suit named Burke, the prosecutor’s office, the county and former state attorneys general Christopher Porrino and Gurbir Grewal.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will begin routinely collecting demographic data about sexual orientation and gender identity during government surveys under an executive order signed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. The order Monday responds to growing concerns that basic demographic information about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations is being left out of an array of studies that shape public policy and governmental planning decisions. Officials at the National Institutes of Health are developing guidelines for collecting data on sexual orientation and gender identity to better serve unmapped LGBTQ populations. Lujan Grisham said survey responses will be voluntary as all state agencies begin collecting self-identification information. The order prohibits the public release of any personal identifying information. The governor called the order, lauded by several advocates for the LGBTQ community, a step toward identifying and addressing inequities in access to public resources. “If you really look at us as a community, we’ve never been asked who we are, ever,” said Democratic state Sen. Leo Jaramillo of Espanola, who is gay. “Now we’re included in a conversation and data-collecting that will then help in ways that we may not even see or think of.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: There’s a disconnect in the effort to make New York state less reliant on fossil fuels. Solar farms, wind turbines and hydro dams are producing more renewable power for the state, but it can be difficult to deliver that power south to the massive New York City market. So state officials are considering proposals to effectively plug the city into more green power through high-voltage transmission lines that would run underground or underwater for more than 100 miles. Different proposed lines would go beneath the Hudson River or be buried along the state thruway. One long-planned line would run down the entire state to deliver hydropower from Canada. The proposals are designed to bring New York state a big step closer to its goal of relying on renewable sources for 70% of its power by 2030. The Cuomo administration this year offered incentives to build the lines after analysts concluded it would be difficult to hit the statewide goal without targeting New York City, which relies heavily on fossil fuel. That reliance is expected to increase in the short term because of the recent closure of Indian Point nuclear facility just north of the city.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A program created by legislators to prevent overcrowding in state prisons has paid county jail operators millions of dollars to house certain offenders even as those facilities exceed capacity, according to a report released Monday. Disability Rights North Carolina, the report’s author, said 50 counties received $4.2 million combined to house and transport people sentenced for misdemeanors during months between 2018 and 2020 when their jails were above 100% capacity. Fourteen people died in 2018 and 2019 in overcrowded jails that were participating in what’s known as the Statewide Misdemeanant Confinement Program, the report said. “The conditions we found are extremely dangerous for all people in these overcrowded jails, staff and those housed in them, and we are especially concerned for the safety and well-being of people with disabilities in these jails,” group attorney Luke Woollard said in a news release. Jails have long have held people convicted of misdemeanors serving 90 days or fewer. State lawmakers passed a 2011 law that allowed jails, which are run by local sheriffs, to hold people sentenced to between 91 and 180 days for misdemeanors, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Jails received $40 per inmate per day. Sheriffs can opt out of the program.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Bakken Energy and Mitsubishi Power Americas on Monday announced they are acquiring a financially troubled synthetic natural gas plant in western North Dakota and plan to redevelop it to produce renewable energy. The companies said the deal to purchase the Great Plains Synfuels Plant from Dakota Gasification Co. is expected to be finalized by next April. Dakota Gasification is a subsidiary of Bismarck-based Basin Electric Power Cooperative. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The plant near Beulah is part of a proposed hub announced in June to produce clean hydrogen, which has a variety of uses including powering vehicles and energy generation. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum has hailed the project a key part of the state’s plan to become carbon-neutral by 2030. Officials said the hub consist of facilities that produce, store, transport and consume the carbon-free fuel. The hub will focus on the production of blue hydrogen, which is derived from natural gas with the carbon dioxide emissions captured and sequestered underground or used for enhanced oil recovery. Officials said they hope to connect the hub by a pipeline to other hubs throughout North America.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s Vax-a-Million giveaway contributed to more people getting COVID-19 shots, several independent analyses recently found. Vax-a-Million, announced by Gov. Mike DeWine on May 12, gave $1 million to five vaccinated adults and a college scholarship to five vaccinated youth over five weeks. The state spent about $5.6 million on the effort. Each analysis of the lottery varied in the number of people estimated to have received an initial shot following the announcement – as many as 200,000. But they shared several conclusions, including that the promotion was less costly than other incentives being offered. The studies contrast with an earlier study that received widespread media attention for its conclusion that the lottery didn’t increase vaccinations. Professors at Xavier University’s Health Economic and Clinical Outcomes Research gave the most generous estimate yet for the five-week lottery’s impact. They estimated 213,388 additional Ohioans were vaccinated due to the lottery, according to an analysis provided to the USA TODAY Network – Ohio. Assuming all inoculated children ages 12 to 15 would have been vaccinated without the lottery, that leaves more than 108,000 others who started the inoculation process as a result of the lottery.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After a deadly hostage situation March 27, officials at the Oklahoma County jail blamed staffing problems and promised to do better. “We’d like to get our staffing up to about 400,” the jail administrator, Greg Williams, said at a news conference days after an inmate took a guard hostage. Four months later, at the start of August, there were fewer full-time employees, not more. “Corrections facilities all over the country are experiencing staff shortages. We are no exception,” Williams said last week. “Frankly, lots of businesses are struggling to hire people right now.” And “COVID is certainly a factor.” At the news conference March 31, the jail administrator disclosed the facility only had 330 full-time employees. On Aug. 2, the number of full-time employees had fallen to 327, a jail spokesman said. On Monday, the workforce was up to 334, the administrator told the trust that took over operation of the jail last year. Seventeen employees, though, were out because of positive coronavirus tests.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown announced Monday that she is extending the statewide residential mortgage foreclosure moratorium, aimed at those experiencing financial hardship during the pandemic, until Dec. 31. The moratorium, which allows homeowners to put their mortgages in forbearance, was set to expire Sept. 30. Based on the measure’s language, this is the last extension that Brown is authorized to issue. “As we continue to see record-high numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations driven by the delta surge, I am committed to ensuring that Oregonians have a warm, dry, safe place to live during this pandemic,” Brown said. “Extending the temporary residential foreclosure moratorium another three months will prevent removal of Oregonians from their homes by foreclosure, which would result in serious health, safety, welfare, and financial consequences, and which would undermine key efforts to prevent spread of COVID-19.” During the pandemic, the state’s ongoing housing crisis has only been exacerbated. In late July, more than 49,000 Oregon homeowners said they were not caught up on their mortgage payments, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Saving the state tree could be key to protecting trout in one of the top fishing grounds in the nation and perhaps the world. The iconic hemlock is dying off, under siege from the invasive woolly adelgid bug that slowly sucks the life out of the giant trees. There is a direct correlation between hemlock and native trout, a species highly sensitive to water pollutants, stream erosion and warming temperatures. The situation is particularly crucial in Pennsylvania, which has more miles of stream than any state in the lower 48. The state is renowned for its fly fishing and trout, and hemlocks are one of the great protectors of their waters. The towering trees that often live for hundreds of years create their own ecosystems. Certain kinds of animal life, like warblers and salamanders, as well as insects and plants, depend upon them. Deer and others bed down under them for warmth in winter and to stay cool in summer. Hemlocks often reside along streams, their vast root systems helping to stabilize water levels and prevent erosion. Their branches provide unparalleled, cooling shade. Native trout, for example, require waters that don’t rise above the low-60s to spawn and thrive. They also eat the insects that eat fallen hemlock needles. When hemlocks die, there’s nothing substantial to take their place in short order.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Attorney General Peter Neronha has filed objections to rate increases sought by health insurers that do business in the state. The rate proposals currently under consideration by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner “raised concerns about affordability” for people who buy policies on the individual market, Neronha said. “Given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year, and in light of our analysis of the current financial strength of the involved health insurers, higher rates are not warranted, nor affordable for over 42,000 Rhode Islanders who purchase insurance on the individual market, and nearly 140,000 subscribers of small and large employer group plans,” he said. Blue Cross Blue Shield’s request is for a 3.1% increase in the individual market. Neighborhood Health Plan is seeking an 8.5% increase. Neighborhood said it offers the lowest-cost health plans on the state’s health insurance marketplace, and even with the proposed rate increase, “Neighborhood will still be the most cost effective option.” Blue Cross Blue Shield said in an email that it “recognizes the ongoing economic challenges facing its members due to COVID-19 and took steps to limit proposed rate increases.” The commissioner’s ruling is expected later this month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hundreds of students already quarantined for COVID-19 at the start of the fall semester, the state’s second-largest public school district will require masks in schools despite a state budget proviso that bans districts from doing so without risking funding. Charleston County School District’s board voted 8-1 Monday evening to approve an emergency ordinance to require masks for anyone who enters school buildings through mid-October. Board Chair Eric Mack said the ordinance was proposed for the safety of students and staff given the rapid spread of the delta variant. The district serving nearly 50,000 students is the first school board to openly flout the state budget proviso that went into effect July 1 and prohibits South Carolina educational institutions from using appropriated funds to mandate masks. A similar vote was cast by Richland County Council earlier Monday; that ordinance will require masks for students and educators who serve children ages 2 through 14 in public and private schools and day cares. The Charleston City Council was scheduled to vote on its own school mask rule Tuesday. Columbia leaders earlier this month made masks mandatory for schoolchildren in the capital city who are too young to receive COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A witness to an incident last week involving MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell says he saw no reason for Lindell to claim he was attacked. Lindell, who was in Sioux Falls hosting an election fraud symposium, said Tuesday that his encounter with a man seeking a photo late Wednesday at a hotel left him doubled over in pain. Lindell said he has filed a report of an assault with the Sioux Falls Police Department and is conducting his own investigation into how the photo-seeker could have shoved an object between his ribs, leaving him unable to move his right arm. But “there was no attack,” said Jeff Buongiorno, the conference attendee who was taking the photo. Buongiorno, a Republican congressional candidate in Florida, said he and two others were “shooting the breeze” at the hotel bar late Wednesday when they spotted Lindell in the lobby and asked to take a photo with the businessman who has become an ally of former President Donald Trump. Then another man Buongiorno did not know approached and sought his own photo, which Buongiorno offered to snap with the man’s phone. Buongiorno said nothing he saw could be described as an attack that would leave Lindell in pain. Buongiorno, who said he supported “law and order,” was concerned Lindell’s claim would take up police time and resources.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order Monday letting parents opt their children out of coronavirus-related mask mandates in K-12 schools, after a few school districts issued mask requirements for students and others. With the move, Lee also said he will not call the broad special legislative session requested by Republican House lawmakers to limit the authority of local officials to make rules aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19, which has seen a resurgence in Tennessee via the delta variant. All 73 Republicans in the state House signaled support for a special session last week, and a handful of school board meetings have become contentious as some parents fight mask mandates for their children. But the Senate’s Republican leader, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, had said he trusts locally elected school boards to set COVID-19 health rules for schools. McNally on Monday called Lee’s order an “appropriate compromise that strikes a proper balance between freedom and public health.” Lee has resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools and had left the decision to local school officials. The Republican governor’s order lets parents opt out if either a school board or a health department enacts a mask requirement over a school district.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: An Eanes school district parent assaulted a teacher and ripped off her face mask, according to an email that Superintendent Tom Leonard sent to the community Tuesday. The incident occurred after several weeks of tension and debate in the district over mask rules and mandates. “A parent physically assaulted a teacher by ripping a mask off her face, others yelling at a teacher to take off her mask because they could not understand what the teacher was saying while her face was covered,” Leonard’s email said. “This type of behavior will not be tolerated in Eanes ISD. Our staff are on the front lines of this pandemic; let’s give them some space and grace. Please, I am asking everyone to be kind. ... Do not fight mask wars in our schools.” Eanes, like other school districts in Travis County, has been caught in a legal tug of war between local and state officials over masks in schools. The district originally said it would not require masks but would encourage them, a position that was in line with Gov. Greg Abbott’s order banning mask requirements in schools. Travis County issued a contradictory order Aug. 11 that requires masks to be worn in schools. After a local judge upheld the county order, Eanes announced Saturday that it would reverse course and require masks in line with the county order.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Cuts to Colorado River apportionments announced Monday by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation triggered a new flood of protests against the city’s Lake Powell Pipeline project, the largest proposed diversion of additional water from this river that serves the needs of 40 million people throughout the West. “St. George is not going to get their pipeline,” said Robin Silver, a founder of the Center for Biological Diversity and a former Phoenix emergency room physician, in a press conference hosted by environmental groups Monday afternoon following the one held by the Bureau of Reclamation. “Whether they’re listening or not, they’re going to have no choice. But it’d be nice if they were listening so we could all figure out how to get out of this fix.” The Lake Powell Pipeline is the Washington County Water Conservancy District’s solution to the current rate of population growth outpacing its estimation of the local water supply. The project, which has been pursued by the state since the 1990s, would transport up to 28 billion gallons of water per year – enough to support about 150,000 households – from the Colorado River at Lake Powell 140 miles through the desert in a buried pipeline to Sand Hollow Reservoir for use by future St. George residents.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Lower College Street will be closed to vehicles for a month starting Friday as railroad track improvements are made near the waterfront for the long-awaited extension of the Amtrak train service from Rutland to Burlington. The west side of the street will be closed to vehicles until Sept. 17, but pedestrians and cyclists will be able to travel to Waterfront Park during the closure, the Vermont Agency of Transportation said. The Burlington bike path between Main and Colleges will remain closed for several more months. Amtrak passenger service is expected to return to Burlington next year. The Ethan Allen Express train, which travels from New York City to Rutland, is being extended north to Burlington, with stops in Middlebury and Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Republican state senator is among a group of people suing the Virginia Redistricting Commission over plans to count prisoners at their last known address instead of the prison where they’re incarcerated. The lawsuit says the change will politically weaken rural and conservative areas after the state draws new congressional and legislative districts. “Virginia prisons are typically located in rural districts with greater Republican voting strength, particularly in the southside and southwest regions of the commonwealth,” the suit said. The legal challenge was filed Friday in the Virginia Supreme Court. Petitioners include state Sen. Travis Hackworth, who represents a reliably Republican district that stretches from the Virginia-Kentucky border to Radford. Hackworth’s district includes five state correctional facilities, according to the lawsuit. Others who are suing include county representatives in western counties such as Buchanan and Tazewell. The lawsuit stems from the recent creation of the Virginia Redistricting Commission, which put redistricting in the hands of a bipartisan body. Voters approved the commission in a November referendum that amended the state constitution. But the lawsuit says other redistricting laws were passed by lawmakers outside the referendum and thus violated the state constitution.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee is planning to grant as many as 1,200 commutations for people on community supervision whose drug convictions have been deemed unconstitutional by the Washington Supreme Court. This spring, Inslee issued commutations to the handful of incarcerated people serving prison terms solely due to the overturned statute. Known as the Blake decision, the court overturned Washington’s felony drug-possession statute and rendered invalid decades of convictions. The ruling has made thousands of people eligible to get their records cleared and get paid back for legal financial obligations they paid while incarcerated or on supervision, but it has added to a backlog in the courts. The Seattle Times reports Inslee’s office said that as of Monday afternoon, the Democratic governor had signed 129 commutations for this latest round, and a spokesman said in an email that “new orders are being issued daily at this point, between 15 and 30 a day.” “I am committed to doing what I can to try to remedy the situation and assist the courts who are doing what they can to get through this backlog of cases,” Inslee said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The number of people hospitalized for the coronavirus in the state hit a six-month high Monday as a top health official warned that West Virginia is at a “defining moment” in its response to the pandemic. After two months of declines, virus-related hospitalizations in the state have increased sevenfold in the past six weeks, going from 52 on July 4 to 369 Monday. The majority are unvaccinated people, said Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus expert. Hospitalizations peaked at 818 in early January and haven’t been this high since there were 394 on Feb. 8. The number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units has jumped from 17 on July 4 to 127 on Monday, according to state health data. Marsh said residents must take more precautions, including getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and wearing masks, because the more contagious delta variant of the virus is now present in 43 of the state’s 55 counties. Such confirmed cases have more than tripled this month to least 322. “This is really the defining moment for us in many ways as we see COVID-19 growing in West Virginia,” Marsh said at a news conference. “We see our hospital numbers going up. We see our ICU numbers going up. We see the number of people on ventilators going up.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican state Sen. Andre Jacques, one of the Legislature’s most conservative lawmakers and a vocal opponent of mask and vaccine mandates, tested positive for the coronavirus last week and was at the hospital Monday with pneumonia. The positive test and hospital care came after Jacque testified Wednesday in a packed Capitol hearing room without wearing a mask. The lawmaker from De Pere did not immediately return a text message Tuesday seeking comment on his condition. His spokesman, Matt Tompach, provided a statement from Jacque dated Monday night and said Tuesday afternoon that he had no update on his condition. “Sen. Jacque appreciates respect for his family, and the tremendous expressions of support he’s received from others,” Tompach said. “He’s tired but in good spirits.” Jacque said in the Monday night email that some of his family members also tested positive for the virus. Jacque, 40, has six children, including an infant. Jacque said in the email that he was at the hospital with pneumonia but did not say if he had been admitted. Jacque said he has had pneumonia before but did not immediately say whether it was diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia. His office did not immediately respond to questions about whether Jacque was vaccinated.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state will not return to a mask order or require COVID-19 vaccines despite a resurgence of the coronavirus, Gov. Mark Gordon said Monday. “The issue is not masks; the issue is COVID,” Gordon, a Republican, said in a news conference. “Here’s the thing: We already know what to do. We’ve been through this before.” Gordon imposed a statewide mask mandate in December and lifted it in March. Even so, mandates can cause some people to resist wearing masks, he said. “We know that there’s value to masks, and we recommend those masks. We also know people have very strong concerns about masks,” Gordon said. He said he also didn’t expect any shutdowns like the public health orders that forced many Wyoming businesses and public places to close or limit occupancy through much of 2020 and into 2021. Gordon made the remarks as coronavirus infections, because of the delta variant circulating worldwide, were back to levels unseen in Wyoming since January, though still roughly four times less than at the pandemic’s worst last November. Laramie County on Monday had the state’s highest infection rate, 698 per 100,000 people, followed by Natrona (469) and Campbell (324) counties, according to the Wyoming Department of Health.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/18"}]}

The requests will continue to the Legislature, which has the final say on state funding of education.\n\nWalters' budget plan differs from the version his predecessor, Joy Hofmeister, put together. The new superintendent nixed Hofmeister's proposed $5,000 across-the-board teacher pay raise, which would have cost nearly $310 million.\n\nInstead, he suggested the state spend $150 million to offer incentive pay raises for teachers who are highly rated based on their students' performance, classroom practices and time spent in professional development, such as achieving National Board Certification.\n\nRaises would range from $2,500 to $10,000 on top of the state's minimum salary schedule, Walters said. He did not say what student performance measures would be used as evaluating tools, nor how school districts would be expected to implement the program.\n\n\"We believe that we have to find ways to find teachers who are doing a great job, No. 1, but also incentivize them as they continue to grow,\" Walters said. \"We have to keep these teachers.\"\n\nA new state law offers matching funds to cover half of a pay raise for teachers who earn certain credentials and mentor their colleagues, but it's unclear whether the criteria to earn an incentive raise would meet the same qualifications for matching funds from the 2022 law.\n\nSome state lawmakers have suggested pay raises for all teachers. The leader of the Senate Education Committee, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, filed Senate Bill 482 to increase minimum salaries by $3,000 for teachers with under 15 years of experience and by $6,000 for educators with a 15-year career or longer.\n\nThe state's largest teachers union, the Oklahoma Education Association, said educator salaries should be competitive with the rest of the region.\n\n\"The metrics used to determine merit-based pay are controversial and inequitable,\" OEA President Katherine Bishop said. \"Our students deserve educators who are compensated and respected as the professionals they are. Previous pay raises for all educators have proven to increase quality candidates to the profession.\"\n\nOklahoma teachers earn an average of $54,000 a year, which ranks fourth among all bordering states. The state last increased minimum teacher pay in 2019 with a $1,200 raise, added on top of the $6,100 boost approved in 2018.\n\nA chronic teacher shortage persists in Oklahoma. Between 4,200 and 5,300 teachers left the classroom each year from the 2012-2013 school year to 2020-21, according to a 2021 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.\n\n“I know that the Legislature wants to see high outcomes for students, and certainly the Legislature understands that we have to make a priority with kids and their education,” Hofmeister said after the state board in September agreed to pass her $5,000 raise request to lawmakers. “That means ensuring we’ve got the people and that investment in the (teacher) workforce.”\n\nThe state Board of Education on Thursday approved an overall budget request of $3.51 billion for the state Education Department, lower than Hofmeister's ask of $3.57 billion. The vast majority of those funds would pass through the agency to public schools.\n\nThe $3.51 billion request would increase state education funding by about $330 million over current levels.\n\nPart of the increase, should lawmakers give the OK, would include a $100 million investment in kindergarten through third-grade literacy. After third grade, students without a strong grasp of reading are known to struggle to comprehend classwork.\n\nWalters called the $100 million proposal the \"most comprehensive reading plan in the country,\" though the specifics of each initiative within it are still hazy. He said it would put money toward reading materials, tutoring in the science of reading, dyslexia intervention grants, and hiring high school and college students to assist in schools.\n\n\"If we don't get this part right ... it gets progressively more difficult when students can't read at the later levels,\" Walters said.\n\nThe new state superintendent will present his budget request to House and Senate lawmakers in the following weeks. The 2023 legislative session begins Feb. 6.\n\nSome House lawmakers were angry when Walters presented Hofmeister's budget request, not his own, in a hearing at the Capitol on Tuesday. House legal staff instructed Walters to present his predecessor's budget plan, which he promised to change, because the state Board of Education hadn't yet approved an amendment to it.\n\n“Hopefully (the next meeting is about) numbers because I am not a policy guy. That’s not my job. I want to see the numbers,” said Rep. Mark McBride, R-Moore, chairperson of the House budget committee on education. “We need to put more money into the (education funding) formula. We need to pay teachers more.”\n\nReporter Nuria Martinez-Keel covers K-12 and higher education throughout the state of Oklahoma. Have a story idea for Nuria?

The Rochester school declined $1.2 million from the state in incentive money in exchange for getting $12 million in tuition revenue.\n\nEastern Michigan University made the same calculation in June — $1 million is much smaller than $10 million.\n\nThe simple math is a why university presidents across Michigan are coming to a similar conclusion: The incentive money attached to a state tuition cap and other performance measures put in place by Gov. Rick Snyder isn't a big enough carrot to keep tuition down.\n\nIf OU would have forfeited more money — like $6 million — for going over the cap, a different decision might have been made, Hynd admits.\n\nUniversity presidents said they think more schools will go with bigger increases in coming years unless a new funding system is put in place.\n\nA completely new funding system isn't likely, but lawmakers say there will be talks this fall about tweaks, including increasing the penalty for exceeding the tuition cap.\n\n\"I think we've got to come back with some response to a tuition hike that is five times inflation,\" said state Rep. Al Pscholka, R-Stevensville, the chairman of the House appropriations committee and former chairman of the House higher education subcommittee. \"I don't want us to overreact, but we need some response. We do need to put some teeth into it. I think we need to look at base funding and if they are going to increase tuition by X percent over cap, then we need to reduce the base funding. That's an option.\"\n\nSnyder is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\"The governor's office is always analyzing the impact of its initiatives and we will continue to monitor the role performance funding has played in holding down the cost of a college education for both new and returning students,\" spokesman Dave Murray said.\n\nHynd — and other university presidents — said they would like to see the funding formula looked at as well. They say they need more funding and blame state cuts — including a 15% cut in 2011 — for making these hikes necessary.\n\nState Rep. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, agrees more state funding is needed.\n\n\"I'm always disappointed by these increases, because you know they will impact students,\" said Singh, who serves on the state House's higher education subcommittee. \"I'm not surprised though. There isn't enough resources dedicated by the state to higher education.\n\n\"I hope my colleagues won't overreact and hurt those institutions because it just hurts students.\"\n\nOU's decision\n\nLast Monday and Tuesday, Hynd and other OU officials spent the day on the phone, talking with lawmakers, trying to make the case for why they were about to exceed the state-imposed tuition cap.\n\nThe argument boiled down to numbers. The amount of money needed to do the things Oakland wanted to do — add faculty, increase staff, upgrade technology, improve facilities — was much greater than the $1.2 million being offered by the state under performance funding. An 8.48% tuition hike would raise $12 million, enough to get a good start on what a new strategic plan told them they needed to be doing.\n\n\"From a pure dollar point, it makes all the sense to go over the cap,\" Hynd said. \"We're getting squeezed from both ends. The state, over a number of years, has disinvested in higher education, and even though they have added money back recently, still are underfunding us. Parents and students want us to keep costs low.\n\n\"I think there needs to be a much larger conversation about how the public wants to fund higher education.\"\n\nMichigan has two ways of dividing up its pot of money headed to the 15 public universities.\n\nThe bulk of the money comes through what is known as the \"base,\" which is money coming to the universities the same way it has been coming for decades. There's no formula for how the money is divided. The amounts were set decades ago in political deals and the differences between the universities have stayed mostly the same.\n\nThe amounts range from the $295 million headed to the University of Michigan to the $12 million earmarked for Lake Superior State University.\n\nThen, additional money slated for the universities is divided up based on a formula that looks at performance measures like graduation rates, percentage of students getting Pell Grants and percent of budget spent on instruction, along with several other items. In order to qualify for that pot of money, universities have to stay under a tuition cap, set this year at 3.2%.\n\nThis year, $20 million — or a 1.5% increase in total higher education funding — was divided up using the performance funding\n\nUnder the formula, Grand Valley State University gets the biggest percentage hike — 3%; while Wayne State University gets the smallest — 0.4%. Two years ago, Wayne State gave up its performance funding in favor of an 8.9% tuition increase and received an additional $7 million in tuition revenue. This year, Wayne State settled for a 3.2% hike.\n\nSnyder introduced the cap and the performance funding in 2012.\n\n\"The tuition cap was included because the governor wants to keep a college education in reach for all students,\" Snyder spokesman Murray said. \"We know that many students are leaving college with significant debt. Michigan needs to attract more students to post-secondary education, and cost is unquestionably an obstacle for many families.\"\n\nEastern's decision\n\nLike Oakland, Eastern's decision to go over the cap was also a simple numbers game.\n\nThe university could stay under the cap and get about $1 million in performance funding. Or it could raise tuition 7.8% and get $10 million.\n\nPresident Susan Martin, who stepped down earlier this month, said the extra money is needed after years of keeping tuition increases down, including no increase five years ago.\n\n\"We have a very tight balance sheet,\" Martin said. \"Our balance sheet is too thin. We need to improve our reserves and use the money to help with needed capital improvements. We never have enough money for what we need to do. We've tried to manage as best as we can, but this step was needed.\"\n\nEastern is a rare state public university to see a dip in its unrestricted net assets in the past couple of years, financial statements show. Unrestricted net assets are money that the university can spend however it wishes to spend. In many cases, university administrators and boards have targeted the money toward specific projects, but can change where that money is being spent if they wish.\n\nAt Eastern, unrestricted net assets dropped from $24.7 million at the end of the 2012-13 school year to $20.9 million at the end of the 2013-14 school year, the latest data available.\n\nOakland, on the other hand, saw its unrestricted net assets increase during the same time period, from $147 million to $154 million.\n\n\"Unspent investment income in the endowment fund was the primary funding source which increased OU's unrestricted net assets in FY2014,\" Vice President for Finance and Administration John Beaghan told the Free Press in a June e-mail. \"Investment income can not be counted on annually to fund base expenditures, therefore, it is not a source of funding that can offset tuition increases.\"\n\nChange the system?\n\nNo Michigan public university president will admit right now that they will raise tuition over whatever the cap is next year. Several, however, said they won't be surprised if there are a couple more universities that go over the cap for the same reasons as OU.\n\n\"The university board has the right to react to (the cap),\" said Grand Valley President Thomas Haas. \"They have the fiduciary responsibility to set the tuition rate and have to determine what is best for their university.\"\n\nHaas likes the performance funding — \"it brings accountability,\" he said. Grand Valley has done well under the funding formula, ranking first this year, with a 3% increase under performance funding.\n\nBut, he pointed out, the bulk of the money is still tied up in the base. And, Haas adds, that base has been cut over the last decade, making tuition the largest revenue source for universities, not state aid.\n\nThat's echoed by Daniel Hurley, the CEO of the Presidents Council, State Universities of Michigan.\n\n\"If states begin reinvesting, tuition caps are unnecessary,\" Hurley said.\n\nSo how should Michigan fund its universities?\n\nThat depends on who you ask.\n\nCentral Michigan President George Ross has been the leading advocate to switching to a system much like K-12 funding in Michigan that assigns a dollar figure to each student. Universities then get state aid in a simple formula — number of students enrolled times dollar amount attached to each student equals funding.\n\n\"Our funding levels were set decades ago by political decisions,\" he said. \"Dollars should follow students.\"\n\nCentral last year got $3,787 per student in state aid, according to figures from the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency. That's below the state average of $4,775.\n\nIf Central got the average, it would have $31 million more in state aid.\n\nThe five lowest per-student schools – U-M-Dearborn, U-M-Flint, Saginaw Valley State University, Grand Valley and OU are the five newest universities in the state. OU has the lowest per-pupil state funding at $2,870. Wayne State has the highest, at $8,414.\n\nLake Superior State University President Thomas Pleger said the state funding should make sure to fund universities according to missions, including those who keep tuition low.\n\n\"Long-term, Michigan needs to have a series of access universities,\" Pelger said. \"The state should invest so they can keep tuition low.\"\n\nConvincing state lawmakers to change the system will be hard.\n\n\"The formula, for the most part, is working,\" said state Rep. Mike McCready, R-Bloomfield Hills, who is the chairman of the House higher education appropriations subcommittee. \"When you create a formula, you need to stick with it.\n\n\"At the end of the day, each student will make their choice on where to go to school.\"\n\nContact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

How civics education in Erie school districts encourages student engagement\n\nWestEd would work with teachers and administrators to develop techniques to reverse Erie High's academic decline and to better address social and emotional issues that many of the school's 2,215 students are dealing with. WestEd would tailor its approach to the needs of Erie High, including working on the curriculum.\n\nThe administration of Erie schools Superintendent Brian Polito is asking the Erie School Board to vote to hire WestEd at the board's monthly meeting on Wednesday at 6 p.m. at East Middle School.\n\nAdministration officials gave a presentation on WestEd at the board's nonvoting study session this past Wednesday. No board members objected to the hiring at the study session.\n\nWestEd's involvement offers the best way for the Erie High to recover and end the risk of state oversight due to its poor academic performance, district administrators said. They said WestEd, a national nonprofit with more than 1,100 employees, has aided the rapid turnaround of schools in other cities, including Buffalo.\n\n\"We know that Erie High is not operating at the capacity it can be,\" Teresa Szumigala, the assistant Erie schools superintendent who handles academics, said in an interview. \"The ultimate goal is to strengthen our practices and improve our outcomes in all areas.\"\n\nWhy does the Erie School District want to bring in a consultant?\n\nThe district has focused on improving Erie High since the district created it in 2017 by merging three high schools, largely for financial reasons. East High School and Strong Vincent High School were consolidated on the site of what had been Central High School, 3325 Cherry St., which the district renamed Erie High. Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy remains a separate high school.\n\nThe efforts to fix Erie High took on more urgency in January. The state Department of Education placed it in a federal category known as A-TSI, for Additional Targeted Support and Improvement.\n\nTo be categorized as A-TSI, a school must have one or more student groups that are performing below the level of schools designated as CSI, for Comprehensive Support and Improvement.\n\nThe academic performance for a CSI school is so poor that the school gets a a state-appointed improvement facilitator, according to Pennsylvania guidelines. A CSI school has a graduation rate of 67% or lower or is in the bottom 5% academically for all students in Title I schools, which have a high percentage of students who live in poverty.\n\nErie High's situation is similar to that of the district's Pfeiffer-Burleigh Elementary School years ago. It underwent an intense program to boost its students academic performance as a CSI school.\n\nThe only other Erie School District school labeled an A-TSI school in January is East Middle School. Polito said its problems areas are fewer than those at Erie High, and that the school district will develop an in-house turnaround plan for East.\n\nWhat are some education statistics for Erie High?\n\nThe CSI, A-TSI designations and other labels are part of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, which became law in 2015. It replaced the No Child Left Behind Act, which became law in 2002.\n\nExpanding experiences:'An exciting time': Erie High works to re-energize career and technical education\n\nA total of 70.3.% of Erie High seniors graduated within four years in 2021-22, up from 64.3% in 2020-21, according to district data. A total of 72.7% of Erie High seniors graduated within five years in 2021-22, up from 71.6% in 2020-21, according to the data.\n\nErie High's A-TSI designation has more to do with the school's overall academic performance than it does with graduation rates, according to the criteria for an A-TSI tag.\n\nAccording to state data, 11.7% of the students scored proficient or advanced — or recorded passing scores — in language arts on the Keystone Exams in 2021-22.\n\nA total of 6.3% of Erie High students scored proficient or advanced in math and algebra, and 11.5% scored proficient or advanced in math in science and biology.\n\nState data also shows 83% of Erie High students were listed as economically disadvantaged as of June 2022. The racial breakdown of Erie High, according to the data as of June 2022, was 41% Black, 35.3% white, 14.5% Hispanic, 4.5% Asian, approximately 0.3% of other races or ethnicities and 4.5% of two or more races.\n\nThe Erie School District also cited disciplinary concerns at Erie High. The administration said it is looking to WestEd to help limit those problems.\n\nAs of the third quarter of the 2022-23 school year, 26% of the students at Erie High had been suspended at least on day, according to district data. The district classified 48.4% of the students as chronically absent.\n\nHow did the pandemic affect Erie High?\n\nAs the Erie High saw its students academic performance decline during the pandemic, the school has struggled with social problems that officials said festered during the outbreak, when students lacked structure as they took classes online rather than in the classroom.\n\nOne student shot another student in a hallway at Erie High in April 2022, and students at Erie High and other district schools have been caught up in other youth violence that has plagued Erie during and after the pandemic — a period during which youth gangs have proliferated, according to Erie police and court records.\n\n\"The pandemic caused some of these issues,\" Polito said. He said the correlation is why the district can use the $553,800 in pandemic-related federal funds to pay for WestEd. The money is from the district's American Rescue Plan allocation.\n\n\"We have never had the opportunity to do anything like this because our finances were so tight,\" Polito told the School Board at the study session this past Wednesday. \"We do have the stimulus funds.\"\n\nHe was referring to the 10,000-student Erie School District's protracted financial crisis, which ended when the state removed it from financial oversight in September.\n\nPolito and other administrators said WestEd will help Erie High look at different ways to address students' social and emotional needs.\n\nChange in fortune:Erie School District removed from financial oversight as state praises turnaround\n\nErie High will be designated an A-TSI school for three years before the state evaluates its progress. The Erie School District hopes WestEd, if hired, will get the school out of the classification, and keep it out of a CSI designation.\n\nWhere case stands:A year after Erie High shooting, a plea deal could be near for teen defendant\n\n\"We want to be proactive in moving the school in a new direction academically,\" Polito said in an interview. \"They have a track record of turning around schools just like Erie High,\" he said of WestEd. \"We thought Erie High would benefit from having a team like them to work with.\"\n\nWhat do the administrators and teachers think of WestEd?\n\nWestEd's team will work closely with the Erie High administration, particularly its principal, Don Orlando. Polito and Szumigala, the assistant superintendent, stressed that the push to bring in WestEd was not meant to be a criticism of the teachers and administrators at Erie High. They said WestEd's involvement would be designed to help those who work at Erie High every day.\n\nOrlando said he welcomes the additional support.\n\n\"I'm very excited to have this partnership,\" Orlando told the School Board at the study session this past Wednesday. \"We are lifelong learners. Improvement never stops, never ends. We feel we are on the verge of doing a lot of great things and we are already headed in a positive direction this school year.\n\n\"But we are open to having someone come in and take a look at our practices and make sure we are doing best practices in every area of our building and help us make those changes,\" Orlando said. \"Because our community and kids deserve the best high school they can have and we are open to whatever it takes to do that.\"\n\nThe Erie Education Association teachers' union was part of the discussions to bring in WestEd, Polito said. When asked about the proposal to bring in WestEd, the president of the 840-member EEA, Mary Theuerkauf, said:\n\nLatest youth violence:Testimony reveals gang beef led to 14-year-old's shooting on Cherry Street in Erie\n\n\"There is a lot to examine and it's a complex situation, but the solution must improve the time we spend with the students. We need to nurture them back from the pandemic.\n\n\"That experience brought into stark focus how much these children need their teachers and how critical the school environment is to their safety and wellbeing. We need to create a new culture of learning. And Erie teachers and education specialists are up to that challenge.\"\n\nPossible tax increase at Erie School District\n\nThe Erie School District has a June 30 deadline to pass a budget for 2023-24, but the School Board is indicating it favors a tax increase of 2.46%.\n\nA majority of the board members expressed support for a 2.46% increase at the board's monthly non-voting study session this past Wednesday. Based on that consensus, the board this Wednesday is expected to approve a preliminary budget with a 2.46% increase at the board's monthly voting meeting at East Middle School.\n\nThe board has until June 30 to alter that budget. In considering possible change, the school directors said they will take into account how much funding the district receives in the state's 2023-24 budget, which also has a June 30 deadline.\n\nA 2.46% increase would raise taxes by $45.53 for the owner of a home assessed at $100,000, according to the Erie School District. A 2.46% increase would also raise an additional $1,194,894 in revenue, the district said.\n\nErie schools Superintendent Brian Polito is recommending that the board raise taxes to help the district offset increased costs due to inflation and to ensure that the district has a fund balance for years to come.\n\nThe district had risked insolvency for years due to funding woes and increased expenses. The state in 2017 helped the district by increasing the district's annual state funding by $14 million a year, starting in 2018. The state removed the district from financial oversight in September, signaling that the district's financial recovery was complete.\n\nThe state-mandated financial improvement plan that the district had to follow while under oversight recommended annual tax increases of 2.46%, mainly to give the district enough revenue to keep up with expenses and maintain a fund balance.

Exact income numbers vary based on household size.\n\nScholarships had originally been limited to those students if they attended one of the state’s 100 lowest-performing public schools, but the program was opened up to any student in kindergarten through eighth grade in a 2021 revision.\n\nMore:Laura Kelly's budget boosts special education funding, state worker pay. Here's what to know.\n\nThe program currently limits the maximum credit any taxpayer can receive to $500,000, and the program as a whole is capped at $10 million.\n\nThe program has never met that limit, but the Kansas Department of Revenue estimates that the program reached about $5 million in approved credits for the 2022 tax year, and an audit last year determined the program’s recent growth would cause it to reach its limit in the next few years.\n\nBill could double personal limits, $10M cap on Kansas tax credit scholarship program\n\nUnder HB 2048, the tax credit would go up from 70% to a dollar-for-dollar match, still subject to the $500,000 limit for any individual taxpayer.\n\nLegislative staff estimate that increase would cause donations, and subsequent tax credits, to go up an additional $5 million this tax year, with an additional $2 million in growth each subsequent year.\n\nFor that reason, the bill also contains a provision that would require the state treasurer to unilaterally increase the tax credit program by 20% any time approved credits exceed 80% of the current maximum, up to $20 million.\n\nMore:Kansas bill to criminalize transgender health care for youths. Here's what to know.\n\nThe program would become open to high school students for the first time, and new provisions would also allow open the program to any students who are in foster care or whose parents are emergency medical service providers, firefighters, law enforcement or on active duty in the U.S. armed forces,\n\nSeveral administrators, parents and even students from private schools around Kansas spoke in support of the bill, arguing it allows low-income families access to better opportunities for themselves and their children.\n\nBecause of the program, Holy Savior Catholic Academy was able to grow from 146 students in 2018 to 219 students in 2022, said Delia Shropshire, president of the school. Although the school is a part of the Catholic Diocese of Wichita, only 24% of the school’s enrollment is Catholic.\n\n“As the law expanded, so has our enrollment, and as it has progressed, so has the ability for students to choose our school,” she said.\n\nMore:Gov. Laura Kelly gives her 2023 State of the State address to the Kansas Legislature\n\nWhile many may see the tax credit scholarship program as an indictment of public schools as inferior, legislators should instead see the program as being rooted in choice for families, said Terrell Davis, head of school at The Independent School in Wichita. Prior to his leadership at that private preparatory school, Davis was a lobbyist and director of public affairs for Wichita USD 259.\n\n“It’s not about different ideologies,” he said. “It’s not about private or public. This is simply about kids, and what is in the best interest of kids — all kids.”\n\nPublic school advocates ask committee members ‘Where’s the beef’ that proves tax credit program success\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from most of the state’s major public education advocacy groups cautioned legislators that the bill, like many other school choice measures, was a misnomer, since parents have always had the right to enroll their children in non-public school options.\n\nIncreasing the tax credit limits would not be charity but rather tax avoidance, said Erin Woods, a volunteer for Game On For Kansas Schools, a non-partisan public school advocacy group based out of Johnson County.\n\nMore:Kansas high school graduation rates increase. Here's why commissioner says it's not enough\n\nCompared to public schools, which are legally required to accept all students, Woods said private schools are free to turn away families, especially those who do not meet strict religious or ideological criteria or require costly, intensive special education services.\n\nDavis, the private school administrator, had conceded that many private schools are not equipped with the resources to handle such students, but that they work with public schools to handle any needed special education services.\n\n“This bill hands over public tax dollars to schools that do the choosing,” Woods said. “We believe schools receiving public funds should accept and retain all students who apply.”\n\nMary Sinclair, president of the Kansas State Parent Teacher Association and a Shawnee Mission Board of Education member, said the organization wasn’t necessarily opposed to school choice, but rather hesitated to divert what would have otherwise been state revenue to programs whose successes aren’t clear.\n\nWhile scholarships for students have to be to private schools either accredited by the Kansas State Board of Education or by another recognized accrediting agency, lawmakers and state agencies have not evaluated the academic success of students or their retention rates once they attend those private schools.\n\nAnn Mah, a Democratic member of the Kansas State Board of Education and former state representative, told the committee that no evidence shows the tax credit program has actually worked to improve student outcomes.\n\nMore:Compact could help out-of-state teachers get Kansas licenses. State board not convinced yet\n\n“The original intent was to allow low-income students struggling public schools to go to private schools that perform better and obtain academic achievement,” Mah said. “So where’s the beef? Where are the numbers that show that it worked — that our Kansas scholarship students actually do better academically in private schools?\n\n“Where is the oversight?” Mah continued. “It’s almost like we don’t want to know. If it was a public school program, you would want data six ways from Sunday, but handing out huge tax breaks to an unproven program (is OK).”\n\nDemocrats see Kansas tax credit scholarship program as 'shell game' to avoid tax liability\n\nAlthough Thursday’s hearing was simply to hear testimony and not yet argue the bill, committee members essentially began to debate HB 2048 through sharp questions and criticisms of those presenting testimony.\n\nRepublican members pointed out that even if increased to $20 million, the tax credit scholarship program would be a miniscule amount compared to the nearly-$6 billion the state otherwise spends on public schools.\n\nMore:Should homeschooled students have a right to play in Kansas high school sports?\n\nThey jumped to a Kansas State Department of Education figure that shows on average, public schools spend about $19,000 per student, compared to very rough and varying estimates of about $6,000 at private schools.\n\nThat comparison, though, is flawed, since the $19,000 estimate includes all sources of school funding, including federal and local dollars, although state funding is still the biggest chunk. The public schools estimate also includes special education students, who might require tens of thousands of dollars in additional services, skewing any average.\n\nThe dollar-for-dollar tax credit would also be unlike any other credit offered in Kansas, argued Rep. Mari-Lynn Poskin, a Leawood Democrat in her second year in the House.\n\nThe program, then, could be rife for abuse if a pastor were to direct his or her entire congregation to determine their personal and business tax liabilities and donate the equivalent amounts to scholarship-granting organizations, she said.\n\n“Holy tax scams, that is a masterful shell game,” Poskin said. “For the good of the committee, I just want to reiterate that any religious organization or dark money special interest groups can basically divert their entire group’s entire Kansas tax liability, up to those limits, from our state general funds.”\n\nRepublicans vow to make 2023 the year for school choice in Kansas\n\nFor years, Republican lawmakers have pushed to greatly expand funding for non-public school options in Kansas, but those efforts had made much smaller progress than the lawmakers had hoped for in recent years.\n\nOne priority has been to create an education savings account program that would allow families to use public funding for private school tuition and other education expenses.\n\nLawmakers in Iowa this month rushed to pass a massive school choice bill that allow any Iowa family access to up to $7,598 in taxpayer funds for education savings account. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the bill into law Tuesday, and the measure is expected to cost $345 million annually once it is fully phased in over the next four years.\n\nMore:Should homeschooled students have a right to play in Kansas high school sports?\n\nSpeaking at a National School Choice Rally in the Kansas Statehouse on Wednesday, Sen. Molly Baumgardner, R-Louisburg and chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee, told a group of over 100 private school children that she wants her committee to do the same for Kansas.\n\n“Even though I’m proud to be a Kansas Senator, a Kansas mom and even a Kansas grandma, I wished earlier this week that I was a part of that debate in Iowa, because they had a victory there,” Baumgardner said. “But guess what I want to do with my committee members? We’re going to make sure that you guys go to the schools because it’s your parents’ decision what’s best for you.”\n\nRep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican and chair of the House K-12 Education Budget Committee, on Wednesday introduced the Sunflower Education Equity Act, which would create a similar education savings account program in Kansas.\n\nShe told The Capital-Journal after the hearing that she was confident Kansans support school choice expansion.\n\n“People want choice,” she said. “We live in a very diverse society, and we’re changing the way that we think, the way that we operate and the way we educate. We have technology that’s abound, and I think we should be progressive enough to allow different types of education.”\n\nAlthough school choice bills have been popular among the Republican majorities in the statehouse, getting those bills passed has been a decidedly uphill battle, especially in rallying enough votes to overturn any vetoes from Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nMore:How can Kansas put students into teacher pipeline? Start with more money, task force says.\n\nThroughout her first term, Kelly has voted down most bills related to school choice. She had signed an expansion of the tax credit program reluctantly in 2021, mostly out of a sense of bipartisanship and a bigger goal of compromise to fully fund Kansas’ public schools.\n\nAt the start of her second term, Kelly said she would remain staunchly opposed to any measures that could take away from public school funding.\n\n“I am firmly opposed to school vouchers, always have been,” Kelly told reporters Monday. “I do believe that taxpayer dollars ought to be focused on our public school system. I have always believed that, I continue to believe that.\"\n\nRafael Garcia is an education reporter for the Topeka Capital-Journal.

With the Legislature’s hiring of the New Jersey-based firm EdBuild to propose changes to the oft-debated, twice fully funded Mississippi Adequate Education Program, rewriting the state education formula could be on tap for the approaching legislative session.\n\nIn addition to funding, lawmakers also are expected to hone in on school consolidation, the state’s early learning collaborative and school performance.\n\nStudent-based emphasis\n\nThe structure for the formula is average daily attendance times base student cost plus at-risk component minus local contribution plus 8-percent guarantee. Meant to ensure “adequate current operation funding levels,” the formula has been decried by critics as a behemoth and defended by education advocates and cash-strapped districts who have fought fiercely for funding.\n\nWith top Republican leadership, including Gov. Phil Bryant, expressing support for a student-centered funding formula, both sides are wondering if the 2017 session will sound the death knell for the current MAEP structure.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSenate Education Chairman Gray Tollison, R-Oxford, said lawmakers would “more than likely be considering revisiting the formula.”\n\nEdBuild CEO Rebecca Sibilia has said Mississippi’s funding structure is a hybrid encompassing both student and resource-based funding. Allocations for exceptional-needs students, for example, are based on teacher units, rather than the student’s condition. Under a student-based mechanism, weights for certain needs and characteristics, such as those receiving free and reduced lunch and English-language learners, could be considered add-ons to the base student amount.\n\n“In 20 years, a lot has changed in other states about (school) financing,” Tollison said.\n\n“I think we can be a lot more specific based on a student (as opposed to) a general funding formula across the school districts.”\n\nTollison suggested that having multipliers added to a base student amount would be better suited to meeting student needs.\n\nHouse Education Chairman John Moore, R-Brandon, also said he is in favor of adjusting the current structure but doesn't want it rushed.\n\n“Over the last five years, we’ve known there’s been some issues, but I’ve been very hesitant,” Moore explained. “I don’t want to do anything that will be detrimental.”\n\nBefore considering changes, Moore said, lawmakers should run “tests” analyzing how funds would be allocated to districts — the agreement between the Legislature and EdBuild references a finance simulator tool.\n\nSome stakeholders are leery that during the evaluation the reality that the formula is routinely underfunded will be lost in the details. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Mississippi is one of 35 states where funding per student in the 2013-14 school year was lower than pre-recession levels.\n\nThe next year the Legislature increased the K-12 education budget by $110 million. But several districts took a hit in a budget cut ordered by Bryant in April amid falling revenue.\n\n“We hope to see an increase in funding for school districts, which are struggling in their ninth consecutive year of underfunding and budget cuts,” said Nancy Loome with the Parents’ Campaign, an education advocacy organization.\n\nEarly learning collaborative\n\nIn May, the National Institute for Early Education Research recognized the state’s early learning collaborative as among the top five in the nation.\n\nAnd the state Board of Education recently granted partnerships to providers in Canton, Greenwood, Grenada and Starkville and has expanded the slots in the state-funded prekindergarten classes from 1,700 to 2,200.\n\nFunds for the touted successful partnerships, however, reach fewer than 10 percent of the state’s 4-year-olds. The Legislature appropriated $4 million for the collaboratives for the 2016-17 school year. A $6 million funding increase is being sought for the next fiscal year.\n\nAbout two-thirds of students in Mississippi begin kindergarten without necessary skills, according to the board, citing research that shows children who start school behind “continue to struggle throughout elementary, middle and high school, and have lower graduation rates.”\n\nSince its inception in 2013, appropriation amounts for the program have fallen short of education officials' requests.\n\nThe collaborative exists outside the MAEP formula. During a joint education session with EdBuild, Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, who authored the collaborative, asked whether it would be possible to include the program in a rewritten education formula.\n\nWhile Sibilia said the inclusion could work, Wiggins told The Clarion-Ledger he’s not in favor of the addition if it alters quality.\n\nHe noted that “traditionally districts throughout the state have not focused on early education and the Legislature has not funded early education.”\n\nData, Wiggins said, has shown the program is of high quality.\n\n“As long as those parameters and the quality remains, I’m all for putting it into the formula. But I don’t want to sacrifice the quality and the framework just to say, ‘we’re putting it in the formula.’ If by putting it in the formula school districts are going to focus on early education, then I’m all for it.”\n\nAccountability\n\nBoth Tollison and Moore said they do not expect a major bill tied to accountability to emerge during the session. Moore said he would like the Mississippi Department of Education to provide a debriefing on reform efforts such as The Mississippi Literacy Based Promotion Act.\n\nKnown as the \"third-grade gate,\" the law requires third-graders to read at least on basic grade level before being promoted to fourth grade. Statewide, 87 percent of third-graders achieved a passing score on the Third-grade Reading Summative Assessment, which tests students on reading comprehension and proficiency. Last year a bill that would allow MDE to raise the required reading test scores for school year 2018-19 above the basic grade-level died in the Senate education committee. Next year according to a MDE spokesperson, students will have to score above the lowest two achievement levels.\n\nFor its part, the state Board of Education has not been shy to express to the Legislature that funds are needed to strengthen improvement efforts.\n\nNineteen school districts in Mississippi were rated as failing by MDE for the 2016 school year. Districts and schools that make a consecutive F this year could be considered for absorption into the new Mississippi Achievement School District, and the state Board of Education has asked for $250,000 to develop a model for the district.\n\n“The current conservator model does not adequately address improving academic performance,” the board said of its legislative priorities.\n\nAn examination of qualifications for becoming a superintendent or school board member is also possible, according to legislative education committee leaders.\n\nSchool consolidation\n\nIn the past session, the Legislature continued its trend of consolidating Mississippi’s 144 school districts, sending Bryant four bills that merged eight of the state’s districts into four.\n\nTollison told The Clarion-Ledger one of the objectives of administrative consolidation is equity.\n\n“Political lines that were drawn 50 years ago are not conducive to local tax base,” he said. Tollison gave the example of Holmes County, which he said draws a revenue of $100 million compared to nearby Durant's $9.5 million.\n\nHolmes and Durant were two of the districts lawmakers approved for consolidation.\n\n“When that consolidation is complete, the students in Durant will have access that they otherwise wouldn’t have,” Tollison said.\n\nHe expects his committee to hone in on districts with similar situations that impact academic performance and areas with “a declining tax base that would be stretched to provide education.”\n\nPrecedent suggests new pitches for mergers may not be welcome.\n\nDuring the summer an advisory council tasked with making recommendations to the Legislature for consolidating three school districts in Chickasaw County failed to reach an agreement.\n\nSchool choice\n\nAlthough the landmark Mississippi Charter Schools Act of 2013 permits up to 15 charters to be established per year, fewer than three operate in the state (a high school is slated to open next fall). With both ReImagine Prep and Midtown Public Charter School underperforming on the state's student assessment, the state's authorizer board has made it clear it will not rubber stamp new charters, leading one member to question whether they were deterring prospective operators.\n\nGrant Callen of Empower Mississippi, which advocates school choice, applauded the action and says his organization remains focused on expanding options for students \"trapped\" in failing schools or districts.\n\nAlthough an open enrollment bill introduced by Moore last year — a bill that would have allowed students from D and F districts to attend A and B schools — failed to make it out of committee, Bryant's signage of a law permitting students from D and F districts to attend charter schools was seen as a win for the school choice crowd.\n\nThis session Callen said he hopes the Legislature will consider increased funding for Educational Scholarship Accounts. The program provides awards of up to $6,637 to parents of exceptional needs children to help defray the costs of alternatives to public school.\n\nThe accounts have seen some push-back with stakeholders pointing out the law does not help strengthen resources in public schools.\n\nLoome is among those who have expressed concerns that the program fails to provide a long-term solution, noting private schools have the option of selecting who is admitted.\n\nAlthough funding for ESA has remained level ($3 million in Fiscal Year 2017), the demand for scholarships outweighs resources. In his executive budget recommendation, Bryant noted 425 students are enrolled in the program while 130 remain on the waiting list. The law allows for up to 1,500 spots for the 2017-18 school year.\n\nContact Bracey Harris at bharris2@gannett.com or 601-961-7248.

Fix it.\n\nWithin a year, Kentucky lawmakers responded with a watershed piece of legislation: The Kentucky Education Reform Act.\n\nSigned on April 11, 1990 — 30 years ago today — the bill, known as KERA, overhauled how the Bluegrass State funded schools and instituted measures to prevent political corruption.\n\nSchools would also be judged on the performance of all students, being held to what some consider the nation's first school accountability model.\n\n\"You see Kentucky's 1990 story as one of success, where we increase student outcomes across the board for all students,\" said Brigitte Blom Ramsey, who runs Prichard Committee, a nonpartisan education advocacy group. \"We started climbing the rankings in (national tests). And we were, I think, in the top five in the nation making improvement.\"\n\nBut myriad changes and challenges over the three decades that followed eroded Kentucky's signature education legislation, leaving the state's school system at a tipping point.\n\nThe legislation's signature tenets — equitable funding, a school accountability system, school-based councils, depoliticized overseers — are either underfunded, routinely tweaked or otherwise threatened.\n\nAnd as the coronavirus weighs upon Kentucky households and the economy, it is unclear how much change Kentucky can afford in the coming years.\n\nAfter some initial gains from KERA, Kentucky has plateaued.\n\n\"It really worked,\" said Cindy Heine, a retired associate director of the Prichard Committee. \"It has worked. It is no longer working.\"\n\nRich district, poor district\n\nIn the mid-1980s, inequities in Kentucky's education system were clear.\n\nRural school districts often had less money than their wealthier peers, meaning fewer resources and opportunities for their students.\n\nKentucky clung to the bottom rung of most national rankings: last in high school graduations, one of the highest poverty rates, third from last in education funding.\n\nA Lexington Herald Leader article from the time said Kentucky was \"cheating our children.\"\n\nSo, a group of dozens of districts, school boards and public school students, mainly from rural, cash-strapped districts, sued, arguing Kentucky's system was a failure.\n\nThe case ended up in front of the state Supreme Court, which agreed Kentucky's K-12 school system was inequitable and inadequate. The 1989 Rose v. Council for Better Education decision threw out existing laws and sparked an overhaul.\n\n“The children of the poor and the children of the rich, the children who live in the poor districts and the children who live in the rich districts must be given the same opportunity and access to an adequate education,\" the ruling said.\n\nLawmakers, tasked with building a new education system, responded a year later with KERA.\n\nThe landmark legislation created a school accountability system, where educators would be held accountable for the performance of their students. While common now, Heine believes Kentucky's model was one of the first accountability systems in the country.\n\nKERA required state lawmakers to fund schools differently. The SEEK — Support Education Excellence in Kentucky — model guaranteed districts a minimum amount of money for each student. It combined local and state dollars, with poorer districts getting more from the state and paying less in taxes locally.\n\nAnd it tried to take the politics out of education by changing how the state education chief was selected, tweaking local hiring practices and introducing a council at each school to include parent and teacher input.\n\n​​​\"Without a doubt, KERA worked,\" Blom Ramsey, the Prichard leader and a former state education board member, said.\n\n'With every dime that we have'\n\nDespite its successes, some of KERA's elements disintegrated quickly.\n\nA primary program that kept kids in a gradeless classroom until they were ready for the fourth grade fell by the wayside as educators and parents grew frustrated with the out-of-the-box approach. \"Performance events\" in which students solved problems in small groups also dissipated.\n\nOther aspects eroded over time.\n\nMost troubling for some districts, the funding gap KERA sought to fix is nearing what it was before the 1990 legislation. This comes after years of flat or under-funding from the state, or local school boards not raising taxes.\n\n“(SEEK) was meant as an equalizer,\" Traysea Moresea, the superintendent of Greenup County Schools, said. \"And it has lost that for rural schools.”\n\nPowell County rests on the line between Central and Eastern Kentucky. Its population is dwindling, so it is losing per student funding while its fixed costs are not dropping.\n\nProperty values are growing thanks to the local tourism industry, meaning its local tax base is growing. But in the SEEK formula, that means they get less money from the state.\n\n\"We're taking a double whammy,\" said Anthony Orr, the Powell County superintendent.\n\nMore:How is JCPS handling grades during distance learning? Here's what to know\n\nLike many rural Kentucky districts, transportation is tricky. \"Really challenging roadways,\" prone to flooding, mixed with mountains lead to higher maintenance costs, Orr said.\n\nWith kids scattered throughout the county, some bus routes stretch over an hour. Kentucky only partially funds school transportation — around 60% — which disproportionately hurts smaller districts, which don't have the local funds to make up the difference but desperately need more buses and maintenance.\n\n“If they would just fund transportation 100%, we could offer so much more to our students,\" Moresea said. \"And that would be an equalizer for us.”\n\nWith that money, Moresea would be able to get more buses and shorten trips.\n\n“We are reallocating to the best of our possibilities,\" Moresea said. They're working to stay competitive with neighboring districts and private schools, \"but we're doing it with every dime we have.\"\n\nOften, public districts need to go beyond the classroom to help with kids' basic needs, such as food and mental health services.\n\nAnd in an area hit by the opioid epidemic, kids are coming to them with more need than ever before, Moresea said.\n\n“We are the first and sometimes only caretakers for children,\" Moresea said.\n\nEven the district's youngest learners face lengthy bus rides, sometimes ending with a bus driver needing to wake them up when they get home. And sometimes that home doesn't have water, she said.\n\n“We're their only saving grace,\" Moresea said of some of her students.\n\nMore funding would help close gaps in achievement, too, the district leaders say.\n\nThere's \"no question\" that state-funded preschool and full-day kindergarten would help Powell County's youngest learners, Orr said. It would level the playing field for the impoverished student body, he said.\n\nA new normal:How JCPS students, teachers and parents grappled with distance learning\n\nAnd it would free up local money to cover instructional coaches to help his educators improve their teaching skills, he said, helping older students.\n\nOr freed-up money could go to facilities. Aging HVAC systems are a \"drain\" on Powell County's maintenance budget.\n\n“You can’t expect kids to learn if they’re sitting in coats, shivering,\" Orr said.\n\nUltimately, Kentucky needs new revenue, and that needs to come from the state level, Orr said. Several school boards have already taxed out.\n\n“It’s tight all the way around,\" Orr said.\n\n\"Listen with an open mind to what educators are asking for,\" Moresea said. Teachers are not asking to be the richest people, but for \"resources to help kids.\"\n\nA gradual erosion\n\nHow Kentucky grades its students' performance and identifies struggling schools has seen multiple iterations since the accountability model's inception.\n\nKentucky used different accountability models over the years: CATS, Unbridled Learning, K-PREP. Tweaks are made so often that educators joke that the only certain thing is that their target will move.\n\nBefore starting as superintendent last year, Moresea led Greenup County's assessment and curriculum team.\n\nTo have a true measure of results, Kentucky needs a consistent measurement, Moresea said. Putting more focus into teaching, rather than tests, \"would go a long way.\"\n\n“I've really quit talking about aiming for K-PREP scores,\" Orr, in Powell County, said. He's focusing on simply teaching kids.\n\nIt is \"very, very difficult\" to get an accountability system, Heine said. Should it be broad or focus in on reading and math?\n\nInitially, KERA's accountability focus was broad. Over time, through tweaks and changes, it has become narrow. Students are still tested in social studies and science, but the focus often lands on reading and math.\n\nA bill again tweaking how Kentucky grades and identifies schools for support cleared multiple hurdles in the state legislature before halting when lawmakers cut days out of the session.\n\nLocal school boards were notoriously corrupt around the time of KERA, sparking the creation of school-level councils that would control how individual schools spent their money and what curriculum they used.\n\nThose councils are \"largely intact,\" Blom Ramsey said. But legislation pops up annually to tinker with the groups, often asking to take away their power to hire a school's principal or to change the makeup of the group.\n\nLike the school accountability bill, a bill moving the councils' hiring authority is withering because of a shortened legislative session.\n\nState-level overseers are on shaky ground, too.\n\nTo reduce politics in education, KERA moved away from electing an education chief. Instead, a governor-appointed board would hire the commissioner. The board's terms would be staggered, so a governor would have a board fully appointed by themselves only toward the end of their term.\n\nMore:What JCPS parents need to know about special education during coronavirus closures\n\nThat has been threatened in recent years, with the last two commissioners resigning under pressure days after a new education board has been appointed.\n\nHours after former Gov. Matt Bevin appointed new people to the board to fill expired terms, the now fully Bevin-appointed board called for a special meeting to discuss their sole employee: The commissioner.\n\nA day later, former commissioner Stephen Pruitt resigned under fire.\n\nOver a year later, specifically citing ideological differences with Bevin's appointees, Gov. Andy Beshear abolished and recreated the education board, filling it with his own picks. The new members soon after accepted former commissioner Wayne Lewis' resignation.\n\nThe board Beshear ousted quickly sued, arguing in part that KERA intended for the board to be nonpartisan and free from politics.\n\nLegislation preventing similar reorganizations and requiring a politically diverse board is all but dead as lawmakers head into their last week of the session.\n\nBut legislators need to confirm Beshear's newest board members — which the Republican-led Senate doesn't seem poised to do because the board is all Democrats — before adjourning. If they don't, Beshear will need to appoint a new board during lengthy school closures caused by a pandemic.\n\nAmid a worsening coronavirus outbreak, shuttered schools and fears of a recession, it is unclear what Kentucky will face next and how it would fund it.\n\n\"In past economic recessions, Kentuckians with the least education were the ones most negatively impacted, and as a result, our economic growth has lagged the nation,\" Blom Ramsey said in a recent press release.\n\nBut one thing is clear: If Kentucky doesn't change its approach to education, it may slide further, Blom Ramsey said.\n\n\"Nobody is standing still,\" Blom Ramsey said. \"We've been standing still for a while, not making additional improvements. And all the while, other states are starting to pass us by. And we're falling behind.\n\n\"There should be a great sense of urgency to continue to improve if Kentucky wants to maintain its place as a national leader in education and one that has realized success even as a very poor state.\"\n\nReach Olivia Krauth at okrauth@courierjournal.com or 502-582-4471, and on Twitter at @oliviakrauth.

If the measure passes, with the exception of a few weeks early in the school year, the district will move to a Tuesday-Friday class schedule.\n\n\"I believe that we will have a competitive advantage by recruiting and retaining staff that value time over money and lifestyle,\" said Joel Pedersen, superintendent of the district of nearly 1,000 students that spans the southeast Iowa counties of Davis, Jefferson, Van Buren and Wapello.\n\nThe Cardinal district would join a few other rural school districts in Iowa that have moved to four-day weeks, including WACO in Wayland, Mormon Trail in Humeston and Moulton-Udell. All have cited a desire to attract students and teachers.\n\nAccording to Tim Bartels, principal of WACO Junior and Senior High School, his district's move to Monday-Thursday school weeks in 2013 has helped him recruit teachers.\n\n\"While bigger schools might be able to pay more, time is a non-renewable resource. And I tell every single person we interview, 'I cannot give you a what they give you in pay, but I can give you something they can't.' And that's time,\" he said. \"Time with family. Time with friends. Time off to go do stuff. Throughout COVID, we learned that (time) was very valuable.\"\n\nMore in education:Kim Reynolds reworked her private school scholarship bill to win rural lawmakers. Will it be enough?\n\nWithin the past four years, Bartels said he has been contacted by approximately 20 school districts curious about the logistics and benefits of four-day school weeks, including the Cardinal Community School District.\n\nCardinal's proposed changes would include a few five-day school weeks on the 2022-2023 calendar through October. Then, a combination of professional development days, parent-teacher conferences, holiday and vacation days, combined with designated \"no-school\" days on the schedule, would shorten the school weeks for the rest of the academic year.\n\nThe proposal would also extend school days by 20-25 minutes, with the classes at the elementary school starting at 8 a.m. and ending at 3:40 p.m.. The middle and high school would begin classes at 8 a.m. and dismiss students at 3:47 p.m.\n\nUnder state law, Iowa school districts and accredited nonpublic schools are required to provide either 180 days or 1,080 hours of instruction to students. The proposed 2022-2023 schedule for Cardinal would consist of only 150 school days, but provide a total of 1,095 hours of learning.\n\nThe district believes switching to a four-day week will have multiple benefits, including helping retain staff, attracting teachers to the district, allowing staff more time to prepare for classes and work on professional development, boosting teacher and student morale, and a reduction of student and staff absences.\n\nAdditional benefits for the district could include cost savings on fuel and substitute teachers.\n\nTo ensure that hourly employees will not see a reduction in wages, Pedersen said the district will adjust its hourly rates to make up for the difference.\n\nThe plan appears to have strong support among district staff, with 95% in favor of the proposed schedule in a recent survey, according to Pedersen.\n\nMore in education:Kim Reynolds wanted more charter schools in Iowa. But only two groups have applied to open them.\n\nDay care, school lunches are concerns about a shorter school week\n\nThe Cardinal Community School District's proposal carries some uncertainties and concerns.\n\nThe district's preschool program already operates on a Tuesday-Friday schedule. It is unclear whether the district will provide day-care services on Mondays, if the four-day schedule is adopted. Pedersen said the district intends to survey parents before reaching a decision on making day care available on Mondays.\n\nProviding breakfast and lunch to students during Mondays with no class is another concern. According to data from the Iowa Department of Education, in 2021, 55% of students in the Cardinal district qualified for free or reduced lunch.\n\nPedersen said the district is working with local partners to open food pantries in all of its schools to help with those experiencing food insecurities.\n\n\"This is a community need, not just a school need,\" he said.\n\nAnother area of concern is whether more students will engage in criminal activity as a result of time away from school and lack of parental supervision on Mondays. Pedersen does not believe this will be a significant issue.\n\n\"We have two Mondays off already, and we have not seen an uptick in this area,\" he said.\n\nMore in education:Iowa Republicans boost school funding by 2.5%, Democrats say it isn't enough\n\nFour-day school weeks growing in popularity in other states, like Colorado\n\nFour-day school weeks are hardly a novel concept.\n\nA recent Brookings Institute report notes that, during the springtime prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 662 school districts were on four-day school weeks across 24 states, an increase of more than 600% since 1999.\n\nSince the pandemic, more than 1,600 school districts are estimated to have switched to four-day weeks.\n\nColorado leads the way, with 114 of the state's 178 school districts, or 64%, on four-day schedules.\n\nA June overview on schools utilizing four-day weeks published by the Colorado Department of Education said those districts \"tend to be rural and sparsely populated,\" requiring some students to travel longer distances to get to class or athletic events.\n\nFour-day weeks are also present in an estimated 40% of school districts in New Mexico and Oregon.\n\nBartels said the WACO district's move to a four-day week was initiated by a group of teachers brainstorming ways to meet the learning needs of students.\n\nThose teachers began researching classroom instruction, school-day structures and other learning environments, concluding that a better path forward should include class periods where teachers could use every single instructional minute.\n\nBartels said this calculation and move to four-day week led to the elimination of study halls, plus slightly longer school days that include seven class periods.\n\nLonger class times have allowed teachers to squeeze in more lectures and practice time with students, Bartels said, with the result of a decrease in homework for many students.\n\n\"We didn't need the study halls, because with a study hall, a student sits there by themselves and they don't have a teacher,\" Bartels said. \"I don't send a kid to basketball practice without a coach. So we don't send a kid off with homework without them knowing how to do that schoolwork independently, or, if they don't, that teacher is in the room with them the whole time.\"\n\nMore in education:These two Iowa educators just earned a national award for teaching science and math\n\nBartels added that four-day weeks have had no apparent impact on student test scores or the district's culture.\n\nBartels did concede that on the few Fridays during the beginning of the school year when classes are being held and students have to show up \"it is like pulling them in on a Saturday.\"\n\nBut Bartels said attendance numbers have been generally good and students seem willing to put in the hard work necessary to earn an extra day off.\n\n\"They know that they don't have to come in on Fridays, and that's been a big boost,\" he said.\n\n'Teacher is biggest predictor of student success': Why superintendent thinks he can gain a competitive edge\n\nFor Pedersen, if a four-day school week can help the district keep and attract teaching staff, that sense of consistency and collaboration between teachers and students is the most attractive tradeoff of the proposal, regardless of studies that warn of the possible downsides of lost instructional time.\n\n\"I have seen studies that show many different results for the four-day week,\" he said. \"I would counter that the research is clear that the teacher is the biggest predictor of student success over any school factor.\"\n\nAdvocating for the schedule change, the district's website asserts that lower teacher retention percentages \"have been shown to greatly impact the scholastic performance of students\" and that \"studies have shown that students who are subject to higher teacher turnover suffer in terms of achievement gains.\"\n\n\"We certainly will watch our test scores, but to me this is bigger than standardized test scores,\" Pedersen said. \"I want a quality teacher in front of every student consistently in grades Pre-K through 12. If we can achieve that, I'm convinced that the scores will be fine.\"\n\nMore in education:Iowa won't require schools to put live cameras in classrooms after Republican bill dies\n\nThe Cardinal Community School District is currently seeking to fill five positions, including a principal opening at the high school.\n\nPedersen said the district has dealt with increasing hiring challenges within the past five years, particularly in areas like science, math, special education and foreign languages.\n\n\"Even elementary positions that we had 100 applicants 10 years ago, now will have under 10 applicants,\" Pedersen said.\n\nPedersen said the district's salary schedule is improving but he realizes he is unable to compete with larger schools or against the amenities bigger cities can provide.\n\n\"We have to think differently, and there has been possible applicants inquiring about the four-day schedule,\" he said.\n\n'Many are just quitting': Teacher shortage is problem across Iowa\n\nBig or small, districts across the state have struggled this academic year with staffing shortages.\n\nAccording to the Iowa Department of Education website Teach Iowa, there are currently more than 4,500 openings at schools across the state.\n\nPedersen said the COVID-19 pandemic has taken an additional toll.\n\n\"The pandemic has been so stressful for teachers,\" he said. \"The concern over safety and teachers trying to teach online and in-person has worn them out. Many are retiring early and many are just quitting.\"\n\nThe difficulty finding teachers is compounded by the fact that fewer college students are choosing that profession.\n\nDuring the 2018-2019 academic year, data from the Department of Education shows a 20% drop in the number of people going to college in Iowa to study education during the previous decade, plus a 22% drop in the number of Iowa students completing those degrees.\n\n\"We are experiencing an exponential problem, to use a math term,\" Pedersen said. \"This is going to take bold initiatives from our legislators to stop.\"\n\nMore in education:Norwalk district taps high school students to help fill paraeducator staffing shortage\n\nPedersen suggested that state lawmakers are also contributing to the teacher shortage, by not properly funding public schools.\n\n\"While we appreciate 2.5% state supplemental aid, inflation is at 7% and we will settle at close to 3% due to collective bargaining laws,\" Pedersen said. \"The state has the largest surpluses ever, we hoped this would be a year to receive at least 4%. A decade of funding below 4% except for one year compounds the problems with paying teachers more.\n\n\"When many employers are paying more than a starting teacher salary in many schools, that is going to cause challenges for hiring the best and the brightest and keeping them in education.\"\n\nStill, Pedersen said he is motivated by the challenge of finding educators willing to teach in his smaller, more rural district.\n\n\"The data is clear that rural schools receive less applicants than our urban counterparts,\" Pedersen said.\n\n\"I don’t begrudge any of my urban colleagues for this current situation. We can either mindlessly complain or look for solutions by innovating. As the leader of Cardinal CSD, I choose to be solution-oriented.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/virginia/2017/10/18/northampton-virginia-schools-forum/757548001/", "title": "School supporters brainstorm ways to boost education in Northampton", "text": "More than 70 Northampton County leaders who want to see the county's public schools succeed came together Tuesday at the Northampton County Education Foundation's first annual State of the Schools community forum.\n\nThe group included businesspeople, clergy, elected officials, parents, media representatives and school employees, among others.\n\nAs the morning progressed, the Northampton High School gymnasium wall filled rapidly with colorful stickers enumerating results of eight simultaneous roundtable discussions about the schools' successes and challenges, as well as initiatives the groups thought should be considered.\n\nWayne Bell and Jeff Holland facilitated the session.\n\nResults are being compiled and a report will be sent to all participants.\n\n\"This isn't a one and done,\" said Holland, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.\n\n\"Today is a positive day,\" he said.\n\nThe day started with a continental breakfast served by students in the high school's hospitality and tourism program and musical selections performed by the high school chorus. That was followed by a speech by School Superintendent Eddie Lawrence, who listed dozens of achievements accomplished by students and staff at the county's two elementary schools, one middle school and one high school.\n\nLawrence spoke at length about each school's accomplishments, including academic improvements, athletic achievements and state and regional awards won by students and staff.\n\nHe noted that Occohannock Elementary School, after remaining for a decade in some kind of school improvement plan, is now fully accredited.\n\nOne challenge the eight roundtable groups agreed is important to address is finding better ways to get the word out to the public about those accomplishments.\n\nAnother is funding — with less money coming from the state due to a decline in student population along with what some say is a flawed state funding formula.\n\nLawrence acknowledged the state of the schools \"is a little bit of a mixed bag of results,\" adding, \"but, of course, any organization is.\"\n\nThe district over the past 14 years lost about 500 students, resulting in an increasing challenge for schools to continue to offer a full spectrum of educational programs.\n\n\"When your population shrinks, your state assistance and your funding shrinks,\" Lawrence said.\n\nRELATED: Hope finally fulfilled: Eastern Shore Community College marks construction project\n\nHowever, the district last year had an unexpected boost in numbers, going from 1,505 to 1,570 students.\n\n\"While that is very encouraging and promising, I'm not yet ready to call that a trend,\" Lawrence said.\n\nNorthampton County is among the poorest localities in Virginia, but it has relatively high land values, making for another major challenge to the school district — a state funding formula some say leaves the county bearing an unfair burden.\n\nThe local composite index — a measurement of the locality's ability to pay — for Northampton is 0.49. That means for every dollar the state contributes for education, the county is expected to contribute nearly the same amount.\n\n\"It has us with a greater ability to pay than Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Newport News and Accomack County,\" Lawrence said.\n\nStill, Northampton County actually pays more than the state requires. The school board budget this year totals $20.6 million, and the county is footing $8.6 million of that — about $2 million more than the state requires.\n\n\"So we have, I think, a very supportive Board of Supervisors,\" Lawrence said.\n\nNorthampton County Board of Supervisors Chairman Spencer Murray during the roundtable discussion said it is the board's job \"to just give every penny we can to the elected school board and to the administration to run the program,\" adding that bringing economic development into the county is key.\n\n\"We fuel the whole economy with jobs, and the more money that we have coming into our communities, the more money that we'll be able to give to schools,\" Murray said.\n\n\"Funding runs across all these issues we're talking about,\" he said.\n\nAnother major challenge participants identified was teacher recruitment and retention.\n\nLawrence noted teacher salary in the county is the lowest in the region, making it difficult to attract and retain teachers.\n\nREAD MORE: Va. Shore's past and present on display at exhibit\n\nNevertheless, the district wants to find ways to increase its academic and career and technical programs, including in the areas of cybersecurity and agriculture, he said.\n\nLawrence and roundtable participants agreed that partnerships, in particular with Eastern Shore Community College, are key to doing more with the available resources.\n\nDual enrollment courses and the possibility of a welding program to be offered in partnership with the college will enhance the school district's offerings, he said.\n\n\"We hope to expand our partnership in the upcoming years,\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"We have lots of things we need to work on ... I'm really excited about the direction that Northampton County schools are going in, but we do have lots of obstacles to overcome,\" he said.\n\nThe foundation's mission is to engage the community and mobilize resources to promote student performance and excellence in teaching in Northampton County Public Schools.\n\nIn addition to organizing Tuesday's forum, the foundation last year raised more than $11,500 for the schools. The money went toward classroom grants, a teacher recognition banquet, $25 gift cards given to new teachers and $1,500 in student scholarships.\n\nGrants from the foundation supported school activities ranging from the high school play to participation in a robotics competition; a student athlete tutoring program; pre-K summer camps to improve school readiness at Occohannock Elementary School and Kiptopeke Elementary School; and the Reflections writing and art contest at the middle and high schools, among other initiatives.\n\nREAD MORE: For rocket launch project, NASA, Snow Hill Middle students join forces\n\nOn Twitter @cvvaughnESN\n\n443-260-3314", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2023/10/23/vote-yes-columbus-city-schools-levy-issue-11-ohio-election/71119419007/", "title": "School levy is necessary for Columbus students – if voters can wrap ...", "text": "Dispatch Editorial Board\n\nColumbus Dispatch\n\nIt has been long believed Columbus Board of Education was on a different page than many in the community.\n\nIn the past months — way before the district's 7.7-mill permanent levy was placed on the Nov. 7 ballot — it has become apparent the district and the people are not reading the same book.\n\nThere may never be a good time to ask voters for nearly $100 million more annually in property taxes. But the school board's strained relationship with the community, the district's poor academic performance and Columbus' high cost of living make this a decidedly a bad one.\n\nIf the school levy is approved, property owners will shell out about $180 more per $100,000 of property valuation when the taxes are first collected in 2024.\n\nMany residents — seniors in particular — are already pinned against the wall by economic forces beyond their control as taxes and home values increase in a city battling an affordable housing crisis.\n\nBut if the levy is rejected, Columbus' kids — many of whom are still struggling with the dire social, emotional and intellectual impacts of the pandemic — will continue to pay a heavy price.\n\nMore:Culture-war issues take center stage in many central Ohio school board races\n\nIt's a complex predicament.\n\nWith Issue 11, Columbus voters are being asked to wager if school officials are playing typical gloom-and-doom politics to get what they want against potentially rejecting the levy, thusly exacerbating the real challenges Columbus City Schools children face.\n\nThe district's leaders — current and former — have made this bed, but nobody wants to see our kids lay in it.\n\nSchool board acknowledges missteps\n\nAs inadvertently as it may have been, the board — which will oversee a $1.6 billion budget in 2024 — has given voters reason to be skeptical of its word.\n\nPresident Jennifer Adair acknowledges mistakes were made in relaying information to the community about the district's needs and the levy.\n\n\"That's on us. That's on the board. That's on me,\" she said. \"As the president, I accept responsibility and accountability for that. The only way forward is to say, 'let's all go forward'.\"\n\nAdair said the board wants the public's feedback and would work to repair relationships that began to deteriorate decades before she and the current board took office beginning in 2019.\n\nThe vote \"yes\" school levy campaign got a slow start and information about why it is needed has not been conveyed well beyond meetings and the district's website, Adair said.\n\nGarnering support for the levy has been challenging.\n\nWhy has the Columbus school levy been a hard sell?\n\nThe high cost of the levy as property values increase to record levels is among the complaints.\n\n\"You will not balance the CCS budget on the backs of this community, especially on senior citizens,\" Columbus NAACP President Nana Watson, a vocal opponent of the school levy, recently told a Dispatch reporter.\n\nThe Franklin County Auditor's Office has for months told residents the county's average property values would increase by 41%. Property taxes won't increase that much from the reappraisal, but the levy complicates legitimate cost concerns.\n\nResidents are navigating the reappraisals and potential impact on their bottom lines. Renters worry landlords will ask for more money if the levy passes.\n\nAdd to that the fact that many voters do not believe they are getting a good return on their financial investment and the reasons for the disconnect are clear.\n\nMore:Shame on Columbus school board for asking for more money, showing faces| Letters\n\nMore:School reports cards were released by the state Thursday. Columbus City Schools got worse.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Education's annual report cards released in September revealed that Columbus schools showed no improvement in some categories and declined in others.\n\nSchool board transparency and its strained relationship with stakeholders have been raised multiple times by those who have rejected the levy or otherwise refused to endorse it.\n\nLast month, a coalition of Black religious leaders that includes The Baptist Ministerial Alliance of Columbus and Vicinity, The Baptist Pastor's Conference of Columbus and Vicinity and the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Columbus and Vicinity, announced that it would not support the levy.\n\nThe 500-member Columbus Chapter of the NAACP is actively campaigning against the levy, positioning vote \"no\" signs throughout the community.\n\nEquity Now Coalition board members recently declined to endorse the levy. Known as the ENC, the group's membership includes 75 Black leaders. The board recommendation included that the levy be taken off of the ballot, there be public review of efforts to reduce costs, and that Adair be replaced with a new school board president.\n\nIt is telling and nearly unheard of that a majority Black urban school district would receive public levy push back from so many Black-lead organizations.\n\nColumbus shouldn't be having this fight\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court ruled the state's method of funding schools unconstitutional more than 26 years ago.\n\nIt is dead wrong, unsustainable and illogical that so much of the burden for paying for schools is still being placed on the backs of taxpayers, seniors in particular.\n\nColumbus' new Superintendent Angela Chapman, who helps her father navigate his finances, agreed with that premise at least in part.\n\n\"It is incumbent upon us as citizens — taxpayers in the city — to put pressure on our legislators to work on a legislative fix,\" she told members of our editorial board during a meeting that also included Adair, Columbus Education Association President John Coneglio and Jennifer Vanover, the district's interim treasurer.\n\nDistrict leaders say the financial challenges did not hit them by surprise, and there were efforts to right the district's ship long before the levy was placed on the ballot.\n\nVanover told our board that about $16 million in non-personnel related spending were cut from the budget in January. The district had intended to cut $30 million.\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nSchool heating and cooling issues and other unacceptable issues were thrust into the limelight as a result of attention drawn to the district by the teachers' union 2022 strike.\n\nMice droppings, roaches, leaks, and other substandard conditions were found by Columbus Public Health last year, according to records obtained by the Dispatch.\n\nSome progress has been made.\n\nAll but one school now has air conditioning. Mifflin Middle School's HVAC system is still under construction and set to be complete by next summer.\n\nIf the 7.7-mill levy is approved, $38.6 million would be used for operations and $60.5 million would be used to maintain the district's 113 school buildings.\n\nIf the levy fails, officials warn schools, fields and other facilities will continue to deteriorate, implanting the message in students that they deserve to learn in inadequate environments.\n\nIf the levy fails, the district would stop a plan to expand pre-K. Conflict training and other programs for the most vulnerable students will be cut. The district will not be able to repair or replace critical equipment such as student computers and employees will lose their jobs.\n\nThis includes the nearly 650 counselors, interpreters, social workers, substitute teachers, custodians, security guards and other employees hired with Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds the district received from the federal government in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEven if the levy is approved, 353 of those positions will end when the last of the $287.6 million ESSER fund — about $121 million — is used up by September 2024.\n\nThere is little doubt that students — particularly those who fell behind during the pandemic — will suffer if counselors are cut from schools.\n\nTo drive this point home, Chapman relayed the story of a distraught student who tried to throw himself off a second-story balcony.\n\n\"The social, emotional supports to me are non-negotiable. Think about the needs of our students,\" she said. \"Our students are experiencing a tremendous amount of trauma in the community.\"\n\nThe Columbus way\n\nThe pandemic caused major setbacks for Columbus City Schools, but Chapman and her team are on the ground working to turn things around. They deserve a chance.\n\nVoters will ultimately decide if Chapman's strategy is worth more of their investment or if the school board must build community trust and return to the drawing board to come up with a solution that is more palatable to voters.\n\nRegardless of Issue 11's outcome, there's an immediate need for more community involvement in Columbus City Schools.\n\nState lawmakers should work to reduce the tax burden on property owners, but there are things that can be done at the community level to improve Columbus City Schools.\n\nSchool officials hope to establish a foundation that can help raise funds to mitigate the impact on school districts residents.\n\nThe business community must more deeply embrace the Columbus Way — a concept of public-private partnerships — when it comes to Columbus City Schools.\n\nEqually as important, the public should hold the school board to Adair's promise to build relationships with partners from social services, business, community and governmental agencies — the ENC, NAACP and religious organizations included.\n\nThe hurdles are high, but it is worth the fight.\n\nThe future of Columbus depends on it.\n\nThis piece was written by the Dispatch Opinion Editor Amelia Robinson on behalf of The Dispatch Editorial Board.

It’s for our kids and our county’s future.\n\nAs a parent, I don't think I truly appreciated the value of our teachers until I had to attempt to teach my son during the pandemic. Their ability to instruct, coach, and equip our kids with the knowledge and skills they need is remarkable. I don’t know how they do all of it, but I’m grateful. And we all should be.\n\nThat's why I have pushed to raise teacher pay supplements to the top in the state — because we need the best teachers in our schools to engage, support and teach our kids.\n\nWe always hear politicians talk about how they value education, but what substantive changes do we usually see from this? With this budget and these efforts, my fellow Commissioners and I are actually taking action and insisting that our county be top in the state in teacher pay and that our schools have the funding they need to provide the best education possible. We’re not just talking about it, we are taking the steps to ensure education in our community is prioritized.\n\nOur FY 21-22 budget will have an increased investment in schools – about an 8.3% increase over the current year adopted funding – for a total of $121.5 million across all funding categories (current expense, grants, capital and debt service). That’s more than a third of the county’s general fund budget.\n\nIt’s a lot of money, but it’s important, and I believe this increase in funding will make significant improvements in our schools, and attract and retain the best and most diverse teachers to our area. This funding will raise our locally funded teacher supplements from an average of $4,183 a year to an average of $9,000 a year. That will put New Hanover County at the very top in the state for teacher supplements and should be a big incentive to draw more qualified and high achieving teachers into our district. It’s proven that better pay affects performance and attracts more candidates to the profession.\n\nWe are also adding four new Teaching Fellow scholarships, teacher incentives for hard‐to‐staff schools to receive National Board Certification, a reading training program for teachers working in schools with the greatest disparity in student performance, and a Workforce Housing Gap Rental Assistance Program to alleviate the housing cost burden for 12 teachers in hard-to-staff schools.\n\nFor students, we are going to fund three more Pre-K classrooms – for a total of six county-funded Pre-K classes that help set students up for success – academically, socially, and emotionally – as they enter Kindergarten. And we are going to increase the amount we provide per student district-wide (in public and charter schools) by $527 – from $2,907 per student this year to $3,434.\n\nIn addition to these funding allocations, the county will continue supporting our public schools with 43 School Resource Officers and 40 school nurses, and 16 school‐based therapists who provide support for middle and elementary school students in the budget.\n\nThrough funding from the American Rescue Plan, we will also be providing 19 additional mental health counselors, another school health nurse supervisor, school health team leads and extending broadband service to 8,000 households with children who qualify for Medicaid or Food and Nutrition benefits so students and families can have reliable high-speed internet.\n\nSo if you hear anyone say we aren’t doing enough to fund and support our schools, please share these facts with them!\n\nAs a Commissioner, I also want to ensure that we are funding the right things to move our schools and our students forward. So I also want to see our school board and Superintendent Dr. Foust develop a strategic plan with clear measures, priorities and goals. I want to know that our schools have a tangible plan for moving forward and that the funding we provide is helping achieve better education outcomes for our students.\n\nWe must see progress, and I believe this increased investment is going to help us get there. I appreciate the school board and my fellow Commissioners for their collaboration – because we all have the same goal and want the best education for our students.\n\nThe county’s FY 21-22 budget is also going to accomplish a variety of other initiatives that will serve and better our community, like new walking trails and a nature park, affordable housing and infrastructure initiatives, emergency response resources, and much more which I won’t get into here. But I hope you will take a look at the budget and come to our June 7 Board of Commissioners meeting to share thoughts with us during the public hearing.\n\nI’ll leave you with this – the proposed tax rate in this budget is 8 cents less than our current tax rate (from 55.5 cents to 47.5 cents) – but we will be bringing in more revenue under this lower tax rate than before, because of the increased property values through our revaluation (property values reflect the market and are up around 33% on average across the county). This new rate is slightly above revenue neutral, because we have clear priorities and sustainable investments in this budget to make our community better and ensure every resident – every child and adult – has the resources and support they need to thrive.\n\nThat’s what this budget achieves, at a tax rate lower than most other counties our size, and I’m proud of the investments we are making for residents today and for our county’s future.\n\nJulia Olson-Boseman was born and raised in New Hanover County and currently has a son in New Hanover County public school.

Sure, they'd love a championship too, but not every athlete can win one every year. Furthermore, those MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL superstars often have everything they want already. So, instead, they often embrace the season of giving and offer their sports families a look into their lifestyle.\n\nChristmas time for athletes is often an opportunity to see all the benefits of having a world-class athlete as one of your closest friends. They spare no expense to show the people they love how much they appreciate them.\n\nHere are some of the best examples of gift giving in sports this season.\n\nClass act:Shohei Ohtani gifts Ashley Kelly, wife of Dodgers reliever, Porsche in exchange for number\n\nDallas Mavericks G Luka Doncic\n\nLuka Doncic gifted nearly every member of the Mavericks electric bikes from Mercedes.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nLuka loves gifting transportation. Last year, he got Mavericks' players and staff scooters. This year, it's bikes. Certainly, the Mavericks should have no issue showing up to practice on time next season.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers DH/P Shohei Ohtani\n\nHeading into his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, two-time American League MVP, Shohei Ohtani, stole the No. 17 jersey from beloved Dodger Joe Kelly. In order to make it up to Kelly, Ohtani gifted Kelly's wife a brand new Porsche.\n\nAshley Kelly was one of the biggest advocates for bringing Ohtani to the Dodgers. Before Joe Kelly ever admitted he'd be willing to give up his jersey number, Ashley Kelly said her husband would be more than willing to do so. The only problem is that now Ohtani might be obligated to get all of his teammates' wives new Porsches. I'm sure the $700 million man can afford it though.\n\nRams gift Puka Nacua's first TD ball\n\nPuka Nacua is known for catching touchdowns, so you can imagine the Los Angeles Rams' surprise when, on October 1, Nacua threw his first-ever receiving touchdown into the stands in Indianapolis. In the heat of the moment, Nacua tossed the ball away to fans that don't even cheer for his team. Luckily, the Rams admin has some FBI detectives in their midst.\n\nNacua seemed very appreciative of the gift. Scoring your first touchdown in the NFL is always a special accomplishment, and Nacua likely regretted throwing his first one away after the initial excitement wore off.\n\nMahomes gives his linemen golf carts\n\nYou know what they say, take care of your teammates that take care of you. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes made sure his offensive linemen were taken care of.\n\nAny casual golfer knows the best parts of golfing are the hot dog at the turn and driving the cart around. Even if some of Mahomes' linemen don't play golf, being able to get around on such a fun machine is always a great Christmas present.\n\nChristian McCaffrey gets his team new golf clubs\n\nWhat's better than a golf cart? How about a luxury golf bag and fitted clubs...plus a bottle of tequila. Every 49ers' offensive player received each of those items, courtesy of potential MVP Christian McCaffrey.\n\nThese gifts were especially great for quarterback Brock Purdy, who is only making $800,000 this year. In regards to the gifts McCaffrey gave his teammates, Purdy told reporters \"Financially, I wouldn't be able to cover that right now.\"\n\nNFL News:Lions win division for first time in 30 years, claiming franchise's first NFC North title", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/24"}]}
