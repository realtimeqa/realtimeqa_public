The Alabama Department of Corrections indicated in an Aug. 2 court filing that it is waiting to make sure the nitrogen hypoxia system is ready before writing procedures for how it will be used. The prison system did not describe how the system would work or give an estimate on when the state may try to use the new execution method. Death would be caused by forcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, thereby depriving the subject of oxygen. Lawmakers theorized that death by nitrogen hypoxia could be a simpler and more humane execution method. But critics have likened the untested method to human experimentation. No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out an execution, and no state has developed a protocol for its use, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The information of the construction was disclosed in a court filing involving a lawsuit over the presence of spiritual advisers in the death chamber. State lawyers wrote that they did not yet know if a spiritual advisers could safely be present during an execution via nitrogen hypoxia.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has urged residents to get vaccinated as coronavirus cases spike, driven by the delta variant. “There is a safe, free and widely available tool to put COVID-19 in the rearview mirror,” Dunleavy said in a statement Wednesday. “That tool is the vaccine.” At least 385 state residents’ deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Nearly 53% of eligible Alaskans have been fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Dunleavy has previously urged Alaskans to get vaccinated. But the statement issued last week was more urgent because the state’s spike has been tied to the highly contagious delta coronavirus variant, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Hospitalization numbers have been steady over the past week but are considered high for Alaska, a state with a limited health care infrastructure and hospitals that are already close to capacity during the summer.\n\nArizona\n\nEloy: A small, often overlooked shrub could make a big difference in the rubber industry and change the face of farming in Pinal County, the Casa Grande Dispatch reports. For several years, tiremaker Bridgestone has been researching the native desert shrub guayule on a 300-acre farm in Eloy. The company is about to enter the second phase of its research pilot project, doubling acreage dedicated to the shrub and encouraging other growers to plant it as a crop. Guayule, a perennial woody shrub native to the desert regions of the Southwest and northern Mexico, is a rich source of rubber as well as ethanol, non-toxic adhesives and other materials. Bridgestone Operations Manager Dave Dierig, an expert on the plant and its potential, has spent a career studying guayule, and he focused his doctoral studies on the plant and the materials it can produce. “Lots of plants produce rubber,” Dierig said. “Even sunflowers and lettuce have rubber in them, but it’s not a high-quality rubber. Guayule produces a high-quality rubber that has many uses.” Since 2015, Bridgestone has been producing tires made from guayule-derived natural rubber. “The plant can also be used to make an adhesive and a natural termite pesticide,” Dierig said. “What’s left of the plant after extracting the rubber can be used for biofuel.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge reinstated an attorney’s contract with the state Friday after the state canceled it when he criticized a lawmaker’s support for banning gender-confirming treatments for transgender youths. Chief U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. issued the preliminary injunction in Little Rock that restored Casey Copeland’s contract with the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts. Marshall issued the order verbally after hearing arguments between the state and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, which is litigating the case. Copeland emailed his criticism to Republican state Rep. Charlene Fite, who sponsored the ban enacted earlier this year. A federal judge blocked enforcement of the ban before it took effect July 28 after the ACLU challenged it in court. However, the state canceled Copeland’s contract after Fite forwarded Copeland’s message to Administrative Office of the Courts Director Marty Sullivan. In a statement, Copeland said he was relieved at his reinstatement “so I can get back to work protecting the rights, well-being, and opportunities of Arkansas foster children.” Said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas: “State legislators may not like hearing from constituents who are unhappy with their actions, but they can’t use the power of the state to retaliate.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe: A 14-year-old boy has become the youngest person to swim the entire 21.3-mile length of Lake Tahoe and complete the alpine lake’s coveted Triple Crown. James Savage, of Los Banos, California, completed the trip in 12 hours Aug. 1 when he swam from Camp Richardson in South Lake Tahoe, California, to the Hyatt Regency in Incline Village, Nevada. He earlier completed the other two legs of the Lake Tahoe Triple Crown, all 10 miles or longer. Savage and his mother, Jillian, told the Tahoe Daily Tribune the physical training for the swim was a lot easier than the mental endurance it takes to complete such a long-distance swim. His mother said her only concern was that her son would get bored and decide he wanted to quit. But after the first mile, she was convinced he would get the job done. Last August, at age 13, Savage became the youngest to complete the 12-mile “true width swim.” It’s also known as the “Godfather” swim because it starts at the site of a mansion in Homewood, California, that was used in the movie “The Godfather: Part II.” He also swam the 10-mile Vikingsholm route that traverses the southern portion of the mountain lake.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city’s top public safety leader said he is prepared to discipline police officers, sheriff’s deputies and firefighters who don’t follow the mandate that all city employees get vaccinated against COVID-19, The Denver Post reports. A public health order issued by the city health department last week requires all city employees to receive their second vaccine dose by Sept. 15 and provide proof of vaccination. “I am prepared to do what is necessary to hold people in compliance and hold people accountable,” Murphy Robinson, executive director of the city’s Department of Public Safety, told The Denver Post. “That’s my job.” The Denver police officers’ union said in a statement Thursday that it “respects and trusts our members with their own choices on how to maintain their health, the health of their families and the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Denver.” It’s unclear how many of the Denver’s police officers or emergency responders have been vaccinated, as the city does not keep track. However, the Denver Police Protective Association – which represents a majority of the department’s 1,494 officers – conducted its own poll that showed a total of 778 union members responded, and 43% said they had received vaccines. The union issued a statement Thursday night disputing the validity of its own poll.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s cemeteries continue to suffer from neglect and lack of rule enforcement, according to advocates, families and officials. “Many of Connecticut’s oldest and most historic cemeteries are suffering from severe neglect and are in critical, sometimes desperate, need of care and restoration,” state Historian Walter W. Woodward told the Hartford Courant. A fund for neglected cemeteries was created in 2014 by the Legislature and has been paying towns between $2,000 and $3,300 each year to mow grass and repair gravestones and other features like fencing. The money for the fund comes from death certificate fees and has been fully spent each year, Office of Policy and Management spokesperson Chris McClure told the newspaper. A former board member of the Connecticut Cemetery Association and current volunteer trustee for two cemeteries in Brookfield, Jeff Nolan, wants a state commission to oversee cemeteries and to regionalize and professionalize their management. He suggested using geographic information system mapping to attach the precise location of graves to a person’s vital records. He also said record-keeping for money paid by families of the dead to go toward maintenance is shoddy at many of the cemetery associations that run the state’s 5,000 graveyards.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The University of Delaware is now requiring masks in all indoor facilities, regardless of vaccination status, the school announced Friday afternoon. UD cited rising COVID-19 cases nationwide and the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the impetus for the policy. Delaware State University is also requiring masks in indoor settings. Masks will be required in “common spaces, with limited exceptions, inside all campus buildings, including classrooms, hallways, laboratories, residence halls, and offices,” UD said in an announcement. “In dining areas, masks should be worn except when eating or drinking. Masks are not required inside an individual student’s residence hall room or floor community.” UD and Delaware State University had previously announced that all students would be required to get vaccinated to return to campus. Those who haven’t been – a small number that includes those with religious or medical exemptions – are required at UD to be tested for the coronavirus weekly starting Aug. 15. Delaware State University is requiring vaccinated students on campus to be tested once per week and unvaccinated students twice. Wilmington University also announced an indoor mask requirement last week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Summer Restaurant Week has kicked off despite concerns about the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant, WUSA-TV reports. The weeklong event started Monday and lasts through Sunday. However, restaurants like Taqueria del Barrio in Petworth are feeling the effects of the indoor mask mandate, for which bars and restaurants can be fined if they don’t enforce it. Owner Anna Bran said she lost about 20% of reservations almost overnight. “People are scared to come back out and dine indoors,” she said. Bran said the mask mandate, which came as the restaurant was experiencing nearly pre-pandemic customer volume, has forced her to pause plans for reopening her bar next door. Bran is a cancer patient who said she understands and appreciates the need for implementing mask rules but admitted to being in a tricky position with a business running at a deficit. The event has been a normally lucrative time for participating restaurants, but the pandemic has dwindled turnout for some businesses. Local tourism officials said it is important for people to know D.C. is still very much open. “We’ve come so far, and to be honest, the posture of D.C. doesn’t change: We are open, we are open for everyone that’s coming in,” said Theresa Belpulsi, VP of tourism for Destination DC.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: LIV, one of South Beach’s most glamorous nightclubs, is offering free COVID-19 shots outside the venue where high rollers spend up to $20,000 just for a table. The star-studded nightspot, where Super Bowl champs celebrate at parties so legendary they’ve inspired lyrics from Drake and Kanye West, set up pop-up vaccine sites over the weekend at LIV and club Story to entice the young demographic that is rapidly filling up Florida hospitals as the delta variant of the coronavirus rapidly spreads across Florida. The Sunshine State set another record high over the weekend. On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 23,903 new COVID-19 cases for Friday, topping the previous day’s record of 22,783 new cases. LIV and Story were shuttered for roughly a year during the pandemic and reopened in April. “We are excited, we want to stay open, and we know the only way to make that happen is if people get vaccinated, so we want to make it as accessible as possible,” said owner David Grutman, the king of South Beach’s nightlife scene who also owns a restaurant and hotel with Pharrell. He partnered with CDR Health, which has administered more than 2 million vaccines since the outbreak began, to offer free shots outside the clubs over the weekend, with the possibility of extending it for additional weekends.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Some Savannah-area residents are experiencing delays when they call 911. Chatham County Manager Lee Smith said the emergency call center has about 20 vacancies for operators. A full staff is about 100 operators. “It’s a major problem, but we’re not at a crisis yet,” Smith said. People have said when they call, they sometimes get repeated rings. Former City Council member Julian Miller said he made several calls trying to report a person with medical problems along a city street. “It’s kind of a hopeless feeling when you’re waiting on an ambulance,” Miller said. Miller said the first two calls he made went unanswered for a combined 28 rings. Miller then called a police officer he knew to report the problem. He got a returned call from an automated system, and then the phone rang another 12 times. The county has stepped up recruitment and seen some more applicants. New hires are trained for at least nine months. Trainee pay starts at $13.52 an hour. Pay goes up as training is completed. “Sometimes with private industry, we’re not able to compete at the same level. So it is very tough for local governments,” Smith said. The remaining operators are working 12-hour shifts, but Smith said that’s too long for a stressful job. Managers are seeking ways to shorten shifts and reduce nonemergency calls.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Friday selected a Native Hawaiian prosecutor and former high school teacher for an appeals court judge vacancy after he initially appointed a white man who faced criticism over equitable racial and gender representation on the state’s highest courts. The appointment of Sonja McCullen, a deputy Honolulu prosecuting attorney and former Waianae High School teacher, is subject to state Senate confirmation. McCullen was among six nominees for the Intermediate Court of Appeals on a list submitted to Ige by the state Judicial Selection Commission. Ige initially selected Daniel Gluck, the executive director of the Hawaii Ethics Commission, prompting the House Native Hawaiian Caucus to send Ige a letter saying there are “no native Hawaiian, Filipino, Pacific Islander, or African American judges at the Supreme Court or the ICA.” Some critics said it’s been 30 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals and 20 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the state Supreme Court. McCullen has been a deputy prosecuting attorney for 11 years, most recently in the appellate division, Ige said in a news release announcing her appointment. She previously taught social studies, Hawaiian studies and Hawaiian language, according to the governor’s office.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: The Sun Valley region, a popular ski destination that had one of the highest per capita rates of coronavirus cases in the country at the start of the pandemic last year, is now leading the state – and most of the country – in vaccinating its citizens. Numbers from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare show that more than 87% of Blaine County residents ages 12 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, the Idaho Press reports. Eighty percent of the county’s residents are fully vaccinated, which puts the county in the top 10 among more than 3,000 counties nationwide, according to healthdata.gov. That’s far higher than Idaho’s statewide average of about 50%. The nationwide average reached 70% last week. “Blaine County has shown a remarkable willingness to work together as a community,” said Brianna Bodily, public information officer for South Central Public Health District, the health authority for Blaine and seven other counties, including Twin Falls. “They understand that this disease impacts all of them, so they make efforts together to unite against COVID-19. Vaccination is just one of many things that they have done.” Blaine County is home to resort towns Ketchum, Bellevue, Hailey and Sun Valley. Out-of-state travelers brought the virus to the ski destination in early 2020.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After essentially disappearing from the state, the osprey is making a comeback thanks to a decades­long effort to eliminate harmful pesticides and provide safe places for the large, slender hawks to nest. The raptors remain a threatened species in Illinois. But 14 nesting pairs settled this season in platforms placed on top of tall poles throughout the Cook County Forest Preserve District, the Chicago Tribune reports. The district placed the platforms in areas to resemble the birds’ preferred treetop nesting habitat and now has 20 sites around the county. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has a similar effort across the state. Three of Cook County’s 14 nests were lost when tornadoes hit parts of the Chicago area earlier this summer. But generally, there has been a slow and steady increase in occupied platforms and nesting pairs in recent decades. Experts say it’s due largely to the removal to environmental toxins like DDT, a pesticide banned in 1972 that thinned the shells of the raptors’ eggs, making it nearly impossible for offspring to survive. “It can take a bird that’s basically everywhere and does really great under most circumstances and take it to the brink,” said Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the Field Museum. “And it also shows that we can change that.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will fund a $1.3 million distribution of the opioid reversal agent naloxone to ensure the medication reaches Hoosiers who are at risk of drug overdoses, officials announced. Overdose Lifeline Inc., an Indiana nonprofit that helps those affected by substance use disorder, will distribute 35,000 doses of naloxone to first responders, families, friends and others who are likely to be the first on the scene if someone overdoses. Funds were made available by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration state opioid response grant. This is the state’s third investment in naloxone distribution since May 2020, when Holcomb announced the state would earmark $1 million for 25,000 doses of the medication amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Each dose of naloxone represents another life that could be saved and another opportunity to engage individuals with substance use disorder in treatment,” Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement Thursday. “The effects of COVID-19 continue to linger, and now more than ever we must make treatments like naloxone readily available to any Hoosier who may encounter an individual experiencing an overdose.” Indiana reported a 33% increase in fatal overdoses in 2020, according to provisional data released in July by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Ahead of Thursday’s Major League Baseball game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site, fans have flocked to the town in record numbers. The New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox, two historic franchises featured in the film, will play in the first official MLB game in Iowa history on a specially built field right next to the diamond featured in the movie. James Earl Jones’ character sketches a vision for farmer Ray Kinsella, played by Kevin Costner, of a mystical baseball field built out of Iowa cornfields that will lure people who are seeking to reconnect with childhood memories of baseball and are yearning for simpler times. “People will come, Ray,” Jones says. And they have, baseball fans and movie buffs alike. The game had an immediate impact on Dyersville the moment it was announced back in 2019. The phone at the Super 8 by Wyndham rang nonstop. The Plaza Antique Mall has seen business pick way up. Karla Thompson, executive director of the Dyersville Area Chamber of Commerce, said other businesses, including boutiques and home decor stores, have benefited, too, as national media outlets have done stories on the town. “We were up to 120% just on the website views and hits,” Thompson said. “That was back in June.”\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: An outbreak of illness at a splash park near Wichita was not caused by animals at its interactive zoo, health officials said. The Wichita Eagle reports that email exchanges it obtained through an open records request indicate none of the water samples health officials took from the splash park at Tanganyika Wildlife Park had animal-linked contamination. The newspaper reviewed more than a month of email correspondence between state and county health officials and park director Matt Fouts with details about the results of water samples taken June 19 and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Christine Steward, deputy health director with the Sedgwick County Health Department, sent Fouts an email July 8 saying the organisms isolated from water samples “help us rule out the animals at the park.” Health officials have said eight people who visited the park June 11 contracted Shigella, a type of bacteria that spreads from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces. People who visited the splash park also have tested positive for the norovirus, sapovirus and a type of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli. The splash park was allowed to reopen July 27 after it made necessary changes and passed inspection.\n\nKentucky\n\nFancy Farm: Two Republicans expected to compete to lead their party’s ticket in 2023 took turns Saturday accusing the Democratic governor of infringing on individual liberties with his pandemic-related restrictions, pressing GOP themes on the stage of the state’s premiere political event. Speaking at the Fancy Farm picnic – attended only by Republican elected officials and candidates this year – Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles and state Auditor Mike Harmon accused Gov. Andy Beshear of overreaching with his now-lifted restrictions on businesses and gatherings to try to contain COVID-19. The attacks against Beshear’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a crisis that has spanned most of his term, came as Kentucky faces its worst outbreak in months, fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Republican speakers didn’t talk about the resurgence, instead repudiating Beshear’s executive actions. The governor has said his decisions saved lives. With virus cases soaring to the highest levels in months, Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman skipped the picnic. Western Kentucky’s Graves County, where the picnic is held, is in the red zone for COVID-19 cases, signaling a severe level of community spread. Beshear didn’t respond directly Saturday but said in a statement that the focus should be on getting more Kentuckians vaccinated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: City officials are eyeing a closed golf course as a floodwater detention area, but the owner says he doesn’t want to sell. The city-parish announced Friday that the Louisiana Watershed Initiative had awarded it $6 million to buy 65 acres of the former Sherwood Forest Golf Course. Paired with $3.27 million in local funding, the city-parish said it would buy the land, dig out parts to hold water from Jones Creek when it floods, and possibly use the land as a park. The city-parish has been buying vacant land to use for stormwater detention after flooding in 2016 that caused widespread damage in southeast Louisiana. “This project is another example of the aggressive approach my administration is taking to address drainage throughout the parish,” Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome said in a statement. But Randy Dornier, whose family controls a company that owns the land, told WAFB-TV he doesn’t want to sell. “If I really thought this was the solution to the 2016-type flooding, I’d have to bow out and say it’s for the good of the community, but I know it’s not,” Dornier said. Instead, he said he wants to restore the golf course. In 2019, a developer proposed building a 276-home subdivision on the course, a move opposed by residents of the older neighborhood surrounding the property.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A brick smokestack that pumped out molasses-scented steam for decades is coming down. Visible from Interstate 295, the nearly 150-foot smokestack has long been a symbol of the B&M baked beans factory, but it hasn’t been used for more than 20 years. The Portland Press Herald reports crews began removing it Friday, and the rest is expected to come down by the end of the month. Burnham & Morrill Co. opened in Portland in 1867 as a food cannery to package meat, vegetables and fish. It began making baked beans in the 1920s and is now owned by B&G Foods, which includes Green Giant and Crisco among its brands. The trademark smell of molasses from the cooking beans now emerges from an exhaust stack on the other side of the factory.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Comptroller Peter Franchot outlined a plan Monday to increase equity and inclusion for Black residents as part of his campaign for governor, including a pledge to name a Black woman as his running mate. Franchot, a Democrat, announced he would create a Cabinet-level office called the Secretary of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to review state policies. The secretary would release a report on promoting diversity in government, addressing existing biases in government policies and promoting economic opportunity. If recreational marijuana is legalized in a ballot initiative, the comptroller said he would focus on ensuring it would help economic growth in areas of the state disproportionately affected by enforcement for cannabis-related offenses and addresses past criminal justice inequities. Franchot also noted plans to explore creating a state-owned bank to ensure access to credit for Maryland small businesses, particularly those owned by women and members of minority groups. Another part of the proposal would seek to provide state-backed mortgage loans to people in communities of color with a goal of creating parity in new homeownership rates by the end of his first term. Franchot is running in a crowded Democratic primary for next year’s election.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A hospital crippled by a nurses’ strike that’s now entering its sixth month says it has hired more than 100 replacement nurses after talks aimed at ending the standoff stalled. St. Vincent Hospital said in a statement Sunday that it planned to post more jobs in the coming days. “Saint Vincent must take responsible action and hire as many nurses as possible to maintain access to ensure core services, as COVID numbers increase and the cooler weather approaches,” it said. Hospital officials accused the Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents the 700 striking nurses, of “minimal interest or intention to end the strike.” The nurses, who have been on strike since March 8, are seeking staffing increases at the Worcester hospital owned by Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare. Union spokesperson David Schildmeier questioned whether the hospital has really hired replacement workers. In an email to The Boston Globe, he said: “Tenet has spent in excess of $100 million to force and prolong this strike to avoid accountability for providing the level of care patients of Worcester expect and deserve.” Management at St. Vincent’s Hospital on Thursday presented what they called their “last, best and final” offer. The union promptly criticized it as an “unsatisfactory ultimatum.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Childhood vaccination rates have dropped below 70% in more than half of the state’s counties, and health and school officials are advising parents to catch their kids up on immunizations before school starts in the coming weeks. Michigan’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Joneigh Khaldun and other health and school officials spoke Monday about the need to catch students up on regular immunizations, as well as COVID-19 vaccinations for those who are 12 and older. Seven counties and the city of Detroit have childhood immunization rates that have dropped below 60% during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry. When an area has lower vaccination rates, it creates an environment where diseases can spread, Khaldun said. “All it takes is one infected individual. So as families, students, teachers and administrators, prepare for this upcoming school year, I urge every parent, to make sure their child is up to date on all of their vaccinations,” Khaldun said. East Lansing School Board President Terah Chambers said that on top of requiring face masks indoors, parents must make sure their kids get all their vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine if eligible, in order to move forward with the goal of in-person instruction every day of the school year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: More than a year after George Floyd’s death sparked a failed push to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department, activists and several City Council members are trying again, with a well-funded initiative that would ask voters in November whether the department – disparaged by critics for what they say is an enduring culture of brutality – should be dismantled. In its place would be a public safety department that employs a “comprehensive public health approach” and licensed peace officers “if necessary.” The new department would no longer be under the sole command of the mayor’s office, which is significant given that incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey opposes abolishing the police department, while a majority of City Council members supports the idea. More than 30 local groups are pushing for change under the “Yes 4 Minneapolis” banner. They gathered 20,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot – almost twice the number necessary – and have raised about $1 million, including $500,000 from Open Society Policy Center, which has ties to billionaire George Soros. “What we knew as public safety – which is only the police right now, the only option that we have – was unacceptable,” said Brian Fullman, lead organizer with one of the groups, Barbershop and Black Congregation Cooperative.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s top public health official said Monday that as coronavirus cases continue to surge with the highly contagious delta variant, no intensive care beds were available in 35 of Mississippi’s top-level hospitals. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs also said more than 200 people were waiting in hospital emergency rooms to be admitted, and the problem will grow worse in coming days. The wait times affect not only people with COVID-19 but also those with other health conditions. The state Health Department said Monday that more than 6,900 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed from Friday through Sunday. “Keep in mind – this will translate into around 500 new hospitalizations in coming days,” Dobbs wrote on Twitter. He said the intensive care units were full in Level 1, 2 and 3 hospitals in the state’s acute care systems. Those include the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo, Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg, Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, and Singing River Health System in Pascagoula. Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation. As of Friday, the state Health Department said 35% of residents were fully vaccinated, compared to 50% nationally.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The head of St. Louis County’s government on Monday urged its council to adopt a mask mandate amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The request from St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, a Democrat, comes after a judge last week issued an order that, at least temporarily, halted a mask requirement for indoor public places that Page had announced last month. Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt then sued to stop it after the County Council voted to overturn it. A hearing on a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Aug. 17. Page said during a news conference that Missouri’s largest county, with about 1 million residents, is now averaging 311 new COVID-19 cases each day – six times the number from two months ago. Data from St. Louis regional hospitals shows 493 patients are hospitalized with the virus, compared with 93 hospitalizations in June. The County Council meets Tuesday, and Page urged passage of a mask requirement, a move that would make the court case moot. Schmitt’s lawsuit argued that Missouri law gives the council the authority to terminate the requirement. Page said the council’s vote in July “has brought confusion, anxiety and anger.” Noting that children under 12 can’t get COVID-19 shots, he also lamented that “we are seeing younger people in our ICUs.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Hunting this fall could be largely shaped by the widespread drought hitting the state this summer, from potential access closures to impacts on wildlife fitness and location. While some early hunts start in August, Montana’s hunting season really begins in earnest Sept. 4 with the start of the six-week archery season. On Oct. 23 general season kicks off for five weeks, ending the Sunday after Thanksgiving. And, new for this year, traditional muzzleloader hunters will have their own nine-day season to chase elk and deer in December. Most big game herds fared pretty well following a mild winter by Montana standards. Cold snaps remained relatively short-lived with little lower-elevation snow. And hunter success hovered around average levels in most parts of the state. Persistent drought this summer affected green-up, with many areas of Montana reporting stifled grass growth. That can mean less nutrition for elk, deer and other wildlife, the Montana State News Bureau reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A group of doctors who are also moms is urging schools to consider requiring masks this fall as the number of coronavirus cases surges across the state. The group has about 700 members statewide who work in a variety of different medical specialties, said Dr. Christine Mitchell, an Omaha-area internal medicine specialist who is involved in the effort. “This virus changes. The pandemic changes. And we have to change our policies with it,” she said. “Now it’s time that we make the restrictions again, put the masks on and see if we can keep school going all year, just like we did last year.” Nebraska virus cases have been increasing for six straight weeks as the highly contagious delta variant continues to spread. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has more than doubled, going from 139.71 cases per day July 24 to 374.14 per day Saturday. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts has said he believes schools should not require masks or COVID-19 vaccinations this school year despite recent recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics that say all students and staff should wear masks in school, even if they are inoculated.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Metro officials on Saturday announced plans for transit improvements, including new and restored services, following cutbacks during the pandemic. Henderson Mayor Debra March, chairwoman of the Regional Transportation Commission, said officials were “thrilled to celebrate the services that we’re bringing back and adding to our community thanks to federal stimulus funding.” The enhancements announced Saturday and taking effect Sunday include faster and more regular service for busy stops along Charleston Boulevard and weekend services in underserved areas. There also will be a pilot microtransit service in parts of the Las Vegas metro area.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An off-the-grid hermit known to locals as “River Dave,” whose cabin burned down on the wooded property where he was squatting for 27 years, says he’s grateful and overwhelmed by fundraising efforts and offers for a place to live. “I feel about as good as I ever have in my life,” David Lidstone, 81, said Sunday, saying he has many friends. “I live down there in the woods because I like being alone, being away from people, so this publicity is not anything that I’m used to at all.” Lidstone lived in the woods along the Merrimack River in the town of Canterbury. He was jailed July 15 on a civil contempt sanction and told he’d be released if he agreed to leave the cabin. The property owner, 86-year-old Leonard Giles, wanted Lidstone off the land. A fire destroyed the cabin Wednesday, hours after Lidstone defended himself during a court hearing. He was released from jail Thursday after a judge ruled that he would have less incentive to return to “this particular place in the woods” since the cabin had burned down. The state fire marshal’s office is investigating the fire. Lidstone had said a prior owner gave his word years ago that he could live there, but he had nothing in writing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: An amendment to Megan’s Law that tightens the rules on who can seek to be removed from a sex offender registry can’t be applied retroactively to crimes committed before the amendment was passed, the state Supreme Court ruled Monday. The case involved a man, identified by the initials J.D.-F., who was working as a manager at a McDonald’s in Hillsborough in 2001 when he was accused of improperly touching two teenage boys who worked there. He was convicted in December 2002 of criminal sexual contact and child endangerment and sentenced to time in the county jail and probation. Under Megan’s Law, he was required to publicly register with law enforcement as a sex offender. The law allows offenders to apply to be removed from the list if they are offense-free for 15 years and no longer considered a safety threat to others. Earlier in 2002, between when J.D.-F’s crimes were committed and his conviction, the Legislature had amended Megan’s Law to prohibit those convicted of certain offenses or of more than one offense from applying to end their registration requirements. After J.D.-F applied for removal from the registry in 2019, a trial court and, subsequently, an appeals court had denied his request on the grounds that the amendment was passed before he was convicted.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The governor and dozens of other elected officials are urging the state’s business community to require that employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 or alternatively undergo regular testing. Those steps are necessary to stop the increased spread of the coronavirus as infections increase, according to the letter released Friday and sent to employers and business groups. The 28 signers include Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham., U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich, and U.S. Reps. Teresa Leger Fernandez and Melanie Stansbury but not U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell, the congressional delegation’s sole Republican member. “Requiring vaccination of your workforce – and/or requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test of the patrons who visit and support your business – is within your right as an employer,” the letter said. “Implementing that sort of policy to help New Mexico finally end this pandemic is within your power as a community leader.” New Mexico state employees are required to be vaccinated or get tested regularly. The elected officials’ letter cited increased cases and hospitalizations. “In short, the pandemic is not over,” the letter said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dave Chappelle, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and Amy Schumer are part of a star-studded group of comedians that will perform for one night only at Madison Square Garden to mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11. All proceeds from “NYC Still Rising After 20 Years: A Comedy Celebration” will benefit 9/11 charities. Proof of vaccination against COVID-19 is required. “We wanted to put on a fun celebration to honor this great city’s resilience. It’s nice to be able to do this with friends and people we love,” Stewart said in a statement. The show is his brainchild with “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who will also perform. A ticket presale for the Sept. 12 show begins at noon Wednesday on Live Nation, Ticketmaster.com and Madison Square Garden’s website and runs until 10 p.m. Thursday, with general tickets on sale starting at noon Friday at Ticketmaster.com. Bill Burr, Colin Jost, Colin Quinn, Dave Attell, Jay Pharoah, John Mulaney, Michael Che, Ronny Chieng, Tom Segura and Wanda Sykes are also in the lineup.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: One of the state’s most vaccinated areas is again compelling people to wear masks at indoor public spaces. Durham’s city and countywide emergency order, which took effect at 5 p.m. Monday, is the latest effort to combat the rapid spread of the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. In a Monday morning news conference, Durham Mayor Steve Schewel said it’s time to go “back to the basics” in order to combat what he now views as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” “Face masks are a common-sense, non-economically damaging way of limiting transmission,” Schewel said. In all but two of North Carolina’s 100 counties, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal mask-wearing for both vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans. But at a time when nearly all available COVID-19 metrics showed spread of the virus at its worst levels in months, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper decided to let his statewide mask mandate expire July 30 and allow local school boards to set their own masking policies. Spread of the virus has only continued to surge since then, prompting some experts to fear an uptick in transmission within the dozens of school districts that have made masking optional for all K-12 students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Wildlife managers say predictions of a poor duck breeding season in the state due to drought have proven true, and hunters should expect challenging conditions this fall. The number of duck broods, or families, observed during the state Game and Fish Department’s annual mid-July survey was the lowest in nearly three decades. This year’s fall duck flight is expected to be down 36% from last year, according to Mike Szymanski, the agency’s migratory game bird management supervisor. “Hunters should take advantage of early migrants like blue-winged teal during the first two weeks of the season,” Szymanski said. “We won’t be able to depend on local duck production to the extent that we have in the past.” The news was not unexpected, the Bismarck Tribune reports. More than half of North Dakota is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories, while all of the state is in some form of drought. In past dry years, some areas still remained wet, but “there’s nothing like that this year,” Szymanski said. “It’s all dry.” The National Weather Service expects that drought will persist into the fall. Some areas of North Dakota have seen improvements, but rainfall continues to be hit-and-miss. The regular duck season opens Sept. 25 for resident hunters and Oct. 2 for nonresidents.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A man will face a charge of causing a panic after his actions prompted a panicked rush out of a mall movie theater over the weekend, authorities said. Columbus police said Sunday that, contrary to earlier reports, no shots were fired, and in fact no weapon of any kind was involved. Sgt. James Fuqua said a man walked into the Easton Town Center movie theater just before 9 p.m. Saturday – just before the end of a showing of “Suicide Squad” – and began screaming “that he was the king,” accompanied by “many obscenities.” Fuqua said the man then ran to top of theater and, still screaming obscenities, started to reach into his bag – and that sent everyone else racing for the exits, even jumping over railings to reach them, in fear that he had a weapon of some kind. Fuqua said officers working special duty at the mall rushed inside and restrained the man without incident. The man, who refused to give his name but has since been identified, will face a charge of “inducing panic,” police said. Fuqua said the incorrect reports of shots fired stemmed from shouts of young people rushing out of the theater. Some people sustained minor injuries in the flight from the theater, he said. “We don’t want the citizens of the city to feel that it is unsafe to go to any shopping mall here,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s already burgeoning movie and television industry – with buzzy projects like new Hulu series “Reservation Dogs” and upcoming fact-based Martin Scorsese epic film “Killers of the Flower Moon” – is about to get a big boost. To go along with the ceremonial signing of Senate Bill 608, which created the Filmed in Oklahoma Act of 2021, Gov. Kevin Stitt issued a proclamation Aug. 3 declaring it “Film Day” in the Sooner State. But Oklahoma will really get into its next phase of cinematic action Tuesday, when film and television projects can begin applying for production tax incentives through the new $30 million program designed to create a more robust entertainment industry for the state. The application portal will available on the Oklahoma Film + Music Office website at okfilmmusic.org. Passed by the Legislature and signed by Stitt in May, the act increases the state’s total film incentive cap and eligibility threshold to host major motion pictures and television series. It creates a new rebate program of $30 million per fiscal year for 10 years, a significant boost that proponents of Oklahoma’s film and television industry say will bring in more productions, which means more jobs and economic activity for the state.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Authorities say a man was fatally shot on a TriMet bus Sunday evening. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Sunday’s shooting marks the 56th homicide in Portland this year, making 2021 the city’s deadliest year since 1994, when 55 people were killed during the entire year. Officers responded to the area in southeast Portland just before 5:30 p.m. and found a man who had been shot. The victim was taken to a hospital, where he died from his wounds, police said. TriMet spokesperson Tia York said the agency is providing the police bureau with security footage from Sunday’s incident.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A man has pleaded guilty to leaving a backpack containing homemade explosive devices in a bush outside a complex in the downtown area during last year’s protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Matthew Michanowicz, 53, pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to possession of an unregistered destructive device. Authorities said he was seen on surveillance video placing the military-style backpack near a bike rack under some trees at PNC Plaza on May 31, 2020. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Smolar said it contained three improvised explosive devices filled with gasoline, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Authorities said Michanowicz originally told them he had gone to the area to see the property damage that occurred during the protests but initially denied any knowledge of the backpack. Sentencing for Michanowicz, who was originally charged with arson and possessing weapons of mass destruction, is scheduled for Dec. 13.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Communities and organizations across the state are eligible to apply for a portion of $3 million in matching grants to protect valuable green space, according to the state Department of Environmental Management. Funding provided through the 2016 Green Economy Bond and the 2018 Green Economy and Clean Water Bond – which Rhode Island voters approved by a margin of almost 80% last November – is capitalizing the grants. Awards up to $400,000, which may cover up to half of the project cost, will help preserve lands that offer significant natural, ecological or agricultural value by direct purchase or conservation easement. In addition to the grants, funding is available to cover some costs associated with appraisal, title and survey services. The application deadline is Oct. 29.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWalterboro: A prosecutor is using a federal grant to expand a program that can let nonviolent criminals who are veterans or addicted to drugs avoid prison. The 14th Judicial Circuit’s Multidisciplinary Court program is expanding from Beaufort County into Colleton and Jasper counties, Solicitor Duffie Stone said in a statement. The program allows veterans whose problems in military service like post-traumatic stress disorder or people with drug problems to seek help. They have to plead guilty, but their sentences aren’t carried out unless they don’t complete the program, Stone said. The people sent to Multidisciplinary Court after pleading guilty have to get drug addiction or mental health treatment, have random drug tests and home visits, pay restitution for their crimes, and perform community service. They also appear before one of the court’s judges regularly to report how they are doing and answer questions. The expansion is being paid for through a $740,000 federal grant. In applying for the money, prosecutors said drugs are the root of about half of the 5,000 cases they deal with every year in the five-county circuit, when related crimes like burglaries are included. The program is much less expensive than prison, and it gives people convicted of minor crimes a second chance, Stone said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: Police say the upward trend of domestic incident calls reported in the middle of COVID-19 lockdowns last year is continuing to manifest itself in 2021. Police Chief Jason Foote said Yankton police answered a total of 292 domestics in 2020, up more than 50 from the year before and something he believes “could be due to issues associated with COVID.” Midway through this year, the city has fielded 180 such calls, the Yankton Press and Dakotan reports. Nationwide, domestic violence reports rose sharply when the pandemic arrived. “I can’t say that there a specific factor to the increase, but I believe COVID has caused tension during this time, but this is not the only factor,” Foote said. “Making the public aware of domestic violence and that it should not be tolerated could be a factor in the increased calls for service getting law enforcement to intervene before things turn to physical assault.” In that respect, the number of cases being referred to the state’s attorney office is trending downward, Foote said. He said the police department continues to work with its community partners such as the River City Domestic Violence Center to help tackle the problem, and the public can also play its part in addressing what is an ongoing issue.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Southwest Tennessee Community College has forgiven $1.8million in school debt for 1,600 of its recent students, the college announced Monday. The community college cleared the balances for eligible students enrolled during the spring, summer and fall semesters of 2020, using federal emergency relief funding. “Our students were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and many of them had to leave college abruptly,” Dr. Tracy D. Hall, president of the college, said in a statement. “Wiping the slate clean clears a path for them to come back and move forward with their goals and career aspirations.” Forgiving the debt is a step toward giving students financially affected by the pandemic “a fresh start” for their college education. Students do not have to repay the funds, the college reiterated. “Earning a college credential is transformative for our students and removing this financial barrier to their success is the best use of COVID-19 relief funds,” Hall said. “We are truly grateful and elated to be able to help our students in such a meaningful way.” Last fall, the college experienced an enrollment dip of 24%, the greatest drop of any community college in the state. The fall semester begins Aug. 23. Masks are required indoors for students, faculty, staff and visitors.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Travis County state district judge has signed a temporary restraining order blocking the arrest of any quorum-busting Texas House member, paving the way for those who remain out of the state to return home without that threat. State District Judge Brad Urrutia signed a three-page order late Sunday that was filed Monday in Travis County District Court. It came at the request of 19 House Democrats who said in a 24-page lawsuit that their arrests would rely on a misinterpretation of the state Constitution and House rules and give the “government power to arrest its political opponents.” The application for the restraining order includes affidavits from Reps. Gina Hinojosa of Austin, Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio and Jasmine Crockett of Dallas. In his order, Urrutia blocked Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, from “detaining, confining, or otherwise restricting a Texas House Democrat’s movement without his or her consent.” It also bans those Republicans from “issuing any warrant or other instruments” that would cause the Democrats to be detained or confined. The order also applies to the House sergeant-at-arms, the Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Rangers, Capitol police and other law enforcement agencies. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for later this month.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: Three weeks after graffiti laden with Nazi symbols, codes and slogans appeared in a Logan High School parking lot, the local police investigation appears to have stalled. “The case is still open, but at this point, there’s not new information coming in,” Logan City Police Department Capt. Curtis Hooley told the Herald Journal. Investigators could see figures in the parking lot, Hooley said, but no identifying features. Requests for information from residents have so far likewise failed to turn up identifying details. “We put out a Facebook request of citizens if they live down in that area if they have any footage from their doorbell cameras and things, and officers tried to make contact with people down there,” Hooley said, “but we have not come up with anything. We’ve had no information that has come forward to help us to try to identify who those people might have been.” Surveillance footage shows figures in the parking lot just before midnight July 13, Hooley said. Area resident Chris McGinty said he discovered the graffiti the next morning, took a photo, and spread it to news and social media in the hopes of starting productive conversations about the expression of hate and racism.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: The state’s busiest Amtrak station could be getting a $3.5 million facelift with the help of a federal appropriation. The Essex Junction station is much as it was when it was built in the 1950s, and it’s showing its age. “It’d be really hard to understand why this station here that receives 20,000 or so individuals over the year isn’t treated with better respect,” said Essex Junction Village President Andrew Brown. MyNBC5 reports the improvements to the Essex Junction station would include upgraded restrooms, more seating and bike racks. David Carle, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, said the Vermont Democrat has been working for years to find funding to renovate the station. A request for $3 million for the Essex Junction station is pending in Congress.\n\nVirginia\n\nEttrick: Four buildings at a historically Black university that were named for white men with links to the Jim Crow era or to the Confederacy have been renamed for Black women. Virginia State University announced the new names Friday, five months after the original names were taken down, with replacement names considered by a committee. “It wasn’t hard, and we didn’t have to look far to find women who embody our mission today,” Tonya Hall, VSU’s vice president of external relations, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Vawter Hall, originally named for a Confederate captain, was renamed for Lula Johnson, believed to be the first woman to graduate from a Virginia public college in the 1890s, from what is now VSU. Byrd Hall, a dorm named for former governor and U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr., is now Otelia Howard Hall, honoring a school English teacher in the 1920s and ’30s. The former Trinkle Hall is now named for Johnella Jackson, who wrote the music for VSU’s alma mater in the 1920s. Elbert Lee Trinkle was governor in the 1920s and signed a law that prohibited interracial marriage. And Eggleston Hall, named for Joseph Eggleston, a board of visitors member in the early 20th century, is now named for Lucretia Campbell, the faculty’s first Black female member.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Most state workers, as well as private health care and long-term care employees, will be required to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs, Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday. Weekly coronavirus testing will not be an option for those who want to avoid vaccination and maintain their employment, and the only way to opt out of the requirement is a medical or religious exemption. The order applies to about 60,000 employees of the 24 state agencies that are part of the governor’s executive Cabinet, which includes the departments of corrections, social and health services and transportation, as well as the Washington State Patrol. A fact sheet issued to employees notes that the order applies to employees who are currently working remotely, since they may need to go to a work site at some point. The governor’s office said the overall number includes those who have already been vaccinated, so it was unclear how many within that group are unvaccinated. Inslee’s announcement appears to be the most stringent among states that have issued vaccination requirements for state or health care workers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state treasurer’s office will hold two auctions for unclaimed property at the State Fair this month. The auctions will take place at 5 p.m. Aug. 14 and Aug. 21 in Fairlea, the office said in a news release. Among the items up for bid are rare coins, currency, jewelry and other collectibles. They will be on display throughout the fair at the treasurer’s office booth located in the West Virginia Building at the fairgrounds. Banks and law enforcement officials turn over the items to the office’s Unclaimed Property Division when lawful owners cannot be located. Proceeds from the auction remain in an individual’s name for claim in the future. “These items are often forgotten about or left abandoned,” state Treasurer Riley Moore said. “These auctions help convert these collectibles into the highest cash value possible for someone to claim in the future. They’re also a treasure trove for collectors.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday that he has given hotels $70 million in federal coronavirus relief dollars. The governor’s office said grants of up to $2 million went out Friday to 888 lodging businesses around the state to help offset pandemic-related losses. The money is part of $140 million in American Rescue Plan Act dollars designated for Wisconsin’s tourism and entertainment industries, including $11.25 million for movie theaters; $12 million for live-event small businesses; $2.8 million for minor league sports teams; $1 million to help the Wisconsin Historical Society reopen historical sites; and $8 million for summer camps. The lodging industry supported more than 157,000 jobs across Wisconsin and had a $17.3 billion impact on the state economy last year despite the pandemic. So far this year, the industry’s numbers have surpassed 2020 as travelers start taking vacations again, the governor’s office said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the first time in nearly six years, Powder River Basin coal producers are reporting increased production, lower costs and profitable mines. The 6% increase in production for the first half of 2021 for the basin’s 12 Campbell County mines – going from 101.85 million tons through the first half of 2020 to 107.9 million this year – isn’t enough to be considered a trend, jump or leap. But as the nation’s economy continues to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic that’s lingered for nearly 18 months, it’s a welcome reprieve from the 22.5% decline thermal coal saw last year. With natural gas prices also rising above $4 and the pandemic rebound, it was expected there would be more of a leveling off for a beleaguered thermal coal industry, said Robert Godby, a leading energy economist and interim dean of the University of Wyoming College of Business. “This is exactly what we expected,” he told the Gillette News Record. “As the economy recovers, we knew this was coming. But even (to this level) has kind of surprised us. Originally, we though it might be a one-year jump and then moderate, but now it’s looking like coal could maintain this pump through a good chunk of next year.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/01/milestone-rhino-bigfoot-shooting-jailed-feeding-news-around-states/39874537/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nElmore: A K-9 known as both the best narcotics-sniffing dog in the state and a “knucklehead” was honored at a memorial service Tuesday after he died searching for drugs during a prison sweep. The 5-year-old Belgian Malinois named Jake suddenly became ill July 18 after he came into contact with a powdery synthetic street drug known as flakka during a routine contraband search. He died two days later after developing pneumonia and other complications. Fellow four-legged law enforcement officers yapped in the background at the Staton Kennel Complex in Elmore as Jake received a 21-gun salute, a traditional bugle playing of taps, a commendation from Gov. Kay Ivey and eulogies from law enforcement officials. Officials are still investigating the source of the narcotic at the Staton Correctional Facility.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Repairs and upgrades at earthquake-damaged area schools could cost more than $150 million. The Anchorage Daily News reports the Anchorage School District says the new estimate triples the original assessment of damage caused by the Nov. 30 quake. District officials say two schools need more than $20 million to repair and improve seismic performance; six schools may require at least $10 million; and improvement projects at 14 schools could cost at least $1 million each. District Chief Operating Officer Tom Roth says the estimates include immediate repairs needed and optional improvements that would improve the quake-readiness of schools. Roth says the district has spent $8 million to $9 million so far on post-quake repairs to return facilities to working condition.\n\nArizona\n\nTusayan: Fees could be going up at a large campground near the Grand Canyon’s popular South Rim entrance. A proposal by the Kaibab National Forest would more than double the overnight fees for single sites from $10 to $24 and at double sites from $20 to $48. The cost for large group sites at Ten X Campground also would go up from $75 per night to $125. Forest officials say the proposed hikes better align with prices at nearby recreation areas. They say additional funding would help maintain and expand the site and also allow them to bring in more seasonal workers. Officials say the campground fees haven’t gone up in more than 25 years. The public has until Oct. 31 to comment on the proposal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials say the four companies providing coverage through the state’s insurance exchange under the federal health care overhaul law are seeking an average rate increase of about 2% for next year. Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday that all four insurers cited the elimination of an exchange user fee in their rate requests. The highest average initial rate-hike request for individual plans came from Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield at 2.89% and the lowest from QualChoice Life and Health at 0.51%. The average increase requested by Ambetter from AR Health & Wellness was 1.9%, and the average from QCA Health Plan was 0.56%. The requests are subject to an independent actuarial analysis under state law, and the Insurance Department has until Sept. 18 to approve rates for next year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A conservation organization says it has achieved the first successful artificial insemination birth of a southern white rhino in North America, an important step in saving another rhino species from extinction. San Diego Zoo Global says mother Victoria gave birth Sunday to a healthy southern white rhino male calf in the barn at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park after 30 minutes of labor. Victoria was artificially inseminated with frozen semen from southern white rhino Maoto following hormone-induced ovulation. Victoria carried her calf for over a year – 493 days. Mother and calf will remain off exhibit to the public for now to allow them to bond. The calf will eventually be introduced to the other five female rhinos at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center – including Amani, also pregnant through artificial insemination and due to give birth this fall.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The U.S. Department of Justice has lost track of more than 60 boxes of documents from a 27-year-old criminal investigation into safety and environmental violations at a former nuclear weapons plant, officials said Tuesday. The files were gathered in a two-year grand jury probe of the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, which manufactured plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and had a history of fires, leaks and spills. The files have remained secret since the investigation ended with criminal charges in 1992. Seven groups representing environmentalists, ex-nuclear workers, area residents and public health advocates filed a motion in federal court in January asking that the files be made public. Government attorneys are fighting the request. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver told the activists in a July 24 email that it cannot find the files but now say the search is ongoing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is seeking scenic Connecticut photos. For the second year, DEEP is holding the Discover Outdoor Connecticut Photo Contest. Photographers from any state may participate, but all submissions must have been taken in Connecticut. Photographers may enter one photo in each of three categories: wildlife; people enjoying the natural world; and scenic landscapes and flora. Judges will select first-, second- and third-place winners in each category. There’s a separate youth category. Entries must be postmarked by Aug. 16. Entry forms can be found on DEEP’s website. First-place winners will have their photograph published in DEEP’s Connecticut Wildlife magazine. Winners will also receive gift cards.\n\nDelaware\n\nBowers: The Murderkill River has claimed a nearby bait shop that stood as an icon to the surrounding town’s history as a commercial fishing hotspot. News outlets report Frenchie’s Bait & Tackle partially slid into the river late Monday. The shop’s front end still sits on the shores of Bower Beach, where it was rebuilt after it burned down in the 1990s. Owner and commercial fisherman William “Frenchie” Poulin says it appears the shop’s eroded pilings gave out. The Bowers Beach Maritime Museum says responding authorities turned off the shop’s power and worked to contain any hazardous materials, such as oil. It says a cat that lived at the shop is now homeless. Councilman Bob McDevitt says no one was injured. Poulin previously served as Bower’s mayor and as a councilman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city’s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is asking Maryland to release over $50 million the state has withheld for a month amid ongoing funding disputes. The Washington Post reports Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld recently sent a letter to Maryland officials requesting funds be released immediately, warning Metro’s credit rating could take a hit. Maryland was supposed to release $56 million July 1, which was set to go toward new trains and buses. But Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn says Metro has delayed audits and hasn’t provided adequate information about its spending. The newspaper says the dispute may relate to Gov. Larry Hogan’s view that Maryland spends too much on transit rather than roads.\n\nFlorida\n\nRedington Beach: Authorities and beachgoers came together to protect and transport five pilot whales trapped in shallow water along the state’s western shore. News outlets report the whales were first spotted Monday morning, and biologists and beachgoers swung into action, covering the whales from the climbing sun as the tide pulled away from shore. Biologists determined the whales were healthy enough for transport, and volunteers teamed up to move the heavy creatures. Three whales were returned to the sea, while two others were taken to a Clearwater Marine Aquarium facility in Tarpon Springs for medical treatment and testing. Aquarium spokeswoman Carlee Wendell says pilot whale mass strandings have happened about a dozen times since 1990. Just this month, dozens of disoriented pilot whales were saved from a mass stranding near a Georgia shore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia’s seaports are celebrating another year of record growth, though their chief executive warns business will suffer if the U.S. doesn’t resolve its trade war with China. The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that its ports at Savannah and Brunswick handled a record 37.5 million tons of cargo in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s a 4.2% increase over the previous year. A whopping 4.5 million container units of imports and exports were shipped through Savannah. Griff Lynch, the port authority’s executive director, said he’s concerned tariffs imposed in the Trump administration’s trade dispute with China, if unresolved, could slow business in the coming year. Lynch said export volumes dipped slightly in June, and “that could very well be linked to the tariffs.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor on Tuesday rescinded an emergency proclamation put in place to deal with Native Hawaiian protesters who are blocking a road to prevent the construction of a giant telescope at a mountain summit they consider sacred. Gov. David Ige said there were no immediate plans to move heavy equipment to Mauna Kea’s summit. He also noted two hurricanes were approaching that could affect the protest area and the rest of the state. Hurricane Erick is forecast to pass south of the Big Island this week. Following right after is Hurricane Flossie, on track to come close to the islands early next week. “For the safety of all involved, we want to deescalate activities,” Ige said. He declared an emergency July 17 to give law enforcement more authority to close areas of the mountain and to use additional National Guard troops to help deliver construction gear.\n\nIdaho\n\nJerome: The University of Idaho has bought land for a public visitor center, classrooms and other facilities supporting what officials say will be the world’s largest research dairy. Bill Loftus with the university’s College of Ag and Life Sciences told The Times-News the new property near Jerome represents a significant step for the planned Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. Work on the CAFE began over a decade ago, and the university plans to have the dairy up and running in 2024. The project spans three sites: a food processing research and training facility at the College of Southern Idaho; the dairy, which will hold 2,000 head of cattle; and the Discovery Complex, which will be built at the newest property and include classrooms, the visitor center, faculty offices and housing.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s transportation agencies are boosting services to accommodate tens of thousands of people attending Lollapalooza. The Metra commuter train and the CTA subway agencies will expand capacity for one of the nation’s most popular music festivals, which takes place from Thursday through Sunday in Chicago’s Grant Park. The lineup at Lollapalooza this year includes Ariana Grande, Lil Wayne, The Strokes and more than 150 other performers. Over 100,000 people are expected to attend each day. Metra will add trains and adjust schedules on most lines for the four-day event. CTA will add service on rail lines and bus routes. In a statement Friday, CTA President Dorval R. Carter Jr. said there will be ample service to get attendees to the festival “easily and comfortably.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The body of notorious 1930s gangster John Dillinger is expected to be exhumed in September at a local cemetery, but it could be a tough job because his grave is encased in concrete. Digging up the remains more than 85 years after Dillinger was killed by FBI agents also could resolve conspiracy theories that the man some considered a hero during the Great Depression isn’t buried in his marked grave, said Susan Sutton, a historian with the Indiana Historical Society. Among the tales is that his family tricked the FBI into shooting the wrong man. The Indiana State Department of Health approved a permit sought by Dillinger’s nephew to have the body exhumed from Crown Hill Cemetery and reinterred there. Days after his son’s funeral, Dillinger’s father had the casket reburied under a protective cap of concrete and scrap iron topped by four reinforced-concrete slabs, Sutton said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The ousted director of the state Department of Human Services will pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit, alleging he was let go after objecting to a pay arrangement for the governor’s deputy chief of staff, his lawyer said Wednesday. Jerry Foxhoven will file a whistleblower claim with the State Appeal Board, the first step toward pursuing a lawsuit against state government, his attorney Tom Duff said. It’s the latest development stemming from a personnel decision that has put Gov. Kim Reynolds on the defensive and prompted inquiries by state and federal watchdogs. Earlier this month, Reynolds’ spokesman wouldn’t confirm or deny whether Foxhoven’s workplace praise for rapper Tupac Shakur played a role in his being asked to resign, but the governor later said that she’d never heard of the rap icon and that “of course” that wasn’t the reason.\n\nKansas\n\nWellington: The National Glass Museum is temporarily closed after the front of the building collapsed. The front of the museum and most of the front brick facade collapsed overnight Friday. KAKE-TV reports the collapse is blamed on heavy rains during the year. The landlord hopes to rebuild and reopen the museum by the end of September. Pam Meyer, president of the National Depress Glass Association, said the building had been leaning for some time. She said the group plans to stay in Wellington. The museum displays American-made glassware from the Great Depression era. None of the museum pieces were damaged.\n\nKentucky\n\nCave City: Federal officials are investigating a report that a man fired a gunshot while camping at Mammoth Cave National Park, an incident that another camper says was prompted by an alleged sighting of Bigfoot. Mammoth Cave said law enforcement rangers responded early Sunday to a report of a person with a firearm at one of the park’s backcountry campsites. Brad Ginn told news outlets he and his girlfriend were camping nearby and were awakened about 1 a.m. by a man with his son. The man said they were going to investigate strange noises he kept hearing. Ginn said he heard a gunshot minutes later, and the man returned to say Bigfoot had emerged from the woods, so he fired. Ginn said he and his girlfriend decided to leave and report the incident. Park spokeswoman Molly Schroer said an investigation continues, and the park is safe to visit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 260 new laws are taking effect in the state as August begins. Starting Thursday, people must be at least 16 years old to marry. Medical marijuana patients can inhale cannabis. Women seeking abortions via medication are limited to Louisiana’s three abortion clinics, rather than a doctor’s office. Parents who scuffle with referees at children’s sport events face new penalties. Animal shelters can’t take in stray or unwanted animals solely to euthanize them for research facilities or sell animals for research or experimentation. Louisiana agencies can’t deny or revoke an occupational license when someone falls behind on student loan repayments. Anti-hazing laws get tougher, with new provisions aimed at forcing colleges to report allegations more quickly.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: The Maine Lobster Festival is underway, with festivalgoers planning to eat hundreds of the state’s beloved arthropods and crown a new sea goddess. The decades-old festival takes place near the Rockland waterfront and offers fare including steamed lobster, lobster bisque, lobster mac and cheese, lobster rolls, lobster wraps and lobster Caesar salad. The festival started Wednesday and ends Sunday. Wednesday’s big event is the 72nd Maine Sea Goddess Coronation. That piece of the festival caused a stir in the community last year when the winner lost her crown a day after her coronation over social media posts showing her holding a marijuana cigarette. New leaders of the festival later apologized to the pageant winner, Taylor Hamlin.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Officials in the city are creating unique learning spaces to help students traumatized by violence and poverty. Trauma-sensitive schools offer mental-health clinicians, mindfulness exercises, and abundant “peace corners” with pillows and books where students can retreat and compose themselves. The schools come in response to a growing realization among educators that chronic childhood trauma affects brain development and creates the risk of health problems. The need to address childhood trauma and mental health was underscored in Baltimore in 2015. The death of young black man Freddie Gray in police custody brought renewed attention to poverty, inequity and crime in large swaths of Baltimore. And the city drew national attention when President Donald Trump tweeted that its congressional district is a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An archaeological dig in historic Chinatown has been cut short after it turned up a 1980s music cassette, a toy dinosaur and other bric-a-brac. The city’s Archaeology Program tweeted Tuesday that it was wrapping up its three-week excavation because researchers reached the water table, and it was unsafe to dig further. The excavation of a vacant lot near the neighborhood’s distinctive gateway had been expected to last until early autumn. In recent days, researchers have been humorously tweeting some of their “finds,” including a cassette by Boston R&B group New Edition, a dinosaur toy, linoleum flooring, and other items from the 1970s and 1980s. Researchers had hoped to turn up artifacts shedding new light on Boston’s immigrants from China, Syria, Ireland and England who sought new lives in Chinatown from 1840 to 1980.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A mission to return the Arctic grayling to state waters is nearing a milestone. Juvenile grayling are scheduled to arrive soon at the Oden State Fish Hatchery in Emmet County, where an ultraviolet water disinfection system recently was installed. Fish production manager Ed Eisch of the Department of Natural Resources says the system will prevent fish already in the area from being infected by viruses or bacteria that the newly arrived grayling might bring along. They were collected as eggs in Alaska and have been kept at Michigan State University. The juvenile fish will be reared in isolation at Oden. Once cleared by health testing, they’ll be transferred to Marquette State Fish Hatchery to continue maturing. Grayling are native to Michigan but died out because of logging and overfishing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: About 200 people protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies blocked traffic near a Twin Cities federal building at Fort Snelling on Tuesday. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building houses an immigration court sometimes referred to as “deportation court.” Demonstrators blocked traffic late Tuesday afternoon in protest of ICE policies at the Mexican border, the separation of families and conditions in immigrant detention centers. Police cited about 25 protesters. Some held signs that read “Close the Camps” and “Abolish Ice.” The protest was part of a national movement called #NeverAgainIsNow, which links the Holocaust to America’s treatment of migrants arriving from Central America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Wildlife Federation’s Mississippi Wildlife Extravaganza has long been considered the unofficial start of hunting season in the state and draws tens of thousands of outdoor enthusiasts, but this year may prove different. Sportsmen say they’ll boycott the event this weekend, and vendors are dropping out over the organization’s stance on floodwater pumps in the south Delta. Flooding there most of the year has led to damaged homes, loss of crops, business closings and wildlife deaths. At its peak, floodwater covered a reported 550,000 acres of prime farmland and wildlife habitat. Proponents of the pumps say much of the flooding could have been avoided if pumps were installed at the Steele Bayou Control structure to push backwater out. But MWF has publicly opposed the pumps over environmental damage concerns.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A spokesman for the University of Missouri’s flagship campus says the school has identified fewer than 10 students whose parents may have taken advantage of a financial aid loophole. At issue is a practice of wealthy parents transferring guardianship of their children to friends or relatives to make it appear they came from poorer backgrounds, making them eligible for more financial aid. The U.S. Education Department is being urged to make changes to close the loophole. University of Missouri spokesman Christian Basi says the school will pull the funding it provides based on need and notify federal authorities if the determination is made that guardianship changes were done solely to take advantage of financial aid. Basi says no one will be kicked out of school, but the university is “extremely disappointed.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The blood supplier of area hospitals says it needs more donors after its daily blood donation count has fallen by more than half. The Billings Gazette reports Vitalant of Montana aims to get between 150 and 200 units of blood each day, but the daily donation has dropped to about 70 units. St. Vincent Healthcare and the Billings Clinic said in a joint statement that the blood supply is “alarmingly low,” so they need more people to donate regularly. Vitalant donor recruitment manager Erin Baker says the supplier has had trouble attracting donors who are ages 24-40. Most of the donors are 50 and older. Baker says a person would ideally donate blood at least three times a year.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state trooper has cited a driver after pulling over a vehicle that had registration stickers painted onto its license plates. Nebraska State Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas says the vehicle was stopped Monday morning at an Interstate 80 exit in north Lincoln. Trooper Adam Strode spotted the problem, and he ticketed the driver for having fictitious plates and not having valid registration. It’s unclear whether the driver also was the artist whose unsteady hand fashioned two rough red rectangles in the upper right-hand corner of the plates. The number 5 was in the middle, signifying a May expiration for 2020. Thomas says troopers to whom he’s talked told him it was the first time they’d heard of or “seen anything like this.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airport officials say a 3.1% jump in the number of passengers for the first half of 2019 puts McCarran International Airport on record pace to top 50 million passengers for the year. The Clark County Department of Aviation reports the 4.5 million arriving and departing travelers at the airport in June followed an all-time-high monthly tally of 4.6 million passengers in May. The airport handled a record-high 49.7 million passengers in 2018. McCarran is one of the 10 busiest airports in the nation based on passenger count. Domestic airlines have handled more than 22.8 million McCarran passengers through June, up 2.9% from the first half of 2018. Southwest Airlines is the busiest carrier at the airport, followed by Delta, Spirit, American and United.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: An annual gathering of current and former foster youth has a rap music theme this year. Participants at Thursday’s Youth Voices Summit at New England College in Henniker will attend workshops on topics such as getting a college degree; finding a job; choosing a career; budgeting; self-advocacy; forming healthy relationships; and finding help for substance abuse. This year’s keynote speaker is Ethan Birch, also known as rapper Six 8. He’s been a vocal youth advocate at several national events, including the Future Business Leaders of America State Convention. In addition to providing the keynote address, Ethan will lead an afternoon workshop on positive rap. The event will also include a listening session led by the Office of the Child Advocate and a youth talent show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: The state’s senior U.S. senator wants federal officials to take more aggressive action to protect beachgoers from wind-swept beach umbrellas. Bob Menendez held a news conference to once again call on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to improve its regulations and develop an aggressive campaign to educate beachgoers on the dangers the umbrellas can pose if they’re not properly staked in the sand. But the Democrat stressed that he wasn’t calling for a ban on umbrellas. A woman was speared in the leg by a beach umbrella last summer in the Jersey Shore community of Seaside Heights. CPSC statistics show that more than 31,000 people were treated at hospitals for umbrella-related injuries from 2008-2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The mother of a Navajo girl who was kidnapped and killed in 2016 urged tribal officials and children’s advocates Tuesday to take advantage of tools and funding under a law that expands access to the nation’s Amber Alert system. Pamela Foster spoke during a training at Isleta Pueblo, south of Albuquerque, for tribes seeking to implement the alert system. Despite a 2007 pilot project, it was not in place on the Navajo Nation when her daughter Ashlynne Mike was abducted near Shiprock. Her disappearance was a catalyst for the state to fully implement Amber Alerts. “I want you to know there was nothing worse than finding out there were no Amber Alert systems on the reservation at the time when we needed it most. No roadway digital signs, no text alerts,” Foster said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State ethics officials are threatening to fine a woman up to $75,000 for unregistered lobbying after she rented billboards to criticize state laws on molestation and share her own story of abuse. Kat Sullivan, a nurse who says she was assaulted by a teacher at a private school upstate two decades ago, was part of the successful push that got lawmakers in Albany to relax the statute of limitations on molestation. Sullivan got the billboard idea from the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” about a woman who used billboards to seek justice for her daughter’s unsolved murder. Sullivan also set up a website and hired a pilot to fly a plane around Albany carrying a banner supporting the legislation. Then she received a letter saying she could be fined for violating a law requiring individuals to register as lobbyists if they spend more than $5,000 on efforts to influence the Legislature.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: Officials are looking for an emu on the loose that was last spotted jumping on the hood of a car before running away. News outlets report that officials say the emu, nicknamed “Eno,” was sighted over the weekend. Orange County Animal Services spokesperson Tenille Fox says it’s believed to be in the Hillsborough area. An Orange County government Twitter account posted an emu’s mugshot Friday with the word “wanted” in red letters. Officials say it’s been on the run for about five weeks. They don’t know where the flightless bird escaped from. Fox says people shouldn’t try to catch it but instead should call animal services. Fox says owning emus is legal in Orange County. She says they’re often kept on farms and don’t usually run away.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landowners group has sued the state over a new law related to compensation for the use of cavities in underground rock formations. The Bismarck Tribune reports the Northwest Landowners Association filed its lawsuit Monday challenging the law that takes effect Thursday. The group says the new law amounts to the unconstitutional taking of private property rights. Gov. Doug Burgum in April signed the legislation that sought to clarify issues surrounding the cavities known as “pore space,” which may be used to inject saltwater from oil and gas production or for enhanced oil recovery. Under the new law, some landowners cannot be compensated for their pore space. Burgum has said the law clarifies legal issues related to underground injection, which should boost the state’s energy industry.\n\nOhio\n\nGarfield Heights: A judge wants to take a second look at a 10-day jail sentence given to a 79-year-old woman for refusing to stop feeding stray cats in her suburban Cleveland neighborhood. Cleveland.com reports that Garfield Heights Municipal Court Judge Jennifer Weiler wants to hear the case herself after a jail sentence handed down to Nancy Segula by a city magistrate last week was widely criticized. Segula acknowledges repeatedly violating a city ordinance making it illegal for people to feed dogs and cats that aren’t their own. She was sentenced to jail after her fourth appearance in court for the violations. She says she lost her husband and her own cats in 2017, and she began feeding the cats because she’s lonely.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWelch: Authorities are starting a new search for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for nearly 20 years. Craig County District Attorney’s spokeswoman Michelle Lowry says the search for Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible is being held near the Picher area, where authorities have said the girls’ bodies are believed to have been dumped. The girls disappeared Dec. 30, 1999, from Freeman’s home in nearby Welch. Freeman’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found fatally shot in the burned home. In April 2018, authorities charged 68-year-old Ronnie Dean Busick with four counts of first-degree murder in the case and said two other suspects are dead. Busick has denied involvement in the case and is undergoing a mental competency evaluation.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A real estate investor has donated undeveloped land to Portland Audubon’s Wildlife Sanctuary. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Marty Kehoe and his family have donated Pittock Place. The 22-acre plot borders Forest Park, a public park west of downtown. Audubon officials say the property is one of the largest, most ecologically valuable parcels on the periphery of the park. The land is worth an estimated $14 million and was slated for development of 32 multimillion-dollar homes. Officials say donors raised $200,000 to pay the property’s remaining mortgage, which was Kehoe’s only stipulation. The City of Portland contributed $350,000 to purchase a conservation easement. The city is also expected to provide $150,000 for restoration services including invasive plant removal and water quality protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvanians who prefer not to be identified as male or female will soon have a gender-neutral option on their state-issued driver’s licenses. The state joins more than 10 others that have rolled out plans to give residents options. The Daily Item of Sunbury reports Pennsylvania Department of Transportation expects to have the new procedure in place by the middle of next year. It will let motorists use “X” as a third option to indicate gender. A department spokeswoman says the agency is able to make the change on its own and doesn’t need authorization from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday that the department made the decision, but it’s consistent with his opinions about equity and fairness.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Providence Teachers Union has declared its commitment to work with the state to reform the city’s schools. The report from the union came less than a week after state Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green was given sweeping authority to turn around Providence Public Schools. The union’s document details several reform recommendations, including addressing chronic teacher absenteeism, increasing the number of educators of color and integrating community members into everyday work at schools. Infante-Green responded to the union in a statement saying she welcomes the commitment from teachers. The Department of Education sought control of Providence schools after a searing report last month from the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy labeled it among the worst public school systems in the nation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLexington: The state Department of Education has been granted $8million to buy new school buses thanks to a settlement involving Volkswagen. State leaders including Gov. Henry McMaster made the announcement Tuesday in Lexington. The money will be used to buy 78 school buses that run on propane. The state has been criticized as having one of the worst school bus fleets in the country. Lawmakers set aside $19 million from lottery profits this year for school buses. Charleston’s transit system received money for two electric buses and charging stations. Anderson received money for a bus fueled by compressed natural gas. South Carolina will receive nearly $34 million from the 2016 emissions settlement the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached with Volkswagen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union is creating a new position in the state focusing on indigenous issues. ACLU director of campaigns Sabrina King says the position will be modeled on the organization’s indigenous justice program in Montana. King will supervise the new South Dakota position. The ACLU has long wanted to build on its work on indigenous issues in the state. The idea took on new urgency after South Dakota this year passed laws aimed at potential Keystone XL protests. The laws allow for tougher penalties for so-called riot boosting, defined in part as encouraging violence during a riot. The ACLU is challenging the law in federal court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is providing access to federal grant programs to help communities and volunteer fire departments become better equipped for wildfires. The state Department of Agriculture will accept applications for Hazard Mitigation Assistance program grants from Aug. 5 through Sept. 20. Eligible communities must have crafted or be in the process of crafting a Community Wildfire Prevention Plan. The grants offer full reimbursement up to $20,000 for communities to implement wildfire prevention efforts and education projects. A program to help fire departments serving 10,000 or fewer people will open Aug. 5 and end Sept. 13. The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program offers 50% reimbursement for wildland fire equipment and supplies from $1,000 to $6,000.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Officials have approved a settlement in a federal lawsuit over the bail system in Harris County that ensures that most people accused of misdemeanor offenses don’t languish in jail. The bail system in the state’s most populous county had been deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge following a 2016 lawsuit alleging poor misdemeanor defendants remained jailed because of their poverty. Harris County commissioners approved the settlement by a 3-2 vote Tuesday, with the two Republicans on the court voting against it. The settlement ensures most people charged with misdemeanor offenses would be released within hours of arrest and would get help to ensure they attend future court appearances. The judge handling the lawsuit could give final approval at an Aug. 21 court hearing.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s decision to award a smaller number of medical marijuana grower licenses than allowed by law is being challenged by six companies that say the state granted licenses to unqualified cultivators and had inappropriate interactions with applicants, among other claims. Chris Hughes, director of the state’s Division of Purchasing, confirmed that six rejected applicants met Friday’s appeal deadline. The administrative appeal could further delay the rollout of medical marijuana for the state because state law says licenses cannot be finalized until protests are resolved. Utah’s Department of Agriculture and Food selected eight companies to grow medical marijuana for its program set to open next year. Although the new law allows Utah to award up to 10 licenses at the start of the program, state officials say they chose to only hand out eight to avoid an oversupply of cannabis.\n\nVermont\n\nCastleton: Castleton University has received accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Learning for the newest extension of its nursing program. The school took over the registered nurse bachelor’s degree program previously offered by Southern Vermont College in Bennington, which closed after the spring semester. The Rutland Herald reports the new program will be in the Vermont Mill Building in Bennington. It used to be home to the radiology and X-ray programs and is being renovated before the fall semester. More than 30 students are enrolled; 25 are from Southern Vermont College. School officials say the nursing shortage is ongoing, and 3,800 nursing positions will be vacant in the next five years. Castleton nursing educators say there’s a plan in the works for a potential master’s program.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A video rental store that is believed to be among the last of its size on the East Coast is set to close this month. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Naro Expanded Video Archival Library in Norfolk will close by the end of August. The store has more than 42,000 video titles and outlasted a vast number of video rental businesses that have already closed across the country. But like them, it fell victim to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Naro Video converted from a business to a nonprofit in 2016 and partially relied on fundraisers. One raised $45,000 from 440 people in less than two days. That likely kept it going for another two years. But such efforts couldn’t provide sustainability over the long term.\n\nWashington\n\nSeatac: Democrats have elected the first female speaker of the state House. With the selection of state Rep. Laurie Jinkins of Tacoma, Washington becomes the eighth state to have a woman in the top spot in the House and is now the second state to have a gay speaker of the House, joining Oregon. “I’m really proud to be the first woman, the first out lesbian serving in this position,” Jenkins said at a news conference after the vote. “I believe very, very strongly that the diversity of our caucus really more and more is representing the diversity of our state and helps us make better decisions for the people of this state. I’m proud to be a part of carrying that forward.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: People recovering from substance abuse disorder can get rides to appointments under a forthcoming project in the area. The Herald-Dispatch reports the Appalachian Regional Commission has provided more than $215,000 for the one-year pilot program. ARC federal co-chair Tim Thomas says it will start in October in the Huntington region. Thomas says those recovering from substance abuse disorder often do not have an active driver’s license or own a vehicle. Rides will be given for recovery and treatment appointments, probation meetings, mandatory court appearances, job interviews or to a new job. Other program sponsors include the Appalachian Transportation Institute, the state Department of Health and Human Resources, the Office of Drug Control Policy and the West Virginia Governor’s Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is pushing to toughen state rules to reduce nitrate contamination in ground and surface water as concerns grow about pollution across the state. Evers announced Wednesday that he is directing the state Department of Natural Resources to establish nitrate performance standards for soil most likely to be contaminated. Environmental group Clean Wisconsin praised the news, saying creating new rules for how nitrates are applied to farm fields is an important step for protecting rural drinking water across the state.

Can it make a comeback ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMarc Rosen didn’t flinch when he was offered the top job at JCPenney last year.\n\nA stalwart of twentieth-century retail for middle-class Americans seeking affordable clothing and home furnishings, JCPenney has struggled for more than a decade and fell into bankruptcy shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBut Rosen, a retail veteran who previously worked at Walmart and Levi’s, said he “did not have any personal hesitancy at all” about trying to revitalize the 120-year-old brand and protect JCPenney from extinction like Barney’s, Lord & Taylor, Century 21 and other shuttered retailers.\n\n“I believe in taking on large scale transformation,” Rosen, 54, told CNN Business in a video interview this month. “There was an opportunity to really take this brand and make it relevant again.”\n\nRosen is staking his turnaround plan on appealing to “America’s diverse working families.”\n\nThe typical customer at JCPenney has a median household income of between $50,000 to $75,000. Roughly 30% of the retailer’s customers are Black, Indigenous and people of color, according to the company, a larger share than many competitors\n\nJCPenney CEO Marc Rosen took over last year. He is trying to regain working-class customers. Amy E. Price/Getty Images for SXSW\n\nSo JCPenney is chasing these shoppers with an overhauled beauty strategy after a long partnership with Sephora ended. It has remodeled stores and added new major brands and private-label clothing and home furnishings’ labels. The company has also improved its technology and online experience to draw more online sales. Just a quarter of JCPenney’s sales are online, trailing rivals.\n\nRosen said customers now are shopping at JCPenney more frequently, the first time that has happened for the brand in years, and it’s regaining market share in key departments such as home goods. (JCPenney does not break out sales publicly.)\n\nBut there are signs of pressure: visits to all JCPenney stores were down 29% as of October from the same time a year ago, according to data from Placer.ai. In October, traffic to JCPenney’s website increased only 1.26% from a year ago, according to data from SimilarWeb.\n\nNow, a year into Rosen’s tenure, he faces his biggest test at JCPenney yet: the holiday shopping stretch. And it comes at an uncertain moment for the US economy and shoppers.\n\nJCPenney faces a critical holiday shopping season. Richard Vogel/AP\n\nThe company said it’s off to a strong start to the holiday season. But JCPenney’s main customers are feeling strained by the highest inflation in 40 years and they have shown signs of pulling back on discretionary goods— the bulk of what JCPenney sells.\n\nRosen also has to dig out from years of mismanagement and failed strategies at the company.\n\nThe company faces unrelenting pressure from much larger retailers such as Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). TJX (TJX), the owner of TJMaxx and Marshalls and other “off-price” retailers that have undercut the department stores’ model by selling designer brands at bargain prices.\n\n“The future is going to be a challenging one because it’s difficult for department stores to navigate, even under the best circumstances,” said Erin Schmidt, a senior analyst at Coresight Research, a retail advisory and research firm. “The competition is really fierce.”\n\nRise and fall\n\nJCPenney started as the Golden Rule, a dry goods store, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, in 1902.\n\nIts founder, James Cash Penney, quickly expanded the business and by 1917, there were 175 stores, later renamed JCPenney. By 1929, on the eve of the stock market crash and Great Depression, JCPenney had 1,000 stores.\n\nIts stores were known for their low prices. Merchandise could be bought only with cash, not on credit.\n\nJCPenney survived the Depression and by 1950, Fortune Magazine declared the company the “King of Soft Goods.” Penney himself became known as the “Man with a Thousand Partners.”\n\nBy the time he died in 1971, JCPenney had more than 1,600 stores, many in newly-built suburban malls, and was the fifth largest US retailer.\n\nBut the company’s mid-market appeal was tested by growing competition during the 1980s and 1990s. Discount stores including Walmart and Target spread, stealing away JCPenney’s budget-conscious customers.\n\nThe company was hit hard by the Great Recession in 2008. It lost shoppers to discount stores and struggled to bring them back as the economy began to rebound.\n\nJCPenney was a retail powerhouse during the twentieth century. But it has struggled for more than a decade. Rick Wilking/Reuters\n\nBy the end of 2010, JCPenney’s sales had fallen 10% from their 2006 high of about $20 billion, and the company attracted the scrutiny of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Ackman bought up a chunk of Penney and installed Ron Johnson, Apple’s former head of stores, as CEO.\n\nWithout testing shoppers’ reactions first, JCPenney under Johnson changed its advertisements, its logo and its store designs.\n\nPeople walk past a JCPenney store at the Queens Center Mall in New York in 2016. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images Businessman James Cash Penney points to a picture of his first store in Kemmerer, Wyoming. JCPenney started in 1902 as a dry-goods store called the Golden Rule Store. At the time, Penney's business practices were revolutionary. He banned haggling, a common practice at the time, to keep prices low. And he encouraged his employees to \"serve the public to its ultimate satisfaction.\" The company changed its name a decade later, opened many more stores and went public in 1929.

And it ended coupons, a move that alienated loyal shoppers.\n\nJCPenney’s sales plunged $4.3 billion in 2012, a 25% drop from the previous year. Johnson left in 2013, 17 months into the job.\n\nThe company cycled through several CEOs and strategies in the following years and brought back appliances for the first time in decades, a move that didn’t resonate with customers. The company was unprofitable every year beginning in 2011 and its sales fell each year starting in 2015.\n\nIn May of 2020, soon after the Covid-19 pandemic began and JCPenney was forced to close stores temporarily, the company filed for bankruptcy after 118 years in business.\n\nAt the time, JCPenney had more than 800 stores and 85,000 employees.\n\nTurning around JCPenney\n\nJCPenney has around 670 stores today and has little debt for the first time in years.\n\nThe company is owned by mall landlords Simon Property Group (SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). The two firms rescued JCPenney out of bankruptcy for $1.75 billion in the fall of 2020. It was their interest to do so. JCPenney was a key tenant at hundreds of malls and a liquidation would have left vacancies in their shopping centers.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy process, JCPenney restructured its debt and closed more than 200 stores.\n\nRosen said JCPenney now has the financial flexibility to invest in upgrading its technology, supply chain and revamping stores under under its new owners.\n\nMall owners Simon and Brookfield bought JCPenney out of bankruptcy. Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n\n“That alignment with ownership is critical, especially as you’re going through a transformation that requires significant investment,” he said.\n\nInstead of chasing new shoppers, as several of Rosen’s predecessors tried to do, he has built a strategy centered on convincing existing budget-focused customers to visit more frequently and buy a wider array of goods at JCPenney instead of other stores.\n\nThe company is attempting to highlight merchandise and services like hair salons and family portrait offerings that resonate with the its core working-class families. Teachers are the number one profession among its customers, so JCPenney has focused on ensuring stores have clothing they want to wear to work.\n\nJCPenney’s 14-year partnership with Sephora ended in 2020 and it has started to replace many Sephora shops with new beauty departments. Roughly 20% of the products in new beauty areas come from a partnership with Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce company that features brands started by founders of color.\n\n“Customers want to see brands that are brought to them by Brown and Black founders, and they want to see brands that look relevant to their skin types,” Rosen said.\n\nRetail experts say that JCPenney is improving under Rosen and his strategy to target different customers than competitors is shrewd. Stores are better lit than they were before the bankruptcy and top vendors are selling merchandise to the company again.\n\n“A lot of people in the industry wrote them off,” said David Katz, chief marketing officer at Randa Apparel & Accessories, which makes Levi’s, Dockers, Haggar and other brands. “Today, they are a good partner. We’re giving them a lot more financial credit than we used to. We are developing more products for them because we have confidence they’ll be able to sell it effectively.”\n\nJCPenney and other department stores have been squeezed by competition in retail. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/ZUMA Press\n\nStill, JCPenney faces both short-term challenges and long-term questions about its survival.\n\nInflation is squeezing customers, particularly its middle-income shoppers. It’s not the only retailer facing that problem – Kohl’s said last week that its middle-income customers are buying fewer items when they shop and switching to private brands.\n\nRosen said that more JCPenney customers are buying the company’s lowest-priced products and switching to its cheaper private brands. The company plans to offer some products at 2019 prices during the holidays, including its St. John’s Bay cable sweater.\n\nThe bigger question remains whether there is a place for JCPenney in the changing era of retail and if it can draw younger customers.\n\nStiff competition has taken a toll on the entire department store landscape, including Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy’s (M).\n\nJCPenney can’t solely rely on winning more business from existing shoppers with limited discretionary ability, said Schmidt from Coresight. The chain needs to attract new shoppers, too. But winning new customers has never been harder.\n\n“They’re doing some really good things in terms of their positioning,” Schmidt said. “But the department store is a tough place to be. It will be a challenging road.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: News and impact on your community", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

He said the guidelines are restrictive, but they must be followed to ensure patrons' safety.\n\n\"I want to be clear: these are important businesses for Burlington,\" Weinberger said. \"They've been an important part of Burlington's economic successes, they're a part of the vibrancy of Burlington.

It greatly decreases the time it takes for them to enter, eliminates the need to remove their mask, and decreases the time they spend in close proximity to our staff, which keeps everyone safer.”\n\n__________\n\nVermont Law School will conduct all of its fall 2020 classes online, according to a news release Monday.\n\nNo on-campus residential courses will offered during the semester, and all on-campus classes will be held virtually in a series of live sessions.\n\n\"We strive to provide a consistent educational experience for all of our students while being sensitive to our community's safety and security,\" said Thomas McHenry, president and dean of Vermont Law School.\n\n\"We want to provide as much notice to our students, facility, and staff, in order to plan appropriately and deliver the high-quality course content and access to faculty that VLS is known for.\"\n\n__________\n\nSunday, June 28, 2020\n\nTwo new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont as of noon on Sunday, bringing the total number of positive cases to 1,202, according to Health Department data.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized with COVID-19, while 13 people are hospitalized and under investigation for the virus.

Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release.

Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

(Tuesday, June 7, 2022) — Summer must be on the way! School is out, temperatures are quickly climbing, and a popular promotion has returned to Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country. During Sevier County Days, anyone who lives or works in Sevier County can visit their favorite hometown theme park or water park for just $5, while also helping their neighbors at the same time.\n\nSevier County Days takes place June 13-19 at Dollywood theme park and now-June 12 at Dollywood’s Splash Country water park. Residents and workers in the county can visit the award-winning parks for a $5 donation to Sevier County Food Ministries. All proceeds from the visits go to the food ministries, helping the non-profit provide support within the community.\n\n“We are always proud to partner with Jim Davis and his phenomenal staff at Sevier County Food Ministries,” said Carol Agee, Dollywood Community Affairs and Philanthropy Manager. “As kids are now out of school for summer, demand for the food ministries increases because those school lunches aren’t available for families who need them. We encourage families in that situation to visit the food ministry because the team there does an exemplary job of assisting those in the community who need it. We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth. Those who work in Sevier County but are not residents must present proof of employment as well as a state- or federally-issued photo identification matching the paycheck stub. Full details and eligible zip codes also are available by visiting Dollywood.com/SevierCountyDays.\n\nAs an added bonus for making the donation to the food ministries, the Sevier County Days ticket receives full upgrade value toward the purchase of a 2022 season pass.\n\nDollywood first started giving to Sevier County Food Ministries in 1998. Since that time, total contributions to the food ministry are more than $1.4 million. In addition to monetary support, Sevier County Food Ministries always accepts passionate volunteers ready to serve others through their efforts. For more information about how to volunteer, please visit seviercountyfoodministries.org.\n\nDollywood celebrates a year full of exceptional experiences, with each season unlike the next.

YWCA’s Phyllis Wheatley Center serves hundreds of middle and high school youth through innovative, life-changing after-school and summer programs.\n\n“The students we serve are among Knoxville’s most vulnerable and are oftentimes low-income and at high risk for dropping out of school,” said Rachel Haverkamp, CEO of YWCA Knoxville & the Tennessee Valley. “Access to the internet creates opportunities for educational success and a chance to improve our neighborhoods and communities. Our organization will use the hotspots to support on-site programming, create opportunities for off-site learning and exploration and support students’ independent and group work at home.”\n\nHotspots are stand-alone Wi-Fi networks that can connect several devices at once wirelessly and have proven to be a vital tool for youth to access the internet, study and complete homework.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

(May 24, 2022) – Today, Anakeesta announced a brand-new, nighttime immersive experience with Canadian-based multimedia entertainment studio, Moment Factory. The Lumina Night Walk will be the first of its kind in the United States. The stellar journey of discovery will offer the City of Gatlinburg a new nighttime offering unlike anything else in the country. Anakeesta guests will embark on a journey to discover the illuminating wonder of the stars and connect to an imaginative world through the magic of projections, lighting, and music.\n\n“As one of Tennessee’s premier destinations, we strive to bring innovative adventures to our guests and we are thrilled to introduce an incomparable nighttime experience to the country,” said Bob Bentz, Founder and Managing Partner of Anakeesta. “Families and guests of all ages will be captivated by the spectacular state-of-the-art special effects, enchanting storytelling, and more surprises.”\n\nAnakeesta will transform an undeveloped section of the 80+ acre park into an outdoor, multimedia world that awakens the imagination as described by the creative production studio.\n\nMoment Factory’s award-winning experiences are internationally known and have been\n\ncommissioned by organizations such as the Singapore Zoo with Rainforest Lumina and the town of Whistler, Canada with Vallea Lumina.\n\n“We are excited to collaborate with Anakeesta, this momentous partnership marks the first Lumina Enchanted Night Walk in the United States and the 15th of an international series,” said Jonathan St-Onge, General Manager of Moment Factory. “Our unique moments of wonder inspire visitors to experience the outdoors like never before.

We hope this fantastical outdoor adventure sparks a new interest in Tennessee for visitors.”\n\n“Anakeesta’s continued investment with the Lumina Night Walk will give Gatlinburg visitors an exciting and innovative entertainment option in the evening,” said Mayor Mike Werner of Gatlinburg. “This experience will continue to add to the many reasons that visitors will have to choose Gatlinburg as their vacation destination.”\n\nG", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/archives/2006/09/14/18651881/75721668/", "title": "1865-1881", "text": "Daily Record\n\nYorkDailyRecord\n\nJan 25, 2005 —\n\n1865: York\n\nOrphanage established\n\nThe York community's most prominent citizens create the Children's Home of York to house and train orphans of Civil War soldiers. Two years later, they build a four-story red brick building on the corner of East Philadelphia and Pine streets. This building would serve as home for more than 3,000 orphans and children from broken homes until its demolition in 1973. Other youngsters under the Children's Home care are farmed out to county families. Young residents at the home spend decades living within its walls, except for walking in groups to Sunday school. They live highly structured lives in frugal surroundings, leaving little room for individuality. In the minds of those running the home, such institutional life works. By the turn of the century, the home has cared for 550 children and \"only 30 of them have not done us credit,\" the board reported. Facing the loss of state aid, the home ended a restriction in its charter that prohibited admission of blacks in 1959. For decades in the 20th century, Mr. and Mrs. Percy B. Cooper served as superintendents. \"They all come back home to see what's going on,\" Mrs. Cooper commented in 1948. \"They're just like our own children.\"\n\n1866: York\n\nFarmers Market opens doors\n\nThe Farmers Market opens on West Market Street. The location points to sufficient population growth on the west side of the Codorus to support a large indoor market, York's first. Today, Farmers Market is a key piece in a city plan to turn West Market into an antiques district. It is one of the York area's three operating markets. The Central Market in York and the New Eastern Market in Springettsbury Township are the other two. The City Market house, constructed in 1878, was torn down in 1963. A market in West York has been converted to other uses. Colebrook-Terry used the building at West Philadelphia Street and Carlisle Avenue as a sewing factory until recently.\n\n1867: Minneapolis\n\nPhotographer, ex-slave settles\n\nWilliam Goodridge, the ex-slave who became a prominent York businessman, is settled in Minneapolis, where he dies in 1873. Glenalvin, William's eldest son, dies there in 1867. The Goodridge sons, Wallace and William, and other family members live in Saginaw, Mich. There, they carry on William's business and photographic legacy. By the time Wallace dies in 1922, the three brothers have become part of a small group of black men to pioneer as professional photographers in America. One scholar said their \"work was most definitely in the mainstream of the development of photography as a profession and as an art form in the nineteenth century.\"\n\n1867: York\n\nSmall beats Small in vote\n\nDavid Small squares off against David Small in the election for York's chief burgess. David Small wins. The winner is the Democratic incumbent who owns The York Gazette. David Etter Small, the Republican railroad car manufacturer, finishes 317 votes short. While often confused today, people in York could tell these two members of the prominent 19th-century York family apart. An industrial accident claimed David E. Small's right arm in 1853. This cost him a much-desired opportunity to fight for the Union Army. \"If I can bring down a partridge with my gun,\" he said, \"I certainly can shoot well enough to go to the defence of my country.\"\n\n1867: Goldsboro\n\nPrizefight disrupts area\n\nSamuel Collyer of Baltimore and John McGlade of New York, accompanied by several hundred \"roughs,\" duke it out in a field near Goldsboro. York County's sheriff and a posse try to break up the prizefight, but the bullies accompanying the fighters keep them at bay. Collyer wins the one-hour, 47-round fight and $2,000. The Baltimore contingent carries home a reported $200,000 in wagers. The visitors perpetrate various outrages on passengers and those at the stations on their train rides home. \"It was a disgraceful and demoralizing affair,\" one historian commented. A newspaper concurred: \"The whole affair happening under the nose of two governments, within a few miles of the state capital, was one of the most disgraceful in the history of this Commonwealth.\" Goldsboro does not see such excitement again until the accident at the neighboring Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979. Some residents evacuated town while national media descended on Goldsboro to cover the event.\n\n1867: Dallastown\n\nAyres family faces tragedy\n\nLong before young Jessica McClure was dramatically rescued from a Texas well in the 1980s, heroic York County diggers work to uncover 18-year-old Smith Ayres from a collapsed well. Ayres descends 60 feet into a Dallastown well to retrieve a bucket. On his way up, the walls caves in, and he cries, \"For God's sake, take me out.\" Workers construct a frame to guard themselves against harm. After 26 hours, the diggers reach the youth's lifeless body. It is thought the rope bearing Ayres caught a stone in the wall about 20 feet from the bottom. Just a few years earlier, the Ayres family suffered through another distressing event: Samuel, Smith's father, died in a Confederate Civil War prison.\n\n1868: Hanover\n\nGrant makes side trip\n\nNewly elected President U.S. Grant stops in Hanover on his way to his first Gettysburg visit. A defective locomotive causes the unscheduled stop. Grant makes a few remarks to an audience, largely praising the performance of Union commanders in the Battle of Gettysburg. Gen. George Meade directed Union troops at Gettysburg, while Grant was negotiating the surrender of Vicksburg in Mississippi. Grant later became Meade's boss as military commander of all Union troops.\n\n1868: Wrightsville\n\nBridge makes comeback\n\nThe third Wrightsville bridge over the Susquehanna River opens to rail, wagon and pedestrian traffic. The span replaces the structure burned to keep the Confederate Army from crossing. County residents have depended on ferry service to make connections with points east in the five years since the bridge burned. Two iron spans connect in the middle to prevent any future fire from devastating the entire bridge.\n\n1869: Washington, D.C.\n\nYork man caught in Booth scheme\n\nThe government grants a York native a pardon after he serves about four years of hard labor in Florida's Fort Jefferson for a role in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Actor John Wilkes Booth asked Ned Spangler, an acquaintance and stagehand at Ford's Theatre, to hold his horse for a few minutes. \"Booth had failed to mention to him that he intended to shoot President Abraham Lincoln, a fact Spangler found difficult to prove to a jury,\" a newspaper reported many years later. Spangler, a 40-year-old descendant of Baltzer Spangler, one of York's fathers, probably knew Booth since 1853. Booth came to York to attend a local academy. Spangler, a carpenter, helped build a house for the Booth family in Maryland. Spangler unsuccessfully argued that he arranged for another person to hold Booth's horse because his duties as a scene changer required his attention inside. After leaving prison, Spangler lives out the remaining six years of his life in the Maryland home of Dr. Samuel Mudd. Mudd was implicated in the conspiracy for treating Booth. He meets Spangler in prison. Nettie Mudd, Samuel's wife, describes Ned Spangler: \"His greatest pleasure seemed to be found in extended kindness to others and particularly children, of whom he was very fond.\" Today, part of an exhibit at Ford's Theatre is devoted to Ned Spangler, listed as Edman Spangler.\n\n1869: Franklintown\n\nTown aims for national fame\n\nFranklintown, located along the Harrisburg to Baltimore pike, incorporates. This sleepy borough is sometimes called Buttstown after one of the town's founders. Martin Carl, father of future two-time York Burgess Jere Carl, buys a mercantile business and establishes a post office. In recent times, the borough spent time in the national spotlight by passing an ordinance requiring residents to own firearms. The unenforced ordinance came on the heels of the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, as council sought to uphold the right to bear arms. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's one of those things that somebody thought was a good idea at the time,\" Frankintown Council President Marvin J. Wilson said in 1993. Wilson did not see a practical purpose for the law.\n\n1870: York\n\nGraduates make good\n\nWilliam H. Shelley, a former student and teacher at York County Academy, is the first principal at the newly founded York High. Flora B. Hays and Edward B. Stair, members of the first graduating class in 1872, make long-term community contributions. Hays later teaches in York public schools, and Stair becomes an executive at Farmers National Bank. Mary Kell, one of four original faculty members, teaches in York schools until 1904. The high school moves to a new building on West Philadelphia Street in 1872. The original building still stands on South Duke Street, outliving its successor, a victim of a fire in 1942.\n\n1870: York\n\nPaper changes over years\n\nThe York Daily, the county's first daily newspaper, starts publication. The Daily attempts to steer a middle ground between the Republicans and Democrats, a change from the usual partisan approach to producing a local newspaper. The Daily does not have the staying power of The York Dispatch and The York Gazette, later its daily competitors. The Dispatch purchased The Daily in 1904. The Gazette bought the newspaper from its competitor, The Dispatch, in 1918 and became known as The York Gazette and Daily. The Daily's name re-emerged in 1970, when new owners of the former York Gazette named their paper, the York Daily Record. The Record came from the York Legal Record, previously published by The York Gazette and still in operation today.\n\n1871: Railroad\n\nTown named appropriately\n\nRailroad, whose name matches its primary reason for existence, is formed. The borough serves many years before and after its incorporation as a depot for Shrewsbury on the Northern Central Railroad. It boasts industries of its own, including a tannery, grist mill, brewery, brandy distillery and a furniture company. Frederick Helb, the borough's first chief burgess, is a force behind several of these interests. The Helb name is particularly connected with brewing and bottling. Theodore, Helb's son, operated the domed Keystone Brewery in York, the county's best-known brewery. At the turn of the century, the six-story-high brewery shipped its product across the nation. Prohibition closed the Helb brewery. It re-opened in 1933 and closed in 1950. The massive structure at the corner of Queen and King streets was demolished in 1952. Back in Railroad, Helb's death in 1905 and the decline of the railroad turns the town into a sleepy roadside community. Today, the York County Heritage Rail/Trail has sparked new service-oriented business interests.\n\n1872: Hanover\n\nSquare sees changes\n\nOfficials order a makeover for the center of Hanover's Center Square several times over the years. The 60-year-old market sheds in the square, scene of heavy fighting in the Battle of Hanover, are torn down to make way for a fountain in 1872. The fountain was moved to Wirt Park in 1904 to make way for The Picket, a statue honoring HanoverÕs war dead. The fountain eventually was sold to a Florida resort. The Picket was unveiled with fanfare and visits from Gov. Samuel W. Pennypacker and Battle of Hanover survivors in 1905. The bronze equestrian statue was moved from the middle of the square to its northeast part in 1968. There, the mounted soldier sits today, accompanied by Iron Mike, the statue of the dog that has accompanied The Picket since the 1950s. In the 1990s, Hanover officials attempted to lighten the traffic load in the square through development of Eisenhower Drive.\n\n1873: York\n\nSmall start for college\n\nSamuel Small, the S. Small in merchant P.A. and S. Small, helps found York Collegiate Institute. The school moves into new quarters in 1887 after a fire destroyed its building two years before. It joins with the York County Academy in a reciprocal teaching agreement in 1929. The two institutions evolve into York Junior College in 1941 and close their doors to secondary education seven years later. With the growth of public secondary education across the United States, the two private schools follow the path of many others by converting into a post-secondary institution. In 1959, York College starts calling a site along County Club Road, its present location, home. The golf course of the Out Door Country Club previously occupied the site. With the introduction of bachelor degree programs, the college becomes known as York College of Pennsylvania in 1968. Today, national college-rating publications regularly list York College as one of the best values and most efficiently operated liberal arts schools in the north.\n\n1874: Red Lion\n\nRailroad starts for long haul\n\nThe Peach Bottom Railway opens between York and Red Lion. The rail line runs to Delta two years later. The narrow-gauge railway hauls slate from Delta and cigars and furniture from factories along its right of way. In 1901, the now-York Southern Railroad merged with Baltimore and Lehigh Railway to become known as the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad. The \"Ma and Pa\" followed winding Muddy Creek, making the route 77.2 miles. The distance between York and Baltimore is 49 miles. The railroad serviced southeastern York County for 80 years before freight service was suspended in 1954 and passenger service soon thereafter. Emons Transportation Group of York later absorbed the Ma and Pa. The railroad's buildings still stand in Muddy Creek Forks. The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad Preservation Society purchased 31 acres of the village that grew up around the railroad complex in Muddy Creek Forks in 1992. Since then, the 100-plus members have been converting it into a living-history museum. The site includes the turn-of-the-century Alexander M. Grove store, roller mills and grain elevator and scale house.\n\n1874: York\n\nFighting more than fire\n\nCompetitiveness among York's fire departments flares one evening. Laurel and Vigilant firefighters end up in a fracas after responding to a fire in George Hay's pig pen. Laurel firefighters believe they are sprayed intentionally with water from the Vigilant's steamer. Firefighters from both departments square off, mixing Hay and a police officer named \"Selack\" into their fight. The firefighters spray water, throw stones and use a discarded table leg as a club. Henry Brown, one of the fighting firefighters, is treated for a gash in his forehead. An account of the melee in a city fire department history ends: \"The origin of the fire in the straw is not known.\"\n\n1874: York\n\nYork Int'l elects its first president\n\nS. Morgan Smith is elected president at the first stockholders meeting of York Manufacturing Company, future York International. The company initially makes washing machines, but it soon produces ice-making machines and later air conditioning equipment. The scope of the company's products has grown. One of York International's recent projects was chilling the Chunnel -- the English Channel Tunnel. Smith, pastor of York's First Moravian Church from 1861-66, leaves York Manufacturing in 1880 and later forms S. Morgan Smith Company. Waterwheels, an early company product, gave way to massive turbines sold around the world. Allis-Chalmers acquired Smith in 1959. Today, two companies are heirs to Smith. Voith Hydro continues to make hydraulic turbines. Precision Components fabricates vessels to contain and ship radioactive material and chemical weapons.\n\nc. 1875: Hanover Junction\n\nIce cream a major industry\n\nCornelius Gladfelter builds an ice cream plant in Hanover Junction, one of several in the vicinity. Gladfelter and other ice cream makers dam up creeks and harvest blocks of ice from the resulting pond in the winter. If the ice house is close enough to a creek, the ice is floated inside. Sawdust and leaves are placed between blocks, insulating the ice so it wonÕt melt during the summer. Area dairy farmers supply milk to the ice cream makers, who ship their product in tubs covered with ice on the Northern Central Railroad to Baltimore. Many ice cream makers set up parlors to sell their wares to local folks.\n\n1875: York\n\nFiremen lose a link to past\n\nMichael Edwards Sr., a member of YorkÕs Laurel Fire Company since its birth in 1790, dies at the age of 108. \"He was the representative fireman of the past,\" a fire department history states, \"the connecting link between the fire department of ladders, bucket, basket and hand engine brigade, and the firemen and their apparatus today.\" Many people at the funeral comment that it is unusual to see four sons as old as Edwards' at a funeral. The ages ranged from more than 50 years in age to 70 years-plus.\n\n1875: Red Lion\n\nRed Lion woman prospers\n\nYears before women are granted the right to vote, a Red Lion woman becomes widely respected for her ability to get things done. Catherine Meyer builds a general store, saloon, post office and railroad station in 1875, 10 years after her husband died. The \"Mother of Red Lion\" plays a part in her town's incorporation as a borough, although she is not eligible to vote or hold public office. The Red Lion Cemetery and Fairmount Park, sitting on some of the highest populated ground in the county, are located on former Meyer land. \"For nearly half a century she was the leading business spirit of the prosperous cigar manufacturing center (Red Lion),\" a newspaper said in 1914, five years before Meyer's death. \"Businessmen of York and the county recognized her ability and esteemed her for the unalterable integrity, the good sense and judgment she showed in all transactions.\"\n\n1876: York\n\nDispatch starts as a weekly\n\nHiram Young, owner of the weekly True Democrat, starts a daily newspaper, The York Dispatch. Young arrived in York about 12 years before and started publishing his weekly. The York Dispatch follows its weekly predecessor by aligning itself with Republican politics for about 115 years.\n\n1876: York\n\nYork celebrates U.S. centennial\n\nYork begins a day-long celebration of the nation's centennial. Festivities begin at 12:01 a.m. on July 4, when the bells in the borough ring in chorus for an hour. Festivities end with an 8:30 p.m. fireworks show that causes one York resident to observe: \"That evening excelled anything attempted before in the history of York when it comes to celebrations.\" Henry Lee Fisher writes a 100-stanza poem about county life to commemorate the event. He writes in German, and York resident Henry Barratt liberally illustrates the work. It is dedicated, \"To the honest, virtuous, intelligent and patriotic Pennsylvania Germans this humble effort to illustrate their manners, customs and general mode of life in their own dialect, is respectfully inscribed by the author.\"\n\n1877: York County\n\nCounty spared epidemics\n\nCounty residents enjoyed good health the past few years and have remained \"remarkably free\" from epidemics. The York County Medical Society reports common diseases are pleurisy, pneumonia, rheumatism and typhoid fever. \"The people are industrious, intelligent, healthy and temperate and generally live to a ripe old age,\" the 4-year-old society said.\n\n1877: York\n\nSynagogue lays its foundation\n\nA new Hebrew Reformed congregation meets in homes and rented quarters for 30 years before a cornerstone for a building is laid at the corner of South Beaver Street and Newton Avenue in 1906. Rabbis William Roseman of Baltimore and J. Rosenthal of Lancaster officiate in a ceremony attended by the congregation and a large number of people from gentile congregations in the community. The congregation, known as Temple Beth Israel today, worships in Spring Garden Township. Leopold Rosenbaum, Joseph Lustic and Ivan Trattner organize an Orthodox Jewish congregation in 1883. The present-day Ohev Sholom (Lovers of Peace) congregation evolved from this York congregation. The congregation built a house of worship at the corner of West Princess and South Water (Pershing) streets in 1904. The congregation meets today in a synagogue in Spring Garden Township. The Young Men's Hebrew Association, a social and cultural organization, formed in 1910. The organization incorporated as the Jewish Community Center in 1925. Today, it serves people of all ages and faiths.\n\n1878: York\n\nFarmers markets move indoors\n\nConstruction begins on the York City Market, for years one of the largest covered markets in Pennsylvania. The market, sporting a Gothic design, features a 140-foot-high tower. This indoor marketplace, as well as the Penn Street Farmers Market built in 1866, helps replace the open air Centre Square market sheds as the place for farmers to turn their excess goods into cash. The new market house, located at South Duke Street and East College Avenue, also serves as an exhibition center. York school students and Gov. Henry M. Hoyt attend a county Horticultural and Industrial Association exhibition in 1879. The City Market was demolished in 1963 to make way for a gas station.\n\n1878: York\n\nFire companies built in city\n\nThe Laurel Fire Co. completes a station at the northeast corner of East King and South Duke streets in York. The Rex Hook and Ladder Co. constructs its station next door 10 years later. The buildings house the fire companies to this day. The Rex forms, in part, because some believe that a section of the York Collegiate Institute could have been saved if the borough had a hook and ladder truck to fight the fire. The institute was destroyed by fire in 1885. \"Spectamur Agendo\" appears above the Laurel's bay door, meaning, \"Let us be judged by our actions.\"\n\n1879: West Manchester Township\n\nTeachers set robust agenda\n\nThe topics on the program of the township Teachers Institute could have been on a 20th-century teachers' meeting agenda. They include: a morning-long discussion of school discipline; an afternoon session on how to teach reading; and an evening discussion on the relationship between parent and teacher. The institute urges all township teachers to attend the important meeting.\n\n1879: Hanover\n\nFirefighters mull equipment\n\nThe Hanover Fire Department debates whether to purchase an engine that deploys water or a chemical to extinguish flames. Chemical fire engines are coming into use because they require no water source and can be deployed more quickly because no hydrant hookup is necessary. Chemicals also minimize damage to property compared to water. Firefighters agree on one thing: a new \"fire extinguishing apparatus\" is needed.\n\n1879: Lancaster County\n\nMarietta girl's honor is saved\n\nSamuel Sprenkle of York tries to entice a Marietta girl to York under the pretext of doing housework. Townspeople discover that he actually wants her to work in a house of ill repute. Concerned citizens accost the man on his way to the train with the girl and tell him to get out of town. Sprenkle reaches into his pocket as if to pull a revolver but is advised he should leave town before he is arrested. He jumps on the train and quickly departs. A Marietta newspaper advises Sprenkle to make himself scarce or \"he may have a wooden, legless horse to ride, and tight-fitting black coat of tar and feathers to wear.\"\n\n1880: York\n\nPopulation booms in city\n\nBeginning this decade, York kicks off 50 years of population growth that causes the census to climb from 13, 940 in 1880 to 55, 254 in 1930. The newcomers arrive from cities and the South and include many blacks and people of foreign origin seeking employment in factories. York gains unprecedented racial diversity.\n\n1880: York\n\nSmall opens early hospital\n\nSamuel Small, founder of York Collegiate Institute, doesn't stop there. He provides the force behind organization of York Hospital and Dispensary, one of the first 200 hospitals in the United States. Small purchases a piece of property on West College Avenue and spearheads a $70, 000 fund drive to construct the building still standing on the banks of the Codorus Creek. The building is occupied in the spring of 1881. The cost to patients: board, fuel and light, $4 to $6 per week; add washing, $1; add nurse's services, $3. With a common founder, these two key county institutions forge a working relationship, which continues to this day.\n\n1881: York County\n\nHistorian Gibson becomes judge\n\nCounty voters elect John Gibson as judge to replace his uncle, Robert J. Fisher. Fisher, dominant force on the county judicial scene for the past 30 years, chooses not to seek re-election. Mary L. Fisher, the judge's wife, gaines prominence, too. She writes widely about her experiences nursing wounded soldiers during the Civil War. Gibson is best remembered today for his historical work as the author of an extensive county history, published in 1886.\n\n1881: York\n\nOpera house is a smash\n\nJohn Sleeper Clarke, brother-in-law of Edwin Booth, stars in the opening act of the York Opera House. Booth stars in \"Toodles\" and \"The Widow Hunt.\" \"The large and fashionable audience present was delighted with the performance,\" a newspaper reported. Before its opening, friends and opponents spar over the appropriateness of entertainment the opera house would bring to the community. Opponents also fight the decision to hold a York High School commencement in the new theater. As the years passed, opposition cooled. The annual meeting of county teachers and evangelistic meetings of Dwight Moody and Ira Sankey used the facility.\n\n1881: York County\n\nSaying good-bye to Garfield\n\nAbout 50 children, carrying bouquets and baskets of flowers, march in twos to the Northern Central Railroad tracks in York. They join an estimated 6, 000 others to observe the passing of the train bearing the body of assassinated U. S. President James A. Garfield. \"Lest the gesture of standing in silence with bared heads should seem too meagre in its expression of bereavement such as this, billows of flowers had been strewn between the tracks and floral wreaths were brought to be tossed aboard the coaches,\" a newspaper later reported. Chauncey F. Black is prepared to use his new telephone from his home near the track to alert townspeople of the approaching train. The message would be delivered to courthouse custodian John D. Gallatin, who would ring the county building's bell as a signal. The train passes through, and the crowd then gathers up the flowers and coins placed on the rail, now flattened souvenirs. ÒThat was York's goodby (sic) to James A. Garfield, the second of the nation's martyred presidents,\" the newspaper said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2006/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/05/pisgah-national-forest-twelve-mile-timber-sale-open-public-comment/1807622001/", "title": "Pisgah National Forest Twelve Mile Timber sale open to public ...", "text": "HARMON DEN - The elk's ears must have been burning. Since they were being openly talked about mere feet away while munching their breakfast.\n\nA group of men and women in important-looking uniforms stood beneath the dense canopy of Pisgah National Forest near the Pigeon River Gorge, discussing how cutting down trees and setting prescribed fires would open up better foraging habitat for Western North Carolina's growing elk herd.\n\nWhen mid-sentence, two cow elk sauntered nearby, stopped for a distant peek through the trees at the humans, then disappeared deep into the forest.\n\nIt was a special sighting for members of the U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, wildlife conservation groups and media who had come to inspect some of the proposed sites for the Twelve Mile Project, a landscape improvement and timber plan.\n\nBut it was also a perfect example of the need for the project, considered to be one of the largest single timber projects in the history of the more than 100-year-old Pisgah National Forest.\n\n\"It’s pretty amazing. To see them moving across the landscape is a really unique opportunity,\" said Tara Anderson, wildlife biologist for the Forest Service's Pisgah Zone, in almost a whisper, so as not to disturb the cows.\n\nElk, which look sort of like very large deer and grow to several hundred pounds, are native to the Southern Appalachians but were extirpated by over-hunting more than 200 years ago.\n\nA small herd was reintroduced to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 2001 and another in 2002. The herd now numbers roughly 150 animals.\n\n\"One of the emphases of this project is to enhance habitat for wildlife, including elk, because we know they’re already nearby and utilizing the habitat. But we can enhance that habitat so they can continue to persist and expand their range,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"By opening up the canopy that allows sunlight to reach the forest floor that enhances the growth of grass and herbaceous forest and under-story, and provides better forage for them.\"\n\nThe 222-page draft environmental assessment for the Twelve Mile Project was released July 24, and is open for a 30-day public comment period, ending Aug. 23.\n\nRELATED: Forest Service holds meeting on new elk habitat\n\nThe draft shows that a roughly 18,000-acre area in the Twelve Mile area - so named because it borders 12 miles of I-40 in the Pigeon River Gorge Gorge, is aimed at maintaining a resilient and diverse forest that supports wildlife, provides a sustainable source of timber, improves water quality and aquatic habitat and improves access to the forest, said Appalachian District Ranger Richard Thornburgh.\n\nAs part of the required procedure under the National Environmental Policy Act for a proposed timber sale on federal land, the Forest Service draft environmental assessment lays out different options on which people can give their opinion. These include Alternative A, the “no action” option, and the Forest Service’s preferred alternative, B, or “action alternative.”\n\nThe comments received on the draft environmental assessment will be used to determine whether the Forest Service needs to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact, and proceed with the timber project.\n\nRare, widespread agreement on forest landscape management\n\nThe project began with public meetings in 2016, said Jason Herron, environmental coordinator with the U.S. Forest Service’s Pisgah Zone, which encompasses the Pisgah, Grandfather and Appalachian districts.\n\n“We tried to get a bunch of different interests involved in the project early on,” said Herron, who estimates between online comments and public meetings, the Forest Service received about 20 comments during the scoping period.\n\n“We heard about creating elk habitat, golden winged warbler habitat, ecological restoration as it relates to natural range of variation and departure modeling, increasing diversity in species in stands that are homogenous maybe due to past management, aquatic organism passage and the need for old growth and need for young forest,” he said.\n\nBased on those comments, some changes were made to the original plan, such as dropping plans to open up the forest in old growth areas, and forest planners added a couple of units specific for golden winged warbler, an endangered species.\n\nThat upfront collaboration with many varied interests, from hunting and fishing groups to mountain bikers, hikers, horseback riders, wood products industry and government agencies, has led to something rather unusual when it comes to landscape management – collective agreement on all sides.\n\nStanding in an area logged for two-age regeneration two years ago, where sunlight was beaming to the forest floor, nourishing grasses, and uncut hickories, oaks and maples dotted the forest, Josh Kelly, public lands biologist with the Asheville-based environmental nonprofit MountainTrue, said he was happy to support the Forest Service alternative for the Twelve Mile Project.\n\n“We can meet the need for young forest wildlife habit and scrub and shrub wildlife habitat, and meet the needs of the local timber industry, without damaging the values that some people hold dear like natural areas or mature forest or roadless areas,” Kelly said.\n\nThe plan calls for adding less than 1 mile of new temporary road for logging operations, while using about 8 miles of existing roads to log on 1,356 acres.\n\n“This is one of the largest habitat improvement projects I’m aware of in the history of Pisgah National Forest. It’s great to see that when the effort is made to understand people’s needs and values that we can all have everything that we need and want out of the forest.”\n\nSam Evans, national forests and park program leader with the Southern Environmental Law Center, based in Asheville, said the group has been involved in the Twelve Mile Project since the beginning.\n\n“We’re comfortable that the project is in a good place,” Evans said. “It doesn’t unnecessarily impact natural values, it designates a lot of areas of old growth, and it speaks to the willingness of the project developers to be responsive to the public.”\n\nWhat will happen in the Twelve Mile Project?\n\nThe Twelve Mile Project is not just a timber sale, but aims to address change in the forest needed to meet the Forest Service’s mission of sustaining the health, diversity, and productivity of the forest to meet the needs of current and future generations, Thornburgh said.\n\nThis includes everything from better foraging habitat for a multitude of wildlife, from elk to deer, bear, grouse, turkey and game and non-game birds, as well as aquatic life, and recreation for humans, including horseback riding, hiking and hunting.\n\nThe draft environmental assessment goes into great detail regarding each of these needs, proposed activities necessary to achieve these goals, and the impacts of the proposed activities.\n\nSome of the Twelve Mile Project proposed actions are to:\n\nDesignate 1,570 acres of small patch old growth.\n\nUse commercial and non-commercial timber harvest techniques on 1,356 acres to promote the growth of young trees, increase the diversity of forest structure and age classes, improve wildlife habitat, and regenerate oaks.\n\nConduct prescribed burns across 1,342 acres to promote fire-adapted plant communities and create and maintain open forest conditions.\n\nImprove the composition, structure, condition, health, and growth of 649 acres of young forest stands by removing competing vegetation.\n\nIncrease open forest conditions on 498 acres of woodlands.\n\nThin 327 acres of forest to improve growth and enhance forest health.\n\nCreate or maintain 136 acres of wildlife openings to provide important feeding areas for a variety of wildlife.\n\nImprove 14 stream crossings to restore aquatic organism passages where roads cross streams.\n\nEnhance .66 miles of streams by improving aquatic habitat diversity and stabilizing streambanks to prevent erosion.\n\nThe media tour included a visit to some of the areas that would be harvested, including along Cold Springs Road, which leads to Max Patch.\n\nMost of the proposed logging – 1,027 acres – will be a two-aged regeneration harvest, Herron said. It will not be done in one “clump,” but in compartments across the 18,000-acre project area, creating what he calls “a mosaic on the landscape,” or a sort of patchwork quilt of different aged trees and vegetation, open and closed canopies, to provide different types of habitat.\n\nRELATED: Forest Service proposes Buck Creek Timber sale in Nantahala National Forest\n\nTwo-aged regeneration harvest is the removal of trees intended to assist regeneration of trees already present or make regeneration possible, and create trees of basically, two different ages. A large focus is regenerating oaks, a keystone species in the forest that provides acorns, a food source for many wildlife.\n\nHe said residual trees will be left – healthier, longer-lived trees - so they will exist into the future stands, and also keep the scenic beauty of the forest intact.\n\n“We have leave (residual) tree specifications to meet visual quality objectives. We might leave more trees in an area if you can see it from the Appalachian Trail or the Blue Ridge Parkway.”\n\n“Many wildlife species use a diversity of forest age classes. Every species has a home range. As a human, it’s where you wake up in morning, and go to the grocery store,” said Chris Coxen, North Carolina district biologist with the National Wild Turkey Federation.\n\n“Having a representation of all the things a species might need that’s available to it on landscape is important. I think that’s really good in this project area. It’s a great representation of trying to accommodate all those needs for those species,” he said.\n\nJonathon McCall, Southern Mountains Wildlife Forester with the wildlife commission, said the drive to get back to mature habitat after the forests were systematically clearcut in the late 1800s and early 20th century, younger habitats have been left behind.\n\n“We’ve left behind that 0-10-year old group of trees, that really young forest. A lot of species are now in decline because they no longer have what they need, like grouse. They need those young forests,” McCall said.\n\nPart of the Twelve Mile Project will also include permanent wildlife fields, which means removing stumps after logging so that they don’t regenerate, and seeding the fields with vegetation grouse, turkey, elk and deer like.\n\n“We like to see those fields maintained, but we also like to see the harvest because they provide that early successional habitat that is going to grow up and become mature. Some birds need old growth, but don’t spend their whole life there,” McCall said.\n\n“They come out and want younger habitat as well. We need different habitats close to each other so animals can move between them. They’re like us, they don’t get everything in one spot.”\n\nKim Delozier, conservation program manager for the Eastern U.S. for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, which helped to fund the elk reintroduction, said it’s exciting to see the fruits of labor, as well as the elk peering through the forest.\n\n“It means the herd is expanding, they’re looking for new homes and they found a good one. (Twelve Mile) will help keep the ones here that are here, and other elk will jump on the same bandwagon,” he said.\n\nFish, hellbenders to also benefit from project\n\nThe group also looked at places where stream improvements would take place. As part of the project there will be 13 stream crossing improvements, and 0.66 mile of stream enhancement.\n\nThis work will include removing passage impediments to fish like trout and other aquatic wildlife like hellbender salamanders. Culverts – metal pipes installed to allow creeks to flow under roads – have been found to actually make life more miserable for the creatures who live in the streams.\n\nRELATED: Where did all WNC's native brook trout go?\n\nPoint to one such round, narrow culvert on Fall Branch Creek, Herron said it would be pulled out and replaced with an arching pipe that allows for a natural surface bottom with rocks so that it maintains pools and riffles that aquatic organisms need to nest and find shelter.\n\n“With a round pipe like this the velocity is really high and it prevents some aquatic organisms from passing through it and in many cases there’s a drop on the downhill side where water erodes away and that also creates a barrier,” Herron said.\n\n“Where the pipe is hanging free, they’d have to climb up, making it definitely impassable. In some cases we’ll take the culvert out all together and replace it with a ford.”\n\nRELATED: Eastern hellbenders lose bid for federal protection\n\nStream enhancement work will also include shaping the stream to reduce channelization, by placing large woody debris and boulders in particular ways that makes that stream flow its natural course, Herron said.\n\nClimate change is also addressed in the environmental assessment, which found that in the short-term, the timber harvest would remove a carbon sequestration – removal of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide – from the atmosphere.\n\nRELATED: Climate Report: Southern forests are threatened\n\nBut in the long-term, it would increase the forest’s ability to sequester carbon, as well as increase the forests’ resilience to climate change threats, including the increasing probability of drought, high-severity fires, and large-scale insect outbreaks.\n\nAmount of local logging decreasing, but public might be soon be cut out of process\n\nWhile some people might be uncomfortable with any logging, Thornburgh said, a sustainable approach is needed for people to have the hardwood floors, decks and cabinetry that is so desirable.\n\nBut according to the Forest Service, in the Pisgah and Nantahala national forests, which together comprise 1.1 million acres of land across the WNC mountains, logging has decreased significantly over the past 30 years.\n\nIn the early 1980s, there were about 10,000-12,000 acres logged a year, said Cathy Dowd, Forest Service spokeswoman. With the implementation of the 1987 forest plan, harvested acres dropped to 4,000-6,000 acres annually in the late ‘80s.\n\nAfter the 1994 plan amendment, harvested acres fell to below 2,000 by the late '90s.\n\n“I believe this drop was due to the discovery of populations of the endangered Indiana bat,\" Dowd said.\n\nIn the last 10 years harvest acres have been relatively stable at 600-800 acres per year with the peak in 2016 of 1,271 acres and a low of 318 acres in 2009.\n\nRELATED: Bald is beautiful on Blue Ridge Parkway\n\nRELATED: New in Pisgah National Forest: River Rangers on patrol\n\nThe Forest Service is in the midst of its Nantahala Pisgah National Forest Plan Revision, a document required every 15 years to guide management of the forest. The plan, in the works since 2013, has hit several delays, and now is due out sometime this summer, Dowd said.\n\nThe reason for so much harmony among stakeholders with the Twelve Mile Project seems to be the collaborative effort and response to public feedback, Kelly, with MountainTrue, said.\n\nHe compares it to the Buck Creek Project in the Nantahala National Forest, which calls for cutting 845 acres and building 9.1 miles of new roads, which Kelly said will lead to erosion and sedimentation in creeks. He said that project was not done collaboratively and the decisions were made “by one or two people.”\n\nUnfortunately, said Evans, of the SELC, there might be more of that to come.\n\nOn June 13, the Forest Service released a proposed rule amending its National Environmental Policy Act, which was authorized in 1969, to allow for speeding up the “pace and scale of work accomplished on the ground” by removing the public review process for many timber projects.\n\nThe Forest Service estimates that up to 75% of decisions that now receive public input could proceed under categorical exclusions – meaning they will not need environmental assessments and will not take public comment – on commercial logging of up to 4,200 acres, which is nearly four times the amount of the Twelve Mile Project, as well as building up to 5 miles of road.\n\n“This means Twelve Mile might be the last successful proposal of its kind,” Evans said.\n\n“The Forest Service needs to abandon this proposal and focus more on standardizing the best practices they’ve learned through processes like the Twelve Mile Project, which means more front end public involvement, instead of limiting it.”\n\nThe public has until Aug. 12 to comment on the proposal at https://www.regulations.gov/.\n\nWant to comment on the Twelve Mile Project?\n\nPublic comment on the Twelve Mile Project is open through Aug. 23.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Project Say Something and its founder, Camille Bennett, claims the city and Police Chief Ron Tyler are trying to clamp down on the protests by telling the group when, where and how it can demonstrate against the monument, located at the Lauderdale County Courthouse. Bennett said the organization, a nonprofit she founded about eight years ago, has tried to work with the city, the TimesDaily reports. “Alabama has a long history of confronting racial injustice through peaceful demonstration, and it is imperative that we not lose that ability to speak truth to power when the situation demands it,” Bennett said in a statement. The city has not responded to the federal lawsuit in court, and city officials declined comment. Project Say Something held as many as 175 demonstrations at the monument in 2020 but cut back the following year because the city used its noise and parade permit ordinances to discourage them, the lawsuit said. The chief relocated the demonstrations to a “protest zone” away from the courthouse to shrink the potential audience, it claimed, and he threatened to issue citations.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is in the midst of her first visit to the state in the role, including a visit to a community at the center of a long-running dispute over a proposed land exchange aimed at building a road through a national wildlife refuge. Residents of King Cove have seen a road as a life and safety issue. Haaland was in King Cove on Wednesday with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Dunleavy’s office said. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to Cold Bay, which is about 18 miles away and has an all-weather airport. The refuge is near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. “The federal government needs to consider human safety and quality of life factors for residents in King Cove. The locals deserve to be heard by the federal government,” Dunleavy said in a statement. A U.S. Justice Department attorney last summer said Haaland had not decided what position she would take on a proposed land exchange, saying Haaland planned to review the record and visit King Cove before making a decision. A planned trip to Alaska last year didn’t materialize.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Republican House speaker on Thursday was named one of five recipients of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for his refusal to consider overturning the 2020 election results despite massive pressure from ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters. Speaker Rusty Bowers rebuffed repeated direct efforts by Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to overturn results that saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona. Trump and Giuliani urged Bowers in a phone call to retroactively change Arizona law to allow the Legislature to chose a different slate of presidential electors than those picked by the voters. “I am very grateful for this honor yet cannot help but feel undeserving of it,” Bowers said in a statement. “Honoring my oath and the people’s choices at the ballot box are not heroic acts – they are the least that Arizonans should expect from the people elected to serve them.” The award created by Kennedy’s family in 1989 is designed “to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most” and is given each year to one or more political figures. This year’s award honors those who showed “courage to protect and defend democracy in the United States and abroad.” The awards will be presented at a May 22 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A local agency says it’s seeing an uptick in calls for help after the end of a statewide rent relief program. The Arkansas Department of Human Services closed its program April 1, leaving many renters struggling to find additional avenues to keep their families housed. The Arkansas Rent Relief Program provided up to 15 months of relief for unpaid rent and utilities due on or after April 1, 2020. As of the beginning of this month, about 30,000 applications had been paid at the close of the program, totaling $92.5 million in funding distributed. Some households are still waiting for assistance as their applications are being processed. As of April 7, about 3,700 applications were still being processed across the state. In the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey taken from Jan. 26 to Feb. 7, 41.4% of Arkansas households surveyed said they were not current on rent or mortgage, making eviction or foreclosure either very likely or somewhat likely in the next two months. Dana Crawford, family services manager at the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, said she has seen an uptick in calls looking for help following the closure of the state’s rental assistance program. “We did have the Arkansas Fresh Start, but we have since depleted those funds,” Crawford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Parents of middle and high school students in the state would be warned about the dangers of firearms every year under a measure that advanced Wednesday. But they would no longer be required to tell school officials if they keep guns in the house, under the revised legislation. The state Senate Education Committee three weeks ago rejected the firearms reporting requirement as an invasion of privacy. So Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino reworked his bill, eliminating the parental reporting. The narrower version cleared the same committee Wednesday on a 5-1 vote. His revised bill requires schools to include information on the safe storage of firearms in the annual notifications they send home to parents of students in middle and high schools, starting in the 2023-24 school year. Legislation with a similar requirement has already passed the California Assembly. More than two-thirds of school shootings involve weapons taken from the students’ home, friends or relatives, Portantino said. “This is an attempt to try to empower school districts to do everything they can to make the school environment safe,” he said. “This errs on the side of caution.” If there are threats or perceived threats of school shootings, the proposal requires investigators to check the state’s firearm database to see if the suspect’s family has registered firearms.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The police chief who led the force in the Denver suburb when a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater a decade ago is returning to temporarily lead the embattled department following the firing of its last chief. Daniel J. Oates, who served as police chief in Aurora from 2005 to 2014 before retiring as police chief in Miami Beach, Florida, will serve as interim chief and help in the selection of the next police chief, the city announced Wednesday. City manager Jim Twombly said he hired Oates “because he has established trust within our community and many of our officers.” Earlier this month Twombly fired Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who was hired in 2020 as the city faced scrutiny over the death of Elijah McClain – a case that received widespread attention in the wake of protests of racial injustice and police brutality. McClain died after being stopped by police, put in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine in 2019. Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted in McClain’s death last year. Wilson acted quickly to fire officers for misconduct, including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock McClain’s death. Twombly praised Wilson’s community outreach but said he fired her because of concerns about her leadership and management of the department, without getting into specifics. Wilson disputed Twombly’s assessment and alleged she was forced out for political reasons.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Emergency responders rescued 50 dogs and cats from a fire at a pet boarding facility after three people had escaped the flames by jumping from a second-floor window, authorities said Thursday. The fire was reported shortly before midnight Wednesday in a two-story building on Post Road East, Assistant Chief Jeff Gootman of the Westport Fire Department said in a news release. Firefighters responded and found heavy fire on the second floor of the building, which housed a pet boarding facility on the first floor and basement and an apartment on the second floor, Gootman said. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they searched the building and determined that the three people on the second floor had jumped to safety from a window, Gootman said. None required hospitalization. Westport firefighters and police officers removed approximately 50 dogs and cats from the boarding facility, Gootman said. The cause of the fire was under investigation Thursday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After decades of criticism over use of force and a strained relationship with the community, the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and procedures are coming under legal scrutiny. A federal lawsuit filed against Wilmington officers involved in the 2020 shooting of a man found sleeping in an SUV lists years of departmental procedures claiming city police are unable to handle many situations, including making contact with unarmed individuals. The civil lawsuit touches on documented accounts of how Wilmington officers have not been taught to give proper verbal warning prior to using deadly force or to take cover when officers believe someone is armed. The lawsuit also claims department supervisors, among others, fail to check that officers use their standard-issue equipment and fail to prohibit officers from making false statements. These failures create unwritten policies, allowing Wilmington officers to engage in acts of excessive force without accountability, which in turn result in injury to civilians, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Jabri K. Hunter, who was shot by a Wilmington officer April 12, 2020. “These inadequate training policies existed prior to the date of this incident and continue to this day,” said the lawsuit targeting the officers involved in the shooting, Chief Robert Tracy and the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and other community leaders announced Thursday that the city’s annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness showed a decline for the sixth straight year, WUSA-TV reports. Over the past year, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has dropped 13.7%. Since 2016, when the Bowser administration began its Homeward DC plan, homelessness has declined by 47% total, data show. For the 2016 Point in Time count, 8,350 people were experiencing homelessness. In 2022, that number was 4,410. That’s the lowest recorded number going back to at least 2005, the mayor’s office said. The 2022 results also show declines in family homelessness (down 14%), homelessness among single adults (down 12%), and chronic homelessness for families (down 26%) and single adults (down 22%). “These results are a culmination of years of working together – across government, with our community partners and providers, and with residents in all eight wards – to implement Homeward DC and build systems and resources that meet the needs of D.C. residents,” Bowser said in a statement. “While we are proud of these results, we know there’s more work to do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the Florida House floor Thursday to protest a congressional map pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that they say will diminish the state’s Black representation in the U.S. House. The DeSantis map would increase Florida’s GOP presence and dismantle two districts now represented by Black members of Congress. As debate on the maps was nearing an end, Reps. Angie Nixon and Tray McCurdy opened up their suit jackets to display “Stop the Black Attack” T-shirts and shouted the same phrase. They sat on the state seal in front of the House speaker’s rostrum and were soon joined by other other Black Democrats and other supporters. The Republican-led chamber called a recess, all GOP lawmakers left the floor, and the state Florida Channel stopped broadcasting the proceedings. “This is good trouble! Necessary trouble!” Nixon shouted, echoing a phrase used by the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. The group sang “We Shall Overcome” and prayed. Some members went on Facebook to stream live feeds of the protest. Nixon said in a text message to the Associated Press that the lawmakers would not leave the floor unless they were physically removed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams’ gubernatorial campaign asked a federal judge Wednesday to shut down unlimited contributions to a committee controlled by Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. The filing is yet more litigation over the constitutionality of a 2021 Georgia law that allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits and coordinate spending with campaigns. The judge earlier denied a request by Abrams to start taking unlimited amounts before she clinches the Democratic nomination May 24. Kemp narrowly beat Abrams in the 2018 general election, and they would match up again if Kemp survives a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue and others. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Donors can give as much as they want, while they can’t directly give candidates for statewide office more than $7,600 for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. Opponents say the law unconstitutionally favors incumbents over challengers because they can raise limitless sums for years ahead of an election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Public school students must continue wearing masks in classrooms despite state officials lifting the same rules for airports and public transportation following Monday’s federal judge decision to remove mask requirements on U.S. flights. Masks are no longer required in Hawaii airports, on city buses or in handicapped vans, but all public students will be required to wear masks through the end of the school year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “I understand that there are different perspectives regarding the Hawaii State Department of Education’s indoor masking in schools,” interim Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in a letter to parents. “We will continue to implement universal indoor masking in schools.” Federal transportation officials announced Monday that they would no longer enforce mask rules after a U.S. judge’s decision to strike down the mandate on domestic flights. The four largest U.S. airlines almost immediately dropped their mask requirements, and Hawaiian Airlines announced late Monday that it would follow suit. “We ask for our guests’ patience and understanding as we update all our communications and announcements,” the airline said. “We advise travelers to stay informed and follow mask requirements that may remain in effect at their origin or arrival airports.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men have been sentenced to jail time and banned from hunting for years after pleading guilty to poaching a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said in a press release that Rex Baum, 79, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the female grizzly’s death last year. He was ordered to serve 3 days in jail and was banned from hunting for a decade. Baum’s son, Jared Baum, of Ashton, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and banned from hunting for life after pleading guilty to a felony in connection with the incident. Fish and Game officers discovered the grizzly’s carcass April 9, 2021, after the bear’s radio tracking collar signaled it had died, the Idaho Statesman reports. X-rays of the bear showed she had been shot more than a dozen times. Conservation officers visited the bear’s den, discovering a dead male cub. The agency contacted the two men after sending a warrant to Google for records of electronic devices that had been in the area around the time of the grizzly’s death. Idaho grizzlies are federally protected. Last month, Gov. Brad Little joined Montana and Wyoming governors in petitioning for the bears to be removed from Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The city will have a starring role in the state’s latest marketing campaign, with the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Cozy Dog Drive-In, and other sites featured in the new promotion. Gov. J.B. Pritzker officially announced the new campaign, “Middle of Everything,” at a ceremony Monday at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium. While the Windy City is spotlighted heavily, Springfield gets plenty of love as well, with sites related to the 16th president, such as Lincoln’s Home and Lincoln’s Tomb, promoted in addition to the museum and a statue of Lincoln sitting on a park bench outside the museum. Pritzker said the $30 million campaign would help to recover tourism dollars lost during the COVID-19 pandemic and put the state in a position to grow in the years to come. A series of TV ads will run with the campaign, directed by Illinois native Jane Lynch, famous for roles such as in the TV series “Glee” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” The Dolton-raised actor, a graduate of Illinois State University, narrates a quartet of 30-second ads that showcase a Lincoln impersonator at the Lincoln Home, a muscle car at the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices downtown, Lynch interviewing a family at the Cozy Dog and speaking with a ghost of Lincoln at “Ghosts of the Library” in the ALPLM, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Thomas McDermott Jr. released a new video ad Wednesday of him smoking marijuana in honor of 4/20, a cannabis-related celebration. McDermott, who will face Republican Sen. Todd Young on Nov. 8, has been vocal about his support for the legalization of marijuana, but the video of him lighting it up is a first. In the video the Hammond mayor posted on Twitter, McDermott lights a joint and smokes it in an Illinois backyard, where marijuana consumption has been legalized. He talks to an attorney, a physician, a criminal defense attorney, a professional distiller and another elected official about the benefits of legalizing weed. “Here’s the bottom line,” McDermott says in the video. “We need to legalize marijuana on the federal level. We need to also legalize cannabis in Indiana as well, so Hoosiers can get the health and economic benefits of cannabis.” The mayor admitted last year on his “Left of Center” podcast that he smoked marijuana at a recent Grateful Dead show at Wrigley Field. McDermott unveiled the ad the same day the Indiana Democratic Party launched a tour to push marijuana legalization. It started publicly advocating for the policy change in November, but with Republicans in control at the Statehouse, it went nowhere in the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: This year’s Major League Baseball Field of Dreams game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs will have an opening act. The Cedar Rapids Kernels and Quad Cities River Bandits will play a regular season minor league baseball game in the stadium located near the iconic diamond from the movie Aug. 9. That showdown is set to take place just two days before MLB’s second-straight visit to the famous farmland and in the same ballpark used last season by the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds will play on the same field Aug. 11. “I think it just adds to an entire week now up there,” said Kernels general manager Scott Wilson. “Instead of just one night even with the major league game, you’ve got Tuesday night with us. It gives the Field of Dreams some opportunity to do some things on Wednesday between us and have that game on Thursday.” It’s a marquee matchup of minor league teams have been rivals in the Midwest League for years. The River Bandits are the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Kernels are the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The two teams, who are are located in Eastern Iowa, will become the first two minor league teams to play on the field.\n\nKansas\n\nAtchison: Aviator Amelia Earhart vanished as she tried to fly around the world in 1937, along with navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra 10-E airplane. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world. That museum is in the works in Atchison, Earhart’s birthplace. Museum founder and president Karen Seaberg announced last week that supporters had already donated $10 million of the estimated $15 million needed to create the museum, including corporate powerhouses FedEx, Garmin and Lockheed Martin. The museum is expected to open next year, according to its website. Earhart, born in 1897 in Atchison, was a social worker in Boston in 1923 when she became the 16th woman in the U.S. to be issued a pilot’s license. She subsequently became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. She was also the first woman to fly nonstop across the U.S. She became a celebrity and drew attention by rejecting traditional women’s roles and speaking in support of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Earhart also created her own line of women’s clothing, featuring comfortable outfits designed for “active living.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he will form an advisory team amid a broad review as he weighs whether to take executive action to legalize access to medical marijuana. Beshear said he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action to create a framework to make medical cannabis available for people suffering from specified ailments. The Democratic governor also made a direct appeal to Kentuckians to offer their views on the issue. “I want to be clear: I am for medical cannabis,” Beshear said at his weekly news conference. “I want it done in the right way. And we’re going to be looking at our legal options very closely. And at the same time, we want to hear from you.” The advisory team will travel the state to gather public input, and Kentuckians will be able to express their views directly to the governor’s office, he said. The expanded review reflects the governor’s growing frustration after the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate during the legislative session that ended last week. Lawmakers failed to “get the job done,” with Kentucky falling behind the majority of states that make medical cannabis available as an alternative to opioid medications, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge and court-appointed monitors hired to oversee reform of the New Orleans Police Department said Wednesday that the long-troubled agency could reach full compliance this year after a nearly decade-old court-backed overhaul of its policies and practices. “I’m proud of how far NOPD has come,” U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan, who approved the agreement in 2013 a highly critical 2011 investigation and report by the U.S. Justice Department. Morgan tempered her praise with acknowledgment of continuing problems, including the short-handed department’s slowdown in recruiting and allegations of wrongdoing by officers who work private duty details arranged through the department. But the department has shown transparency in dealing with such setbacks, Morgan said. The reform agreement, embodied in a court document called a consent decree, was welcomed by department critics when it was negotiated during former Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s administration. They said it was needed for a department that had been plagued by recurring scandals involving corruption or questionable use of force for decades. But the consent decree had its critics as well, including police officer representatives who said it hampered police work.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed off on a $1.2 billion supplemental budget Wednesday that sends more than half the money to residents in the form of $850 relief checks. Backed by dozens of lawmakers and Cabinet members, the governor signed the bill into law in the State House Hall of Flags. “What this budget shows once again – through hard work and good faith negotiation – Democrats, Republicans and independents can come together to do what is right for Maine people. And that we can do so without rancor or bitter partisanship that has sometimes divided Augusta in the past,” she told the assembly. The swift action means the checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 Mainers as early as June. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the budget proposal in a show of bipartisanship. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers, taking a suggestion from Republicans as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. It was originally touted as pandemic relief but is now called inflationary relief. Mills’ opponent in the upcoming election, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, derided the relief checks as a “gimmick.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed measures into law Thursday aimed at increasing public safety, jobs, environmental stewardship and mental health resources. The Republican governor, who prioritized initiatives to support the police and fight crime this legislative session, signed legislation to increase transparency in the criminal justice system and to create a state gun analytics center to coordinate resources to screen and vet gun cases to improve the prosecution of gun crimes. “Violent crime continues to be Marylanders’ top priority, and today we’re signing our Judicial Transparency Act so that the public knows more about the sentences that are being handed down for violent criminals,” Hogan said. “We’re further expanding our warrant apprehension efforts and strengthening prosecutions on gun crimes.” Hogan opened his remarks before signing 103 bills with House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith by noting it was the first time two Black women were the presiding officers representing the Maryland House and Senate together at a bill signing. The criminal justice measures marked a compromise between the Republican governor and the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMartha’s Vineyard: A local family will go to court Friday over its continuing fight over a piece of land in Aquinnah that the Kennedy family donated to the Vineyard Conservation Society in 2013. Tanisha Gomes and her family say they are the rightful owners of that 5.7-acre property and are challenging the society’s motion for summary judgment, which asks a judge to throw out the case. In 2017, Gomes received a letter from Fidelity National Law Group, a firm that represents Vineyard Conservation Society Inc., to inform her and 19 members of her family about title problems with the land. The letter informed Gomes and her relatives that a lawsuit was filed with Dukes County Superior Court against the family, who are considered heirs of Louisa Pocknett. Pocknett, described in the complaint as the former owner of the property, died Aug. 29, 1874, and was a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The family members were asked to sign an agreement to verify they had no right, title or interest in Lot 240, which was indicated on a plan entitled “Plan of Gay Head.” After further research, Gomes and her family found that Lot 240 remains in Pocknett’s name on the town of Aquinnah’s assessor’s website and objected to the lawsuit due to discrepancies surrounding incomplete deeds.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican state Sen. Lana Theis opened a session with an invocation by claiming children are being attacked by “forces” that want to indoctrinate them with ideas their parents do not support. Three Democrats walked out of last week’s meeting to protest her apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation and gender identity and critical race theory. Within days, one who tweeted criticism of the prayer was targeted by Theis in a fundraising email, calling Sen. Mallory McMorrow a liberal social media “troll” and accusing her of wanting to “groom” and “sexualize” kindergartners and teach “that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.” McMorrow responded Tuesday with a forceful, impassioned floor speech that resonated nationwide. “I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom” who wants “every kid to feel seen, heard and supported – not marginalized and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian,” she said. Theis, who declined to speak after the session, released a statement in which she did not apologize but again accused Democrats of trying to undermine parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education. McMorrow’s 5-minute speech found an engaged audience on social media, racking up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mike Dando, a St. Cloud State University English professor, has helped to create a new superhero comic and is aiming to teach students in grades 5-12 literacy skills, critical thinking and self-reflection this summer through an often overlooked medium. Exploring concepts like Afrofuturism and the African diaspora, students can imagine new worlds by reading and analyzing the story of the first Black superhero, Lion Man. In 2018, after the highly successful “Black Panther” movie debuted, Dando worked with a group of artists and professors around the world to revisit Lion Man, the first Black superhero comic, written in 1947 by Black Philadelphia journalist Orrin Cromwell Evans. The original story follows Lion Man, a scientist turned superhero tasked by the United Nations to watch over a magical mountain full of uranium in Africa to prevent war. When All-Negro Comics Inc.’s paper supplier refused to help the company produce another book because its founders were Black, only one Lion Man issue was ever published – until now. Dando’s new, much longer Lion Man comic book follows the character’s journey of self-discovery and heroism as he works to save a group of other heroes trapped in monstrous bodies. He served as editor and project manager for the work written by John Jennings and illustrated by David Brame. Thanks to a grant from St. Cloud State, the team was able to make copies of the comic book – one of which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – and Dando will work with a variety of after-school clubs this summer to talk about the narrative structure and themes of the book, as well as teach students how to make their own comics.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Volunteers on Thursday planted several types of grasses along a stretch of Mississippi Gulf Coast beach to help restore habitat for newly hatched Least Tern chicks. Audubon Delta, along with Harrison County Sand Beach Authority and Gulfport High School, partnered to install several species of beach grasses into a globally recognized conservation zone in Gulfport in order to stabilize the beach, encourage dune formation and provide coverage for the endangered birds. The area was destroyed after hurricanes Ida and Zeta and several tropical storms over the past two years, officials said. The project was made possible by a Caring for Our Coasts grant issued by Citgo and Restore America’s Estuaries.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City leaders on Thursday announced plans for a new institute designed to make the region a major player in geospatial technology. Andy Taylor, executive chairman of the rental car company Enterprise Holdings, is providing financing for the Taylor Geospatial Institute, along with eight St. Louis-area research institutions. The institute will provide funding for research and program development and expects to attract leading scientists to St. Louis, organizers said. Taylor said in a statement that he hopes the institute “will cement St. Louis as the world’s true center for geospatial excellence.” A news release says research and training will focus on topics such as food security, improving health care systems, and national security. Officials did not disclose how much money the Taylor family is investing, but the family has funded more than $1 billion in St. Louis civic initiatives and cultural institutions through the years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers have rejected an attempt to call a special legislative session to investigate the state’s election processes amid continued false claims by ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen. A poll of 149 lawmakers found just 44 approving a special session by Tuesday’s deadline, short of the 75 needed. The secretary of state’s tally showed 60 lawmakers rejected the special session, and another 45 didn’t return their ballots, which counts as a “no” vote. One legislative seat is vacant. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers tried to reach an agreement to ask Gov. Greg Gianforte to call a special session to create new voting districts for the Public Service Commission before three federal judges had to decide how to even out the populations in the five districts. However, GOP leaders were unable to get a commitment from all Republicans to limit the special session to addressing just the voting districts. Gianforte said he would not call a special session without such an agreement. After the court set the PSC districts for the 2022 elections, 10 lawmakers asked for the poll on whether lawmakers wanted to hold a special session on election integrity.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson endorsed state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks on Thursday in her campaign for the state’s 1st Congressional District. Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, is looking to replace former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who resigned after he was convicted on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal campaign contribution. Nelson, a Democrat, said Pansing Brooks has worked with both parties while in the Nebraska Legislature and passed more than 60 bills. Pansing Brooks will face state Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, in a June 28 special election to determine who will serve the remainder of Fortenberry’s term in Congress. She’s also expected to face Flood again in November, assuming that they both win their parties’ May 10 primary nomination as expected. Nelson is the most recent Democrat to have served as Nebraska’s governor, with a tenure from 1991 to 1999. He was a U.S. senator from 2001 to 2013. Pansing Brooks has served in the Legislature since 2015 and is leaving office in January due to term limits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Most of the five leading Republican candidates for governor who gathered Wednesday for a campaign forum offered dire assessments of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, rising crime and struggling schools – and asked for votes for their visions to fix them. Several also blamed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the consensus GOP front-runner, for skipping the event. “We want to have the best, well-run, state in the country,” said Guy Nohra, a Reno venture capitalist, drawing applause from among about 100 people at a Republican women’s club luncheon in Las Vegas. “But we don’t. We’re 50th in everything,” said Nora, who called his foray into politics the culmination of an American dream after his own teenage experience fighting a war in his home country, Lebanon, and his business ventures in the U.S. The event also featured North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, Gardnerville surgeon Fred Simon, former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and firebrand northern Nevada lawyer Joey Gilbert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House approved a resolution Thursday in support of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary before advancing a bill opponents said would threaten it. The nonbinding resolution came a week after the Democratic National Committee approved a plan to revoke the guaranteed first-place spots in the presidential nominating calendar long held by the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Noting New Hampshire has withstood previous challenges, lawmakers affirmed their commitment to the tradition and said candidates are well-served by campaigning in a state with an engaged citizenry and “well-run, free and fair elections.” But a supporter of a bill to create a provisional ballot system later called the current system “laughable,” claiming it allows people to cast fraudulent ballots with virtually no consequences. Under current law, voters who arrive at the polls without the necessary identification fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days; those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. The votes themselves remain valid, but under a bill sent to the House Finance Committee on Thursday, the state would create a new type of “affidavit ballots” that would be thrown out if voters fail to follow up. Opponents called it an expensive and complicated solution to a problem that doesn’t exist and said creating a system that would delay the final results for more than a week would threaten the state’s ability to hold the first primary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBloomfield: The flowers were finally on full display Thurday as recreational marijuana sales began in the Garden State. Michael Barrows wore his Grateful Dead T-shirt and Jerry Garcia face mask for opening day of legal cannabis sales and was one of dozens of people who lined up before dawn to join the celebratory scene. “It’s pretty amazing, exciting, and if I get pulled over on the way home, and I’m ever asked if I have any drugs in the car, now I’m allowed to say ‘only this,’ ” Barrows said, holding up the canister of marijuana flower he had just purchased. Possession of cannabis is legal now in New Jersey, though driving under the influence is still prohibited. Barrows, 60, joined a steady stream of other novelty-seekers, longtime marijuana users and medical patients at RISE in Bloomfield, near the state’s biggest city, Newark, and not far from New York City. With soul music blaring, free doughnuts in the parking lot, a steel drum and a balloon arch at the entrance, New Jersey’s cannabis kickoff for people 21 and older had the feel of a fair more than a store opening. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has long backed recreational marijuana legalization and signed the bill that set up the new marketplace kicking off at 13 existing medical marijuana facilities across the state, appeared at ZenLeaf in Elizabeth for its first day of recreational sales. The governor said he wouldn’t be trying any pot; earlier this week he said it’s not his “thing,” and he prefers scotch.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Habitat for about a million bats will be protected from human impacts through a deal between a nonprofit and the federal government. About 315,000 acres of southern New Mexico land owned by billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner were protected from development in a partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and New Mexico Land Conservancy. The deal saw a conservation easement added to Armendaris Ranch, owned by Turner, due to perceived cultural significance and biological diversity on the land in Sierra and Socorro counties. The ranch land supports more than 500 vertebrate species, according to a report from the Land Conservancy, including multiple listed for federal and state protections. It also contains the Fra Cristobal Mountain Range, home to 230 desert bighorn sheep, and lava fields that include the Jornada cave system that houses bats of multiple species. “This land is laden with important and unique natural and cultural resources, and the opportunity to permanently protect a property with conservation values of this magnitude was at the heart of our organization’s decision to tackle this landscape-scale project,” said Ron Troy, southern New Mexico program manager with the Land Conservancy.\n\nNew York\n\nOlive: As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The fight over a downtown Confederate marker is not over, according to the attorney challenging the city’s removal of Vance Monument, and documents filed Wednesday attempt to take the issue to North Carolina’s highest court. Despite an April 5 ruling from the N.C. Court of Appeals in favor of the city, affirming a lower court judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing removal of the monument, the city finds itself again in limbo. Nearing midnight Wednesday, Edward Phillips, lawyer for the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops, which brought the challenge against the city, filed a petition for discretionary review with the N.C. Supreme Court. This document is a request for the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Court of Appeals. It does not ensure the high court will hear an appeal, said City Attorney Brad Branham. “I am not going to cede the point until I’m told there’s just no path forward,” Phillips said. The filings add to an already lengthy process to determine the fate of the obelisk that was built to honor racist Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance. The 75-foot-tall granite Vance Monument stood in Pack Square Plaza in the heart of downtown Asheville. All but its base was taken down as of June 2021 after the City Council voted to remove it. The historical preservation group is seeking to stop and potentially reconstruct the monument to Vance.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state and several western counties that could have resulted in the construction of additional roads in parts of the Badlands. The Badlands Conservation Alliance says the ruling protects some of the most pristine areas of the Badlands from traffic and potential oil development. “I think it’s a really serious win for the Badlands, for the long-term integrity of those areas that are still roadless and considered suitable for wilderness,” said Connie Triplett, president of the alliance. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s and counties’ claim is barred by a 12-year statute of limitations that was passed years ago. Their ruling upholds an earlier decision by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, who dismissed the matter in 2017, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The case began a decade ago when Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie and Slope counties sued the federal government. The state followed with its own lawsuit, and the court consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs sought to claim rights to section lines used in land surveying and mapping in the Little Missouri National Grassland and other areas that make up the Dakota Prairie Grasslands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A lawsuit has been filed targeting legal protections granted to health care providers that allow them to deny treatment they oppose on the basis of their conscience or religious beliefs. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on Wednesday sued the state over the measure known as the “conscience clause.” According to the law, a medical provider can be “excused from participating” whenever a treatment conflicts with a provider’s “moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or convictions.” Opponents of the law say it could limit abortions or other medical care. The city also argues the measure violates Ohio’s Constitution and the federal Affordable Care Act. If nurses employed by the city are opposed to a medical procedure, “they can refuse it, and we as a city can’t do anything about it,” Klein said. He also said insurance companies could refuse to pay for certain procedures, and “that obviously causes significant problems for our employees.” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine kept the language of the law in place when he signed the 2021 budget. DeWine said the provision merely sets into state law what’s already being practiced. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the lawsuit “meritless, anti-democracy and authoritarian.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Plans to fully legalize marijuana can proceed to the signature-gathering stage, the state Supreme Court ruled, paving the way for two more cannabis plans seeking voter approval. The high court’s ruling late Tuesday comes amid a marijuana boom in the Sooner State after voters in 2018 approved the most liberal medical marijuana program in the nation. Nearly 10% of Oklahoma’s 4 million residents have qualified for a medical-use card – by far the highest percentage in the country. Supporters of the two separate proposals still need to gather enough signatures to put the plans on the ballot for voters. The plans approved Tuesday, State Question 819 and a companion State Question 818, would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to protect the right of residents age 21 and older to use marijuana. It’s part of a nationwide push to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults, which 18 states and the District of Columbia have already approved. Because the two proposals seek to amend the constitution, supporters will have to gather more signatures, about 178,000 in 90 days, for them to qualify for the ballot. “Whether we’ll get on the November ballot this year remains to be seen,” said Jed Green, a longtime Oklahoma cannabis activist behind the plans. “We’re going to push, push and push to get it done.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Native American tribe in the state said it is assessing its legal options after learning the U.S. government plans to release water from a federally operated reservoir to downstream farmers along the Oregon-California border amid a historic drought. Even limited irrigation for the farmers who use Klamath River water on about 300 square miles of crops puts two critically endangered fish species in peril of extinction because the water withdrawals come at the height of spawning season, the Klamath Tribes said. Last year, critically endangered sucker fish central to the Klamath Tribes culture and religion didn’t have enough water to spawn, and thousands of downstream juvenile salmon died without reservoir releases to support the Klamath River’s health. The tribes said in a statement that the decision to release any water to about 1,000 farmers in the massive, federal agricultural project was “perhaps the saddest chapter yet in a long history of treaty violations” and placed the blame for the current water crisis on “120 years of ecosystem mismanagement at the hands of settler society.” The fish are important to the inland tribes’ cultural and religious practices and were once a dietary staple. The Klamath stopped fishing for the sucker fish in the 1980s as numbers dwindled. They now run a captive breeding program to ensure the species’ survival and note that no juvenile sucker fish have survived in the wild in recent years. “We have nothing left with which to ‘compromise,’ ” the Klamath Tribes said in a statement. “Global warming is certainly a global problem, but thus far its local consequences appear to be exacerbating existing and systematic inequalities between ourselves and the larger society.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors said Thursday that they will not re-try a Philadelphia man whose 2012 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month, citing weak evidence and the involvement of a disgraced former detective now charged with sexually assaulting witnesses in other cases. Rafiq Dixon, 40, had been serving a life sentence in the 2011 fatal shooting of Joseph Pinkney. The 40-year-old was expected to be released from prison Thursday afternoon, hours after a Common Pleas Court judge granted the motion to withdraw charges, his attorney said. The initial case relied heavily on testimony from three witnesses who gave inconsistent accounts. All three were interviewed by former homicide detective Philip Nordo, who has been charged with various crimes including stalking, intimidating, and sexually assaulting male suspects and witnesses during his career. In June, a judge reversed the 2015 conviction of Arkel Garcia, who confessed to murder during an interrogation in which, his lawyer said, Nordo asked the teenager to view pornography with him. The ruling came after both sides presented evidence that Nordo had sexually groomed witnesses in the case and trial prosecutors had suppressed his misconduct. Garcia was also serving a life sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic former state lawmaker David Segal has joined the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a fellow Democrat who’s retiring after more than two decades in office. Segal announced his decision Wednesday, saying that many voters are fed up with federal politics and that “government should be able to do more to address the concerns of our neighbors.” Segal served on the Providence City Council before winning a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He served for two terms, from 2007 to 2011. In 2010 he lost a bid for Congress and founded a national liberal advocacy organization known as Demand Progress. He’s the latest entry in a crowded Democratic field that also includes state Treasurer Seth Magaziner; Joy Fox, a former top aide to Langevin; Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau; Omar Bah, executive director of the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; and former political strategist Michael Neary. “We have the people power to reach the voters, we have the money to compete, and we have the urgent case to make that we deserve leaders who can bring people together and ensure their voices are heard,” Segal said in his campaign announcement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Wednesday issued a temporary stay blocking the state from carrying out what was set to be its first-ever firing squad execution. The order by the state Supreme Court puts on hold at least temporarily the planned April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, who drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. The court said in issuing the temporary stay that it would release a more detailed order later. Attorneys for the 57-year-old inmate had sought a stay, citing pending litigation in another court challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina’s execution methods, which also include the electric chair. Moore’s lawyers also wanted time to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether Moore’s sentence was proportionate to his crime. It has been more than a decade since the last firing squad execution in the U.S. The state of Utah carried out all three such executions in the nation since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The most recent was in 2010. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday also set a May 13 execution date for Brad Sigmon, 64, convicted in 2002 of the double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s parents in Greenville County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A leadership shake-up and shorter wait times for service are welcomed changes for disgruntled military veterans who say the federal health care system is failing them, but that’s still not enough to appease the dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as a handful of elected officials, who showed up at the South Dakota Veterans Council’s quarterly meeting Wednesday. Praises of this week’s removal of the now-former Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs director were tempered by caution for a need for more systematic improvements. “If you walked the halls on Tuesday, there were more smiles in the Sioux Falls VA Hospital than there have been in 14 months,” said Hawk Mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran, referring to the departure of now former Sioux Falls VA director Lisa Simoneau. “But we’ve been shut out.” Simoneau was removed from the position as of Monday after growing pressure for a regime change from both veterans, VA employees and South Dakota’s congressional delegation. Since at least October, members of the South Dakota Veterans Council have voiced concerns about a lack of responsiveness from Simoneau regarding what’s described as an inadequate level of care being provided to veterans entitled to medical services through the veterans’ health care system. Some employees at the VA have also blown the whistle in recent weeks on poor management practices and a hostile work environment under Simoneau.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would become the latest to impose harsh penalties on doctors who violate new, strict regulations dictating the dispensing of abortion pills under a proposal headed to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. It’s part of a coordinated nationwide effort spearheaded by anti-abortion groups upset over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to remove a rule that required women to pick up the abortion medication in person. After Tennessee’s GOP-controlled House approved the measure last week, Senate Republicans on Thursday signed off on sending the proposal to the governor. Lee hasn’t publicly weighed in on the measure, but he has yet to veto a bill while in office and frequently stresses his opposition to abortion. According to the bill, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed, and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills. The drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians – effectively barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine. The in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A prominent conservative activist has been charged with unlawful restraint and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon over an October incident involving a contractor the activist hired, his attorneys said Wednesday. Jared Woodfill and Gary Polland, attorneys for Dr. Steven Hotze, said the Harris County District Attorney’s Office told them Wednesday that Hotze was indicted over allegations against a former police officer, Mark Aguirre, who worked for Hotze. Aguirre had been retained to pursue a voter fraud investigation on behalf of Houston-based Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization Hotze runs. Aguirre was charged Dec. 14 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after a man accused him of running him off the road and holding him at gunpoint in an effort to prove what authorities have called a bogus voter fraud scheme. Aguirre claimed an air conditioner repairman was the mastermind. He said the man’s truck was filled with fraudulent ballots when he ran his SUV into it Oct. 19, according to authorities. Aguirre told police he and some friends set up a “command post” at a Marriott hotel in suburban Houston that conducted 24-hour surveillance on the repairman for four days, according to a police affidavit.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Faced with continuing drought and one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., the Washington County Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to apply new water restrictions to every new residential and commercial development. The new rules won’t apply to any existing homes or commercial buildings, but they could hopefully provide a better balance between what water is available and the continued demand for new construction, said Adam Snow, a member of the three-member commission, which regulates buildings requirements for all of the unincorporated areas of the county. “We want to have beautiful communities and a beautiful place to live and maintain our quality of life,” Snow said. “We’re doing it as effectively and efficiently as possible with our water, which is a very sacred resource right now.” The changes will be written into Title 10, Chapter 27 of the county code. They will only apply to projects on unincorporated county land that still need approval from the county to go forward, although they resemble similar measures being passed by cities and towns in the area. Snow said about 5% of the county’s population lives on unincorporated land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Property owned by Vermont-recognized Native American tribes will be exempt from property taxes under a new law that takes effect in July. The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, recognizes that Vermont lands “are the historic and current territories of the Western Abenaki people.” “I sign it out of respect for the heritage of our Native American communities and traditions,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “Further, the associated costs to the Education Fund and the General Fund borne by all Vermonters are forecast to be negligible.” To be exempt from the state and municipal property taxes, the property must be used for the purposes of the tribe and not leased or rented. Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation, has said the tax exemption allows the tribes, which rely on grants and donations, to be able to use those resources “to help uplift our people” with food security and other needs. The legislation states that “stewardship of these lands was removed from the Abenaki by European governments and settlers” and acknowledges “the Abenaki people as the traditional land caretakers of Ndakinna, which includes parts of Vermont, New England, and Quebec.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWestlake: Officials at Booker T. Washington National Monument are asking the public for help in unraveling one of its biggest mysteries. Hidden away in a section of the park just off its Jack O’ Lantern Trail rests a cemetery that predates much of the known history of the former plantation where Booker T. Washington was born a slave and later freed. The cemetery has few markings to provide context to who was buried there or when they were buried. “It’s definitely one of the biggest mysteries at the park,” said Tim Sims, senior park ranger. Archaeologist with New South Associates recently began taking a deeper look into the cemetery, commonly referred to as the Sparks Cemetery named after a person who once lived nearby. Some of the Black families who have lived near the cemetery include the Brown, Holland, Divers, Burroughs, Ferguson, Taylor, Green, Harris, English, Edwards, Starkey, Swain, Saunders, Childress and Dudley families. Sims said the names of the families were found looking through property deeds, slave records and federal census records. People with information on those possibly buried in the Sparks Cemetery are asked to contact Velma Fann, historian, at New South Associates at 770-498-4155, x126 or vfann@newsouthassoc.com.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that an Edmonds city ordinance requiring that guns be locked up and kept out of unauthorized hands is preempted by state law. The ruling affirmed a three-judge state of appeals ruling last year in the case sparked by a lawsuit filed by three residents against the city of Edmonds after it approved an ordinance in July 2018 requiring residents to lock up their guns or else face fines. “Under our system of divided government, many elected bodies hold legislative power, including elected city councils. These councils, however, must legislate within constitutional constraints,” Chief Justice Steven González wrote, joined by the eight other justices on the high court. “One of those constraints is that city ordinances must not ‘conflict with general laws’ that have been enacted by the people of our state by initiative or by our state legislature.” A statewide ballot measure that passed later that same year on gun safety doesn’t mandate that a firearm be stored in a particular way or place, but it created criminal penalties for when a gun isn’t properly stored and accessed by someone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm – such as a child – and used to injure or kill, displayed in public in an intimidating manner or used during a crime.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A health care system has partnered with a junior college on a program aimed at addressing the shortage of nurses in the state. Mon Health System and West Virginia Junior College signed a letter of intent to launch a nursing education program that will put students at the school on an accelerated path to becoming nurses, officials said during a signing ceremony Monday. Mon Health nurses will serve as faculty, and the students will have digital coursework as well as learning through work at the hospital – what Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg called patient-side, The Dominion Post reports. The program plans to open enrollment in September and start its first class next April. The collaboration, Goldberg said, will serve “to bring not only the best nurses to patient-side through Mon Health, but keep people in this community, grow our own, take care of our own neighbors, family members and friends, so we continue to be the best health care location in north-central West Virginia and improve our health care outcomes.” West Virginia Junior College CEO Chad Callen said nursing shortages are at near crisis levels in some areas of the state. “Such challenges require bold thinking and innovative, out-of-the-box approaches,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker in the state as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves snakes and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman’s reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman’s website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s senior population grew at the nation’s second-fastest rate in the second decade of the millennium, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Citing research from online resource hub AgingInPlace.org, the newspaper points to a 40% increase in the proportion of Wyoming residents who are 65 or older between 2010 and 2020, with the level sitting at 17.8% in the latest census. Only Alaska was found to have a faster-growing senior population when comparing U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/11/07/renewable-energy-power-reliability-explained/70748158007/", "title": "Renewable energy sources can produce 24/7 power. Here's how", "text": "In February 2021, the electric grid failed in Texas.\n\nA particularly brutal winter storm system had struck the state and, as temperatures plunged, millions of people were without power or heat for days. Pipes burst, flooding homes. Water treatment facilities went offline. Hundreds of people died.\n\n\"People were literally burning furniture inside their house for heat,\" Selena Xie, president of the Austin EMS Association, told USA TODAY.\n\nPoliticians and other public figures were quick to blame the tragedy on renewable power.\n\n\"It never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources that contribute the least when they are needed the most,\" Texas Public Policy Foundation, a state think tank, said in a statement.\n\nThese claims echoed a widespread belief seen in mainstream political discourse and social media chatter that replacing “reliable” fossil fuel power sources with “unreliable” renewable power technologies will inevitably lead to catastrophe.\n\nHowever, renewables were unfairly blamed for the disaster in Texas. While wind facilities did underperform or fail, the outage was primarily caused by the failure of natural gas infrastructure and supply chains, experts said.\n\nClaims that renewables are intrinsically unreliable are also off base. Renewable energy sources are necessary to reduce CO2 emissions from the electric grid and the escalating harms caused by global warming, and with proper planning grids can increase use of these resources without sacrificing reliability, experts told USA TODAY.\n\n“The truth of it is every resource has its own unique characteristics to plan for,” said Trieu Mai, a researcher in the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “There is no intrinsic reason why a renewables-based grid would be more prone to blackouts. But it does require planners to account for the characteristics of those renewables when they do their planning.”\n\nCan renewable energy replace fossil fuels?\n\nTo deal with the intermittent nature of some renewables, grid planners have a variety of strategies in mind:\n\nStoring power to be used later\n\nTransmitting power over distance\n\nCreating resource diversity with different types of renewables\n\nUsing “demand response” initiatives to encourage consumers to use power when it is plentiful\n\nFor an electric grid to work properly, operators must make sure that power supply meets power demand instantly – managing random fluctuations in consumer use and the typical peaks and troughs of the day or year.\n\nRenewables like solar or wind that fluctuate with weather add another layer of complication. Some fluctuations are predictable − such as solar power production increasing as the sun rises and peaking in the afternoon − but others are less so.\n\n“Renewable generation could swing rapidly and suddenly within a region due to cloud coverage or wind speed or direction changes,” said Andy Sun, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology electric power systems professor.\n\nStorage: Save power until it's needed\n\nOne option for managing these fluctuations is to store energy that is produced when power is plentiful and use it when power becomes scarce. This strategy functionally transforms \"intermittent\" renewable power into \"dispatchable power\" − meaning the power is guaranteed to be available for a given time, even if the weather is bad.\n\nGiant lithium-ion batteries – the variety found in electric cars and cell phones – are being rapidly deployed for this purpose. The most common utility-scale lithium-ion battery stores power for about four hours, enough to push through, for instance, an evening peak demand period after solar plants have largely stopped producing, according to Mai.\n\n“In the longer term … you might need to shift it further than four hours,” he said. “What we see in our analysis is an increasing duration of energy storage needed as you significantly increase renewables on the grid.”\n\nOther technologies can store power for longer and require less intensively mined minerals than batteries. For instance, pumped storage hydropower has been used for energy storage for decades, according to Robert Armstrong, chair of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative's 2022 report, \"The Future of Energy Storage.\"\n\nIn this system, excess energy produced during peak production periods – such as mid-afternoon on a solar-driven grid – is used to pump water up an incline to a reservoir. When energy is needed, the water is released to flow back downhill, creating electricity by spinning a turbine.\n\nThese facilities can store many hours' worth of energy depending on their size.\n\nOther energy storage strategies, which are in varying stages of research and development, include:\n\nTransmission: Move power to where it's needed\n\nAnother option to fill the gaps on cloudy days or windless nights is importing renewable power from elsewhere via electrical transmission lines, according to Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.\n\n\"When the wind is not blowing in one place, it is often blowing somewhere else, and vice versa,\" he told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. electric grid is divided into three broad sections that operate almost independently of each other and differ in renewable resource distribution and abundance. Connecting the eastern and western parts through increased transmission capacity could help the U.S. make better use of its abundant renewable resources, according to a 2021 study led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\n\nFor instance, these improvements would allow excess solar power from the Southwest to support Eastern communities during peak demand, according to the Department of Energy. Likewise, Midwestern wind power could be sent in the opposite direction as the sun sets on the West Coast.\n\nLarge interconnected grids allow \"resources of different types – meaning solar, geothermal, hydropower and various storage technologies – to work together,\" Mai said.\n\nResource diversity: Leverage complementary renewables\n\nThis sort of resource coordination, or resource diversity, is itself an important strategy for keeping the lights on. For wind and solar energy specifically, grid operators can take advantage of a convenient characteristic that allows them to be used in tandem.\n\n\"Wind and solar, which are both ... intermittent resources, are complementary in nature,\" Jacobson said. \"When the sun is not shining, the wind is often blowing ... and vice versa. Thus, combining wind and solar on the grid smooths out the overall electricity supply over time.\"\n\nPlanners can take advantage of this quality by coordinating wind and solar across the U.S., within a specific region, or even within the same power plant, Caitlyn Clark, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory researcher and co-author of a 2022 hybrid power plant study, told USA TODAY.\n\nIncluding other types of renewables brings additional benefits.\n\nFor instance, both hydropower and geothermal power can offer dispatchable power to the grid, which may reduce the need for storage in areas where these resources are available. And geothermal technologies can also reduce the amount of demand on the electric grid by providing direct heating and cooling in buildings, Amanda Kolker, the geothermal energy laboratory program manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY.\n\nDemand response: Incentives for using less power when renewables are producing less\n\nReducing demand, or at least moving demand around in time, is yet another key strategy for managing a renewables-dominated grid, experts say. This can be accomplished with demand response initiatives, which provide incentives for consumers to reduce power consumption during times of peak demand.\n\nThis can help shift demand to better coincide with peak wind and solar energy production.\n\n\"Right now our mindset is, 'There's demand for power out there and we have to create an electric grid to serve it,'\" Jim Robb, CEO of North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an electric grid regulatory authority, told USA TODAY. \"Another way to think about this problem is ... 'How do we shape the demand curve to take advantage of what the system naturally wants to produce?'”\n\nSuch programs have already been deployed to avoid blackouts on fossil fuel-dominated grids. For example, one Texas utility remotely accesses the thermostats of program participants and adjusts them by 2 to 4 degrees to reduce community power usage during peak demand or extreme weather. The participants receive financial compensation and can override the adjustments manually if they choose.\n\nA 2021 study found incentive-driven demand response programs have the potential to reduce the power needed during Texas summer and winter peak demand by 19,000 megawatts. That's about the same amount of electricity that would be generated during peak demand by 10 or 11 recently proposed new gas power plants, according to a press release for the study.\n\nIs it possible to power the grid with 100% renewables?\n\nWind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy produced about 20% of U.S. power in 2022. Researchers say that, through the right combination of the available strategies (tailored to different geographic areas), significantly higher levels are attainable in the near term.\n\nThis is true even when accounting for the increasing demand associated with electrifying other sectors of the economy, such as transportation.\n\nMultiple research groups have proposed models of renewables-dominated systems. For example, Jacobson and his colleagues modeled a grid that would run on 100% solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal and wave power and storage by 2050.\n\nMai and other researchers modeled various scenarios where a combination of wind, solar, hydropower and storage could contribute up to 95% of electricity by 2035, with fossil fuels and nuclear making up much of the rest.\n\nHowever, he said including nuclear and fossil fuels in this mix doesn't mean those power sources are intrinsically necessary to “back up” a renewables-driven grid, as some have claimed.\n\n“When we do our research over what a 100% renewable or low-carbon grid would look like, we often find lots of solutions that we think may work,” Mai said. “There are really no pure technical challenges where if you hit ‘X’ percent (renewables), it can't be done. Or at least we have not found such a case.\"\n\nBeing smart about grid design\n\nThe speed at which a reliable grid driven by 100% renewable power – or close to it – can be built out isn’t just a technological question, Mai said. Political will, economics, supply chain strength, policy decisions and planning decisions very much determine how quickly the future low-carbon grid can be constructed and how reliable it will be.\n\nAnd careful planning that accounts for all the variables is key.\n\nFor instance, substantial new transmission infrastructure will be necessary to build out a reliable renewables-driven grid, Mai said. However, permitting for new transmission lines is difficult, and some proposed transmission projects (as well as some solar and wind projects) have met resistance due to social, cultural, ecological and wildlife impacts.\n\nThis conflict has created tension around the future of the grid, but Jacobson said the amount of transmission necessary to support reliability is somewhat flexible. Additional storage could make up for less-than-ideal transmission infrastructure.\n\nSmart transmission technologies and advanced conducting materials can also help reduce the amount of new transmission needed by allowing planners to use existing transmission infrastructure more efficiently, according to Brad Klein, an attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, who co-authored the center’s 2021 report on the subject.\n\nFor example, the amount of power that can be sent through a given transmission line is determined by weather and temperature, but planners currently limit the amount of transmitted power based on conservative worst-case weather conditions, Klein said. Smart dynamic line rating technology can be used to quickly adjust the amount of power flowing through wires based on real-time weather data − allowing more power flow when conditions are ideal.\n\nWhile new transmission projects may take a long time to be built, smart grid tech can be deployed now to make the existing grid better equipped to disperse renewable power, according to Klein.\n\n“It's a way to do things better, cheaper, faster and with less environmental impact and less controversy and less land use dispute,” he said. Additionally, smart tech deployment would let the “new transmission facilities we build operate more efficiently, so we can ‘right size’ the amount of new transmission we need and avoid overbuilding.”\n\nWhatever the balance of transmission, storage and other strategies ends up being implemented, a grid dominated by wind and solar must also use new techniques to deal with electrical disturbances such as faults or grid frequency fluctuations, Robb said.\n\nCurrently, mechanical components in gas, coal, nuclear, hydropower and geothermal plants help the grid adjust when there is a disturbance, but solar and wind power plants lack these components.\n\nTo maintain reliability, replacement technologies that can help grid operators respond to problems must be widely incorporated into wind and solar plants or elsewhere on the grid before too many coal and gas plants go offline, according to Robb.\n\n“The way I describe it is that we inherited our grandfather's electric system,” he said. \"We're going to create an electric system we're going to leave for our grandchildren. And it's going to be very, very different.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/03/hershey-beer-sassafras-sickness-demolition-mystery-news-around-states/40237133/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A woman previously charged with voter fraud has been appointed to a county elections board by Gov. Kay Ivey. News outlets report Ivey appointed 79-year-old Rosie Lyles to the Hale County Board of Registrars on Friday. Lyles was charged with four counts of voter fraud in 2007 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of possession of a forged instrument. Ivey press secretary Gina Maiola says the governor didn’t know about the conviction and hadn’t done a background check before the appointment. She says background checks aren’t typical for such appointments. Secretary of State John Merrill, the state’s top election official, says his office is investigating the appointment. He says it appears Lyles can serve as registrar, however, as her conviction wasn’t a felony.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The state Department of Education has launched an online tool aimed at providing families the ability to assess data from public schools. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports the tool is called The Compass: A Guide to Alaska’s Public Schools. Education Commissioner Michael Johnson says its purpose is to present data to families in an engaging and helpful way. The online portal lets users select a school and view data points about it. Johnson says the site gives people an opportunity to compare schools across the state. “This is just the start. We want to continue working on the website,” Johnson says. The department will update data as it receives new information and will review feedback to determine how the portal will be shaped.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A baby javelina is recovering after a jaunt on a freeway. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says the young javelina was one of two that brought traffic on State Route 51 to a standstill Monday afternoon. DPS officials say several troopers tried to round up the animals, which were on the northbound lanes. Trooper Martin Sotelo managed to wrangle one javelina. The other ran off and eluded capture. The rescued javelina was transported to Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center in Scottsdale for medical treatment. Javelina, which look like wild boar, are native to desert environments.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: United States Steel Corp. is buying a minority stake in an Arkansas-based steel company for $700 million. Big River Steel announced Tuesday that it had entered into an agreement with the Pittsburgh-based corporation. Under the agreement, U.S. Steel will hold a 49.9% ownership interest in Big River Steel and will hold an option to acquire the remaining 50.1% within the next four years. Big River Steel began operations at its $1.3 billion mill in Osceola in 2017 and last year announced an expansion of the facility that will add 500 new jobs. The plant was Arkansas’ first “superproject” under a 2004 constitutional amendment that allowed the state to borrow money to help lure major employers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mayor has told department heads they cannot investigate the possible ties of city contractors to the National Rifle Association, prompting the gun-rights group to declare victory in its ongoing fight with the liberal city. Mayor London Breed issued the advisory Sept. 23, a few weeks after the Board of Supervisors passed a resolution labeling the NRA a “domestic terrorist organization” and calling on the city to take steps to assess possible ties between its contractors and the organization. In a memo cowritten by the city attorney, Breed wrote that the board can only enact new contracting requirements by ordinance. Resolutions have no legal weight. William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, said Tuesday that the memo is a “clear concession” to a lawsuit filed in federal court against the city in response to the resolution.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A local man has agreed to settle with federal officials after convincing investors to give him tens of millions of dollars in a cattle and marijuana Ponzi scheme. The Denver Post reports that Mark Ray agreed to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end the agency’s fraud investigation. Authorities say Ray channeled more than $140 million to pay off prior investors and his own medical bills, private flights and herd of show cattle from 2014 to March. Federal authorities say Ray consented to having his assets frozen, but he didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement. Authorities say the business Universal Herbs was in deep debt, and detailed descriptions of the cattle and feedlots were mostly lies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWindsor Locks: A World War II-era plane with 13 people aboard crashed and burned at the Hartford airport after encountering mechanical trouble on takeoff Wednesday, killing seven. The four-engine, propeller-driven B-17 bomber struggled to get into the air and slammed into a maintenance building at Bradley International Airport as the pilots circled back for a landing, officials and witnesses said. Some of the survivors of the crash were critically injured, authorities said. One person on the ground was also hurt, and a firefighter involved in the response suffered a minor injury. The vintage bomber – also known as a Flying Fortress, one of the most celebrated Allied planes of World War II – was used to take history buffs and aircraft enthusiasts on short flights, during which they could get up and walk around the loud and windy interior.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware says it’ll decrease its rates on the Affordable Care Act marketplace by nearly 20%, marking the first time rates have dropped after years of steady increases. Reduced premiums will be funded by millions of state and federal dollars, including a small fee taken from all commercial insurers. The rate relief comes as a state report showed the cost of monthly marketplace premiums doubled from 2014 to 2018, causing thousands of residents to drop coverage and insurers to drop out. Highmark is the only insurer left. Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro also credits Delaware’s newly approved reinsurance program with helping reduce rates. The program will cover some expensive ACA enrollees’ medical claims.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Court records say Whole Foods customers helped detain a man accused of filming under the skirt of a 13-year-old girl standing in a store checkout line. Citing D.C. Superior Court records, news outlets report Daniel Izquierdo, 25, was spotted standing “usually close” to the girl in March. Records say a witness noticed Izquierdo appeared to be filming under the girl’s dress and began yelling, leading customers to detain him until police arrived. Records say he refused to let police view any video on his phone. Police Chief Peter Newsham said at a news conference Tuesday that officers obtained search warrants and, with the FBI’s assistance, found the upskirting video, along with videos of 34 other women. Izquierdo was arrested Monday on voyeurism charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A South Florida eco-adventure park is hosting a Chinese lantern festival for the rest of the year. A Jungle Island news release says it’s opening Luminosa to the public this Saturday. The 18-acre park, located on an island between downtown Miami and Miami Beach, has partnered with Zigong Lantern Group and China Lantern International to create a nighttime jungle filled with giant illuminated lanterns made from colorful silk by Chinese artisans. Luminosa features lanterns shaped into animals, flowers and iconic Miami destinations. More than 1 million LED lights are used in the attraction. Luminosa will run from 5 to 10 p.m. daily until Jan. 8. Regular adult admission is $35.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked Georgia’s restrictive new abortion law from taking effect, following the lead of other judges who have blocked similar measures in other states. The law signed in May by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp bans abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present, with some limited exceptions. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realize they’re expecting, according to a legal challenge. The law had been scheduled to become enforceable Jan. 1. Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights in June filed a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Georgia abortion providers and an advocacy group.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A park development project has been delayed following the discovery of a possible artifact on the grounds. Mayor Kirk Caldwell halted the project at Waimanalo Bay Beach Park on Tuesday while officials wait for further information from the State Historic Preservation Division and the Oahu Island Burial Council. The discovery of an artifact of historical value could hold up a $1.43 million development at the Oahu park, commonly known as Sherwood Forest. The planned construction of a multipurpose field, 11-stall parking lot and playground has sparked demonstrations and a lawsuit to block the development. Experts determined the object is “basalt of a lava dike.” The burial council is scheduled to discuss the object at its Oct. 9 meeting.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials plan to round up nearly all the wild horses in a south-central Idaho wild horse area so the population can be brought down and maintained at about 50 horses. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said Tuesday that it has approved an environmental analysis that includes using fertility control on 25 female horses that would be released back into the wild. The agency estimates the population at the Saylor Creek Herd Management Area, about 15 miles south of Glenns Ferry, will be about 170 horses by summer 2020. The agency says if the roundup occurs then, it expects to capture about 150 horses using a bait and water trap. Horses not returned to the wild would be prepared for the agency’s adoption program. It’s not clear when the roundup might occur.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will spend $2.7 million to make sure more residents are included in the 2020 census. It’s an effort Mayor Lori Lightfoot says is driven in large part by an effort to combat fear created by the Trump administration’s immigration raids. At a news conference Tuesday, Lightfoot announced what she says is the largest amount of funding Chicago has ever committed to the census. She says despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision to block the Trump administration’s push to add a citizenship question to the census form, concern linger among immigrants and refugees that it is not safe to come forward to be counted. Lightfoot also says an accurate census is important because for every person not counted, the city stands to lose $1,400 per person per year.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Zoo reached a deal last month with the owner of the former GM stamping plant site to acquire dozens of acres that will allow the zoo to expand in the coming years. Ambrose Property Group donated 10 acres of land, and the Indianapolis Zoo bought another 161/ 2 acres of space from the former GM plant site, according to a Wednesday news release from the zoo. Later Wednesday, the city sent a letter to Ambrose threatening to use eminent domain to take ownership of the rest of the development site unless Ambrose reaches a deal to sell to the city. In a move that shocked officials, Ambrose announced Friday that it plans to sell the site after more than a year of preparations and hundreds of thousands of dollars of infrastructure improvements made by the city.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will end its 2019 fiscal year with a surplus of more than $289 million in its general fund, but Republican political leaders have been cautious about discussing where the money might be spent. Gov. Kim Reynolds says it’s a reflection of a vibrant economy, adding in a statement Monday that the state must be “mindful of the economic headwinds in our agricultural economy and be prepared for whatever the future might hold.” Farmers are facing a tough year with trade disruptions due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs and policies that have hurt corn and soybean markets, potentially cutting into state income tax revenue. The fiscal year ended in June, but the state posted its final budget figures at the end of September.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly is discounting Republican calls to rescind a policy requiring out-of-state online businesses to collect sales taxes on transactions in Kansas and remit the tax to the state. On Monday, Attorney General Derek Schmidt issued a nonbinding opinion that Kelly’s administration did not have the legal authority to impose the policy, which some experts said is the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting state and local taxes on online sales. House and Senate GOP leaders then demanded Kelly drop the policy, which the Kansas Department of Revenue issued in August. The tax collections were scheduled to take effect Tuesday. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports Kelly says the policy reflects existing state law and would promote tax fairness.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Matt Bevin wants students to celebrate a holiday Oct. 3 – and he isn’t talking about Mean Girls Day. This Thursday, Bevin wants kids to bring the Holy Scripture to class and take part in “Bring Your Bible to School Day,” an annual event that encourages students of all ages to take the religious text into the classroom. “I would encourage you, please, don’t just bring your Bible to school, but read your Bible. Bring it, share it with others. If you have an extra Bible, bring it and share it with somebody who doesn’t have one, who maybe has never read this book,” Bevin said Tuesday in a video posted on social media. “Bring Your Bible to School Day” is sponsored by Focus on the Family, a national Christian organization that has frequently come under fire.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A planning committee in Caddo Parish has recommended setting aside up to $500,000 to move a Confederate monument. News outlets report the Long Range Planning/Special Projects Committee of the Caddo Parish Commission made the decision at a meeting Monday. The full commission is expected to vote on the proposal in early December. The monument stands outside the Caddo Parish Courthouse in Shreveport. Parish attorney Donna Frazier wrote to the United Daughters of the Confederacy in late August saying the group had 90 days to remove the monument. In a statement and letter released Monday, the UDC said Frazier hadn’t responded to a Sept. 5 letter from attorney Arthur Carmondy saying the 90-day notice is invalid. Frazier told the Shreveport Times she responded to the letter Monday.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The University of Maine System says it’s going to cover the full cost of tuition and fees for more than 1,200 members of the state’s graduating high school classes next year. The system made the announcement Wednesday as part of its “Maine Values You” outreach program. System Chancellor Dannel Malloy says the offer is evidence the state’s public universities “can proudly offer Maine students unmatched affordability” and access to higher education. System spokesman Daniel Demeritt says students will be chosen based on more than one metric and will first have to apply for financial aid. The state covered 1,142 students this year. Demeritt says the coverage of tuition will be available at UMaine campuses around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Property records show former Mayor Catherine Pugh, who resigned in May, has sold her home for less than half its assessed value. The Baltimore Sun reports records show she sold one of her two Ashburton homes for $75,000 to Boaz Alternative Energy and Technologies LLC in July. Property records list the home’s assessed value as $187,700. Pugh resigned in May under pressure amid a flurry of investigations into whether she arranged bulk sales of her self-published children’s books to disguise hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks. She’s still being investigated at the state and federal level. Pugh listed the home as her principal address but lived at a different Ashburton home.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge has cleared Harvard University of discriminating against Asian American applicants in a ruling that was seen as a major victory for supporters of affirmative action. In a closely watched lawsuit, a group called Students for Fair Admissions accused the Ivy League college of deliberately – and illegally – holding down the number of Asian Americans accepted in order to preserve a certain racial balance on campus. U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, however, ruled that Harvard’s admissions process is “not perfect” but passes constitutional muster. She said there is “no evidence of any racial animus whatsoever” and no evidence that any admission decision was “negatively affected by Asian American identity.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Police are looking into who demolished a house that a state lawmaker and her nonprofit group were planning to rehab for a needy family. Detroit police Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood said Tuesday that the case is being investigated as malicious destruction of property. Mayor Mike Duggan’s office said information shows the house on Minock in northwest Detroit was torn down on or around Sept. 20 but was not on a list of properties slated for demolition and was not in the pipeline in preparation to be razed. Democratic Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo has said the house was torn down without notice to her or her nonprofit group, Coalition to Integrate Technology and Education. The property was purchased last year for $1,000 from the Detroit Land Bank Authority.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Some midwives are warning that the state’s unregulated midwifery practices pose a danger to mothers and babies as home births rise. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that the state in 2000 recorded two planned home births. In 2018, that number jumped to 721. Minnesota and Utah are the sole states that don’t require midwives to obtain a license to deliver babies. Licensed home birth midwives must earn their Certified Professional Midwife credential from the state Board of Medical Practice. Tavniah Betts, a licensed midwife, says being licensed benefits families and midwives by providing access to filing complaints. Tracey Lapointe, an unlicensed midwife and the president of the Minnesota Midwifery Guild, says requiring licensing would diminish the supply of midwives while demand is rising.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Justice Department says a sheriff fired an employee because he had to be gone on military duty for extended periods. Coahoma County Sheriff Charles Jones says the employee was fired for “insubordination,” not for taking military leave. The department filed a civil lawsuit Monday against Coahoma County. It says Jason M. Sims Jr. of Batesville is in the Army Reserve and teaches leadership classes at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The suit says Sims started working for the sheriff’s department in 2014 and told his bosses he would need to take military leave. It says the sheriff’s office “demonstrated hostility” to that in 2016, then fired him in 2018. Jones says he’s “100% confident” the firing was unrelated to Sims’ military service.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: An inmate was executed Tuesday for killing a man in 1996 in a string of violence that included several other crimes, despite concerns that the prisoner’s rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection. Russell Bucklew was put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It was Missouri’s first execution since January 2017. Bucklew had twice previously been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that he might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. He breathed with help from a tracheostomy tube. His attorneys said a throat tumor could burst, causing him to choke and die painfully and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge is considering the U.S. government’s request to throw out a lawsuit by two women who say they were illegally questioned by border agents for 40 minutes for speaking Spanish in a convenience store. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris was scheduled to hear motions to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Ana Suda and Martha “Mimi” Hernandez on Wednesday. They say U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agent Paul O’Neill detained them in a parking lot in Havre last year in violation of constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizures. They are asking Morris to block the agency from detaining anyone based on race, accent or language alone and to award them an unspecified amount for damages. Attorneys for the agency say that it has sovereign immunity against damage claims and that the women are unlikely to be stopped again.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: An Air Force colonel says he and other officials are paying close attention to resident complaints about living conditions and repairs at off-base, privatized housing for personnel at Offutt Air Force Base just south of Omaha. Col. Gavin Marks, commander of the 55th Wing at Offutt, told residents Tuesday at a town hall meeting at a Bellevue school that he’s set up a new hotline to handle complaints. The Omaha World-Herald reports local complaints about mold, shoddy construction, slow repairs and street problems at the Rising View neighborhood west of the base echo those from other bases. At Offutt, inspectors found 96 homes with what inspectors described as “health and safety” violations, such as mold or lead paint. The leasing manager says all the violations have been rectified.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State policymakers have announced plans to explore potential legislation that would follow California in allowing state university athletes to make money from endorsement deals. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the Legislature does not meet again until February 2021, and Democratic state Sen. Yvanna Cancela says a formal proposal has not yet been created and is still in the research process as she looks for “a proposal that fits Nevada.” Cancela says the California bill is forcing other states to figure out how to compete with its recruitment practices. The Mountain West Conference didn’t respond to requests for comment. A NCAA statement says laws from different states would not level the playing field.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has made another pick for the state’s poet laureate, a few months after he abandoned his last choice following growing criticism of the man’s work and how he was selected. Sununu planned to nominate Alexandria Peary, of Londonderry, to be the next poet laureate, at Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting. She’s written six books, including “Control Bird Alt Delete.” Her newest book, “The Water Draft,” is to be published this month. Though he never formally nominated him, Sununu initially chose Daniel Thomas Moran, a retired dentist and former poet laureate of Suffolk County, New York, whom some said wasn’t qualified. The surfacing of a sexually suggestive poem Moran wrote about former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice only intensified the criticism.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A federal judge has agreed to block the state’s recent political donor disclosure law in response to a lawsuit brought by a think tank founded by the Koch brothers. U.S. District Judge Brian Martinotti granted the injunction Wednesday. Americans for Prosperity challenged the new law, which required political organizations and some nonprofits to disclose all spending over $3,000, up from $1,600. The law also mandated that contributors giving more than $10,000 would be disclosed. The group said the law was unconstitutional on its face and could ruin organizations. The state argued the bill was aimed at showing who was “pulling the strings” in politics. A spokesman for Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said the state is reviewing the decision.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A small lizard found among the dunes straddling New Mexico and West Texas in one of the nation’s richest oil basins is at the center of a legal complaint filed Tuesday. Environmentalists want the U.S. government to add the dunes sagebrush lizard to the endangered species list as part of a fight that stretches back to the Bush and Obama administrations and could affect part of the multibillion-dollar energy industry in the Permian Basin. The Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife filed the complaint in federal court in Washington. It follows a listing petition that the groups submitted in May 2018. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had 90 days to consider the petition and initiate a review of the species if necessary, but the groups say the agency failed to take action.\n\nNew York\n\nWoodstock: The Woodstock Film Festival this year will feature an appearance by actor Matt Dillon. The 20-year-old annual festival runs Wednesday through Sunday in the Hudson Valley towns of Woodstock, Rhinebeck, Kingston, Saugerties and Rosendale. This year the event will showcase more than 50 features from around the world, short films, panels and live performances. Films being shown this week include Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” and “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” which won best screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival. Dillon is to take part in a question-and-answer session Saturday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMount Holly: A truck assembly company has announced it will lay off 900 employees between two Freightliner plants in the state in the coming weeks. Daimler Trucks North America, the parent company of Freightliner, confirmed Tuesday that about 450 employees would lose their jobs at the manufacturing plant in Mount Holly, and another 450 would be laid off at Rowan County’s Cleveland plant by Oct. 14. Daimler said in a statement the layoffs come as the truck market returns to normal levels after a year of record sales. Mount Holly employee Robin Jenkins told the Gaston Gazette some employees are scared because they don’t think they’ll be receiving severance, though other employees said they’re used to the “cyclical nature” of truck building.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The proposed presidential library for Theodore Roosevelt in western North Dakota now has a CEO. The board of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum voted Tuesday to appoint Edward F. O’Keefe to lead the organization. Gov. Doug Burgum calls O’Keefe “the best person” to take the proposed library “to the next level.” O’Keefe is a North Dakota native who is writing a book on Roosevelt, who spent more than three years in the state in the 1880s. Burgum has made the library a top priority of his administration. State legislators in April approved $50 million to operate the library, but that must be matched by $100 million in private money. O’Keefe will join Burgum and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt along with Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer on a tour of Medora on Thursday.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: The federal government says it received no bids during a competitive lease sale for coal underneath about 430 acres of Wayne National Forest. The Bureau of Land Management-Eastern States released the results of last week’s offering on Tuesday. Leases involved seven tracts in Perry and Morgan counties that contain an estimated 1.4 million tons of subsurface mineable federal coal. The sale came in response to a lease application by CCU Coal and Construction, formerly Westmoreland Coal Co., which already operates an adjacent privately owned underground coal mine. But the bureau said no one bid on the leases. Officials said the public will be notified if an additional request is ever made to offer competitive leases for the tracts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge made a $107 million miscalculation when he ordered consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million to help clean up the state’s opioid crisis, attorneys for the company argue in a court filing. The company also is asking for a reduction in the judgment based on pretrial settlements totaling $355 million that the state reached with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The company has separately appealed the court’s ruling to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, arguing that Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman’s ruling was an unprecedented interpretation of the state’s public nuisance law. A spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter declined to comment on the filing.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities suspect the bizarre deaths and mutilations of five bulls were caused by humans, but they have no leads. The deaths of the bulls recall mutilations of livestock across the West and Midwest in the 1970s that struck fear in rural areas. A former FBI agent who headed an investigation said there was no indication that anything other than ordinary animal predators were behind the mutilations. In the weeks since the dead bulls were found over several days in July, the Harney County Sheriff’s Office has received calls and emails with speculation about what, or who, might be responsible. Colby Marshall, vice president of the ranch that owned the bulls, says he suspects a cult is behind the killings. Ranch hands have been advised to travel in pairs and to go armed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPottsville: Soon on tap: a new brew featuring Yuengling’s nearly 200-year-old porter recipe and Hershey’s chocolate. The two Pennsylvania companies are teaming up on a limited-edition beer called Yuengling Hershey’s Chocolate Porter. The chocolate-infused brew will be available on tap beginning in mid-October at bars, restaurants and other venues in 13 states. It’s the first collaboration for Pottsville-based Yuengling, America’s oldest operating brewery. The company says the beer will have “rich chocolate notes” and recommends pairing it with barbecued and smoked meats, cheeses and desserts. The brew was in development for nearly a year. Yuengling expects it to last until February.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Providence: The town has built a public safety complex using its share from a settlement with Google. The Providence Journal reports the $27 million, 58,000-square-foot building now houses the North Providence police and fire departments. Rhode Island’s share of the 2012 settlement, about $230 million, is being distributed to police departments, the attorney general’s office and the National Guard. An investigation exposed Google’s role in the online sale of non-FDA-approved prescription drugs. The complex includes a courtroom, offices, dispatch center, training area, bunk rooms, crime laboratory, emergency operations center and cell block.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A former member of the board that oversees state highways will spend seven months in prison for trying to hire a prostitute just hours after he received probation for admitting he tried to derail an FBI investigation by destroying evidence. John Hardee, 72, was sentenced Wednesday after a psychiatrist hired by his lawyer suggested a mild form of dementia might have led him to text what turned out to be an undercover deputy offering $40 for a sex act. Hardee also asked for mercy, saying he has been with terrible criminals and heard horrible language used during his time in jail since his August arrest, according to media outlets. As he handed down the sentence, U.S. Judge Terry Wooten told Hardee he hoped the former official learned his lesson this time and pointed out even with the dementia diagnosis, the psychiatrist still testified Hardee knew right from wrong.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A group of truckers plans a “slow roll” protest in the state Thursday. Organizer Jeremy Johnson says the demonstration of a line of semi-trucks driving at reduced speed will loop around Sioux Falls and continue on to Pierre. He says the group will have a “slow roll” on Interstates 29, 229 and 90. The protest is a local response to a trucker demonstration planned in Washington, D.C., to protest federal legislation including proposals to limit truck speed, increase the minimum personal liability that truckers must carry, and mandate safety equipment to keep cars from sliding under trucks. The line of trucks will drive about 50 mph within Sioux Falls city limits and drive about 60 mph outside city limits.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Agriculture says a disease that kills sassafras trees has been detected in Dickson and Montgomery counties. The department is advising residents to be on the lookout for signs of laurel wilt disease. They include browning of leaves, leaf loss and staining in the inner bark. Those who suspect their trees might be diseased should contact the state Division of Forestry. Laurel wilt is a fungal disease transmitted by the wood-boring redbay ambrosia beetle. It can affect a range of plants, including sassafras and spicebush. State Forester David Arnold says in a news release that sassafras and spicebush are important ecological species in Tennessee. He says the disease is “another unfortunate example of an invasive pest impacting our forests.”\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The U.S. government has awarded three contracts worth more than $812.6 million for construction of about 65 miles of new border wall along the lower Rio Grande in South Texas. In a statement issued Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the contracts were awarded Sunday to two contractors. The wall projects are to include steel bollard walls of 18 to 30 feet in height, all-weather roads, lighting, security cameras and other technology in 19 separate segments in Starr, Hidalgo and Cameron counties. The statement said the walls will go up, starting early next year, where none now exist but not in areas prohibited under the CBP’s 2019 appropriation. The sector is the CBP’s busiest, accounting for about 40% of its immigrant apprehensions.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Gov. Gary Herbert has rescinded an emergency drought order nearly a year after it went into effect. The Daily Herald reports that persistent rain and snowfall this year have gradually put an end to statewide severe drought conditions. Almost 99% of Utah was experiencing at least moderate drought last year when the governor declared a state of emergency in October 2018. Herbert said it was affecting agribusiness, livestock production and wildlife habitats. But with a change in the weather this year, no area of the state has severe drought conditions, and the U.S. Drought Monitor shows parts facing moderate drought have dropped to 15%. Much of that area is in the southern part of the state, which has had a relatively quiet monsoon season.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre: The state Agency of Transportation has launched a new tool that will help bus riders track the location of buses and their arrival times as well as search bus routes and stops. The agency announced Tuesday that the Transit app, which can be downloaded to cellphones for free, shows the real-time bus location on any transit route operating in Vermont. Barbara Donovan, the agency’s public transit program manager, says that “our riders deserve this predictability and real-time information.” The agency says the app also has features for trip planning, navigation, notifications for bus service disruptions, and departure and stop reminders.\n\nVirginia\n\nWest Point: A high school teacher who was fired for refusing to use a transgender student’s new pronouns has filed a lawsuit. The Washington Post reports Peter Vlaming is suing West Point Public Schools, outside Richmond. Vlaming says his rights to speak freely and exercise his religion were violated. The suit states that Vlaming “sincerely believes that referring to a female as a male by using an objectively male pronoun is telling a lie.” The French teacher was fired in December . He had told superiors at West Point High School that his religion prevented him from using male pronouns for a student who had informed the school of his transition during the summer.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: State land officials have approved a land transfer to help conservation groups protect recreation areas on Blanchard Mountain. The Skagit-Valley Herald reports that the state Board of Natural Resources granted the approval Tuesday for the 2.5-square-mile area known as the Blanchard Core, which includes popular trails, campgrounds and lakes. Land officials say the transfer would be paid for with $10 million allocated by the Legislature in 2018 to become a state natural area. The transfer would be completed by putting sections of the Blanchard Core into the Common School Trust program, then paying the program the $9.2 million value of timber on that land. Officials say the $626,000 value of the land would be used to purchase new forest lands elsewhere in the state.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded $5 million to the Water Research Institute at West Virginia University for its rare earth recovery project. The project includes building a facility at a new acid mine drainage treatment plant near Mount Storm. Rare earth elements come from acid mine drainage sludge and are used to power things such as smartphones and the U.S. missile guidance system. The institute will partner with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Office of Special Reclamation, Rockwell Automation and TenCate Corp. in the project. About 15,000 tons of rare earth elements are used annually in the U.S., which imports nearly all of them. A bench scale pilot plant was opened in 2018 on WVU’s campus to test the feasibility of extraction and refining technology.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A man convicted of rape and murder when he was a teenager whose story was documented in the 2015 Netflix series “Making a Murderer” asked the governor for a pardon or commutation of his life prison sentence Wednesday. The request from Brendan Dassey came as his advocates launched yet another attempt to free him, this time outside the court system. His latest appeal was not considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. Dassey’s chances of getting a pardon from Gov. Tony Evers appear remote. “I am writing to ask for a pardon because I am innocent and want to go home,” Dassey said in a handwritten note to Evers that accompanied his application. Dassey also listed things he enjoys, including Pokemon and hamburgers, and drew a pair of hearts with the word “hugs” in one and “love” in the other.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife officials have introduced a detailed plan for review to scale back elk and bison feeding days by 50%. Jackson Hole News & Guide reports the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officially released the draft “step-down” plan Monday. Wildlife officials say the plan was intended to reduce elk numbers and make the animals more reliant on native vegetation, including strategies to wean the animals off alfalfa.

Officials say the plan is not open to being altered through the current public review process, but an accompanying environmental assessment is.

There is evidence that the claim has circulated on social media for years, but a May repost by Facebook user Vernon Adkinson recently went viral.\n\nOver 20 goals comprise the \"new world order\" the United Nations will focus on as part of its \"Agenda 21/2030 Mission Goals,\" according to the claim. Items on the agenda include one world government; a single cashless currency; government-owned and controlled schools, colleges and universities and an end to single-family homes.\n\n\"THIS IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY,\" Adkinson insisted in the caption. \"If you don’t believe it, a simple google search will take you to the U.N. website where you can access the document and read it for yourself. It is amazing (not) how well the Covid 19 plandemic ties in with Agenda 21/2030.\"\n\nAdkinson did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nWhat are the U.N.'s Agenda 21 and its Agenda 2030 mission goals?\n\nAgenda 21 was one of several agenda items for the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment & Development in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe agenda included 31 items addressing global social and economic dimensions; conservation and resource management; role strengthening for women, children and workers, as well as proposed methods of implementation.\n\nItems listed in the \"new world order\" do not appear in Agenda 21. For instance, there is no mention of currency. Terms like \"military\" and \"sovereignty\" also do not appear, though both are referenced in the \"new world order.\"\n\nMore:'No one is safe until everyone is safe': Vaccine nationalism threatens global coronavirus effort\n\nHowever, there are brief mentions of some of the items from the claim. The term \"central banking\" is present in reference to capacity-building in developing countries; it is not described as a \"world central bank.\" Property rights are also addressed, regarding protecting women's rights to property, but not an end to all privately owned property.\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2015 that is focused around achieving 17 goals within 15 years:\n\nEnd all poverty in all forms everywhere End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Reduce inequality within and among countries Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (acknowledging the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development\n\nTerms like \"one world,\" \"currency,\" \"military,\" \"family unit,\" \"5G,\" \"private transportation,\" \"air travel,\" and \"synthetic drugs\" are not mentioned in the 2030 Agenda, though they are listed in the \"new world order.\"\n\nThere are references to equal rights and access to land and other forms of property for poor and vulnerable men and women, full and permanent sovereignty over natural and economic resources for individual states and universal health coverage to include affordable vaccines for all. The 2030 agenda does not mention global sovereignty over these items as the claim suggests.\n\nIs the United Nations planning to institute a 'new world order' by 2030?\n\nThere is no evidence that the U.N. will establish \"one world government\" along with associated implications, such as a single military and currency.\n\nDaniela Gross, a spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary-General, told USA TODAY in an email that the claim is entirely fabricated.\n\n\"No, this is false. This is not a genuine UN document,\" Gross wrote.\n\nThe author of a 2014 report on Agenda 21 conspiracy theories, Heidi Beirichm, told AFP Australia in June that the \"new world order\" claim is a far-right hoax.\n\n\"That post is filled with all the bogus claims the far right has made against (Agenda 21) for a long time now,” Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said.\n\nMoreover, Agenda 21 and the 2030 Agenda are not legally binding. The latter is subject to each country's commitment. A frequently asked questions page states that \"implementation and success will rely on countries’ own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes.\"\n\nSimilarly, Beirich described Agenda 21 as a \"perfectly sensible planning paper, a nonbinding statement of intent aimed at dealing with sustainability on an increasingly crowded planet,\" in her 2014 conspiracy theory report for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. A claim suggesting the UN's Agenda 21 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will establish \"one world government\" has been debunked by experts.

The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.\n\nBut Russia’s war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv’s military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.\n\nA witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a “sudden clap” from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.\n\nLocal authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine’s Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a “terrorist attack” on peace and security “near the EU-NATO border.”\n\nThere were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO – unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.\n\n“Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,” Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. “Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.”\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,” Sullivan said.\n\nAmbulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nA senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia’s invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about reports of Russia’s request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, “I’ve never heard of that.”\n\nAs attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.\n\nZelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country’s delegation “has a clear task – to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nAmerican journalist killed in Ukraine\n\nHeavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain’s Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to “envelop” Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.\n\nRussian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia’s Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.\n\nBrent Renaud is pictured at the Peabody Awards Ceremony in New York City on 2015. Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nAmid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.\n\nRenaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.\n\nThe US State Department confirmed Renaud’s death on Sunday. “We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,” department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. “This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin’s indiscriminate actions.”\n\nSocial media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.\n\nTIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,” TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.\n\nUkrainians take to the streets to protest\n\nUkrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.\n\nResidents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation. From Telegram\n\nWaving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.\n\nIhor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show “Kherson is Ukraine” and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.\n\nBut the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city “can’t receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.”\n\n“Our main weapon is unity,” he added.\n\nIn recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the “Kherson People’s Republic.” If true, the move would mirror Moscow’s establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.\n\nPutin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.\n\nSchool demolished by Russian strike\n\nRussia’s air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.\n\nA school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.\n\nKim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. “Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,” Kim said.\n\nMissiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.\n\nIn the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been “massive shelling” of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.\n\nThe bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.\n\nUkrainian forces in Kyiv’s suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces’ attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Ukraine’s National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant’s electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.\n\nAs the devastation mounts, Zelenskysaid the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.\n\nMariupol’s city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.\n\nAs the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and “to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.”\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.\n\n“The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,” Vereshchuk said. “The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.”\n\nNew round of talks\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.\n\n“Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,” Podoliak said on Twitter. “Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.”\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.\n\nPodoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will “achieve concrete results.”\n\n“Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,” Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nThis comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said “significant progress” has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.\n\nTalks between Ukraine’s and Russia’s top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.\n\nIn Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.\n\nImages of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia’s riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.\n\nAccording to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Mohammed Tawfeeq Olga Voitovych Simone Mccarthy Tara John", "Tim Lister", "Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Olga Voitovych", "Simone Mccarthy", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/06/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Irpin, Kyiv family killed: Russian military strike hits evacuation route ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Russian military strike hit an evacuation crossing point in a Kyiv suburb Sunday, killing a family with two children and several other civilians trying to flee the Russian invasion, according to the city’s mayor, as civilian casualties seeking safety from the onslaught continue to rise.\n\nTwo mortar or artillery shells hit the checkpoint in the suburb of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said, which has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days.\n\nIrpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said eight civilians have been killed across the district, and international media filming at the checkpoint reported that a shell landed as a stream of civilians was coming through.\n\n“A family died,” Markushyn said in a statement. “In front of my eyes, two small children and two adults died.”\n\nVideo from the moment the strike killed a family shows a Ukrainian soldier standing outside a building on a street. Suddenly, an explosion is seen and heard on the video. Debris is heard raining down on the building and the street is obscured by a dust cloud. A number of journalists are heard reacting to the strike.\n\nAs the scene begins clearing, someone is seen pulling the Ukrainian soldier away. Other soldiers run across the street and appear to be checking the condition of a number of individuals on the ground.\n\n“Medic,” someone is heard repeatedly screaming.\n\nPhotographs from the Associated Press showed bodies on the ground covered by sheets, with suitcases standing upright nearby. CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video.\n\nThe Kyiv Regional Military Administration appealed to international organizations for help in resolving a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\n“Thousands of people found themselves in isolation, because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,” it said.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that more than 360 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely “considerably higher.” CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. The UN also reports more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24.\n\nEvacuation corridors closed\n\nIn the country’s southeast, hopes that a second attempt to open up safe evacuation routes for civilians in Mariupol and Volnovakha might succeed – after a first effort failed on Saturday – were dashed within hours.\n\nThe governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook on Sunday that the planned “evacuation convoy with local residents was never able to leave Mariupol today: the Russians began to regroup their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions.”\n\nKyrylenko added that a convoy carrying humanitarian aid from the central city of Zaporizhzhia, three hours from Mariupol, “has not yet reached its destination and is currently on its way.”\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said Sunday’s planned evacuation in Mariupol had failed.\n\n“Today, our team began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. We remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts – if the parties reach an agreement, which is for them alone to implement and respect,” the ICRC said on Twitter.\n\n“People in Mariupol and in other places across #Ukraine are living in desperate situations. They must be protected at all times. They are not a target. People urgently need water, food, shelter. The basics of life. We need safety guarantees to be able to bring them aid.”\n\nUkrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun claimed Sunday that Russian forces had damaged a gas pipeline in southeastern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without heat in bitter temperatures.\n\n“Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged by #Russian occupants. Now, more than 750,000 of people are left without any heat, while it’s still often below 0°C (32 degrees Fahrenheit) outside,” Sovsun said on Twitter.\n\nSeparately, television and radio broadcasts have been knocked out in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, after Russian military strikes, according to the Regional Administration.\n\nIn a post on Facebook Sunday, the Regional Administration said “repeated shelling” of the TV tower in Kharkiv had knocked out broadcasting capabilities.\n\nRussia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine.\n\nEarlier Sunday, heavy shelling was reported to the west and northwest of Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard by CNN teams in Kyiv and in rural areas to the southwest.\n\n“They (Russian troops) captured Hostomel and Bucha yesterday (Saturday). The Russians entered there,” said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in the Ukrainian President’s Office, referring to two suburbs northwest of Kyiv. “They have injured many children and do not allow to evacuate them, despite numerous appeals at the highest state level to provide a ‘green corridor’ from Bucha and Irpin. There are many children in the basements.”\n\nArestovych described the situation as a “catastrophe,” adding that discussions were going on “at the highest level with international humanitarian institutions, through mediators with the Russians” in order to find a way out for those who are trapped.\n\nSeveral children have died, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Health.\n\nSeparately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Sunday that Russia was preparing to bomb the Black Sea port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and said the airport in Vynnytsia, in the west of the country, had been destroyed by a rocket strike.\n\nIn an address broadcast on Facebook, Zelensky said: “Russian people always used to come to Odessa and they only knew warmth and generosity and what’s now? Artillery, bombs against Odessa. This will be a war crime. This will be (a) historic crime.”\n\nIn a separate message, Zelensky again appealed for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, following the destruction of Vynnytsia’s airport.\n\n“They continue to ruin our infrastructure our life, which we have built, and our parents, and grandparents, many generations of Ukrainians. We repeat every day – close the skies over Ukraine,” he added.\n\nUS and European officials have been discussing how the West would support a government in exile helmed by Zelensky should he have to flee Kyiv, Western officials told CNN.\n\nThe discussions have ranged from supporting Zelensky and top Ukrainian officials in a potential move to Lviv in western Ukraine, to the possibility that Zelensky and his aides are forced to flee Ukraine altogether and establish a new government in Poland, the officials said.\n\nWestern officials have been wary of discussing a government in exile directly with Zelensky because he wants to stay in Kyiv and has so far rejected conversations that focus on anything other than boosting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, two Western diplomats said.\n\nCalls for more support\n\nAs the Russian invasion continues, Zelensky has reiterated his pleas for US and NATO assistance in establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine – a move which could prevent Russian forces from carrying out airstrikes against the country.\n\nBut there are fears such a move could be seen as an escalation, with Russian President Vladimir Putin warning on Saturday he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine as “participants in a military conflict.”\n\nZelensky has repeatedly asked NATO and Western officials to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but both say they oppose such a move.\n\nIn an impassioned call to US lawmakers Saturday, Zelensky also encouraged Eastern European nations to provide Ukraine with fighter jets, stressing they were needed to defend against Russian aggression.\n\nOn the call, Zelensky said if the West won’t impose a no-fly zone they should give Ukraine planes.\n\nA White House spokesperson confirmed the United States is working with Poland on the possibility of Warsaw providing fighter jets to Ukraine. Some Biden administration officials privately fear that this move could be viewed by the Russians as an escalation, US officials say.\n\nMeanwhile, a multinational effort to send weapons to Ukraine is running at top speed at an undisclosed airfield in Eastern Europe, a defense official said. The US European Command is at the heart of the operation, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley met last week with troops and personnel to examine the weapons shipments activity, the official said.\n\nSince the invasion, 14 countries have sent security assistance to Ukraine, a senior US defense official said Friday, some of which had rarely sent such substantial equipment before.\n\nPutin claimed Saturday that Russia had almost completed the destruction of Ukrainian air defense systems, and added that Western sanctions were the “equivalent of a declaration of war.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has seen “very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians” in Ukraine that would be considered a war crime.\n\nHe added that the US is working with its allies in Europe to look into the possibility of banning Russian oil imports in an effort to further punish the country for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Josh Pennington Luke Mcgee Radina Gigova", "Tim Lister", "Josh Pennington", "Luke Mcgee", "Radina Gigova"], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-evacuations-03-09-intl/index.html", "title": "Mariupol: Russia's bombing of maternity and children's hospital an ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian forces bombed a maternity and children’s hospital in southern Ukraine, authorities there said Wednesday, an attack described by the country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as an “atrocity.”\n\nThe attack came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate a number of towns and cities.\n\nMariupol city council posted a video of the devastated hospital in the city and accused Russian forces of dropping several bombs on it from the air.\n\n“The destruction is enormous,” said the council. “The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed.”\n\nPolice in the Donetsk region said that according to preliminary information at least 17 people were injured, including mothers and staff, as a result of the attack.\n\nZelensky repeated his call for the NATO military alliance to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as he expressed his outrage at the attack.\n\n“Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,” he said on Telegram.\n\n“Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,” Zelensky said, adding, “People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!

Video from the hospital after the bombing clearly showed there were both patients and staff there, including heavily pregnant women who were carried from the hospital.\n\nThe hospital attack received international condemnation, with the United Nations saying it would follow up “urgently” on the “shocking reports,” and that healthcare facilities hospitals and health care workers should not “ever, ever be a target.”\n\nA city administration building and a university in Mariupol, less than a kilometer from the bombed-out hospital, has been identified by CNN as a second location in the city hit by an apparent Russian military strike.\n\nImages on social media show significant destruction at the University and City Council Building.\n\nThe strategic port city of Mariupol on Ukraine’s southeast coast has been under siege for days and has been “isolated” by Russian forces, a senior US defense official said Tuesday.\n\nRussia continues to bombard Mariupol and its troops are not inside the city “in any significant way,” added the official. Two officials said Wednesday that about 1,300 civilians there have been killed since the Russian invasion began.\n\nResidents have been cut off from water and electricity for days, and on Tuesday Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of committing war crimes by holding 300,000 civilians “hostage.”\n\n“The situation in Mariupol is desperate,” Mirella Hodeib, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told CNN on Monday.\n\nUkrainian emergency workers carry an injured pregnant woman outside of a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, on Wednesday, March 9.

Currently, 50 buses are blocked by Russian military in the parking lot,” the post read.\n\nAn attempted evacuation from Demidova, a town north of Kyiv that was not among the agreed corridors, ran into trouble. One police officer was killed and two more people seriously injured during an attempted evacuation of civilians, according to regional authorities.\n\nA downed Russian Sukhoi Su-25 assault aircraft pictured in Kharkiv on Tuesday. Sergey Bobok/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the east, it was impossible to evacuate civilians from the town of Izium “as we constantly hear explosions,” said Oleh Syniehubov, administrative head of Kharkiv region.\n\nHowever, greater progress appeared to be made in organizing buses to get people out of the central city of Enerhodar,as well as Irpin and Vorzel.\n\n“The evacuation from the city continues,” wrote Оleksandr Markushyn, mayor of Irpin, on Facebook. “There are buses in the center of Irpin. We are evacuating as many people as possible.”\n\nIn Vorzel, all of the children that had been stranded in an orphanage have been evacuated, as has the local maternity hospital, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser in the president’s office.\n\nAt least 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, the UN estimates. But millions more remain trapped in towns and cities that have come under sustained attacks by Russian forces in recent days.\n\nAnd on Tuesday Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov claimed more than 400 civilians have been killed, including 38 children, with the real death toll expected to be higher.\n\nReznikov accused Russia of “a real act of genocide” and “war crimes,” claiming that Russian forces had fired on the evacuation corridors.\n\nA young girl pictured in a shelter in Mariupol. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nKharkiv encircled\n\nThe city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine is encircled by Russian forces and continues to suffer heavy shelling, the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kharkiv Mayor Igot Terekhov told CNN the situation was “difficult” and there was “constant shelling from heavy artillery” on residential neighborhoods and civilian infrastructure.\n\n“They’re hitting our water and heating and gas supply,” said Terekhov. “They’re trying to interrupt our power supplies.”\n\nKharkiv is home to 1.5 million people, said Terekhov, adding that utility services were working to keep people warm as cold weather approaches.\n\nTerekhov said he regards indiscriminate shelling as “an act of genocide.” He added that any aid or assistance would be gratefully received, and expressed hope about the ultimate outcome.\n\n“I am absolutely confident that we will defeat the Russians,” he added.\n\nTania Boyko, 20, pictured with her dog Kari sheltering in a Kyiv metro station on Tuesday.

Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka, Vorzel - residents of these settlements are forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food. The occupiers do not give humanitarian corridors, do not give guarantees,” Kuleba said, naming five districts to the north and west of Kyiv.\n\nOn Wednesday, these five districts were named among evacuation corridors agreed by Ukraine and Russia.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Zelensky repeated his call for military intervention from Western allies.\n\n“Ukraine has been saying this to its partners from the first day of the war: If you don’t close the skies, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a massive humanitarian catastrophe,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has meanwhile announced that it will ban exports on key agricultural goods, including wheat, corn, grains, salt, and meat, after passing a cabinet resolution Tuesday.\n\nUkraine’s minister of agrarian policy and food, Roman Leshchenko, said the steps had been taken “to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine” and “meet the needs of the population in critical food products.”", "authors": ["Jack Guy Tim Lister Olga Voitovych Paul P.

Why this cruelty that the world has witnessed in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army?” Zelensky asked lawmakers.\n\nLocal police said in a statement that the rockets struck a temporary waiting room, where “hundreds of people were waiting for the evacuation train.”\n\n“This is another proof that Russia is brutally, barbarically killing the civilian Ukrainians, with one goal only – to kill,” the mayor of Kramatorsk said in a statement.\n\nThe mayor said that some 8,000 people per day were going to the station to evacuate during the last two weeks. As many as 4,000 people were there when the missile struck.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the attack a “deliberate slaughter.”\n\n“Russians knew that the train station in Kramatorsk was full of civilians waiting to be evacuated,” he said.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement Friday calling the missile strike a “provocation,” in a statement that mirrored recent denials of the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.\n\n“All the statements of representatives of the Kyiv nationalist regime about the alleged ‘missile attack’ by Russia on April 8 at the railway station in Kramatorsk are a provocation and absolutely do not correspond to reality,” the statement said.\n\n“On April 8, the Russian armed forces did not conduct or plan any artillery fires in the city of Kramatorsk. We emphasize that the Tochka-U tactical missiles, the wreckage of which was found near the Kramatorsk railway station and published by eyewitnesses, are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces.”\n\nUkrainian forces have the Soviet-designed Tochka missile in their inventory but it has also been used by Russian and separatist forces in the past.\n\nRussia’s military and senior officials have issued blanket denials of attacks against civilians, most recently claiming – without evidence – that the massacre of civilians in Bucha was staged.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said the Russian military used Iskander short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nCNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour said the attack was reminiscent of one on a marketplace in Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia, where “ordinary civilians were massacred as they just went about their business.”\n\nAmanpour said such attacks on civilians tend to harden Western resolve and could push the European Union to enact even more sanctions on Russia.

The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”\n\nEarlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.\n\nCNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well – as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.\n\n“Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,” the armed forces said.\n\nRussian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But “Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,” he said.\n\nRussia’s military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a “successful landing operation” to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv’s outskirts.\n\nZelensky’s comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.”\n\nBefore dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.\n\n“Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,” Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center.

Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.\n\nAs Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.\n\nHowever, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made “limited progress” Friday in its attack.\n\n“Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,” the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted.\n\nA senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have “about a third of their combat power” in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country’s borders right now, but “that does not mean that they will not commit more.”\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.\n\nA Ukrainian firefighter walks between fragments of a downed aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, February 25, 2022.

Oleksandr Ratushniak/AP\n\nFor now, Ukraine’s democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that “enemy sabotage groups” had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.\n\n“Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,” he said. “Such attacks on our capital haven’t occurred since 1941.”\n\nIn an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were “showing their true heroism” but that they were defending their country “alone.” The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are “not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,” he said.\n\nA few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. “There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” he said, speaking in Russian.\n\nShortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.\n\n“As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,” Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern “neutral status,” he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.\n\nZelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.\n\n“Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,” Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called “claims that we have refused to negotiate.”\n\nMeanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine’s armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.\n\n“Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,” Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. “Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”\n\nPutin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a “Nazi” or “fascist” regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.\n\nAsked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow’s plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: “Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being “simply crazy” in wanting to “come here to kill Ukrainians” – and vowed they would resist. “We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,” he said.\n\nA photograph taken on February 24, 2022 shows an Ukrainian infantry combat vehicle standing guard on the outskirts of Kyiv. DANIEL LEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHomes damaged\n\nThe advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions – and questions about Putin’s wider ambitions for the country and its capital.\n\nIt’s unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.\n\nTwo residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it’s not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.\n\nSeparately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.\n\nAs they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.\n\nOutside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.\n\nA CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.\n\nLow-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.\n\nA Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a “counter-offensive” was underway in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.\n\nMakeshift bunkers\n\nOfficials in the country believe Russia’s plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.\n\nThose fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he’s “convinced” Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.\n\nIf that happens, Blinken said he believes “Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses – and potentially worse – on the Ukrainian people.”\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 25. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine’s figures.\n\nBy the end of Thursday, Putin’s forces had launched “in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,” a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.\n\nA family takes shelter along with other Kyiv residents in an underground parking garage on Friday.

The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia’s actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.\n\nPolish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.\n\nPeople hide in a bomb shelter in Kyiv in the early hours of February 25. Sergei Chuzavkov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSanctioning Putin\n\nThe United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.\n\nThe EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have “maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.”\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia’s financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.\n\n“We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,” said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war.”\n\nThe alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.\n\n“We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,” Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have “deployed thousands more troops” to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.\n\nA big concern for NATO is whether Putin’s intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members – including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany – into a wider conflict on European soil.\n\n“You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,” said Blinken on CBS Evening News.\n\nBlinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin’s ultimate goals.\n\n“Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders.

So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails.

This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/europe/russia-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-maternity-hospital-strike-intl/index.html", "title": "Zaporizhzhia maternity ward strike: Newborn baby killed in Russian ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA two-day-old baby died in a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Vilnyansk in southeastern Ukraine on Wednesday, as Moscow ramped up attacks on civilian infrastructure nationwide.\n\nThe newborn child’s mother and a doctor were pulled from the rubble of the destroyed medical facility in Zaporizhzhia, as nearby private houses were also damaged in the devastating S-300 missile assault.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the shelling and accused the Kremlin of trying “to achieve terror and murder,” while first lady Olena Zelenska called the attack “insane.”\n\n“The enemy has once again decided to try to achieve with terror and murder what he wasn’t able to achieve for nine months and won’t be able to achieve,” Zelensky said, referring to Russia.\n\nA newborn baby died in a Russian strike on a two-storey maternity building in the town of Vilnyansk in the southern Zaporizhzhia region on Wednesday.

Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Kremlin has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukraine’s civilian power grid in an effort to leave the civilian population without electricity and heat – an act that would amount to a war crime. A senior US State Department official said Monday that a consistent pattern of Russian attacks on civilian elements in Ukraine was “deeply troubling.”\n\nIn a symbolic move that echoed Western leaders’ condemnation of Russia’s invasion, the European Parliament on Wednesday recognized the country “as a state sponsor of terrorism and as a state which uses means of terrorism.”\n\nThe EU Parliament called on the European Union “to further isolate Russia internationally” in a non-binding resolution, according to a press release.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the decision.\n\n“Russia must be isolated at all levels and held accountable in order to end its long-standing policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe,” he tweeted.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also on Twitter thanked the European Parliament “for the clear stance.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian authorities for comment.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq Olga Voitovych Andrew Carey Victoria Butenko Chris Liakos Eve Brennan", "Sana Noor Haq", "Olga Voitovych", "Andrew Carey", "Victoria Butenko", "Chris Liakos", "Eve Brennan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-11-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia widens attack on Ukraine's cities, striking western airfields ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussian forces launched multiple missile attacks on a wide range of targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Friday, striking airfields in the far west of the country and, for the first time, hitting the central city of Dnipro, to which Ukrainians from other embattled cities have fled.\n\nThe airport at Lutsk, some 70 miles from the Polish border, was reported to have suffered substantial damage in the attacks. The governor of Volyn region said four missiles had been fired from a Russian bomber and that two people were killed.\n\nPlumes of smoke also rose from the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Lutsk. It was previously struck by missiles on the first day of the conflict.\n\n“On the morning of March 11, high-precision long-range weapons attacked Ukraine’s military infrastructure. The military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk were put out of action,” the Russian Defense Ministry said Friday.\n\nThree Russian airstrikes also caused serious damage in and around the central city of Dnipro on Friday morning, killing one person, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in an official Telegram channel. One strike was near a preschool and an apartment building and another hit a shoe factory, causing a fire, the service said.\n\nMany Ukrainians evacuated in recent days from other cities under Russian fire had been taken to the relative safety of Dnipro.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Friday it remains “gravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraine” and called “for an immediate end to the attacks.”\n\n“Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas,” OHCHR spokeswoman Liz Throssell said in a statement.\n\nOHCHR said it has so far recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the invasion began on 24 February, “although the actual figure could be much higher.”\n\n“Schools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit – with hugely devastating consequences,” Throssell said. On March 3, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv and on March 9, a Russian airstrike hit a Mariupol hospital, injuring at least 17 civilians, she said.\n\n“We are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike,” she said. “We spoke to different sources in Mariupol, including local authorities, indicating consistently that the hospital was both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit.”\n\nEmergency workers tackle a fire in Dnipro, central Ukraine. State Emergency Service of Ukraine\n\nThrossell also said OHCHR has received “credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas.” The use of cluster munitions in populated areas is “incompatible with the international humanitarian law,” she said.\n\nElsewhere, in the southern city of Mykolaiv, heavy shelling erupted on Friday evening.\n\nSocial media videos showed fires in the area and Vitaliy Kim, Head of Mykolaiv Region Administration, said that there were “active hostilities near Guryivka,” to the north of the city.\n\nIn a series of messages on his Telegram channel, Kim said the bombardment amounted to “indiscriminate shooting at civilian targets,” including a cafe and apartment block.\n\nAnd in the southeastern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was seen on video being led away by armed men from a government building on Friday.\n\nThe prosecutor’s office for the separatist, Russian-backed Luhansk region now says they are weighing terrorism charges against him. Fedorov’s detention by the armed men is the first known instance of a Ukrainian political official being detained and investigated by Russian, or Russian-backed forces, since the invasion began.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry published a strongly worded statement on Facebook, calling Fedorov’s detention an “abduction” and a “war crime.”\n\nMeanwhile the number of people who have fled Ukraine continues to rise.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Friday that the number of people who have left the country has now hit 2.5 million.\n\nMany others are still trapped in dire conditions as Russian forces bombard multiple cities. Ukrainian authorities said there was limited success Friday in securing the evacuation of civilians from areas worst affected by the fighting.\n\nResistance persists\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, there is growing evidence that the town of Volnovakha, has finally fallen to Russian forces and their allies in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. The city had been surrounded almost since the beginning of Russia’s invasion but had been fiercely defended by Ukrainian forces.\n\nSome social media videos from the city showed Russian soldiers and vehicles in several neighborhoods, as well as abandoned Ukrainian tanks. Other videos showed widespread destruction in Volnovakha, and the Russian defense ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, claimed the town had been taken.\n\nRussia has made some additional advances around the rest of the country in the past 24 hours, a senior US defense official told reporters on Friday.\n\nBut the French government painted a less than rosy picture of the Russian military’s progress.\n\nThe Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, “particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,” French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni told TV station France2 on Friday.\n\n“It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,” he said. “The Russian army is also caught up in a premature spring,” he added, with the defrosting ground causing mobility difficulties for the military.\n\nBritain’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday that Russian forces continued to make “limited progress” in advancing toward Kyiv – but could be preparing for a fresh attack against the Ukrainian capital in the coming days.\n\n“It remains highly unlikely that Russia has successfully achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan,” the ministry said in an intelligence update. “Logistical issues that have hampered the Russian advance persist, as does strong Ukrainian resistance.”\n\nFighting intensified to the northeast and east of the capital Friday, after the Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday.\n\nAn overnight airstrike on the Brovary district just east of the capital caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities. Ukrainian authorities also reported a missile strike on the town of Baryshivka overnight into Friday, some 45 miles east of the city.\n\nA satellite image taken near Berestyanka, northwest of Kyiv, appears to show resupply trucks and a probable multiple rocket launch deployment, according to Maxar Technologies. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nA Russian column that had been stalled for nearly two weeks outside Kyiv has now dispersed, according to Maxar satellite imagery from Thursday. The forces appear to be regrouping.\n\nAnd a western defense official confirmed on Friday that a third Russian general had been killed by Ukrainian forces. He was named as Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, and was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian defense ministry website. The official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict.\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that the invasion was being carried out successfully, despite claims from Western leaders that its military has encountered unplanned obstacles and resistance.\n\n“All is going according to the plan, we report to you here every day this week,” Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin at a televised meeting of the country’s security council.\n\nShoigu claimed that the Russian army has received more than 16,000 applications from volunteers in the Middle East wanting to join the war in Ukraine. He also asked Putin for more weapons to arm the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, including arms that Shoigu claimed the Russian army had seized from the Ukrainians.\n\nPutin supported both suggestions.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Gianluca Mezzofiore Paul Murphy Laura Smith-Spark Rob Picheta", "Tim Lister", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Paul Murphy", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}]}

She said the court took into account Griner’s partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail.\n\nPrior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech.\n\n“I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” Griner said. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom.\n\n“I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,” she added.\n\nAfter the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, “I love my family.”\n\nThe verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry.\n\nGriner’s lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal.\n\n“We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in the statement. “This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.”\n\nSpeaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole.\n\nGriner “is not doing fine today,” said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held.\n\nSentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations\n\nBrittney Griner plays during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Matt York/AP In pictures: WNBA star Brittney Griner Prev Next\n\nThe harsh sentence comes amid the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s saber-rattling with the US and Europe. The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely.\n\nCharge d’Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a “miscarriage of justice,” and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was “unacceptable.”\n\n“Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence “puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.”\n\nHe said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. “This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department’s,” Blinken said.\n\nIt’s now “up to the Russian side” on whether Griner’s conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\n“We’re still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they’re more empowered to do that, then so be it,” Kirby told reporters in Thursday’s White House briefing.\n\nKirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul and Brittney home.”\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia’s court proceedings are not legitimate.\n\n“This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,” he said. “What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback WNBA star's lawyers: cannabis was prescribed 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nLast week, CNN reported that the Biden administration proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, but US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer.\n\nThe Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.”\n\nGriner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.\n\nThe Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a “We Are BG” T-shirt, said after the game the verdict was devastating.\n\n“Nobody wanted to even play today,” she told reporters. “How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.”\n\nEarlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict “a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare” of her detention.\n\n“We are inspired every day by BG’s strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,” the statement reads.\n\nHead coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner’s sentence is “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s just heartbreaking,” the coach said. “To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.”\n\nIn a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.”\n\n“The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,” they said.\n\nDefense asked for leniency in closing arguments\n\nThe court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant’s cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason.\n\nIn closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued.\n\nEven if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor’s prescription, she added. She couldn’t have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said.\n\nBoykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication.\n\nBoykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, “Basically, it means that you are guilty.”\n\nThroughout the trial, Griner’s attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution’s case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport.\n\nHer detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.\n\nAfter she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.\n\nNo lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest.\n\nOn Tuesday, at the seventh hearing in her case, a defense expert testified that the examination of the substance contained in Griner’s vape cartridges did not comply with Russian law. Blagovolina also told CNN her team’s experts identified “a few defects” in the machines used to measure the substance.\n\nAt trial, Griner testified she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said.\n\n“We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said.", "authors": ["Anna Chernova Zahra Ullah Masha Angelova Chris Liakos Eric Levenson", "Anna Chernova", "Zahra Ullah", "Masha Angelova", "Chris Liakos", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-rights/index.html", "title": "The battle over abortion rights helps Kamala Harris find her voice as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has seized onto abortion rights as an issue all her own, cementing herself as the administration’s lead messenger on an area it hopes will resonate with voters at the ballot box in November – and beyond.\n\nHarris has spent the last several weeks traveling the country to meet with activists and state lawmakers about abortion rights in deep red and swing states and following the Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion. Even though a White House official said abortion rights are not a part of her official portfolio, the issue has given Harris some momentum after a first year in which the vice president found herself fighting off negative headlines, internal frustration and tough assignments that became political anchors.\n\nWith the midterm elections less than 100 days away, Indiana state Sen. Jean Breaux, a Democrat, told CNN Sunday she could see abortion rights as a chance for Harris to show off her leadership – both now and in the future.\n\n“I thought that there was something behind it for her, as well. That she was trying to position herself as a leader on this issue so that she could show America that she has the potential to lead and can articulate an issue that is resonating with voters all across the country,” she said after attending a roundtable event with the vice president last week.\n\nBreaux told CNN that still, she believed Harris is “sincerely concerned about abortion and the loss of abortion rights for women across this country” and White House officials and others downplay the idea Harris is making a political play by focusing on abortion. They argue she is only responding to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established abortion as a constitutional right.\n\n“This is not about the next election. This is about an assault on women’s reproductive rights. This is about an extreme Republican Party that is willing to dismantle freedoms and erode rights. I don’t think anybody’s thinking of it in a political sense,” said Cedric Richmond, who left his position at the White House to be a senior advisor for the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWhile there is no action President Joe Biden can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, Democrats and advocates have been pressuring the White House to do more on abortion rights. The White House has dismissed several progressive ideas to protect abortion access, including allowing abortion providers to work from federal property in states where the procedure is banned.\n\nAbortion rights have long been a prominent issue for Harris in her campaigns. When she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, she vowed, if elected, to require states with a history of restricting abortion rights to obtain federal approval before any new abortion law could take effect. “We cannot tolerate a perspective that is about going backward and not understanding women have agency,” Harris said at the time.\n\nShe’s bringing that same intensity to her discussions with state lawmakers about how to respond to the Dobbs decision, in which the conservatives on the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Aides say the vice president plans to be more visible on any topic that is front and center for the Democratic Party as November grows near. In particular, Harris will continue to elevate abortion rights, ramping up her travel to speak to the “urgency of the moment,” three months ahead of the midterms, aides say.\n\n“As a former local official, the vice president is keenly aware of the critical role these leaders play, especially now when it comes to protecting access to reproductive care,” Kirsten Allen, Harris’ press secretary, told CNN. “The vice president will continue to travel the country and meet with leaders and people on the ground to highlight what’s at stake and build coalitions to protect a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from government interference.”\n\nHarris finds her voice on the road\n\nThe vice president has been traveling from state-to-state this summer, sometimes making several trips per week since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade at the end of June. Harris has focused on deeply red and purple states like Florida, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania where state lawmakers have already put in place, or are discussing, newrestrictive measure to curtail or simply eliminate women’s access to an abortion.\n\nHarris will increase that already-ramped-up political travel over the next few months, with a significant number of trips focused on raising money for the DNC and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, according to a DNC official.\n\n“She has been intentional about going to places and calling out mainly Republican governors in a way that we really haven’t done up until now,” one aide said.\n\nHarris allies, who had previously criticized the administration’s use of the vice president, now herald President Joe Biden for positioning her in an effective way on an issue where she has “deep credibility.”\n\n“This is just an area where she has a more defined profile,” the White House official said, who noted her focused intensified after Harris gave a forceful pro-abortion speech at Emily’s List hours after the draft opinion leaked. “It was a confluence of events, ability and opportunity all in one.”\n\nThe official said Harris then tasked her office with providing her data about wider implications of the Supreme Court’s decision, such as the effects if could have in vitro fertilization (IVF), access to birth control and same-sex marriage.\n\nStill, these latest appearances are giving hope to supporters who may have questioned what happened to the fierce former prosecutor who made headlines grilling Republicans during high-profile Senate hearings.\n\n“If you think about her as a rising star in the party, that’s what people saw,” one person allied with Harris told CNN. “They’re like, ‘Yes, she’s a fighter for us.’ And so, her voice out there on this issue is helping both to literally fight the fight, but then also to mobilize voters and remind voters what she is uniquely adept at.”\n\nLess than 100 days\n\nThe roundtables with state legislators have been a winning model for the vice president, allies say, as it props up Harris’ ability to convene and organize, while also shining a light on restrictive policy proposals across the country.\n\nThey’ve also provided Harris with an avenue to show the skills honed over years as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, providing a more emphatic voice on abortion rights than the President, who has a complicated history on the issue.\n\n“I think on issues like this, it’s clear why they are a good pair,” one source close to Harris told CNN.\n\n“In this moment in crisis her unique history, credibility, and expertise is just invaluable both to the administration as well as the country,” said Karen Finney, vice chair of NARAL and Democratic strategist\n\nThe vice president has tasked staff, aides say, with putting more of a focus on engaging younger voters as November grow closer. And a source with a Democratic-aligned super PAC told CNN that their focus groups show that Harris is still a popular figure with Black voters, despite the general dip in approval rating for the President.\n\n“So that’s going to be an important angle down the road,” the source said, suggesting Harris be deployed to help Democrats in tight House races, such as Georgia’s Sanford Bishop or Ohio’s Amelia Sykes, who is vying for an open seat.\n\nThe vice president will start campaigning with a relatively new team around her, after a series of staffers departed her office. A source familiar with office relations says that quicker decision-making has streamlined coordination with the West Wing and the vice president’s office during the administration’s second year. One White House official credited Anita Dunn, who returned to the White House amid staffing changes in the West Wing, as responsible for some of the positive change.\n\nThat’s led to Harris becoming more of a public face than she was during her first year, doing more media interviews in 2022 than in 2021 and taken far more trips to tout the Biden agenda.\n\nAbortion roundtables\n\nHarris has held more than two dozen roundtables on abortion rights since a draft opinion previewing the overturning of Roe v. Wade was published in Politico in May.\n\nFlorida Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who has attended two roundtables with Harris in both Washington and Orlando and rode on Air Force 2, said, “I really have the genuine sense that she is wanting to hear what we are experiencing on the ground.”\n\nIn some ways, Harris has been trying to create a national message for Democrats – repeating at nearly every roundtable how “one does not have to abandon your faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making this decision” for women.\n\nBut advocates say Harris could be doing more, as they pressure the White House to be more aggressive on abortion rights legislation and meet the moment.\n\n“I’m really glad that the vice president is doing these things,” Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, told CNN at in an interview. “But we were asking for very specific things, and we need to see those delivered.”\n\n“It would be amazing to see her have a more forceful voice, to be able to say the word abortion unapologetically,” Sherman said, “to have her remind everyone in this country that everyone loves someone who’s had an abortion, and also to see the actions from the White House that match her energy.”", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/10/16/if-joe-biden-wins-election-2020-he-undo-trump-foreign-policy/5793763002/", "title": "If Joe Biden wins election 2020, will he undo Trump foreign policy?", "text": "For the last four years the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy from trade to immigration, and from climate change to North Korea, has been defined by its departure from convention. International treaties have been abandoned, allies ignored or scorned and the idea of U.S. leadership and credibility on the world stage tested.\n\nTrump has also claimed successes, such as withdrawing U.S. troops from overseas conflicts and acting as a broker for improved relations in the Middle East.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden has vowed to reverse many of Trump's decisions, but Biden's foreign policy might not give the world as much whiplash as some may expect.\n\nTrump vs. Biden: What each president would mean for the military\n\nHere's how a second term for Trump's foreign policy could be expected to play out versus a first presidential term for Biden.\n\nChina: Two courses, both set on confrontation\n\nUnder Trump: Trump has strained relations with China by characterizing Beijing as a threat to American security and prosperity. He has attempted to confront China in economic terms by pursuing an ambitious trade deal, an effort that suits his view of himself as a dealmaker. But the second phase of the agreement has stalled because of the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump has branded the \"China virus\" to the annoyance of Beijing, and over tensions connected to a security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong that tramples on the city-state's prized autonomy.\n\nThe early months of Trump's presidency saw him lavish praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping, but take little interest in China's expanding international ambitions, human rights record, aggressions in the South China Sea, or the need to cooperate on global issues, such as climate change. It's ultimately unclear how far Trump would be willing to push China and risk decoupling the world's two largest economies. He has imposed limited economic sanctions on China over Hong Kong and for rights violations in China’s campaign targeting Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region.\n\nOPINION: US must stop Chinese concentration camps\n\nUnder Biden: The veteran politician from Delaware is also likely to adopt a tough stance on China if elected.\n\n\"If China has its way, it will keep robbing the U.S. of our technology and intellectual property, or forcing American companies to give it away in order to do business in China,\" Biden said in a speech last year.\n\nBut true to his multilateralist instincts, and unlike Trump, Biden would almost certainly seek to \"build a united front of friends and partners to challenge China's abusive behavior,\" as he noted in that same address.\n\nBenjamin H. Friedman, policy director at Defense Priorities, a Washington, D.C.-based security think tank, said that while Biden would be \"tougher\" on China in terms of raising concerns about its human rights abuses against, for example, on Muslim minority Uighurs held in Chinese government-run detention centers.\n\n\"I'd expect a less confrontational rhetorical approach overall, meaning less bluster of the sort (U.S. Secretary of State) Pompeo specializes in, which tends to damage relations for no good reason beyond domestic political consumption,\" Friedman said.\n\nBiden himself has given an insight on how he would have handled China over its obfuscation over the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"I would be on the phone with China and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what's going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist,\" Biden said during the Feb. 25 Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina. He has called Xi a \"thug\" and vowed to slap aggressive economic sanctions on China if it targets American citizens and companies.\n\nTrade deals: Go-it-alone vs. international pressure\n\nUnder Trump: On his third day in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade agreement signed by President Barack Obama in 2016 after seven years of negotiation. Trump’s withdrawal from the pact set the stage for the hardline approach he would take against countries that he accused of taking advantage of the U.S.\n\nHe slapped tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to impose retaliatory levies on more than $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. The two countries eventually agreed to sign a limited new “Phase One” trade deal that called for China to boost its purchase of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over the next two years. But the agreement left unresolved other issues such as complaints that China subsidizes its companies to give them an unfair advantage over foreign businesses. Plans for a “Phase Two” trade deal to focus on those issues faltered as Trump’s relationship with Xi Jinping deteriorated.\n\nCloser to home, Trump kept his campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a quarter-century-old pact with Mexico and Canada. The new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, guarantees U.S. farmers greater access to Canada’s agriculture market, puts new e-commerce rules in place and dictates that a higher percentage of autos be made from parts manufactured in North America.\n\nUnder Biden: Like Trump, Biden argues that China must be held accountable for unfair trade practices and failing to live up to its commitments. But the former vice president has slammed Trump’s go-it-alone trade war and new trade deal with Beijing as “an unmitigated disaster,” arguing that they inflicted pain on American workers and farmers but did nothing to curb Beijing’s trade abuses. Biden has said he would take a different approach by rallying U.S. allies, such as Canada and the European Union, to modernize international trade rules and pressure the Chinese government and other trade abusers to follow the rules – and hold them accountable when they don’t. Though he has not offered detailed trade proposals, Biden’s economic agenda includes a $400 billion investment to buy more American-made products and services to reduce the U.S.’s dependence on China for certain goods.\n\nBiden backed free-trade policies during his three decades as a senator. He voted for NAFTA and, as Obama’s vice president, backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But Biden said during a recent television interview that the U.S.’s new trade deal with Mexico and Canada is an improvement over NAFTA. He also has said he would not join the Trans-Pacific Partnership unless parts of it are renegotiated. Biden, who has the backing of labor unions, has promised that organized labor would have a seat at the table when every trade deal is negotiated.\n\nClimate: No change vs. all change\n\nUnder Trump: Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on whether human activity is responsible for our warming planet and soon after taking office he withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate, which has been signed by almost 200 countries. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency, supported the development of new oil pipelines and weakened industry-wide automobile fuel-efficiency standards. He has blamed wildfires raging on the West Coast of the U.S. on forest mismanagement. He dropped the phrase \"climate\" from his administration's formulation of pressing national security threats. There is no reason to think Trump has had second thoughts or will reverse course on any of his climate-related policies in any second term.\n\nUnder Biden: In a Sept. 14 address, he said: \"I’ll bring us back into the Paris Agreement. I’ll put us back into business of leading the world on climate change. And I’ll challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments.\" Biden has vowed, \"on day one,\" to \"ensure the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050.\"\n\nFRACKING:What we know about the hot campaign topic\n\nCOVID-19: Shunning global collaboration or embracing it\n\nUnder Trump: The Trump administration has shunned international collaboration to confront the COVID-19 pandemic – a decision that experts say may harm Americans amid a global race to produce a vaccine. The president has begun to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization, and his administration is redirecting more than $62 million – money the U.S. owes the WHO – to pay other international dues. The president has also refused to join a global vaccine collaborative, known as COVAX, because it’s linked to the WHO. The coalition, which includes more than 170 countries, is designed to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to coronavirus tests, treatments and vaccines. The White House has defended the decisions, saying the WHO is \"corrupt\" and China has \"total control\" over the body.\n\nUnder Biden: Biden has said he would rejoin the WHO \"on my first day as president\" if he wins. \"Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health,\" he tweeted. Biden has also pledged to restore a National Security Council pandemic unit that Trump disbanded, strengthen the Defense Department and the CDC's disease overseas detection programs, and reengage in other alliances to make the U.S. a global leader in this crisis, among other steps.\n\nCOVID-19: The U.S. was the world's best prepared nation to confront a pandemic. How did it spiral to 'almost inconceivable' failure?\n\nIran: Deal or no deal?\n\nUnder Trump: In 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers and reimposed economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of an agreement aimed at blocking Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. While Iran has remained in the deal with the other signatories and insists it has no interest in acquiring a nuclear weapon, it has taken steps to loosen its compliance, such as stockpiling low-enriched uranium. Iran has also harassed naval and commercial ships in the Persian Gulf and stepped up its support for militants firing rockets at or near U.S. forces in Iraq. After the Pentagon assassinated top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in January, Tehran and Washington appeared to be inching toward an all-out military confrontation before both sides showed restraint.\n\nMichael Makovsky, a security expert and CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, a Washington-based pro-Israel think tank that argues for a tough U.S. approach to Iran, said that in any second Trump term the administration may seek to try to broker a new nuclear deal with Iran – something Tehran has repeatedly ruled out – but Makovsky thinks the \"strategic aim should be regime collapse.\" So do many of Trump's closest national security advisers, from Pompeo on down.\n\nUnder Biden: As vice president in the Obama administration, Biden was part of the team that negotiated 2015's nuclear deal with Iran. Biden has said that if Iran returns to full compliance with the deal he would re-enter the agreement \"using hard-nosed diplomacy and support from our allies to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran's other destabilizing activities.\"\n\nWhether Iran is prepared to resume the deal that Trump abandoned or would insist on modifications remains unclear. Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, referred a question on this point to comments made by Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Sept. 7.\n\n\"The path will be open to the U.S., whenever it decides to avoid making mistakes, and to compensate its illegal actions by returning (to the deal).\"\n\nIran's position has been consistent. In a USA TODAY interview with Iran's foreign minister in 2018, Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran would be open to talking to any U.S. administration about a new nuclear accord provided the U.S. started by first abiding by the one that has already been negotiated.\n\nIsrael: Favored support either way\n\nUnder Trump: Strong support for Israel has been a cornerstone of Trump's foreign policy. He relocated the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the holy city that Palestinians also see as part of their future capital, and overlooked Jewish settlement expansion on land claimed by Palestinians. He recognized Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, territory Israel seized from Syria in 1967. In January, Trump and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled a peace plan aimed at ending decades of hostilities between Israelis and Palestinians but it drew fierce criticism and was then ignored as it was developed without Palestinian input.\n\nMore recently, Trump has brokered a normalization of relations between Israel and some Arab states in the Middle East such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\n\n\"U.S.-Israel relations under a second term for Trump are likely to look a lot as they have over the past four years,\" said Michael Koplow, policy director of Israel Policy Forum, an American Jewish group that promotes a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. \"The Trump approach has been to support Israeli government policies and to isolate the Palestinians as a means of building pressure on them.\"\n\nKoplow added that toward the end of any second Trump term his administration would also likely \"green light\" some form of Israeli annexation of Palestinian areas of the West Bank.\n\nUnder Biden: Koplow said that U.S.-Israel relations under a Biden presidency would also remain strong but that his administration would likely seek a \"restoration\" of diplomatic relations and aid to the Palestinians and a firm stance against Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. He said a Biden administration would seek to build upon the Trump administration’s approach of fostering normalized relations between Israel and other Middle Eastern states but that there will be tension with the Israeli government over any potential nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\nKhaldoun Barghouti, a Palestinian journalist and analyst of Israeli affairs from the West Bank, said that Israel's \"honeymoon\" would continue if Trump is re-elected but if Biden wins Palestinians will still feel \"helpless and alone\" because the Democrat, despite publicly supporting a \"two-state solution to the the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, is unlikely to overturn actions taken by Trump, because successive U.S. administrations have failed to broker peace and because Israeli actions on the ground \"won't be stopped.\"\n\nNorth Korea: From ‘fire and fury’ to ‘photo-ops’\n\nUnder Trump: The U.S. came \"much closer\" to war with North Korea \"than anyone would know,\" the president told journalist Bob Woodward, whose new book recounts in chilling detail how then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis agonized over the prospect of a nuclear conflict with Pyongyang. But Trump embraced a policy of \"maximum pressure,\" developing a series of crippling sanctions against North Korea while threatening \"fire and fury\" against the reclusive authoritarian nation. Trump's next move – a series of showy summits with Kim Jong Un aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal – have not yielded concrete results.\n\nUnder Biden: The former vice president has blasted Trump's meetings with Kim as \"photo-ops,\" calling them a \"vanity project\" that have given the ruthless dictator undeserved legitimacy with no concessions in return. Biden has said he would end the personal diplomacy with Kim and increase sanctions on his regime in an effort to force real negotiations. He also says he would strengthen America's regional alliances with Japan and South Korea, and ratchet up pressure on China, to further isolate North Korea.\n\nRussia: Lots of love or back to basics\n\nUnder Trump: The president has appeared to be a big fan of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. He failed, for example, to press Putin over intelligence allegations that a Russian military unit offered Taliban-linked militants bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nWhen the 2019 Mueller report and 2020 Senate intelligence report described Russia’s attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election, the president denied the evidence and did not take action against the Kremlin.\n\nIan Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group think tank, argues that Trump's stance on Russia is a matter of individual inclination.\n\n\"Trump has been uniquely unusual in his personal desire to never criticize Putin, never criticize Russia,\" Bremmer said. \"I’ve never seen any foreign policy issues where the president has been more distant in orientation from pretty much everyone internally.”\n\nUnder Biden: The former senator places enormous value on America’s relationship with Europe and NATO. Russia objects to NATO forces being so close to its borders. Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia James F. Collins said Biden’s foreign policy toward Russia would be a “distinct contrast” from the last four years.\n\n“Biden is going to go back to a sense that America needs to work with allies,\" he said. Having a much stronger relationship with Europe means Biden would be able to coordinate pressure on Russia, in the form of sanctions against Russian state-owned enterprises and individual officials. A case in point: Trump has said little about the recent poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in August.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with the threats the Russian government poses, Biden and his administration would be in-step, said Bremmer.\n\n\"The administration would all be rowing in the same direction.\"\n\nMilitary: Should troops stay or go?\n\nUnder Trump: The current occupant of the White House has vowed to end America's \"endless wars\" in the Middle East and reduce the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Syria. In Afghanistan, Trump has advocated peace negotiations between the government and Taliban insurgents and said he would reduce U.S. forces by half, to about 4,000 by Election Day. In Iraq, he is bringing down U.S. forces to 3,000 from 5,200. About 500 U.S. troops remain in Syria, where they are confronting the Islamic State group. Trump has also brought some U.S. troops in Germany home and deployed others to Poland. But his administration has also sent dozens more ships and added about 14,000 troops to the Middle East to counter threats from Iran.\n\nHe has also overseen an escalation in the number of U.S. attacks by air to historic levels and continues to authorize counter-terrorism operations in far-flung locations such as Niger, Tunisia and the Philippines, even though studies show the U.S.'s biggest terrorism threat is from homegrown white extremists.\n\nIn Yemen, through arms sales of fighter jets and lethal drones, Trump has backed a Saudi Arabia-led war against Houthi rebels that has contributed to a humanitarian catastrophe and caused atrocities against civilians. It has led to calls for the United Nations to investigate claims of war crimes.\n\nMackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said the difference between Trump and Biden's approach to the military is to some extent a matter of degree. Both favor reduced American overseas involvement, she said, with Trump seeking a faster withdrawal than Biden of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Iraq and those based in friendly countries like Germany.\n\nUnder Biden: Todd Harrison, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said Biden would likely reverse course and keep the 12,000 troops Trump pulled out of Germany as a check against Russian aggression in Europe. While Trump has questioned the utility of keeping tens of thousands of U.S. troops in South Korea and Japan, Biden would also likely revert to a traditional U.S. stance supporting the presence of U.S. troops there.\n\nBig change on Cuba; status quo on Venezuela, Mexico?\n\nUnder Trump: The Trump administration has tried unsuccessfully to force Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro from power – assembling a broad coalition of countries to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s legitimate leader. The White House has used sanctions to cripple Maduro’s brutal regime, but Trump has also hinted that he would consider military action to oust the socialist leader.\n\nTrump has also taken a hardline on Cuba, re-imposing travel and trade restrictions that the Obama administration had loosened. The Republican president went further in 2019, allowing Americans to sue entities that had benefited from property confiscated by the Cuban government. Along the border with Mexico, he has vowed to push ahead with the construction of a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants.\n\nUnder Biden: U.S. policy toward Venezuela would not shift much in a Biden administration. The former vice president says Maduro is a tyrant and supports Guaido and has vowed to increase sanctions. But Biden says Trump’s approach to Venezuela has been “undermined by politicization, faulty execution and clunky sloganeering,” and U.S. sanctions “have been clouded by saber-rattling and misguided efforts to engage with coup plotters.” He has vowed more funding to help Venezuela’s neighbors cope with the ongoing refugee crisis.\n\nBiden would undo Trump’s hardline on Cuba. “I’d try to reverse the failed Trump policies, it inflicted harm on Cubans and their families,” Biden told a Miami TV station earlier this month. “It’s done nothing to advance democracy and human rights, on the contrary, the crackdown on Cubans by the regime has gotten worse under Trump, not better.”\n\nOn the border wall with Mexico, Biden has said: \"There will not be another foot of wall constructed (during) my administration.\"\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-poweroutages-friday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm's icy cold and wind knocks out power to over a million ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA massive winter storm battered the US on Friday with frigid temperatures, high winds and heavy snow, leaving at least nine people dead, knocking out power to over a million customers and wrecking holiday plans from coast to coast.\n\nThe storm – expected to intensify throughout Friday as it barrels through the Midwest and East – is making for grim road conditions with poor visibility and ice-covered streets.

Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time. The air will continue to get and feel colder, especially during night hours.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Ray Sanchez Eric Levenson", "Aya Elamroussi", "Ray Sanchez", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}]}

Ten Conservatives stood in the contest to replace him, and over five rounds of voting, members of parliament whittled those down to two.\n\nSunak won 137 votes and Truss got 113 votes in the final round, while Penny Mordaunt with 105 votes lost out.\n\nBoth of the final two candidates took to Twitter to comment on the result.\n\n“Grateful that my colleagues have put their trust in me today. I will work night and day to deliver our message around the country,” tweeted Sunak.\n\nFor her part, Truss tweeted: “Thank you for putting your trust in me. I’m ready to hit the ground running from day one.”\n\nNow about 160,000 rank-and-file members of the party will have their say, and in September the winner – and next prime minister – will be announced.\n\nBoth candidates who made it to the final two in the Conservative party leadership contest served in Johnson’s government, and could therefore be marred by the scandals that brought Johnson down.\n\nThe first was Johnson whipping his members of parliament to protect a political ally found to have breached lobbying rules, and ended with revelations that Johnson appointed as his deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, a man who’d been accused of sexual assault multiple times.\n\nThe best known scandal was “Partygate” in which Johnson and several political allies – including Sunak – were fined by police for breaching the government’s own Covid-19 restrictions. This made Johnson the first premier in history to be found guilty of having broken the law in office.\n\nThe task facing the final two candidates is enormous enough, with the UK suffering a cost-of-living crisis and the Conservative Party increasingly unpopular after 12 years in power. And as soon as the new leader takes over, the opposition Labour Party will be only too willing to remind whoever succeeds Johnson that they were part of that government.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson attended his final Prime Minister’s Questions session in the House of Commons. He boasted about his government’s response to the pandemic and his support of Ukraine in its defense against Russia.\n\n“We’ve helped, I’ve helped, get this country through a pandemic and help save another country from barbarism. And frankly, that’s enough to be going on with. Mission largely accomplished,” Johnson said. “I want to thank everybody here and hasta la vista, baby.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Hasta la vista, baby': Boris Johnson bows out to lawmakers' applause 01:38 - Source: CNN\n\nThe final round of the leadership race took place amid a record-breaking heatwave, which sparked wildfires and highlighted the UK’s under-preparedness for the climate emergency as well as the need for urgent measures to curb carbon emissions.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the two final candidates:\n\nSunak served as the UK's finance minister from 2020-2022. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nSunak has been considered the frontrunner for a long time. He served as Johnson’s Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) from 2020 to 2022, and gained a largely positive public profile after introducing popular measures during the coronavirus pandemic, such as the furlough scheme and discounts on eating in restaurants.\n\nHe has recently come under pressure over questions regarding the tax status of his wife, Akshata Murthy, a multi-millionaire who is domiciled in India.\n\nSome Conservatives were worried that Sunak found this level of scrutiny hard, and are concerned he would buckle under the pressure of being prime minister.\n\nDespite this, he has consistently led the pack among Conservative MPs in the first rounds of voting.\n\nPolling of Conservative members can be difficult, especially at such tumultuous times, but in those that have taken place Sunak has consistently come second to Truss among party members.\n\nEven if he did make it to power, he would have to overcome criticism from political enemies of all stripes. Opposition leaders would be quick to remind Sunak that he was fined at the same Partygate event as Johnson.\n\nThey will also ask why Sunak remained loyal to Johnson for so long, only resigning after the scandal involving Johnson’s chief whip, Chris Pincher.\n\nThings get worse when you factor in Johnson loyalists, who believe that Sunak’s resignation was the moment Johnson’s premiership began to crumble.\n\nSo, while Sunak might be the frontrunner, he will be surrounded by enemies on all sides.\n\nTruss is currently UK foreign secretary. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLiz Truss\n\nTruss also has a Johnson association problem. She is still serving as Johnson’s foreign secretary and will do so until he finally leaves office in September. She has stood by her leader throughout all of his scandals, justifying that fact she didn’t resign over the Pincher scandal because she was coordinating the UK’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThat explanation might wash with some, however Truss is also largely thought of by Conservatives as the Johnson continuation candidate. Among her chief endorsers are some of Johnson’s most loyal allies, which could make dissociating herself from the current PM tricky.\n\nIt will also be tricky to distance herself from Johnson’s policies. Truss, who voted for the UK to remain in the European Union, has become an arch-Brexiteer since the 2016 referendum.\n\nSince Johnson has taken office, she’s been his trade secretary and his foreign secretary. As the former, she has tub-thumped as loudly as Johnson over each and every trade deal signed, even ones that were simply rollover deals from the UK’s time in the EU.\n\nShe has also been an ardent supporter of Johnson’s plan to rewrite a controversial part of the Brexit deal, the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nTruss has spent much of her time in high office building a power base and is very popular among both MPs and the Conservative grassroots.\n\nSunak and Truss will now spend the summer campaigning to Conservative grassroot members before the victor is announced by the party on September 5.\n\nAfter that, Johnson will resign to the Queen, whom his successor will then visit and be invited to form a government.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955448/penny-mordaunt-dark-horse-tory-leadership-race", "title": "Penny Mordaunt: from magician's assistant to Tory leader favourite ...", "text": "Political pundits are backing Penny Mordaunt as a surprise contender in the race to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe trade minister has become the bookmakers’ favourite in the contest and has come second in the first two rounds of voting by Conservative MPs this week. With 67 votes, she was beaten only by former chancellor Rishi Sunak on 88 last night. In the second round this afternoon she picked up 83 votes to Sunak’s 101.\n\nMordaunt came ahead of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in both rounds and is also the “clear favourite” among party members, according to YouGov.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nThe “fizz and chatter, for now at least, is about Penny Mordaunt”, said Chris Mason at the BBC. If she were to win, Mordaunt would be “the most little-known prime minister on assuming office of modern times”.\n\nSo, who is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nMordaunt and her twin brother, James, were born in the Devon resort town of Torquay in 1973, but lived in Portsmouth from the age of two. The children of a former paratrooper and a special needs teacher, the twins “did everything together” and had an “idyllic” early childhood packed with extra-curricular activities including ballet, canoeing and football, said The Sunday Times.\n\nBut “tragedy struck” when Mordaunt’s mother died from breast cancer when the twins were just 15. “I was a carer from the age of 13, and looked after my family until my father remarried when I was 18,” then defence secretary Mordaunt told the paper in 2019.\n\nAfter leaving school, Mordaunt worked in a Romanian orphanage for a year before becoming the first person in her family to go to university, studying philosophy at Reading. She supported herself with various jobs including work at local factories by day and as a magician’s assistant at night.\n\nMordaunt’s parliamentary career\n\nShe began her political career as a press officer for the Conservative Central Office. The then head of research encouraged her to stand for Parliament, after noticing that Mordaunt “was head and shoulders above all the bright young things in the building”, said The Sunday Times.\n\nShe failed in her first attempt to win the Portsmouth North seat from Labour, in 2005, but went on to win five years later with a swing of 9%. She won again in 2015, 2017 and 2019, each time with an increased majority.\n\nIn 2014, she joined the Cameron-Clegg coalition as the parliamentary under secretary of state for communities and local government. That same year, Mordaunt made national headlines by taking part in now-defunct reality TV series Splash!, starring Tom Daley. She later said that her appearance raised money for projects in her constituency.\n\nMordaunt subsequently held various roles in government including under secretary of state for the armed forces, minister of state for disabled people, health and work, and secretary of state for international development.\n\nIn 2017, at the height of the Yemeni civil war, Mordaunt was “instrumental” in encouraging the Saudis to keep the port of Hodeidah open, said The Sunday Times. “Widely regarded as a determined operator”, Mordaunt was praised for her negotiating savvy following a meeting with the Saudis. A source at the British embassy in Riyadh told the paper that her performance “was the most impressive they had ever seen from a British government minister”.\n\nFor the following two years, Mordaunt was the minister for women and equalities, and was outspoken about abortion laws in Northern Ireland that she described as “the most appalling thing”.\n\nIn 2019, following the sacking of Gavin Williamson, she became the UK’s first female defence secretary. “It is a post that seems more suited to her background than her previous job as international development secretary,” The Guardian said at the time.\n\nAfter just 85 days, however, she was “unceremoniously returned to the backbenches” for “the crime of backing the wrong horse in the leadership contest”, said PoliticsHome, referring to her decision to support Jeremy Hunt over Johnson.\n\nMordaunt was appointed minister for trade policy in September last year. She also continues to be a Royal Navy reservist, lately promoted to honorary captain.\n\nChances for leadership\n\nMordaunt is a passionate Brexiteer and was one of the leading faces of the Vote Leave campaign. One senior Conservative MP and ex-minister said this means she can “appeal to the staunchly pro-Leave wing of the party” as well as attracting the “self-styled moderates in the One Nation and Tory Reform Group caucuses”, reported PoliticsHome.\n\nBut Oliver Duff at the i news site warned that “the Tory Squid Game” is “about to get even more ruthless”. After “surging into second place”, Mordaunt can expect “days of hostile briefings” as Truss and Sunak supporters try to “topple her campaign”.\n\nLord Frost, the former Brexit negotiator, has already told Talk TV he would have “grave reservations” about Mordaunt winning the race. He claimed she “wasn’t fully accountable or always visible” when she served as his junior as the UK left the EU.\n\nHer new status as a feasible contender is certainly “bringing intense scrutiny”, said the Daily Mail. She is facing questions on issues such as “whether she had changed her ‘woke’ views on trans rights in order to win support”.\n\nOne former permanent secretary also said: “I doubt you’ll find a single civil servant who’s worked closely with her who thinks she is prime ministerial material.”\n\nThe comment came after Mordaunt described Whitehall as “broken”, said the Financial Times, adding that her team “strongly dispute” the former mandarin’s claims.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Last Updated", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Catherine Garcia", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-possible-successors-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Sunak, Mordaunt or Boris Johnson: The candidates who could ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain will have a new prime minister within a week, outgoing leader Liz Truss said in her resignation speech outside 10 Downing Street on Thursday.\n\nThe fast-track process is in stark contrast to the contest that catapulted Truss into the hot seat – that lasted six weeks at the height of the summer.\n\nThis time, with the Conservatives at rock-bottom in the opinion polls and the markets jittery after a weeks of drama over Truss’ failed economic policy agenda, the party wants a new leader in place as soon as possible and with as little drama as possible.\n\nGraham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the process, announced the candidates to replace Truss will need get least 100 nominations from the party’s MPs by 2pm local time Monday.\n\nIf only one candidate meets that threshold, they will automatically become leader. Otherwise, an online ballot of party members will close on Friday October 28.\n\nThe winner of the contest will be the fifth Conservative prime minister in just over six years – and the third within this parliamentary term. But who might the next leader be? Here are some of the main runners and riders:\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nThough he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, Sunak has already reached the 100-nomination threshold, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported on Friday.\n\nThe former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) has proved to be something of a prophet of the government’s demise, as many of the predictions he made during this summer’s leadership about Truss’s economic plan came to pass.\n\nConservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nSunak warned that Truss’s unfunded tax cuts would lead to a run on sterling, a panic in the bond market and concern from the International Monetary Fund. Perhaps even he would have been surprised by the pace with which he was proved right.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive members’ vote, Sunak only lost narrowly – with 43% of the vote.\n\nThe trust he has among MPs – and the vindication his predictions have gained – may make him the most likely next set of hands to steer the ship.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons may have had a dress rehearsal for being prime minister this week, after stepping in for an absent Liz Truss at a debate.\n\n“The prime minister is not under a desk,” Mordaunt confirmed Tuesday – in a performance that seemed as much about pitching herself as it did about helping the PM.\n\nMordaunt confirmed in a tweet Friday afternoon that she was running to replace Truss – the first MP to do so.\n\nShe promised a “fresh start” for the country, aiming “to unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next general election.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt HENRY NICHOLLS/REUTERS\n\nMordaunt came third in the last leadership election, narrowly missing out on being put before the members. With 105 votes from MPs in the last election, she too is expected to clear the newt threshold. She is expected to perform well among the party membership, in part due to her military credentials. Mordaunt is a reservist of the Royal Navy and served a short spell as Secretary of State for Defense.\n\nLike Sunak, she is from the more moderate wing of the party. There was even talk among MPs of the two forming a “dream team” ticket, although this is yet to materialize – and it is unclear if either would accept being chancellor over taking the top job.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nBadenoch came fourth in this summer’s leadership election– securing only 59 votes from MPs – but was consistently rated by pollsters as a favorite among Conservative grassroots members.\n\nOne of the younger MPs in the running, Badenoch quickly won the endorsement of long-serving Tory grandee Michael Gove, who praised her as the “outstanding talent” in the party.\n\nBadenoch is from the right of the Tory party – and in her previous leadership bid suggested that the government’s climate targets might prove too costly.\n\nWith Truss’s votes from MPs now up for grabs, Badenoch may have an outside chance of clearing the threshold and making it to the members’ vote.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBoris Johnson is flying back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday and plans to join the race to replace Truss, Britain’s PA Media news agency reported Friday.\n\nUK Trade Minister Sir James Duddridge, a close Johnson ally, told PA Media that he had been in contact with Johnson via Whatsapp, saying that Johnson had sent him: “‘I’m flying back, Dudders. We are going to do this. I’m up for it’.”\n\nThe minister also said via Twitter “I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing. #bringbackboris.”\n\nSky News said one of its reporters, who boarded the flight Johnson took, snapped a picture of the former prime minister and his wife Carrie Johnson on board, adding that the couple received several boos from fellow passengers.\n\nMultiple allies have made the case that Johnson could be a unity candidate who could bring stability to the country, despite the fact he resigned in disgrace only a few months ago after a series of scandals came together, making his position untenable.\n\nWhen asked by CNN how they could justify Johnson standing to be PM again, one MP who campaigned for Johnson in the 2019 leadership campaign, said: “Socialists will destroy our economy and if you don’t understand that then I genuinely fear for our future.”\n\nAnother MP who supported Johnson in 2019 said he was the only candidate who could comfortably win over both Conservative MPs and members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJohnson’s closest allies said they were aware he was being actively lobbied in the hours after Truss’ resignation speech, making the case to him that he represented the party’s best shot at stability in the medium term.\n\nIn his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson made one of his characteristic allusions to ancient history. He said he would “return to his plough” like the Roman statesman Cincinnatus – suggesting a quieter life on the backbenches. But that’s not how Cincinnatus saw out his days. He was called back from his plough to return to Rome for a second term – this time as a dictator.\n\nSome suspect that the new 100-vote threshold is an attempt by the Conservative Party to render another Johnson term impossible. But Johnson’s campaign has already started to gather momentum. A number of prominent Conservative MPs announced Friday that they will back him – even though Johnson has yet to confirm he will stand.\n\nAs Conservative MPs are currently facing electoral oblivion, their desire for self-preservation should not be underestimated. Less than three years ago Johnson delivered an 80-seat majority, and the right of the Tory party may think he is the only candidate capable of saving their jobs.\n\nIf Johnson was to secure the required 100 votes from MPs, he would be expected to perform extremely well in a vote by the party membership.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nIt is a sign of the disorder of the last days of Truss’s government that she elevated Grant Shapps to home secretary – despite not offering him a ministerial role of any sort when she first took office.\n\nGrant Shapps Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nShapps served as transport secretary under Boris Johnson. He put himself forward to succeed him in the previous leadership election – only to withdraw from the race three days later, after failing to secure the requisite 20 MPs’ votes to proceed to the next round.\n\nThe new threshold will likely prove too high for Shapps – but his criticism of Truss’ government from the outset may have won him the support of more MPs than last time.\n\nOther names in the hat\n\nSuella Braverman’s resignation as home secretary on Wednesday night may have been a precursor to a possible leadership bid.

He also said that the candidate list would close on Monday, before a first round of voting on Wednesday. The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote. The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has sufferedthe worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/profile-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Rishi Sunak, rich ex-banker who will be ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nJust seven short weeks ago, it looked as if it might be all over for Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer – the UK’s title for its chief finance minister – made a high-stakes gamble. He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nRishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after he became British prime minister in October 2022.

Claudia Greco/Reuters In pictures: Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/uk/new-british-prime-minister-liz-truss-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Liz Truss wins Conservative Party ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will be the next prime minister of the United Kingdom after winning most votes in the Conservative Party leadership contest, succeeding Boris Johnson who resigned in July after a series of scandals.\n\nTruss defeated rival Rishi Sunak with 81,326 votes to 60,399 among party members and will take over as leader on Tuesday, as Britons face mounting economic and social crisis.\n\nShe pledged action to tackle the crisis in a short victory speech at a conference center in London on Monday. Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/europe/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-meet-british-pm-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson tries to win support for comeback bid, as Sunak ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBoris Johnson was on Sunday battling to win enough support to make what would be a stunning comeback as Britain’s prime minister, as senior Conservative politicians declared their support for former finance minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe two men have become the early favorites to replace Liz Truss, who announced her resignation Thursday just six weeks into a term that threw Britain into political and economic turmoil.\n\nSunak declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. In a tweet, he wrote, “The United Kingdom is a great country but we face a profound economic crisis. That’s why I am standing to be Leader of the Conservative Party and your next Prime Minister. I want to fix our economy, unite our Party and deliver for our country.”\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer has already reached the 100-nomination threshold to make it to the voting stage, while Johnson’s allies said the former PM had returned from a holiday in the Caribbean with the intention of joining the race, PA news reported, but he has yet to declare he is standing.\n\nA runoff between the two men could prove divisive for the ruling Conservative party, not least because many of Johnson’s supporters blame Sunak’s resignation in July for sparking the downfall of his government. Some outlets have speculated that the two men could strike some kind of deal.\n\nThe BBC reported that a meeting took place between Johnson and Sunak but “it wasn’t disclosed what they discussed,” while Britain’s PA Media news agency reported the two “were said to be locked in talks late into the evening” Saturday.\n\nSky News, meanwhile, referred to the meeting as a “secret summit.”\n\nSunak and Johnson, if he decides to run, will be up against Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who said Sunday she regretted the so-called “mini budget” that led to economic turmoil in Britain and the resignation of Truss.\n\n“I very much regret the mini-budget … I raised concerns even before I was in cabinet,” Mordant told the BBC in a Sunday interview, adding there were details about the budget “the cabinet was not aware of.”\n\nThe last time the Conservatives held a leadership race – following the demise of Johnson’s government – Truss came first, Sunak second and Mordaunt third.\n\nGraham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the process, has said any candidate must receive at least 100 nominations from the party’s MPs by 2 p.m. local time Monday.\n\nThe threshold effectively narrows the field of potential candidates to a maximum of three as the party has 357 MPs.\n\nIf only one candidate meets that threshold, they will automatically become leader. Otherwise, the remaining candidates will be put to an online vote by Conservative Party members which will close on Friday October 28.\n\nTruss resigned on Thursday, just six weeks into her disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil. Her successor will be the fifth PM to lead the country since it voted for Brexit in 2016.\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, renewed calls for a general election on Sunday, after claiming people are “fed up to the back teeth” with the Conservative leadership and the consequences of their government’s decisions.\n\n“There is a choice to be made. We need a general election! Let the public into decide… Do they want to continue with this utter chaos, or do they want stability under a Labour government?” Starmer asked during a BBC interview.\n\nFormer Home Secretary Priti Patel on Saturday became one of the most high-profile supporters of Johnson in his quest to become PM. “Boris has the mandate to deliver our elected manifesto and a proven track record getting the big decisions right,” she said in a tweet.\n\nBut his possible return to the top job has split opinions within the Conservative Party, with many lawmakers horrified at the prospect of a second Johnson premiership.\n\nJohnson’s former deputy prime minister and foreign secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, “we cannot go backwards” and pointed out that Johnson still faces a probe into the so-called partygate scandal into illegal gatherings in Downing Street.\n\nThe former PM is expected to appear in the next few weeks before the Commons Privileges Committee which is investigating whether he misled Parliament over the parties, which could potentially see him suspended or expelled as an MP.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hauser Tara Subramaniam", "Jennifer Hauser", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955210/next-tory-leader-odds-the-favourites-to-replace-liz-truss/sajid-javid-the-rags-to-riches-to-politics-tory-leader-contender", "title": "Who is Sajid Javid?

Abdul gained employment in Rochdale, where Javid was born, as a cotton mill worker and then a bus conductor, before the family moved to Bristol.\n\nThe future politician and his four brothers were raised in a two-bed flat on Bristol's Stapleton Road, which Javid would later describe as Britain’s “most dangerous road”. It was there that his mother, Zubaida, ran a market stall selling handmade clothes before opening up her own shop.\n\nJavid attended a comprehensive school in Bristol, and told the Evening Standard in 2012 that “some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations”. Undeterred, Javid rejected the suggestion that he become a “TV repair man” and instead pursued his goal to work in the City, said the BBC. His interest in financial markets was “sparked by the Thatcher government’s privatisations”, and he reportedly became a “regular reader” of the Financial Times as a teenager.\n\nJavid was the first person in his family to go to university. He studied economics and politics at Exeter University, and met his future wife, Laura, at 18-years-old, while the pair were both working summer jobs at Commercial Union. They now have four children together.\n\nJavid has been described by Politico’s Jack Blanchard as having “fought his way up from the toughest streets in England to earn £3-million-a-year at Deutsche Bank”. After graduating, he moved to America and by 25-years-old, he had become vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank.\n\nHe later moved to Singapore while working with Deutsche Bank, where he became managing director before he left finance for politics in 2010 – “a move which reportedly saw him take a 98% pay cut”, said Akhtar.\n\nJavid’s parliamentary career\n\nThe politician was a supporter of the Conservative Party from the early 1980s. “Despite being diehard fans of Margaret Thatcher”, he and fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon “got in a bit of trouble” at the 1990 party conference when they distributed leaflets opposing the then prime minister’s decision to join Exchange Rate Mechanism, said the BBC.\n\nTwenty years later, he was first elected to parliament. He became MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, and began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury. He became culture secretary in 2014, and was the first person of colour to hold “one of the ‘Great Offices of State’”, said Politics.co.uk.\n\n“It was a surprise to many” that Javid called for the UK to remain in the European Union in 2016. He was “on the losing side” of the referendum, and “there was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron” on a “joint ticket” with Stephen Crabb, said the BBC.\n\nTwo years later, Javid “put his head above the parapet during the Windrush scandal to say ‘it could have been me’”, reported the Evening Standard at the time. He succeeded Amber Rudd as home secretary following the scandal, appointed by then prime minister Theresa May, before running for the Tory party leadership in 2019. Javid came in fourth behind runners-up Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove, and was promoted to chancellor by the contest’s victor, Boris Johnson.\n\n“His appointment is set to herald a significant fiscal loosening”, said the Financial Times at the time. He is “the ideal chancellor for creating the magic money trees we were told we were told didn’t exist”, said James Moore in The Independent. But he would hold the position for just six months. Javid resigned in February 2020 following tensions between himself and Johnson’s then-adviser Dominic Cummings. He returned to the backbenches, and took up a role at financial giant JPMorgan.\n\nJavid was appointed health secretary in June last year following the resignaton of Matt Hancock over a breach of Covid restrictions, giving up his financial pursuits in doing so. He resigned from the cabinet on Tuesday evening, and delivered a personal statement at Prime Minister’s Questions the following day in which he made apparent that he believed other ministers should follow his example.\n\nLeadership chances\n\nJavid and Rishi Sunak are among “the favourites” in the “leadership jostling”, said The Guardian. Javid “bolstered his credentials as a candidate” on Tuesday by resigning minutes before the chancellor, who could be his fiercest competition.\n\nThe MP for Bromsgrove “made an early start” in the contest when he “set out his stall to Conservative MPs” in his resignation speech in the House of Commons the following day, said the i news site. He described himself as a “team player” and said he would “never risk losing my integrity” during his parliamentary career.\n\nThe Guardian reported that MPs believe Javid is “the most organised in terms of having a team and an offering”. And though he falls slightly behind Sunak in public popularity, according to YouGov data, his constituents believe he could “do the right thing for the country”, as one Bromsgrove local told the BBC yesterday.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Marc Shoffman", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Arion Mcnicoll"], "publish_date": "2019/07/25"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/953991/who-is-tom-tugendhat-from-soldier-to-possible-future-tory-leader", "title": "Tom Tugendhat: the former soldier running for leader | The Week", "text": "Tom Tugendhat has become the first Conservative MP to throw his hat in the ring to succeed Boris Johnson following the prime minister’s resignation yesterday.\n\nThe MP for Tonbridge, who has never served in the government, launched his leadership bid in an article for The Daily Telegraph, where he called for “a clean start and a government that will make trust, service and an unrelenting focus on the cost of living crisis its guiding principles”.\n\nAs chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of MPs, Tugendhat received private praise from former prime ministers and presidents last summer for an “electrifying address” to the Commons, “in which he raged against the ‘abandonment’ of Afghanistan”, reported the Mail on Sunday at the time.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

As a Foreign Office diplomat, he also assisted Afghanistan’s national security adviser and later worked with the governor of Helmand province.\n\nParliamentary career\n\nTwo years after leaving the British Army in 2013, he was elected MP for Tonbridge and Malling in Kent, where he lives with his wife and their two children.\n\nSince joining Parliament, he has been tipped as a “rising star” – and, on ConservativeHome in 2017, Andrew Gimson touted him as a “possible future Tory leader”.\n\nIn the same year, Tugendhat had challenged fellow Conservative Crispin Blunt, an MP since 1997, for the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee and won. And, in a subsequent article for The Times, he made what was seen as a dig at Johnson, the foreign secretary at the time, saying: “When humour is lost in translation it\n\ncreates misunderstandings with other countries that we can’t afford.”\n\nHis speech in the House of Commons during an emergency debate on the crisis in Afghanistan in August 2021, another example of his willingness to speak up against his own government, rekindled predictions that he is on the rise.\n\nJon Craig at Sky News said the “powerful and emotional lament for the fallen” was “a strong contender for parliamentary speech of the year”.\n\nTugendhat turned his attention to Dominic Raab in September as he challenged the foreign secretary on his handling of the Afghanistan crisis. Two weeks later Raab was moved out of the job in a cabinet reshuffle.\n\nIn January, Tugendhat become the first Conservative MP to publicly say he would stand for prime minister should Johnson leave Downing Street.

Claudia Greco/Reuters In pictures: Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTrading places\n\nTo some, Sunak’s appointment is just the latest in a series of events to highlight the contrasting fortunes of a rising India and the recent economic woes of Britain, its former colonial ruler.\n\nIn the wake of Britain’s exit from the European Union, London has repeatedly looked to its former colony for a boost; wooing it in search of a free-trade deal and granting more visas to Indian nationals than any other country.\n\nAnd now, just weeks after the United Kingdom ceded to India its title of the world’s fifth largest economy, it is former finance minister Sunak that London is turning to in the hope of repairing the economic carnage wrought by the policies of his short-lived predecessor, Liz Truss, which roiled markets and crashed the pound.\n\nGiven Britain’s actions during the colonial period – when Indians were excluded from top jobs in their own country and barred from many institutions – it’s perhaps not surprising that there might be a sense of Schadenfreude.\n\nBut experts say it would be wrong to suggest this is the only emotion in India. Many in the nation of 1.3 billion see the moment as a reason to celebrate progress in both countries, and hope Sunak can act as a bridge between India and Britain by ushering in a new era of ties.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much in a tweet welcoming Sunak’s appointment.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” the Indian leader tweeted Monday.\n\nOthers see Sunak’s triumph as reflective of a growing role in British politics for people of South Asian descent.\n\n“For a long time, the question was asked whether Britain was ready for Sunak to be Prime Minister,” said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation.\n\n“And the fact that he is indeed now, is an enormous tribute to British democracy and to the role the South Asian diaspora has played in British politics.”\n\nMoving relations forward\n\nThe relationship between Britain and India is complicated, given the history of inequality and exploitation during the colonial era.\n\n“Some people are still perplexed about why Rishi Sunak’s race matters. It matters because of the imperial context,” tweeted Sathnam Sanghera, author of “Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain”.\n\nMany Indians have not forgotten the chaos that followed the country’s independence in 1947 and its subsequent bloody partition during which between 500,000 and 2 million people were killed and an estimated 15 million uprooted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nPant said that until relatively recently it would have been “unimaginable” for a person of Indian origin to rule Britain, but Sunak’s appointment was the latest piece of evidence that the relationship today is “much more about the 21st century than about the past. And that has allowed both to take it forward in a much more productive manner.”\n\nEconomic considerations are at the heart of this more modern relationship, with London looking increasingly to India and its $3 trillion economy for opportunities in the post-Brexit era.\n\nBritain remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and politicians in both countries hope economic ties will grow under Sunak.\n\nAmong the biggest prizes on offer is a highly anticipated free-trade agreement, aimed at more than tripling bilateral trade, from $31 billion to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhen then-British prime minister Boris Johnson visited India in April, the two leaders agreed to sign that deal by Diwali. That deadline has been missed but there is renewed hope an agreement can be resurrected under Sunak.\n\n“Whether Sunak will sign the deal will be an important marker,” Pant said. “And it is an important benchmark for how far India-UK relations are willing to go.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak lights a candle for Diwali in Downing Street on November 12, 2020 in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means for Indians in India, and in the UK\n\nWhile Sunak’s face has been plastered across newspapers and televisions in India, the mood on the ground has been harder to judge. The streets of Delhi have been quiet as Indians celebrated Diwali – the most important holiday on the calendar for Hindus, who make up about 80% of the country’s population.\n\n“It is good to see someone whose family is originally from India take the top job and that too on Diwali, which is like a blessing,” said Rajesh, a chemist in the Indian capital. “But it doesn’t mean that things between India and the UK will automatically improve.”\n\nFor some, his appointment is little more than a foreign news story.\n\nA shopkeeper, Arjun, said Sunak’s appointment “didn’t make a difference” to Indians. “Yes, he is Indian but he is still from there,” he said.\n\nOthers say the significance of Sunak’s appointment is that it underlines the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in the UK, where about 7% of the population is of South Asian origin, according to a 2011 census.\n\nBritain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman also has Indian roots, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was born to a working-class Pakistani family.\n\nSunak’s parents came to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. His father was a doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England – something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The uphill economic battle facing new UK PM Rishi Sunak: Analysts weigh in 15:55 - Source: CNN\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nWhen he took his parliamentary oath in 2019, Sunak clutched the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book. He made history a year later when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nNow he is at the pinnacle of power – and that, analysts say, is the epitome of the diaspora’s success.\n\nPant, from the Observer Research Foundation, said Sunak’s appointment symbolizes how people of South Asian descent have “cut across political parties in the UK,” adding Sunak “will shape the political trajectory” of Britain.\n\n“I think there is a certain comfort level that people of the Indian diaspora have in these democracies,” Pant said. “And that is reflective of the largest success of India globally.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

Here's why.", "text": "Letting children be involved in planning family trips and learning to navigate unknown places can help build confidence and the ability to navigate life.\n\nExperts say letting children practice decision-making skills on a family trip can be extremely beneficial.\n\nKids as young as 3 can benefit from being able to make some choices on a family trip.\n\nIt’s noon on a chilly Manhattan day in December and my 14-year-old Tennessean daughter is staring down the steps into the 42nd Street/Bryant Park subway station.\n\nIt's her first foray into a large metropolitan subway system, and her dad and I have decided to let her get us to SoHo.\n\nShe resists our urging to ask the attendant for a subway map, but reluctantly agrees and then (because she is 14), looks up at us as if to say, \"What do you expect me to do with this fossil?\" We mainly wanted her to walk up to a stranger and ask for help. Mission accomplished.\n\nWould you take the same vacation every year?:Here's why these families do\n\nTackling Big Bear as a family:This mom and grandma took an 18-mile hike with a baby\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nYes, we were actually going to SoHo, but the larger goal here was for her to get her bearings on where we were and where we were going.\n\nWe let her buy each of us a MetroCard from the automated machine, and we scanned ourselves through the turnstiles. Her eyes are wide and her steps apprehensive at first. I know this because we are walking a few paces behind her so she can own that she’s in the lead.\n\nThe N train rolls into the station and she looks back and points as if to say, \"This one?\" I shrug my shoulders and ask, \"Is it?\"\n\nTruth be told, it didn't matter if we got on the wrong train or even missed it altogether. But her dad and I felt like it was a great opportunity to gently force her to pay attention. Attention to which subway station she entered, attention to which direction she is going, and attention to which train she needed to get on. If we did all the navigating, she wouldn't have known any of it.\n\nHaving lived in the city myself, I know the value of these skills. Turns out, letting kids have some involvement when traveling as a family can be extremely beneficial.\n\nWhile it can be easier as a parent to do all the decision-making and navigating, let’s take a look at ways your kids – no matter their ages – can participate in family trips rather than just tag along for the ride.\n\nHow kids can benefit from being involved\n\nI spoke with Jessika Boles, assistant professor of the department of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College, about the benefits of letting children of any age be more involved in family travel. She said parents tend to focus on the memory-making aspects of travel but don't always realize there is learning happening, too.\n\n\"Kids need exposure to new experiences, new problems, and new adventures,\" she said. \"Travel gives them a chance to practice real-world problem-solving. Even infants need exposure to new environments and activities. That's how they learn. It also stimulates flexibility and a willingness to learn.\"\n\nSo how exactly do you let a child be more involved in a family trip? Here are five key ways to reap the benefits of family travel so that everyone has fun but also comes away with a sense of ownership.\n\nHere comes the airplane! What to know about flying as an unaccompanied minor\n\nFor subscribers:From $85 to $2,000 family vacations: How much you can expect to pay at popular destinations\n\n1. Understand travel is not only fun, but beneficial for children\n\nBoles says it's important to realize that travel is not just something fun and memorable, but also a unique opportunity to build skills children will use throughout their lifetimes.\n\n\"We've been through a lot of loss and change with the pandemic, so what a great opportunity to let kids have some semblance of control by deciding, 'Do I want to go ice skating or go to an aquarium?' And it gives them a chance to practice decision-making.\"\n\n2. Encourage your kids be involved\n\nOn our recent trip to New York, we had a plethora of hotel options. My husband and I would have probably opted for something in a quieter part of the city, but our daughter really wanted to stay in the heart of Times Square. We get it. The Hard Rock Hotel ended up being our home away from home for three days, and while my husband and I got the clean bed and safe atmosphere we wanted, she got some fun extras, a rooftop patio and the really cool view that she wanted.\n\nBoles says even with younger children, give them two or three options for hotels, but let them choose which one they like best.\n\n\"It may be that this one has an indoor pool, but this one puts us closer to this or that,\" she said. \"Which one do you think would be more fun? Give them some little choices. Not unrealistic ones, but help get them involved in the trip.\"\n\n3. We'll follow you\n\nWhen our daughter was about 8, my husband and I started letting her navigate airports when we took family trips. We thought it was kind of fun to say, \"Our flight is at gate B31, can you find it?\" and watch her take the initiative to get us there. Honestly, most of the time, she was pretty spot on. We were quite impressed, and she was beaming with satisfaction after accomplishing her challenge.\n\nBoles suggests using downtime at an airport to let your kids learn something new. Instead of dragging them behind you to the gate, let them find something for lunch or decide whether to take the tram or walk to the gate.\n\n\"Trips are also a great time to get children engaged in the day-to-day activities,\" she said. \"Offer kids the map of the zoo and let them decide what they want to see. Maybe you go to the sea lions first, then the jellyfish. You don't necessarily have to go in order. It helps sharpen skills and also gives them ownership.\"\n\n4. Understand their point of view\n\nKids as young as 3 to 5 naturally want to make choices and be in control, Boles said. Travel is a great way to embrace that.\n\n\"My daughter likes to collect ticket stubs,\" she said. \"Letting her do that gives her an element of control.\"\n\nOn our NYC trip, my daughter wanted to visit the Museum of Ice Cream. It's something she had seen on TikTok and something my husband and I had absolutely no desire to see. But she was willing to sit through a boring dinner with some of our old friends, so we thought it was fair to let her pick something she wanted to do.\n\nAll she had to do was verify their hours, get us tickets online, find it on the map and navigate the subway to get us there. It ended up being the highlight of her trip, and she has the Instagram posts to prove it.\n\nBoles says teenagers love choices just as much as younger kids, for different reasons.\n\n\"It's cooler to make your own choices, so they are naturally invested in that,\" she said. \"Also, so much of their day is planned by teachers and parents. Giving them some choices says you trust them. Have them look at maps and decide how long it's going to take you to get there. Let them decide what they want to take pictures of and offer them the opportunity to do that. Ask them if they want to make a quick photo stop and don't be judgmental when they do.\"\n\n5. Reap the benefits – and the memories\n\nFamily travel, even when things don't go as planned, can be extremely helpful for children as they develop and grow. It can help cognitively with their ability to execute certain skills like planning, completing tasks and complex problem-solving.\n\n\"Life will happen. A flight will get canceled and you are stuck,\" Boles said. \"You need to know what to do in those situations as far as language development and social engagement. Travel can help kids feel comfortable asking for help if they need it and sharpen their abilities to navigate a new situation. There's a confidence that can come with a kid who can say, 'I think I know who I can ask, and I'm gonna be OK at the end of the day.' \"\n\nLetting your kids take some initiative on trips can be challenging at first. But we realized on our recent trip that our daughter has 3-and-a-half years of high school left, and then she is off to college. Have we enabled her to function away from home without us? This trip proved we're at least on our way as we watched her confidently stride down the busy streets of New York with us in tow for a change.\n\n\"It's a hard transition when you've spent all this time controlling their life circumstances, but these little bits of life freedom are not only good for them, they are good for you,\" Boles said. \"What you would want for your child as a parent is for them to have some confidence and the ability to navigate life.\"\n\nMelonee Hurt covers growth and development at The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network - Tennessee.

Like extra bags, a deck of cards, and eating utensils.\n\nI ought to know. I've been on the road non-stop for the better part of eight years, and have forgotten my fair share of items. Travel surveys dance around this important question. The latest poll from Hyatt suggests guests don't pack their razors, toothbrushes and mouthwash. But that's just the toiletries. Zoom out, and you'll discover other small things that travelers shouldn't neglect.\n\nWe're right in the middle of the busy summer travel season, so this is a great time for a reminder. I have to warn you — my cautionary tales about little things isn't what you think.\n\nIt's in the bag\n\nCan we talk luggage? Every story I've ever read and written about luggage focuses on your carry-on bag. It's important enough, but there's an erroneous assumption the travel experts make when they obsess about that rollaboard. They believe you'll be carrying the same amount of stuff back when you return.\n\nSorry, but that's wrong.\n\nWe learned that the hard way when we returned from a trip to Kenya last year. All of our belongings fit neatly into our luggage on our way to Africa. On our return trip, toting blankets and souvenirs — not so much.\n\nWe had to wear extra clothes and blankets in order to fit everything into our checked luggage. Ah, if we'd only bought a few tote bags with us — you know, the collapsible kind made of cloth — we wouldn't have had to do something we've never done before, and never since: discard items at the airport in order to comply with an airlines' check-in requirements.\n\nThe games people play\n\nAnother seemingly small item we never leave home without is cards. No, not credit cards. I could write a book about the dangers of credit cards, but I'll save that for another day. No, I'm talking about playing cards.\n\nWe discovered the value of a simple deck of cards when we visited Reno, Nevada, last summer. Our hotel had a deck of cards in our room, and I taught the kids how to play \"Go Fish.\" I'm kind of glad it did. Those cards kept us busy on a long drive to Oregon and Washington, in vacation rentals with spotty wireless connections, or when I declared a device-free day because of profound overexposure to electronics. Playing cards require no batteries.\n\nJust two problems with cards that I should mention. First, my 13-year-old son saw some YouTube video that taught people how to throw cards, like in a magic show. He soon learned the true meaning of the phrase, \"Not playing with a full deck.\"\n\nMy daughter is unbeatable at \"Go Fish.\" After a while, that became a small problem for the rest of the family. Playing cards was synonymous with \"letting your sister win again.\"\n\nStill, this card deck trick is one of my favorite travel tips. Because you never know when you'll be stuck on a nine-hour road trip with no devices to keep you company.\n\nEat this!\n\nOh, and don't forget your meals. I know you won't, but you might overlook an important part of your meal — eating utensils. I've lost count of the number of times we bought a meal in a grocery store and then didn't have anything to eat it with. Try drinking broccoli soup from a plastic container. Mind if I take pictures?\n\nDisposable forks, knives and spoons clog landfills, so I try to avoid them. But you can buy reusable plastic utensils for your extended road trips. A word of caution: They look like they're disposable, so if you're staying at a hotel, room service will assume you want to throw them out. I strongly advise washing and storing them after every meal.\n\nThere's another workaround, which is also a healthier one. Buy lots of fruits and vegetables that require no peeling or cutting. Grapes and strawberries are among our favorites.\n\nWhen you travel, it's easy to remember the big things, like a change of clothes, or a passport. But spare a thought for the little ones. Because you never know when you'll need a little extra room, something to pass the time — or something to eat with.\n\nChristopher Elliott's latest book is “How To Be The World’s Smartest Traveler” (National Geographic).

Here's what I learned ...", "text": "I was with my travel agent for only a couple of minutes before getting a detailed itinerary for an upcoming trip to New York City. The schedule not only included suggested activities during a mid-September weekend, such as a stroll through Central Park and a visit to the Empire State Building but also factored in time for flights from Nashville, Tennessee, where I live.\n\n\"Can you help me book those flights?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to book flights for you,\" ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence computer program from OpenAI, responded.\n\nI was using the term \"travel agent\" loosely.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?:Everything to know about OpenAI's free AI essay writer and how it works\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nChatGPT takes on real estate:Agents say the AI could be a game changer in the industry\n\nThat was the first of several roadblocks I hit during an experiment to see whether I could use ChatGPT as a travel agent for a theoretical vacation, compared with a human counterpart. Here's what I learned:\n\nChatGPT's travel planning abilities are limited, for now\n\nI started by asking ChatGPT about the best time to visit New York. I used to live there, so I could make that call for myself, but I wanted to test its recommendations against my own memories of sweaty summer subway rides and snowy winter strolls.\n\nThe program dutifully rattled off a handful of seasonal factors to consider, including weather, crowds and activities. Based on those, I leaned toward spring or fall, when ChatGPT said there would be \"mild temperatures, colorful foliage and plenty of outdoor activities.\"\n\nI chose a free weekend from Sept. 15 through 17 – just before the official start of fall – and asked if the program: \"Can you help me plan a trip from Nashville to New York City from Sept. 15-17?\"\n\nThe itinerary it generated was thorough and varied – complete with a recommendation to \"catch a Broadway show\" and a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge – but its inability to help me book the flights to get there was frustrating.\n\nHowever, the program empowered me to book them myself by providing suggestions for third-party booking websites.\n\nOpenAI said last month it would roll out access to various plug-ins to \"study their real-world use, impact, and safety and alignment challenges,\" including from third-party booking sites Expedia and Kayak.\n\nExpedia Group tweeted a video that shows a user searching for flights via ChatGPT and the plug-in, which provides options before sharing a link to book on Expedia, among other features, for instance.\n\n\"While we will initially prioritize a small number of developers and ChatGPT Plus users, we plan to roll out larger-scale access over time,\" OpenAI said in a blog post (I was using the free version of the program).\n\nWhen I asked which airline I should choose, ChatGPT listed airlines that fly nonstop between Nashville and New York.\n\nIn what felt like a kind of consolation, ChatGPT also volunteered tips. \"When choosing an airline, you may want to consider factors such as ticket price, departure and arrival times, airline rewards programs, and any additional fees or charges,\" the program said. \"You may also want to read reviews from other travelers to get an idea of their experiences with each airline.\"\n\nI had the same issue when I tried booking a hotel through the program, though ChatGPT similarly recommended several hotels, which it said are \"conveniently located and offer good value for your money,\" and sites to book them.\n\nA travel agent had more resources than ChatGPT\n\nMuch like I do after thumbing my way through an automated customer service phone menu, after consulting ChatGPT, I found myself wondering what a real person would have to say.\n\nI sent my travel dates to Geoffrey Millstone, owner of Clarksburg Travel Service, along with some parameters: I asked for a nice but reasonable hotel in a convenient location and solicited suggestions for activities during my weekend in the Big Apple.\n\nHe sent me an itinerary with specific flights, a room at the Hyatt Grand Central New York hotel – he picked it because it offered a good deal that met my criteria – and pricing info, for a total of just over $1,240.\n\nShould I book my summer travel now?:Travel experts share how to find the best deals\n\n'Not much hope for economy class passengers':Airline passengers brace for the big summer squeeze\n\nHe selected an early flight in and a late flight out to \"maximize\" my time there, and nonstop service to avoid disruptions.\n\n\"If the price is close, and I have a nonstop flight, against changing planes with today's situation in flights, I always go for the nonstop,\" Millstone said.\n\nMany of Millstone's recommendations were also rooted in personal experiences, such as grabbing a corned beef or pastrami sandwich from a local deli in Manhattan – he gets half and half when he goes.\n\nHis other suggestions included a hop-on, hop-off bus tour, which he and his wife have used, and a carriage ride through Central Park. The conversation flowed more naturally than with the AI program (believe it or not), and he offered a streamlined way to make bookings as well as passed on a breadth of firsthand New York knowledge that ChatGPT could not have had.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT as a travel agent?\n\nThat depends.\n\nIf I had been simply looking for advice on what to do and suggested ways to do it, ChatGPT served me well as a kind of consultant while I considered my options. But based on my experience with the current iteration of the free program, a flesh-and-blood adviser can offer a more full-service experience with a travel agent who will not only make recommendations but also book my travel.\n\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.

AAA said other factors include persistent flight cancelations and delays at airports throughout the country.\n\nHere are ways to avoid frustration and missing out on any firework shows or celebrations if you plan on hitting the road this week.\n\nAre hotel reward programs worth it? Yes, but benefits are small for infrequent customers.\n\nWhere to beat the heat:5 family-friendly summer getaways in the Northeast\n\nWhen is the best time to leave for Fourth of July weekend?\n\nThe earlier the better, Pishue said, because it gives flexibility to deal with any random traffic.\n\nHe said that since the pandemic began, mornings have been lighter because people weren't going into work. Even though the return to work has begun, it still remains a great time to travel, as well as nighttime.\n\n\"They're not as many people are commuting into work at 7:30 or 8 o'clock (a.m.). So the mornings are lighter, but the midday travel is as strong or a little bit stronger,\" Pishue told USA TODAY. \"People are getting out in midday and afternoons. Not so much in the morning. So leave early – that's generally the best.\"\n\nHere are the best times to travel for the holiday weekend, according to Inrix:\n\nThursday: Before 7 a.m. or after 8 p.m.\n\nFriday: Before 10 a.m. or after 9 p.m.\n\nSaturday: Before noon or after 7 p.m.\n\n\"If you really want to beat the traffic, if you want to get to where you're going quicker and with less hassle, I would recommend leaving midweek if possible,\" Oneika Raymond, travel expert and host on the Travel Channel, told USA TODAY.\n\nIf you're planning a quick trip for the end of the weekend, good news: Sunday and Monday are expected to have low congestion all day.\n\nWhen is the worst time to leave for Fourth of July weekend?\n\nThe daytime is where you'll find the most pain behind the wheel.\n\nAside from the traffic, other factors could make sitting in traffic worse; daytime means hot temperatures inside the car if your air conditioning isn't working or fails.\n\n\"As far as safety and stuff is concerned, with the heat, make sure you have a ton of water, (and) don't overly stress,\" Pishue said.\n\nHere are the worst times to travel for the holiday weekend, according to Inrix:\n\nThursday: 2-8 p.m.\n\nFriday: noon-9 p.m.\n\nSaturday: 2-4 p.m.\n\nPishue added another thing to consider if you are traveling during these peak traffic times: the possibility of car accidents. There has been an increase in serious car accidents and fatalities since 2020, so if an accident happens, it could mean extended time on the road and a greater need to stay alert behind the wheel.\n\n\"A lot of things can happen on a roadway,\" Pishue said. \"We can't predict that.\"\n\nIf the only time you can travel is during peak times, Pishue said, have a traffic app or GPS unit on, because they can offer scenic routes as opposed to major highways and \"make the driving experience a little bit more enjoyable.\"\n\nFlight canceled or delayed?

She recommends people not wait until the last minute to leave because it can create a host of problems, no matter the means of transportation. She also recommends taking advantage of rewards programs to cut the cost of some travel expenses.\n\n\"Not only will it be stressful, it'll also be very expensive, and you might run into issues with availability. That goes across the board; that goes for flights, rental cars, hotels and other types of accommodation,\" Raymond said.\n\nIf you're traveling with family or friends, Raymond added, it's still not too late to plan the road trip together so you can save money on gas, because the national average still remains high at $4.89 a gallon, according to AAA. If you are trying to save money on gas, she said, it's best to fill up \"sooner rather than later\" and monitor prices throughout your route in case one state has cheaper gas than another.\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2023/04/04/what-benefit-costco-travel/11564922002/", "title": "What travelers should know about booking a trip with Costco Travel", "text": "When Cathi White books a trip, she always checks Costco Travel first.

Those making bookings can do so online or by phone, and the service has reservation agents that can assist travelers before, during and after their trip, he said.\n\nCan Costco Travel replace a travel agent?\n\nBrian Ayers and his wife booked a Costco Travel package for their honeymoon in Greece in part because of the convenience. The 2019 trip, which took them to Athens, Santorini and Mykonos marked his first time out of the country, and he said it \"was going to be much too complex for us to measure it out, just because booking ferry times and hotels, there were just so many choices.\"\n\nEven when their plans hit a snag after a ferry was canceled, leaving them \"hanging out at the ferry station for a couple of hours,\" the 29-year-old said, Costco Travel was a helpful intermediary. Ayers, who lives in Lewisville, Texas, and works for a semiconductor chip manufacturer, called the service, which confirmed with the ferry provider that their tickets would be valid on the next one available.\n\nHowever, Kerry Mooneyham, owner of Midwest Travel Solutions said booking through Costco Travel is not the same as working with a travel agent that can offer more personalized guidance.\n\n\"You're going to have the same cruise whether you book it directly with Carnival, you book it with Costco, or you book it with me,\" she said. \"The cruise is exactly the same. ... It's behind the scenes that we do things to make it better.\"\n\nShe said booking with Costco Travel may make more sense for some trips than others.\n\n\"I think maybe when you're not exactly sure what is the best option for you is really a time when you should be reaching out to an expert that understands the differences between cruise A and cruise B,\" Mooneyham said. \"But if you know exactly what you want, that's a time where you might only be looking at, you know, 'What's the best value for me?'\"\n\nHowever, Hendrix said the company has more than 1,000 Costco Travel employees with experts in various focus areas, including cruises, Hawaii and Europe.\n\nBut travelers may not always find what they are looking for. Hendrix said Costco only offers car rentals with Avis, Alamo, Budget and Enterprise, for example, and it has a limited selection of hotels and hotel brands. Certain destinations may also not be available for their vacation package and build-your-own-trip options.\n\nCan you book flights with Costco Travel?\n\n\"Flights are available as part of our vacation packages or our build-your-own options,\" Hendrix said. However, travelers cannot currently purchase flights alone through Costco Travel.\n\nDo you have to be a Costco member to use Costco Travel?\n\nYes. Travelers must be active Costco members to use the service. Depending on the tier, Costco memberships cost between $60 and $120 per year – before any applicable sales tax – according to its website.\n\n\"Many of our programs offer Costco Travel members an exclusive Costco Shop Card for their travel purchase, which they receive once their travel is completed, and can be used in the warehouse or online at Costco.com,\" Hendrix added.\n\nCostco Executive members also get an annual 2% reward – up to $1,000 – on qualifying purchases made through Costco Travel.\n\nSign up for a Costco membership\n\nThis new Vegas show wants you out of you out of your seat:What to know ahead of 'DiscoShow'\n\nShould you buy travel insurance through a cruise line?:Maybe not, experts say\n\nIs Costco Travel a good deal?\n\nSome travelers have found significant savings using the service. Ayers booked a 2022 trip to Spain with Costco Travel after pricing the trip out themselves.\n\n\"The cost for just the airline tickets would have been the cost for the entire Costco package,\" he said, which included flights, hotels and more.\n\nWhite also noted that resort fees have always been included when she has booked through the service. When possible, Hendrix said Costco Travel's buyers work to include those fees \"or negotiate the waiving of those fees.\"\n\nAnd despite its budget-friendly reputation, White has booked luxury hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton through the service.\n\nWhen she doesn't book with Costco, she said it's usually just because they don't have what she's looking for. \"But they do have an amazing selection,\" White said.\n\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.

What health experts are doing for the ...", "text": "When health expert Thomas Russo spoke to USA TODAY in early October, the end of the pandemic seemed within reach.\n\n“I look very much forward to the day, and I don’t think we’re far off. I think it’ll be very early 2022 where most of this is behind us,” Russo, chief of the University of Buffalo’s division of infectious diseases, said at the time.\n\nSince then, a new variant of concern has emerged and quickly taken over as the dominant coronavirus variant within the U.S. Cases are rising, countries across the globe are announcing new entry requirements and tourist hotspots are shutting down once again. After nearly two years into the pandemic, it almost feels like we’re back to square one.\n\nSo does that mean you should cancel your upcoming trip for the holidays?\n\nWhile some should consider pushing back their plans, health experts say there are ways to travel safely this holidays season.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\n\"I'm not recommending everyone cancel their trip,\" said Keri Althoff, associate professor of the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's epidemiology department. \"(But) everyone must recognize that the risk has increased due to the new variant of SARS-CoV-2. That's what we need to be mindful of and walk through our decision-making process again.\"\n\n►Traveling for the holidays:Here are the worst times to hit the road.\n\n►Vaccinated and test positive? What to know about omicron, COVID for this holiday season.\n\nShould I travel for Christmas?\n\nUnlike last year, the federal government has not issued a warning against holiday travel. While officials warn that breakthrough cases are possible with omicron, vaccinations and masks can help protect travelers against infection and severe illness.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Tuesday that Americans can safely celebrate the holidays with family and friends \"if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated, particularly if you've gotten your booster shot.\" Federal health officials on Wednesday said getting together in a home setting can be safe, especially with testing, but advised against parties with dozens of people whose vaccination status is unknown.\n\n\"We're not advocating for large events,\" CDC director Rochelle Walensky said. \"We do want families to be together, to be able to be together, this holiday season. And so to do so, we're really encouraging people to be vaccinated, to be boosted and to practice all of those prevention strategies before they gather.\"\n\nHealth experts tend to agree that getting together with family and friends for the holidays is OK, and even good for mental wellbeing, if done right. Just know that gatherings may require extra precautions this year, such as testing, mask-wearing, vaccinations and booster shots.\n\n►At-home COVID testing:Here's what travelers should know\n\n►CDC travel warning:CDC says to 'avoid travel' to Spain, Monaco, Finland and other destinations due to COVID-19\n\n“We understand that the mental health toll as we come into what would be the third year of this pandemic is very significant,” Chris Beyrer, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told USA TODAY. “People need to get together with their loved ones. They just need to try and do that safely.”\n\nAlthoff suggests travelers think through the risks before committing to their trip. Risks will drop for people who are vaccinated with booster shots and who gather with people who wear a mask properly in public.\n\n\"Your risk when you booked this trip is different now, so it's important to keep that in mind. Particularly if you're someone or you're traveling with somebody who has any risk factor that could lead to more severe illness,\" Althoff said. \"It's just really important we add a few layers of protection right now.\"\n\nBeyrer said travelers should take a coronavirus test before visiting others. While free at-home tests from the federal government won't be available until January, rapid antigen tests are as low as $14 for a pack of two at some retailers and can take less than 15 minutes to give results.\n\nThis can be an especially useful safeguard when visiting with someone who is immunocompromised or not yet eligible for boosters.\n\nBeyrer and other experts also say it’s best to keep any indoor gatherings small.\n\n“This, I think, is going to be a part of how we're all going to manage the holidays,” Beyrer said.\n\nAnd while it may not be an easy decision, health experts say it might be wise for some to delay their trip.\n\n\"If people absolutely need to travel, they can still do so with all of the precautions,\" said Lee Riley, chair of the infectious diseases and vaccinology division at the University of California, Berkely's school of public health. \"For air travel, unless you really have to have a family get-together or there's some sort of business trip, I probably would not. I would wait a bit until we learn more about the omicron.\"\n\nAlthoff agreed that pushing back the trip might be the best call in some circumstances.\n\n\"(There are travelers) getting together with family members they hadn't seen in two years who may be much older and thinking through how many more holidays they will have together,\" Althoff said. \"(Others) have said, you know what, we're gonna stick closer to home and try for a spring trip.\"\n\n►EU travel restriction updates:Netherlands, Denmark shutting down businesses, Greece tightening entry requirements\n\n►Nervous about travel (again?):What to know about airline, hotel and cruise cancellation policies as omicron surges\n\nWhat the holidays look like for health experts\n\nBeyrer still plans to get together with family for the holidays this year, but only with people who are fully vaccinated with booster shots.\n\n“We’re having a boosted Christmas,” he said. \"(Then) we're having a small dinner party for New Year's Eve that I'm hosting, and everybody's boosted and we're keeping the numbers to 12. And we're not going dancing, which we used to do.\"\n\nRiley canceled his usual year-end lab party with his students because of the omicron surge but plans to get together with less than a dozen people for Christmas.\n\n\"My wife is pregnant, so we have more of a concern and are being more careful,\" he said.\n\nAlthoff, who kept to outdoor vacation activities like beaches and hikes with her family when her children weren't yet eligible for the vaccine, said she had a small gathering with her family over Thanksgiving. She will not be getting together with family members again this year.\n\n“We felt comfortable (getting together over Thanksgiving) given the fact that everybody else was vaccinated and boosted,” she said Tuesday, noting that her kids had received their second dose shortly after the holiday. “But omicron has changed all that.\"\n\nRusso, whose biggest trip in 2021 was a Hawaiian vacation that was focused on outdoor activities like patio dining, is also keeping the festivities low key. He has two children flying in from the West Coast, and while both are boosted, Russo acknowledged that there is a chance of breakthrough infection.\n\n\"Once we get to our house, we're going to probably not do much,\" he said. \"We're not going to go out to indoor restaurants, obviously, with masks down indoors. ...We may consider going to a movie theater. But if we do, no popcorn, no drinks, masks up the whole time.\"\n\nIs it safe to fly right now?\n\nFor those who are traveling for the holidays, Russo says traveling in a personal vehicle is safest. Airlines would be the next best option over other forms of public transportation like buses or trains, which don’t have the same quality of air filtration.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most newer-model airplanes filter recycled air through HEPA filters, which capture 99.9% of particles, including larger viruses or virus clumps.\n\nThe federal mask mandate, which requires masks on planes in airports and on airplanes and other forms of public transportation through March 18, also helps reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nBut there are risks, even on a plane – especially with a number of passengers strongly opposed to masking up. Russo said there are ways travelers can take extra precautions.\n\nIf the plane hands out drinks or food to passengers, Russo suggests waiting at least 10 minutes to unmask and eat. This gives the other passengers more time to finish their food and mask up before your own mask comes off.\n\nHe also suggests eating and drinking strategically to minimize the amount of time the mask is off.\n\n“If it’s a short flight, I recommend just keeping your mask on the whole time,\" he said. \"If it's a longer flight if you feel you have to go ahead and do that, what you can do is you can take that sip or bite and then sort of pop that mask back on while you're chewing.\"\n\nRiley suggests looking at a destination's COVID transmission rates before flying there. The CDC’s list of countries with “very high” COVID risk includes 88 countries as of Monday, including popular destinations like the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France, and there are destinations within the U.S. like New York that are experiencing their own COVID surge.\n\nDomestic U.S. flights don't ask for a negative coronavirus test – only international flights into the country require a negative viral test no more than one day before travel. Riley said it may be a good idea to get tested regardless to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.\n\n\"You have to be more careful,\" he said. \"You also have to be vigilant about where you're going to, especially if your destination has people who may not have been fully vaccinated or who are immunosuppressed.\"\n\n►CDC travel warning:CDC says to 'avoid travel' to Spain, Monaco, Finland and other destinations due to COVID-19\n\n►COVID testing:CDC program offers travelers free at-home COVID test kits at select US airports\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter: @bailey_schulz.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2022/09/02/europe-travel-mess-us-baggage/7962762001/", "title": "I went to Europe this summer and so did my suitcase.

Here's what happened.", "text": "The cold water hits my face, then my body, like ... well, cold water. Abrupt. Icy. Chilling. Shocking. Then, somehow, soothing?\n\nNearly every day for the past year, I took a one-minute cold shower after my morning hot shower. I got the idea after editing a piece from a USA TODAY medical contributor: \"Multiple research studies show that cold exposure is a 'good stressor' that floods our brains and bodies with adrenaline and dopamine, increasing our energy and focus and elevating our mood,\" wrote Dr. Michael Daignault. The recommendation is generally for a cold plunge pool, but he said a shower would work, too.\n\nBut was this a good idea? The truth is its health benefits are up for debate, like many health and wellness trends. But my habit probably isn't doing any harm, either.\n\n'Lean into' the cold shower\n\nAdrenaline and dopamine to start my day? Sure, I thought. Maybe I'd relax more. Breathe deeper. I'm a journalist (and a human), after all, so stress comes with the gig. \"Instead of fighting our body’s natural reflex to breathe like this, lean into it and focus on quality breathing,\" wrote Daignault. \"Over time, aim for progressively colder water and a longer time. One to three minutes daily is ideal.\"\n\nLean into it I did, no matter the temperature outside or the location. In Washington, D.C., in Portugal, in New Jersey, in California, what have you. Some mornings I turned the water cooler than others. Some mornings I probably rushed that one minute. Either way, I breathed, deeply and slowly and felt my heart rate decrescendo like a piece of music.\n\nWas this actually working, even if I wasn't exactly adhering to perfect guidance? Or was it all in my head?\n\nHow long should I take cold showers for each week?\n\nLikely a mix of both. Potential health benefits go beyond aiding energy and focus; it could even boost your metabolism and curb inflammation. Groups like adventurous athletes might be more inclined to take a freezing dip in the first place, in hopes of healing injuries.\n\nI'm not quite at that level, but I've been working out more. Strength training, running a few miles twice a week and taking high-intensity interval training classes. Health benefits have evidently cropped up for me elsewhere (though, like many, I could certainly improve my diet), so who's to say exactly what I've been getting out of the cold showers in this regard?\n\nProfessor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford Medicine, Andrew Huberman, suggests 11 minutes per week over two to four sessions should do the trick.\n\n\"For deliberate cold exposure, *it doesn’t matter how you get cold as long as it’s uncomfortable but safe* (temp varies by person),\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in 2021. \"Most studies were done with submersion in water to the neck, limbs, feet & hands in. Showers & layer shedding fine too but not much science there.\"\n\nFormer \"Biggest Loser\" trainer Jillian Michaels points to the same 11-minute recommendation, but that \"the cold shower's better than nothing.\" Also, remember to not heat up again: \"The key is to let your body reheat itself,\" she told me just before the new year. \"That's where a large amount of the benefits come from with regard to metabolism.\"\n\nHmm:The Rock takes a cold shower every day. Should you? Here's what experts say.\n\nMy cold shower plan for 2024\n\nThis year I plan on sticking with my cold shower routine. If anything, it makes me take stock of myself in a given moment. I stop thinking about what I have to accomplish that day. Stop worrying about what's going to happen next week. Stop stressing about what the next month will hold.\n\nI focus on the here and now because when ice injects itself into your veins, that's all you can do. Pause. Slow.

Plan your trip with these travel trends, tips", "text": "Need an escape?\n\nYou’re not the only one.\n\nTravel has surged post-COVID, occasionally causing vacation complications. The increased tourism has stressed airlines and travelers' pocketbooks — and some countries are even limiting the number of visitors to their most popular attractions.\n\nHowever, three local longtime travel agents are offering tips for making your next getaway as easy and stress-free as possible. They also have some suggestions on travel destinations you might seek to explore.\n\nExpect high prices, plan ahead and be flexible\n\nJim Ehehalt, a travel agent for more than 20 years with Brookside Travel in Novi, says travel costs have increased 25 to 50 percent since COVID-19. However, despite the initial sticker shock, the pent-up demand for travel from the past few years has people forging ahead.\n\nFor those who want a deal, he recommends booking well ahead of when you want to travel (as the author of this article did for a Hawaii trip).\n\n“You won’t find a last-minute deal, that doesn’t work any more,” Ehehalt said. “You have to have something always on the book, a trip that you are looking forward to. People should be looking right now for 2024, some are doing 2025.”\n\nSheri Langwald, travel agent with World of Travel in Bloomfield Township, recommends being flexible to save money: Take a five-day trip instead of seven days, or take the garden view at a hotel instead of the ocean view, or an inner cabin on a cruise ship instead of a balcony room.\n\nTiming is everything\n\nWhen you go matters. If at all possible, avoid scheduling your trip during Christmas, New Year’s, spring break or the height of summer or you’ll pay for it both financially and in crowds.\n\nLangwald notes a family of four trying to book right now for Mexico in February or for a mid-winter break can expect to pay about $14,000 for flights and resorts for a week.\n\nWhile few travelers may want to go to Alaska in winter, or to the Caribbean during late summer and fall due to hurricane season, there are “off season” times that are still good weather with less tourists.\n\nLangwald recommends traveling in January for a warm weather cruise or all-inclusive tropical resort, and in April and May or September and October for locations like Europe and Alaska.\n\n“You won’t have the crazy crowds of people, because most kids are still in school,” she said. “The weather is not as hot and it’s a better value, but will still be nice.”\n\nA few hot takes on cool places to go and a few to maybe forgo\n\nChoosing your location is half the fun.\n\nTravelers are enchanted with Europe, including Italy and the eternal city of Rome, but also increasingly with Greece, which has been popular for cruising between islands.\n\nIceland, once a “best-kept secret,” has also maintained popularity and Langwald said Croatia is up and coming the last few years, but still not as crazy as Italy or Greece. She also recommends Ireland as a beautiful country.\n\nBut there are other locations in Europe that have become overrun with tourists and where people may find a crimp in plans.\n\nThose places include Venice, where large cruise ships have been banned from the lagoon; Amsterdam, where Dutch officials recently won the right to order a reduction of flights at the main airport by 12 percent — from 500,000 per year to 460,000; Peru, where the number of tourists allowed to visit Machu Picchu is limited to preserve the 15th century Incan site; and Hawaii, which is limiting the number of people in certain parks.\n\n“There is just over-tourism of those places and a lot of other destinations,” Shelly Diehr, manager of Milford Travel Service, said. “There will be some more changes in the next several years of countries limiting tourism. They are making adjustments because they want to keep these places nice.”\n\nThis will require more planning and reservations, but is unlike locations that the U.S. Department of State advises against travel to for safety reasons.\n\nLocations that are not as heavily traveled for reasons such as the finances and physical fitness required, but are extraordinary for those seeking adventure include Antarctica (although the price tag for this can be very extra, as these Birmingham men know firsthand), Africa and the Galapagos Islands.\n\nLangwald, who has more than two decades experience as a travel agent, said her favorite places in the world are Kenya and Tanzania, where she experienced an amazing African safari she would do again despite the trip’s cost of about $20,000 for her and her significant other.\n\nShe reminisces about that trip, recalling that after they had sat in a Jeep watching cheetahs for 20 minutes, their guide asked if they were ready to go.\n\n“The answer was no,” Langwald laughs. “We could have stayed there for hours.”\n\nRoad trip still a great way to travel\n\nBut Langwald said for those who are looking for a less expensive option, fantastic, awe-inspiring vacations can be had right here in \"this beautiful country of ours\" for less money, by taking road trips and camping or staying at motels.\n\nMore:Couple bikes 4,500 miles in wild cross-country ride into the unknown\n\nDiehr agrees, but advises booking reservations at U.S. national parks a year in advance and also mapping out how many hours per day you want to drive.\n\n“Hit fun things, too,” she said. “Don’t just go point A to point B. If it’s a half hour off the highway, take the time to do it and enjoy it.”\n\nA few more tips before departure for a smooth adventure\n\nIf traveling internationally, make sure you have your passport and it is valid. If you don’t have a passport, routine processing can take several months. If you have a passport that you obtained when you were 16 or older, it is good for 10 years, but some countries, including the U.S., require they be valid for six months beyond the dates of your trip. Make two copies of your passport and credit card and take one with you and leave one at home with a family member or friend.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) with the U.S. Department of State. This free service allows the U.S. Embassy to contact you and provide assistance during an emergency overseas. Additionally, leave a copy of your itinerary with a loved one so they know where you are.\n\nConsider travel insurance. It’s a great thing to have in uncertain times and can cover expenses if a trip gets canceled, or if you suffer a medical emergency overseas.\n\nTravel with a credit card with no foreign transaction fees — and make sure the credit card company knows the dates you are traveling.\n\nDon’t pack your jewelry or pills in your luggage, put them in your carry-on, along with a change of clothing in case your suitcase gets lost.\n\nIf you’re taking a cruise, fly into the location where the ship is departing from a day or two early.\n\nBe flexible. Travel is rarely without hiccups.\n\nMost importantly, remember you may never pass this way again.\n\nEnjoyment of the overall travel experience is key, the travel agents all agree, and tourists are ready to unlock the wonders of the world after pandemic confinement.\n\n“I think its spillover from COVID — people really want to travel,” Langwald said. “It’s a crazy world and we only live once. Let’s book the trips we want to do. People put them off for a while and COVID made people rethink their lives and what is important.”\n\nMore Travel:Milford pair travels 5,635 miles, nearly 1 year by boat in America's Great Loop\n\nMore Travel:Vacation of a lifetime: Two years, 40 countries, countless memories\n\nMore Travel:Camino de Santiago a life-altering trek for Brighton pilgrim\n\nContact reporter Susan Bromley at sbromley@hometownlife.com or 517-281-2412.

Here's the one travel tip you should follow\n\nIs this holiday season going to be busy?\n\nAccording to travel experts, demand is high this holiday season, especially given that Christmas and New Year’s land on weekends. According to a survey by Hopper, 86% of holiday travelers plan to fly for one or both holidays this year.\n\nWhen should I book holiday travel?\n\nYou can get some of the best fares if you purchase around 50 days in advance, according to Bouvrie. You should try to book all your holiday travel plans before the end of October.\n\nThat means it’s time to start booking Thanksgiving flights now.\n\nFor Christmas, Hopper recommends travelers book airfare before Oct. 14. Airfare will be volatile but still low during this time, so you should monitor prices using a flight tracker.\n\nKAYAK gives a few more days, suggesting that travelers should buy by Oct. 24 – this is when prices were the cheapest in 2023.\n\nWhen is the cheapest time to travel this holiday season?\n\nThose who are flexible with their travel dates will save the most money this holiday season, Bouvrie said. Travelers can use the KAYAK Best Time to Travel tool to find out what days to book for their route.\n\nFor Thanksgiving, Hopper said that the cheapest day to travel right now is Nov. 20, the Sunday before the holiday – you could save up to 13% on your flight.

Confiscated assets include 28 mansions, 19 aeroplanes, a hotel and 361 luxury cars, and there are allegations of a prostitution ring dubbed the Oil Dolls.\n\n“They gave themselves a life that not even Gulf princes have,” the paper quotes Saab as saying.\n\nThe episode “offers a rare window into the chaos and corruption at the top of PDVSA”, said The Economist, “the state oil giant which Mr Maduro, following in the footsteps of his late predecessor, Hugo Chávez, has driven to near-ruin”.\n\nThe unfolding of a scandal\n\nOil has been “the backbone of Venezuela’s autocratic regimes for decades”, said The Economist. The country has one of the world’s largest oil reserves, and “successive presidents have been accused of stealing the easily tapped profits for their own use”, wrote The Sunday Times.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nPDVSA was once the second largest oil company in the world, during the oil boom in the early 2000s, when record high prices allowed the leftist Chávez to launch “numerous initiatives” for public services, reported Al Jazeera.\n\n“But a subsequent drop in prices and government mismanagement”, first under Chávez’s government and then his successor, Maduro, “ended the lavish spending”, the site reported. “And so began a complex crisis that has pushed millions into poverty and driven more than seven million Venezuelans to migrate.”\n\nIn 2016, the then opposition-led National Assembly said $11bn had gone missing at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014.\n\nEl Aissami, who headed the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Chávez and served as vice-president from 2017 to 2018, was accused by the US in 2017 of participating in corruption, money laundering and drug trafficking: a “narcotics kingpin”, according to Al Jazeera. He denies all the accusations.\n\nTwo years later, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on PDVSA to try to pressure Maduro into resigning, after the Venezuelan president “blatantly rigged the previous year’s election”, said The Sunday Times. The company’s losses came about partly because it had become “more reckless” in order to evade the sanctions, The Economist said.\n\nPDVSA became reliant on fellow sanctioned allies Russia and Iran to import and sell oil at a heavy discount. In 2019 Maduro ordered PDVSA to move its European office to Moscow. Venezuela began accepting payments in rubles or cryptocurrency.\n\n‘Corruption and incompetence’\n\nWhen the pandemic caused a global slump in demand for oil, production at PDVSA plummeted. In April 2020, El Aissami was appointed Venezuela’s minister of oil.\n\nAn audit of PDVSA’s accounts in March this year showed “corruption and incompetence on a monumental scale”, said The Sunday Times. The anti-corruption police issued a communique on 17 March, which led to the first round of arrests.\n\nSaab told reporters the alleged scheme involved selling Venezuelan oil through the country’s cryptocurrency oversight agency, in parallel to PDVSA. Some cryptocurrency payments reportedly turned out to be either scams, or to lead to huge losses.\n\nEl Aissami stepped down on 20 March. He has not been mentioned as a target for the investigation, and has pledged to help investigators while also publicly declaring his support for Maduro’s anti-corruption campaign.\n\nStabilising the economy\n\nVenezuela is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world, ranked by Transparency International in 2022 as 177th out of 180 countries.\n\nOfficials “are rarely held accountable”, said Al Jazeera, “a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom now live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty”.\n\n“It would be very difficult for even a much less corrupt state to implement all the necessary controls,” Francisco Monaldi, who heads the Latin America energy programme at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, told The Associated Press.\n\nInternal PDVSA documents showed that more than half of its fleet of 22 oil tankers are so run down that they are at risk of “sinking, fires, or spills”, Reuters reported, and should be immediately taken out of service or repaired.\n\nAnalysts suspect Maduro may be seeking to stabilise the economy before next year’s presidential elections. The local currency, the bolívar, has slumped sharply against the dollar.\n\nThe anti-corruption drive, said OilPrice.com, could also be an attempt to persuade the US to lift sanctions on Venezuela.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/12/seize-boeing-747-cargo-aircraft-iranian-airline/72578543007/", "title": "U.S. seizes Boeing 747 cargo aircraft formerly owned by Iranian firm", "text": "The United States government has seized a Boeing 747 cargo plane that was previously owned by a sanctioned Iranian airline, the Justice Department said Monday.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Iranian airline Mahan Air sold the American-built plane to Emtrasur, a Venezuelan cargo airline and subsidiary of a state-owned firm that had previously been sanctioned by the U.S.\n\nOfficials said the sale violated American export control laws.\n\nMatthew S.

Phil Waldron and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, the sources said. Both Army veterans spread misinformation about the election being stolen from Trump.\n\nWhile advisers publicly floated the idea at the time, revelations that two draft executive orders were actually drawn up for different agencies to carry out the job underscores the extent to which the former President’s allies wanted to weaponize the powers of his lame-duck administration to overturn the election.\n\nAny operation for the military or federal agents to seize voting equipment for political purposes would have been unprecedented in US history.\n\nCNN has reported the existence of a draft order tasking the Pentagon with seizing voting machines. That document has been handed over by the National Archives to the House select committee, which is investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nMultiple sources now tell CNN that a second version of the document, instructing DHS to carry out the same task, also exists.\n\nIt’s unclear who drafted the executive orders, and neither was issued.\n\nBut Flynn and Trump’s former attorney Sidney Powell advocated for the idea during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting in mid-December 2020. The meeting devolved into screaming matches as some of the President’s advisers pushed back on various proposals, including invoking martial law and naming Powell special counsel to investigate voter fraud claims, CNN reported at the time.\n\nThe House select committee is now looking into the effort to draft an executive order and how it began, including the roles of Flynn, Waldron and Powell as well as another Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Bernie Kerik, who worked alongside Giuliani after the election to find any evidence of voter fraud.\n\nKerik recently testified to the committee about the effort, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. And a log detailing documents that he believes are covered by attorney-client privilege refers to a memo about seizing voting machines.\n\nAfter the Pentagon draft document, as first reported by Politico, came to light, committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said in an interview with CNN: “It’s an extraordinary document, and we have a lot of questions about it.”\n\n“We’ve got no evidence at this point that there were steps taken in the Department of Defense to implement that memo but … it’s a lawless document and really breathtaking in its approach,” the California Democrat added.\n\nCNN previously reported that Giuliani had approached Ken Cuccinelli, who was second in command at Homeland Security at the time, about seizing voting machines after the election, and Cuccinelli told him the department didn’t have that authority.\n\nReached earlier this month, Cuccinelli said his discussion with Giuliani “never developed to the point of talking about an executive order including such action that I recall.”\n\nWhen asked about the executive order involving the military, Giuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, said his client also shut that idea down when he became aware of it.\n\n“As soon as he heard about this idea, he was vehemently against it, as was White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and then-President Trump,” Costello said.\n\nBut Giuliani and his team did continue to pursue other avenues for overturning the election based on the same conspiracies about election fraud cited in the draft executive order to justify the seizure of voting machines.\n\nTrump also continued to entertain some of the same core elements of those executive orders, including the idea of installing a special counsel to investigate election fraud.\n\nNearly two weeks after White House aides pushed back on the suggestion of naming Powell to such a role, Trump raised the idea again during another Oval Office meeting, but this time floated Cuccinelli as a possible candidate, according to testimony provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee by former senior Justice Department officials who were present.\n\nMeanwhile, Flynn remained adamant that election equipment was going to be seized and personally reached out to at least one senior defense official in mid-December attempting to enlist their help with his cause, according to a source familiar with the outreach.\n\nHe also promoted the idea during a Newsmax interview on December 17.\n\n”He could immediately on his order seize every single one of these machines around the country on his order. He could also order, within the swing states, if he wanted to, he could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states. It’s not unprecedented,” Flynn said at the time.\n\nFlynn, Powell and Waldron could not be reached for comment Monday.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Paula Reid", "Zachary Cohen", "Paula Reid"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/mar-a-lago-special-master/index.html", "title": "Special master: Appeals court halts review of Trump documents ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a major defeat for former President Donald Trump, a federal appeals court on Thursday halted a third-party review of documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nThe ruling removes a major obstacle to the Justice Department’s investigation into the mishandling of government records from Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed US District Judge Aileen Cannon’s order appointing a so-called special master to sort through thousands of documents found at Trump’s home to determine what should be off limits to investigators. The court said the judge should not have intervened in the first place.\n\n“The law is clear,” the appeals court wrote. “We cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant. Nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so.”\n\nThe 11th Circuit said that either approach would be a “radical reordering of our caselaw limiting the federal courts’ involvement in criminal investigations” and that “both would violate bedrock separation-of-powers limitations.”\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating obstruction of justice, criminal mishandling of government records and violations of the Espionage Act, according to court filings. The probe exploded into public view with the August search, which came after investigators obtained evidence they said led them to believe that Trump had not complied with a subpoena for all documents marked as classified being stored at his Florida home.\n\nThe opinion – which was issued jointly by the three-judge panel made up of all GOP appointees – dismantled Trump’s arguments for why a special master was necessary. The court said that only in extraordinary circumstances should courts intervene in Justice Department investigations that are still in their early stages, and that standard had not been met here.\n\n“This restraint guards against needless judicial intrusion into the course of criminal investigations—a sphere of power committed to the executive branch,” the court wrote.\n\nThe appeals court said that its new ruling will go into effect in seven days, unless a party in the case successfully seeks an order – known as a stay – pausing the ruling from going into effect while it is appealed.\n\nTrump’s legal team has not decided whether to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court but is weighing the option, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nRebuke of Judge Cannon’s deference to Trump\n\nThe ruling is a stinging rebuke of how Cannon inserted herself into the dispute. In addition to reversing the order, the appeals court is instructing her to dismiss the entire case.\n\nThe appeals court took aim at the idea, hinted at in her order appointing the special master, that Trump deserves special treatment because he is a former president.\n\n“It is indeed extraordinary for a warrant to be executed at the home of a former president – but not in a way that affects our legal analysis or otherwise gives the judiciary license to interfere in an ongoing investigation,” the court said.\n\nTo create that “special exception,” the 11th Circuit wrote “would defy our Nation’s foundational principle that our law applies ‘to all, without regard to numbers, wealth, or rank.’”\n\nThe three-judge panel that issued the ruling is comprised of appointees of Republican presidents, including two who were put on the bench by Trump: Britt Grant and Andrew Basher. Both jurists had previously hinted in a ruling related to the case that they believed Cannon had overreached.\n\nThe third, Judge William Pryor, the chief judge of the appellate court, is an appointee of George W. Bush who has long demonstrated his conservative bona fides on a host of controversial issues.\n\nTrump had sought the special master in the weeks after the August search, securing the court order from Cannon. Judge Raymond Dearie, a senior judge who sits in Brooklyn, had been tasked by Cannon with leading the review of the thousands of documents that remained.\n\nDuring oral arguments in the 11th Circuit case, Trump’s attorney James Trusty said that only about 900 of those documents were in dispute. Trump’s legal team contends the documents are his personal records or privileged and should be kept outside the scope of the investigation.\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department argued that the special master process stood to drag out for several weeks, if not months, impeding the probe into the documents. Prosecutors said that without access to the other documents, they could not question witnesses about the materials that had been found intermixed with classified records at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Justice Department effort is now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed last week to helm that probe and another investigation into efforts to reverse Trump’s 2020 election loss that could implicate the former president and current 2024 White House candidate.\n\nSmith took over the investigation shortly before the 11th Circuit heard oral arguments in the case and said in court filings that he approved the stance federal prosecutors had taken. He has promised to not let his appointment slow the pace of the investigations he’s taking over.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2017/04/20/general-motors-venezuela-plant-seized/100685120/", "title": "GM has few legal options after Venezuela seizes plant", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard and Brent Snavely\n\nUSA TODAY and Detroit Free Press\n\nVenezuelan authorities suddenly seized a General Motors plant in Venezuela on Wednesday, forcing the company to halt its operations and leaving it with few legal options in a country marked by political and economic instability.\n\nThe world's third-largest automaker assailed the takeover as an \"illegal judicial seizure of its assets.\"\n\n\"GM (Venezuela) strongly rejects the arbitrary measures taken by the authorities and will vigorously take all legal actions, within and outside of Venezuela, to defend its rights,\" the automaker said in a statement.\n\nBut its legal recourse against the Venezuelan government is likely limited, said Peter Quinter, Miami-based chair of the law firm Gray Robinson's Customs and International Trade Law Group.\n\n\"They can go to the courts here in the United States and try to seek action, but that really is not going to be effective unless the Venezuelan government has some assets here” that could be seized as compensation, Quinter said. \"I don't see that happening.\"\n\nAutomakers, including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, all have plants in the country and have struggled to make money in Venezuela in recent years as the economy has weakened and political instability has risen.\n\nAt one time, GM was producing a number of Chevrolet cars at its Valencia plant, such as the Aveo, Spark and Cruise but it hasn't made any cars there since 2015, according to Stephanie Brinley, senior analyst for IHS Automotive.\n\nArndt Ellinghorst, an automotive analyst for Evercore ISI, said the impact on GM's finances may be minimal since the company didn't expect to produce or sell many cars there this year.\n\nIndeed, GM’s stock price rose 31 cents, or 0.9%, to close at $34.10 on Thursday.\n\nThe seizure comes as the South American nation experiences intense public protests against the government of President Nicolas Maduro.

But in posts on his social media platform, Trump has argued that he had declassified all of the documents in his possession.\n\n“Number one, it was all declassified,” he wrote in a post on August 12. “Lucky I Declassified!” he wrote in a post this Wednesday.\n\nTrump’s comments about this supposed declassification have been very vague. But conservative writer John Solomon, one of the people Trump named as a representative in his dealings with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), was more specific in a Fox appearance on August 12. Solomon read a statement, which he said was from Trump’s office, claiming that Trump “had a standing order…that documents removed from the Oval Office and taken to the residence were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them.”\n\nFacts First: Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so. Eighteen former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN in August that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nIt’s important to note that the laws under which the Justice Department is now investigating possible crimes – statutes about the willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of a federal investigation, and the concealment or removal of government records – do not require documents to be classified for a crime to have been committed. (A grand jury subpoena in May and the search warrant in August both sought documents with “classification markings,” not specifically documents that are currently classified.) Also, there would be major questions about the legal validity of any broad “standing order” to automatically declassify any document Trump carried out of a certain room.\n\nBut first things first: Trump has shown no corroboration for the claim that he did issue such an order.\n\nThe Justice Department said in the court filing this week that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified either when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings in January (after an extended back-and-forth with NARA) or when responding to the grand jury subpoena in June, when they returned another package of documents that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\n– CNN’s Jamie Gangel, Elizabeth Stuart and Jeremy Herb contributed to this item.\n\nThe claim: The feds could’ve just asked for the documents\n\nTrump has argued that the search was unnecessary because the federal investigators could have simply asked for the documents from his team, which he claimed had been fully cooperative.\n\n“They could have had it anytime they wanted—and that includes LONG ago. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK,” Trump posted on his social media platform on August 12.\n\nFacts First: It is not true that federal investigators could have long ago obtained the government records in Trump’s possession just by asking. By the time of the search, the federal government had been asking Trump for more than a year to return records from his presidency. Even when the Justice Department went beyond asking in May and served Trump’s team with the subpoena for the return of all documents with classification markings, Trump’s team returned only some of these documents – and then, in June, Trump lawyer Christina Bobb signed a document certifying on behalf of Trump’s office that all of the documents had been returned, though that was not true.\n\nIn other words: Trump claimed that the Justice Department could have just asked for the documents “LONG ago” even though his team explicitly and inaccurately told the department in June that there were no documents left to ask for. Relatedly, the department has called into question how cooperative Trump’s team was.\n\nIn its court filing this week, the department asserted that investigators “developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room” at Mar-a-Lago “and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation.” They said of the August search: “That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the ‘diligent search’ that the former President’s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter.”\n\nThe claim: It was the bureaucrats’ fault\n\nA member of Trump’s team has tried to pin blame on the General Services Administration, a federal agency that provides transition office space and assistance services to the outgoing president.\n\nKash Patel, a former Trump administration official whom Trump named as another representative to NARA, said on Fox on August 12 on that “the GSA has since come out, the Government (sic) Services Administration, and said they mistakenly packed some boxes and moved them to Mar-a-Lago. That’s not on the President. That’s on the National Archives to sort that material out.” Patel said that even if material was classified, which is “highly unlikely,” the fact that the GSA boxed the material “should have been the end” of the matter.\n\nFacts First: The GSA has repeatedly rejected Patel’s claim. The agency says it had no role in deciding which documents from Trump’s outgoing transition office in Virginia would be placed in boxes or which boxes would be shipped to Mar-a-Lago – and that these decisions were made by Trump’s team alone.\n\nA GSA spokesperson said in a statement last week that it was Trump’s team, not the GSA, that packed the boxes and that it was Trump’s team, not the GSA, that put these boxes on pallets and shrink-wrapped them for shipping from Trump’s transition office in Virginia. GSA did enter into a support contract for the actual September 2021 shipping, but “not for the packing of the boxes,” the spokesperson said – and “GSA did not examine the contents of the boxes and, accordingly, had no knowledge of the contents prior to shipping.”\n\nIt is not clear how many of the government documents recovered at Mar-a-Lago were part of the September 2021 shipments from Virginia. It is theoretically possible that some documents were taken to Mar-a-Lago at other times and in other ways.\n\n- CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this item.\n\nThe claim: The FBI may have planted evidence\n\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba said on Fox on August 9: “I’m concerned that they may have planted something; you know, at this point, who knows?” The next day, Trump suggested on social media that it was shady that the FBI would not allow witnesses, such as his lawyers, to be in the rooms being searched and “see what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, ‘planting.’”\n\nFacts First: There is zero evidence that the FBI planted anything at Mar-a-Lago. And it is routine, not suspicious, for searches to be conducted without witnesses such as lawyers being in the room; lawyers don’t have a right to watch.\n\nThe claim about possible “planting” is impossible to definitively debunk at this point. Once more, though, Trump and his allies have not shown even a hint of proof that it is true.\n\nThe claim: Obama took tens of millions of documents\n\nThe week of the search, Trump turned to a familiar tactic under pressure: confuse the public by making false claims about former President Barack Obama. Trump asserted that Obama had taken tens of millions of documents to Chicago, Obama’s adopted hometown and the location of his future library and museum.\n\nIn a social media post on August 11, Trump wrote, “What happened to the 30 million pages of documents taken from the White House to Chicago by Barack Hussein Obama? He refused to give them back! What is going on? This act was strongly at odds with NARA. Will they be breaking into Obama’s ‘mansion’ in Martha’s Vineyard?” In another statement on August 12, Trump claimed: “President Barack Hussein Obama kept 33 million pages of documents, much of them classified.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims about Obama are comprehensively untrue – and the National Archives and Records Administration issued an official statement making that clear. The statement explained that all of Obama’s presidential records remain in NARA’s “exclusive legal and physical custody”; that it was NARA, not Obama, that took about 30 million records to a NARA facility in the Chicago area; that the records it took to the Chicago-area facility are unclassified; and that classified Obama records are at a different NARA facility.\n\nNARA has more information here about the plan for Obama’s presidential records.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/04/20/general-motors-venezuela-plant-seizure/100684954/", "title": "Venezuela seizes GM plant as crisis escalates", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard and Nathan Bomey\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nVenezuela's seizure of a General Motors factory marks a step in the country's economic crisis that boosts risks to the remaining operations of other U.S. and multinational companies.\n\nAmid turmoil punctuated by skyrocketing prices, unemployment, low oil prices and failed economic policies, the government seizure put an abrupt end to GM's operations -- a fate that other companies have faced.\n\n\"GM is not the first and they’re not going to be the last because the government of Venezuela is desperate for any assets they can take,\" said Peter Quinter, Miami-based chair of law firm GrayRobinson's Customs and International Trade Law Group. \"It really is a vicious cycle they're in.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has previously seized assets belonging to U.S. companies, including those of cleaning products maker Clorox in 2014, glassmaker Owens-Illinois in 2010 and nationalized a rice mill operated by Cargill.\n\nGM denounced the South American country's actions as an \"illegal judicial seizure of its assets\" and vowed a legal battle, but the company's protections are minimal in a country with a dubious commitment to the law.\n\nAlthough other automakers, including Fiat Chrysler and Toyota, said their plants had not been touched, the Venezuelan government's assault on the world's third-largest automaker suggests the country is getting bolder as its economic circumstances deteriorate.\n\nThe move comes amid intense public protests in Venezuela against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Three people were killed late Wednesday as tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to demand fresh presidential elections and the release of jailed opposition politicians.\n\nGeneral Motors Venezolana, GM's local subsidiary, was established in 1948 and employs about 2,700 workers and has 79 dealers in the country. The firm said it would make \"separation payments\" to affected workers.\n\nGM representatives did not respond to questions about whether the company had contacted the Trump administration for help.\n\nTo be sure, the direct financial impact on GM is not likely to be large. Consequently, investors were not shaken by the plant's demise. GM shares rose 31 cents Thursday to close at $34.10.\n\n\"Any lost production is unlikely to prove material,\" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note to investors, adding that the \"day may have arrived\" where the plant is unsalvageable.\n\nAs for other automakers, Ford had already shut down its Venezuela plant due to lack of demand but the company remains in possession of the facility, spokeswoman Kelli Felker said Thursday.\n\nToyota's \"operations in Venezuela are currently operating normally,\" spokesman Scott Vazin said. \"Our team members, dealers and customers remain our top priorities, and we are monitoring the situation closely.\"\n\nFiat Chrysler \"is maintaining its production plans in Venezuela in support of efforts to rebuild the country’s automotive sector,\" the company, which makes the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Forza in the country, said in a statement.\n\nGM said in a statement that vehicles and other assets had been taken from its facilities. The Detroit-based company did not provide details about how the seizure unfolded.\n\nThe automaker said it would \"vigorously take all legal actions, within and outside of Venezuela, to defend its rights.\"\n\nBut its legal recourse against the Venezuelan government is likely limited, Quinter said.\n\n\"They can go to the courts here in the United States and try to seek action. But that really is not going to be effective unless the Venezuelan government has some assets here” that could be seized as compensation, Quinter said. \"I don't see that happening.\"\n\nVenezuela has high crime and inflation rates and there are shortages of many basic goods and services. It is oil-rich but cash-poor. Maduro has used his Socialist government's institutions to pursue political opponents.\n\nMuch of Venezuela's woe stems from the low price of oil, the export that has long fueled the economy. But the country's troubles also stem from government overspending, runaway inflation and corruption.\n\nThe country is engulfed by food shortages. People have turned their pets loose in the streets, unable to buy food for them. Companies have tried to cope. Coca-Cola said last year that it could no longer obtain the raw material to bottle the sugar-based version of its famous soft drink.\n\nRelations with the U.S. have been tense in recent years, although Maduro's anti-American rhetoric has softened since President Trump took office. Venezuela's Information Ministry was not immediately available for comment Thursday.\n\n\"We are concerned that the government of Maduro is violating its own constitution and is not allowing the opposition to have their voices heard, nor allowing them to organize in a way that expresses the views of the Venezuelan people,\" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters Wednesday, before the GM episode was publicized.\n\nThe troubled Venezuelan economy has dragged down the auto industry for several years, as tanking sales and abysmal currency exchange rates have undermined earnings.\n\nGM said it was \"confident that justice will eventually be served and looks forward to continue leading the Venezuelan market.\"\n\n\"In the meantime, GMV, through its dealers, will continue to provide aftermarket service and parts for its customers,\" the company said.\n\nContributing: Brent Snavely of the Detroit Free Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/politics/watergate-scandal-burglars-break-in-mistakes-origseriesfilms/index.html", "title": "Watergate burglars made these 6 mistakes in 1972 that led to them ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTheir mission was to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, bug the room and photograph documents. If everything had gone as planned, no one would have ever known.\n\nBut instead June 17, 1972, became an infamous day. The burglary set off a series of actions that brought down Republican President Richard Nixon – the only US president to resign.\n\n“Watergate is the largest political scandal in American history,” John Dean, who was White House counsel to Nixon, told CNN for the Original Series “Watergate: Blueprint for a Scandal,” which commemorates its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe break-in and subsequent cover-up forever changed American politics, and “Watergate” became a synonym for government corruption. The crime is still referenced in today’s political discourse, as with Bridgegate, Pizzagate and Deflategate.\n\nHere are six mistakes that led to the Watergate investigation – the first dominoes to fall in the political scandal.\n\nThey used the ‘F-team’\n\nWhile president, Nixon created a White House unit called the “plumbers.” This unit had two goals: investigate leaks of sensitive information and discredit the administration’s enemies.\n\nSince the President couldn’t use official organizations like the FBI and the CIA for these illegal activities, Nixon’s White House used what Tim Naftali, CNN presidential historian and director of New York University’s undergraduate public policy major, calls “a ragtag group.”\n\n“The country was very fortunate that the CIA and FBI refused to bend completely to Nixon’s will, so Nixon and his lieutenants opted to go outside the established institutions to do their dirty work,” he said.\n\nThe Watergate office complex in Washington, in 1972. Getty Images\n\nIn 1971, the plumbers broke into the psychiatrist’s office of military analyst Daniel Ellsberg to photograph the psychiatrist’s notes on Ellsberg try to smear him in the press. Ellsberg was a target for leaking the Pentagon Papers – a top-secret multi-volume report that revealed senior American leaders knew that the Vietnam War was unwinnable.\n\nThe plumbers’ objective was to enter the office and leave undetected. But they couldn’t open the door, which they had secretly left unlocked earlier in the day, so they broke a window, creating a scene. Then they didn’t find any psychiatrist notes, so they left empty-handed.\n\n“So you’d think that would be the end of them, but it wasn’t. The same group gets reconstituted,” Naftali said. For Watergate, “the leadership is the same and the bulk of the team is the same.”\n\n“It wasn’t like the White House is relying on the A-team; they are relying on the F-team,” he said. “So it’s not surprising they bungled it.”\n\nFailed attempts raised the stakes\n\nThe five men tasked with breaking into the DNC made multiple attempts at the task. The more attempts, the more likely you’re going to get caught.\n\n“The first time they failed completely because the door was locked and they didn’t have the right locksmith with them,” Naftali said.\n\nJohn Dean in 2020.\n\n“The second time they didn’t appear to know where Larry O’Brien’s office was located,” Dean explained. O’Brien was the campaign chairman for Democratic Sen. George McGovern, who was running for president against Nixon in 1972. “So they bugged an empty conference room.”\n\nThe third attempt was intended to correct the previous errors. But the third time was not the charm.\n\n“They wanted to move a bug. They had three more bugs, which they wanted to plant. They were also going to put a listening device in a smoke detector,” Naftali said. “This would have been a massive espionage operation had it succeeded.”\n\nAfterward, Dean recalled Gordon Liddy, the organizer of the Watergate break-in and a former special agent of the FBI, saying to him: “‘I shouldn’t have had so many people. But we had to get back in there. … I know I’ve screwed up terribly, and I can understand if you want to take me out.”\n\nTaped door latch was discovered\n\nA simple mistake by James McCord, a former CIA officer who was one of the burglars, led to a watchman foiling the crime of the century.\n\n“McCord was the wiretapping expert on the team,” Naftali said. “And he insisted on taping the doors. And he was asked, did you remember to remove all the tape? And he said yes. And he hadn’t.”\n\nRELATED: Quiz: How well do you know Watergate?\n\nThe crew had placed tape over every door latch – to prevent the self-locking doors from engaging – from the basement to the sixth floor, where the DNC offices were.\n\nWatergate security guard Frank Wills spotted the tape plastered over one door’s latch.He called the police at 1:47 a.m. and reported the break-in.\n\nYears later, one of the burglars, Eugenio Martinez, told Naftali in an oral history for the Nixon Library that he had been surprised by all the mistakes and that the tradecraft errors were difficult to understand.\n\nThe miscommunication\n\nA backup plan was in place in case police were notified, but that was also botched.\n\nA lookout man, Alfred C. Baldwin, was across the street with a walkie-talkie to alert the burglars if anyone was coming.\n\nNaftali said, “McCord turned down the volume on the walkie-talkie. So when the lookout man could see DC police moving towards DNC headquarters, the burglars didn’t get the alert.”\n\nWhen Baldwin finally was able to notify the crew,it was too late: Police were already in the building. They spotted the five men, who were all wearing surgical gloves, crouching behind desks.\n\nThe burglars didn’t dress like burglars\n\nAfter the men were taken into custody, Ron Ziegler, the White House press secretary, downplayed the break-in as a “third-rate burglary.”\n\nThe journalists assigned to cover the arraignment assumed it was a non-story. Journalist Lesley Stahl joked to CNN that it initially appeared to be a “nothing burger” and said she had gotten the assignment because the editor gave the story to “the new girl.”\n\nBut quickly, the signs that this story was significant were hard to ignore.\n\nMarking the 30th anniversary of the break-in, the National Archives in 2002 displayed some of the police evidence that had been sealed in archival warehouses. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe five intruders – Bernard Barker, Virgilio Gonzalez, Frank Sturgis, Martinez and McCord – appeared in court hours after the arrest dressed in business suits.\n\n“Nine months on the police beat, I’d never seen a burglar who was well dressed,” journalist Bob Woodward, who covered Watergate for The Washington Post, told CNN.\n\nWhat police discovered in the men’s possession made them even more suspicious. The men had hundred-dollar bills (with the serial numbers in sequence), lockpicks, door jimmies, cameras, a short-wave receiver that could pick up police calls and three pen-sized tear gas guns, the Post reported in 1972.\n\n“When the DC police caught them, they had something like 35 rolls of undeveloped film and very advanced cameras with them. So they weren’t just looking for one file. They were looking for tons of information,” Naftali said.\n\nStahl said that’s when she knew this wasn’t just a local break-in. It was something much bigger.\n\n“I was getting more and more excited about this story,” she said. “This was going to go higher.”\n\nThe ‘holy s***’ moment\n\nWithout a backup plan in case of an arrest, the burglars were cornered into revealing some key information that morning in the courtroom: three key letters, to be exact.\n\nWoodward recalls the jaw-dropping moment when one of the suspects was questioned: “The judge said, ‘Where have you worked?’ And the lead burglar, McCord, said ‘CIA.’ And when he said CIA, I think I blurted out, ‘Holy s***.’ “\n\n“Bob’s reaction was the right one: Holy s***,” journalist Carl Bernstein, who worked with Woodward to uncover the Watergate scandal, told CNN.\n\n“CIA. Oh my goodness, OK. We’re in a whole new territory,” said Stahl.\n\nMcCord had retired from the CIA and was a security officer on Nixon’s Committee to Re-elect the President. The others had been hired by Nixon campaign aides: Liddy and Howard Hunt, a former CIA officer and counsel to the campaign committee.\n\n“The White House understands immediately that this could lead back to them,” Naftali said.\n\nIn the months that followed, FBI agents, journalists and congressional investigations began to piece together details of the scandal that pointed to White House involvement.\n\n“Watergate is not the story of one break-in. It’s the story of a pattern of presidential betrayal of trust,” concluded Naftali. “What’s really troubling about this story is if Nixon had chosen more professional secret warriors, think of the damage that could have been done to our democracy.”", "authors": ["Janelle Davis"], "publish_date": "2022/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/15/americas/venezuelan-migrants-title-42-expansion-intl/index.html", "title": "Venezuelan migrants in shock and limbo after new US immigration ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“The news hit me like a bucket of cold water,” says Alejaidys Morey, a 30-year-old Venezuelan woman, who until this week was planning to start traveling towards the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US announced that it is expanding Title 42 — a pandemic-era provision that allows migration officials to expel illegal migrants to Mexico on public health grounds — and unveiled a new program to allow some Venezuelan migrants to apply to arrive at US ports of entry by air with a cap of 24,000.\n\nBoth plans are designed to dissuade Venezuelans like Morey from attempting to enter illegally and dangerously overland through the US-Mexico border.\n\nBut many migrants who are already en route tell CNN that the Biden administration’s decision leaves them in agonizing limbo, after having already given up everything to begin the trek northward.\n\nThey also point out that the new airport entry program favors the wealthy and well-connected — in other words, Venezuelans who can afford to fly northward in the comfort of an airplane.\n\nVenezuelan migrants crossing the Suchiate river between Guatemala and Mexico. Marco Ugarte/AP\n\nThe Venezuelan migration crisis is more acute than ever. More than seven million Venezuelans now live abroad, according to new figures released this month by the United Nations, fleeing a humanitarian crisis in their home country.\n\nMost live in other South American countries – there are more than two million in Colombia alone — but in recent months a growing number have started to head north to the US through Central America and Mexico, as living conditions deteriorate amid the Covid-19 pandemic and a global food crisis.\n\nAs a result, the number of Venezuelans apprehended at the US southern border is ballooning. Up to 180,000 Venezuelans have crossed the border over the past year, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA disqualifying route\n\nPanama and Mexico form a geographical passageway for overland travelers coming from South America. Under the new US migration provision, any northbound migrant entering Panama or Mexico illegally will be ineligible from the program.\n\nThe journey that Morey, her husband Rodolfo and their three children planned would have been just that. They aimed to travel first to the town of Necocli in Colombia, and then hike into Panama via the Darien Gap, a 100-kilometer stretch of jungle that is impassable by road.\n\nDespite the myriad dangers, 150,000 migrants have crossed on foot so far this year, according to Panamanian authorities.\n\nMorey, who is currently in Colombia, says a return to Venezuela is impossible. In 2018 her family sold their home in Santa Teresa del Tuy, an impoverished town some 30 kilometers southeast of Caracas, for US$1500 to pay for the journey to Colombia.\n\nNow, she feels she’s been thrown into limbo. Like so many others, she cannot afford to pay for a transcontinental flight — much less for her entire family.\n\n“Under these circumstances I have nowhere to go… I am scared: what can I do?” Morey told CNN.\n\nHer situation is the norm for most of the migrants who are currently traveling north.\n\n“After so much pain, so many obstacles we had to overcome, now we’re stuck. We are in Necocli and have nowhere to go…” a Venezuelan migrant who asked to be identified only as José told CNN.\n\nUp to 10,000 migrants are waiting in the town to cross the bay to the Darien Gap, according to local authorities, but some are now reconsidering their next move.\n\n“I’m in pain, I don’t know what to do now,” says Ender Dairen, a 28-year-old Venezuelan who was planning to join a group travelling north from Ecuador. But his plans changed after speaking with other migrants online.\n\n“A couple friends are thinking of just settling down wherever they got to, somewhere between Costa Rica and Nicaragua,” he told CNN. “Every person you speak with says the same thing: the whole route collapsed; we can no longer travel.”\n\nYadimar, a migrant from Venezuela who was sent to Mexico under Title 42. Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters\n\nA ‘cruel’ policy\n\nIn a call with reporters on Thursday, senior Homeland Security official Blas Nuñez-Neto said the goal is to reduce the number of migrants approaching the US southern border illegally, and at the same time to create a legal pathway for those eligible.\n\nBut the plan drew rare criticism from members of the Venezuelan opposition, who are generally aligned with Washington in their struggle against Venezuela’s authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro.\n\n“The US Government announced a cruel migratory policy, that makes the situation of thousands of Venezuelans more painful,” tweeted Henrique Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate and one of the few anti-Maduro leaders still living in Caracas.\n\nCarlos Vecchio, the official representative of the Venezuelan opposition in Washington, also tweeted that the plan “insufficient for the magnitude” of Venezuela’s migration crisis.\n\n“We recognize @POTUS’ efforts to seek alternatives to the migration crisis through Humanitarian Parole, for orderly and safe migration for Venezuelans,” he said.\n\n“But the 24,000 visas announced are insufficient for the magnitude of the problem. A reconsideration is necessary in this regard.”\n\nThe Venezuelan government has not commented on the new US policy.\n\nBut humanitarian organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF), have echoed others’ criticism that 24,000 legal permits are not enough — and insist that expulsion of others to Mexico under Title 42 should not be permitted.\n\n“We are shocked by the Biden administration’s decision to start expelling Venezuelans under Title 42, a cruel and inhumane policy that has no basis in safeguarding public health that should have been ended long ago,” said Avril Benoit, Executive director at MSF in a statement.\n\n“While we welcome the rollout of a special humanitarian parole program for Venezuelans, ensuring safe pathways into the US should be the norm and not the exception.”\n\nRights activists argue that asylum seekers should have a chance to present their cases in the US before being turned back.\n\nStill, some migrants say they see a glimmer of hope in the Biden administration’s new stance.\n\nOscar Chacin, 44, a boxing instructor who had considered the idea of traveling to the US via Central America for weeks, told CNN that he now sees a legal pathway to migrate.\n\n“For me, it’s actually better. This will make things worse for so many people, but for me it’s good,” he said. “I have relatives in the US, some friends and some former boxing students, some of them will be able to sponsor me and my family.”\n\nHis son, Oscar Alexander, is already in Mexico and entered before the new US immigration rules were unveiled.\n\n“He will stay there, now. He’s already looking for a job, and we will present the documentation as soon as we find the sponsor,” Chacin said.\n\n“Then we will wait for the paperwork.

But when he’s devouring hot dogs and buns, the 16-time Nathan’s champ also will have the competitors of Coney Island on his mind.\n\nThe contest in El Paso is set to last five minutes. The Nathan's contest in Brooklyn, New York, will last 10 minutes. Chestnut said his hope is to consume more hot dogs and buns in five minutes than the winner at Nathan’s contest manages this year in 10.\n\nNo Joey Chestnut this year:Here's who bettors think will take Nathan's Famous throne\n\n“I think 56 is doable,’’ said Chestnut, who in 2021 set the Nathan's record with 76 hot dogs and buns. “I’d be very happy to do that.’’\n\nThere will be no live ESPN telecast like at the Nathan's contest, but there will be a livestream, with the masticating set to start at 5 p.m. ET. There also will be charter airplanes pulling banners in Los Angeles and Miami encouraging people to “Watch Joey Eat.”\n\n“I wish them luck on that,'' said George Shea of Major League Eating (MLE), which runs the Nathan's contest. \"And I guess it’s possible that Joey’s such an amazing eater that he could do that (eat more hot dogs than the Nathan's winner in half the time) and that may be a way to snub us on Coney Island. But it’s just not going to the Nathan’s Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest.\"\n\nNothing seems quite the same with the Nathan's contest, especially Chestnut’s relationship with Shea, the event's longtime emcee, and MLE. It was MLE that announced June 11 Chestnut could not compete at Nathan's because he'd signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, a brand that sells meat substitutes. Competitive eaters at the Nathan's contest cannot endorse hot dogs other than Nathan's, which sponsors the contest on the Fourth.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shea said MLE had offered to \"set aside the exclusivity issue'' and let Chestnut compete this year. But he would be allowed to do so with the plan of signing a multiyear deal with Nathan's before the 2025 contest and end his partnership with Impossible Foods.\n\nChestnut's representatives declined, Shea said. Chestnut's representatives did not provide a comment in response to USA TODAY Sports' request submitted by email.\n\n“I think it’s fair to say that Impossible or any other brand that chooses Joey is doing so because of his recognition as a hot dog eater,'' Shea said. \"In fact, what they're promoting and selling is a hot dog. So I don’t thnk it is fair to suggest it’s not a conflict.''\n\nRegardless, Chestnut will be enveloped in patriotism Thursday at Fort Bliss, where he will have to eat more hot dogs than the combined total of four soldiers to win.\n\n“I’m thinking, might as well make it five (soldiers) so I won’t get lazy,’’ Chestnut told USA TODAY Sports. “Sometimes if it looks like I’m in the lead, I slow down. I really want to push hard for all five minutes.\n\n“If I’m going to eat on the Fourth of July, I’m going to eat hard.’’\n\n∎The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nJoey Chestnut copes with ban\n\nThree weeks after he learned he’d been banned by Nathan’s, Chestnut said he’s still coping. It’ll be the first time in 20 years he will not compete on the Fourth on Coney Island.\n\n“There’s definitely a lot of pain,’’ he said. “There’s a bit of grief.’’\n\nIn 2022, it became evident how important the contest is to Chestnut. He competed less than three weeks after his mother died. And he arrived at the contest on crutches because he had a broken leg.\n\n“I was like, all right, I don’t really want to tell people it’s a broken leg because then they’ll realize how crazy I am and how much I love this contest,’’ he said. “And I really didn’t want to tell people that my mom passed away because they’d be like, what, you should be grieving.\n\n“This situation is really bad, but it’s not nearly as bad as that one. I was able to get through that one and I was able to get through the year I lost (in 2015 to Matt Stonie) and come back stronger. I’m going to get through this and we’re going to see where it takes me.’’\n\nOf Chestnut, Shea said, \"He’s a great person and I consider him a friend. I would never want him to feel emotional distress ever. But I do believe in this cse, the emotional stress was prompted by his choices.''\n\nOne welcome distraction, Chestnut said, is his scheduled showdown with Takeru Kobayashi on Labor Day to be broadcast by Netflix. They last competed in 2006, a year before Kobayashi left Nathan's because of contractual issues with MLE. Chestnut expects intense competition from his former rival.\n\n“He’s not friendly toward me, which motivates me even harder,’’ Chestnut said. “We know we’re trying to push each other to uncomfortable limits.’’\n\nJoey Chestnut open to Nathan's return\n\nChestnut said he’s holding out hope of a return to the Nathan’s contest. But he said he had no regrets about his signing with Impossible Foods and how it transpired. His representatives and Impossible Foods would not disclose details of the deal.\n\n“Maybe time and public opinion will make them more reasonable,’’ he said of MLE, which runs the Nathan's competition.\n\nOn X, New York mayor Eric Adams wrote, “Stop being such weenies! It would be 'impossible' to have this year's Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest without Joey Chestnut. Let's find a way to squash this beef and bring back the champ for another 4th of July at Coney Island!’’\n\nSaid Shea, “He’s right. The issue here is we got into a contract dispute. You can get into who’s right and who’s wrong. Ultimately the fans just want to see Joey.''\n\nBut MLE's offer to let Chestnut compete if he agrees to sign with Nathan's and leaves Impossible Foods has gone over as well as a plant-based hot dog at the annual Fourth of July contest. But the impasse remained civil.\n\n“I’m not burning bridges,’’ Chestnut said. “They’ve made this bed and now we’ve got to sleep in it and figure out a way if there is a way (to reconcile).\n\n“But I think publicly I’ve been pretty respectful.’’\n\nJoey Chestnut, meat lover\n\nChestnut balks at the notion he'll be eating plant-based hot dogs in Fort Bliss or during his competition against Kobayashi. All beef, he assured, in dispelling the misnomer he's gone from carnivore to vegan because of his contract with Impossible Foods.\n\nInformal talks between Chestnut and the company were underway by early this year, said Peter McGuinness, the company’s CEO. Chestnut's representatives declined to provide the terms of the contract. The company declined, too, but it did announce it will be chartering the planes in Los Angeles and Miami pulling those \"Watch Joey Eat'' banners.\n\n“He really represents our target audience,’’ McGuinness said. “We’re a plant-based meat company. We’re not a vegan company. We make food designed to appeal to meat eaters and Flexitarians, people who eat animal meat and who also eat plant-based.’’\n\nChestnut attests he fits the profile.\n\n“And if I eat 14 pounds of bologna on Saturday, you can bet on Monday I’m going to be eating a plant-based diet and high fiber,’’ he said. “That’s part of my recovery. I’m very happy to be working with them, but I still love meat.’’\n\nFor the record, Chestnut said he’ll be eating all-beef hot dogs against Kobayashi on Labor Day. And, if he returns to Coney Island one day, it’ll be more beef.\n\n“If he ends up going back to Nathan’s, we’ll support him,’’ McGuinness said. “I just don’t see it as this controversial competitive at-war type of thing.\n\n“And I don’t think they should either, frankly.’’\n\nWhat to expect on the Fourth\n\nChestnut said he's heard supporters say of the Nathan's contest, 'We're not watching without Joey (competing).''\n\nBut Shea said he expects bigger crowds and higher TV ratings because of the \"intense'' controversy over Chestnut. He also said he thinks a more competitive contest might appeal to fans at an event that attracts more than 40,000 people every year, according to Allison O'Donnell, a publicist for the contest.\n\nWhile Chestnut usually dominates the field, Shea said this year he's expecting a tight competition among four top eaters on the men's side.\n\nAnd Chestnut's future on Coney Island?\n\n“He’s always welcome back,'' Shea said. \"If he and his team want to resolve it, I'm certain we can.’’\n\nFollow Josh Peter on social media @joshlpeter11", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/07/04/nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest-2024-results/74279491007/", "title": "Hot Dog Eating Contest results: Patrick Bertoletti, Miki Sudo win", "text": "The 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest kicked off at the corner of Surf and Stillwell in Coney Island, New York. While the tournament is all the same, a major player – and an American icon – wasn't present.\n\nThis year, Joey Chestnut wasn't be part of the contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating, leaving him on the sidelines and away from an opportunity at a 17th Mustard Belt. That opened the door (and the esophagus) for Patrick Bertoletti, who won in Chestnut's absence.\n\nOn the women's side, it was Miki Sudo and the field: Sudo is now a 10-time winner of the Ketchup Belt and has finished at the top of the heap in every contest she's performed in.\n\nNathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest results\n\nPatrick \"Deep Dish\" Bertoletti, 39, chomped down a personal best 58 hot dogs and buns to win the 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, which was without perennial champion Joey Chestnut, who was banned from this year's contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating.\n\nIn the women's contest, Miki Sudo ate 51 hot dogs and buns, becoming the first woman to break the 50-dog threshold and eclipsing her personal record of 48. She won her 10th pink championship belt.\n\nWho is Nathan’s new champion?\n\nPatrick \"Deep Dish\" Bertoletti, 39, hails from Chicago. He is not the second coming of Joey Chestnut, but he’s been an accomplished competitor on the Major League Eating (MLE) circuit for more than a decade.\n\nHe holds 32 world records, including 47 pieces of Big Apple pizza in 10 minutes, 29 waffles in 10 minutes, and five pounds of sour pickles in six minutes, according to his bio on the MLE website.\n\nBut the Mustard Belt had eluded him. Until Thursday, when he scarfed down 58 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes.\n\nPatrick Bertoletti reacts after victory\n\n\"I just can’t believe it,\" he said on ESPN's telecast, noting he always finishes second or third when he competes at Nathan’s. \"I lost some weight. Just lots of work. There’s an urgency.\n\n\"With Joey not here, I knew I had a shot. I was able to unlock something that I don’t know where it came from.\"\n\nBertoletti prevails with 58 dogs!\n\nPatrick Bertoletti, 39, of Illinois won the Mustard Belt by eating 58 hot dogs and buns in a back-and-forth 10-minute battle among a handful of eaters. It was the first time someone other than Joey Chestnut has won the contest since 2015, when Chestnut lost to Matt Stonie.\n\nBertoletti rallied from an early deficit and broke his personal record of 55 hot dogs.\n\n\"I wasn’t going to stop eating until the job was done,\" he said moments after the competition.\n\nGeoffrey Esper of Massachusetts finished second with 53 hot dogs.\n\nDown to the wire\n\nWith three minutes to go, Bertoletti, Webb and Esper neck and neck. Photo finish to come?\n\nHalfway home\n\nAt the five-minute mark, Patrick Bertoletti and James have eclipsed the 30 hot dog threshold.\n\nJames Webb devouring three dogs at a time.\n\nTight battle\n\nPatrick Bertoletti, James Webb, Nick Wehry and Geoffrey Esper in a tight battle three minutes in.\n\nRoyal couple of hot-dog eating\n\nNick Wehry, fiancé of Miki Sudo, is out to the early lead.\n\n10, 9, 8, 7, 6 …\n\nThey’re off and eating.\n\nReady, set …\n\nHot dogs are cooked and plated. Competitors are situated and ready. The perfect time for a commercial break, right? Right.\n\nTake the stage, eaters\n\nIntros for the men’s competition are underway as only George Shea, the inimitable emcee can handle them. Ricardo Corbucci of Brazil takes the stage wrapped with a half-American, half-Brazilian flag. He’ll be making his Nathan’s debut as, according to Shea, the No. 1 competitive eater in Brazil. (Haven’t had a chance to double-check those rankings.) Several international competitors on hand. Representing Japan, the Czech Republic, England and Australia.\n\nThe X account for Major League Eating (MLE), which essentially banned Chestnut from competing at Nathan’s this year, has become a gathering place for Chestnut (mostly) supporters. Popular hashtags: #FreeJoey and #LetJoeyEat.\n\nMLE’s official announcement about Chestnut’s status June 11 triggered 296 comments, including:\n\n“The 30 for 30 about the downfall of the Nathan’s hot dog eating contest is gonna be lit.\"\n\n\"This is like Caitlin left off the USA team. I mean who is in charge over there. Watch the viewer drop 50%.\"\n\n\"Strip his old victories and records away from him, too.\"\n\n'The Babe Ruth of Beef'\n\nSo said ESPN’s Jeremy Schaap in narrating a tribute to Chestnut with footage of his triumphs and rare setbacks (the loss to Matt Stonie in 2015).\n\n“This year the greatest eater of our time has put down the dogs and buns,\" Schaap said. \"At least the Nathan’s dogs and buns.\"\n\nMiki Sudo not done eating\n\nWhat, you thought she’d stop after consuming 51 hot dogs and buns?\n\n\"I’ll probably look for something cold and refreshing,\" she told ESPN’s Tiffany Greene about an hour after her triumphant victory. \"Maybe some fruit or soft serve.\"\n\nMiki Sudo does it again (on replay)\n\nESPN is kicking off its next segment of the Nathan’s contest with a replay of Sudo’s record-breaking performance of 51 hot dogs and puns. Almost as impressive on replay as live.\n\nAnother new world record … for what?!\n\nEric \"Badlands\" Booker etched his name in competitive eating (and drinking) history when he chugged a gallon of Nathan’s Famous lemonade in 21 seconds. Yeah, the Lemonade Chugging Contest is a thing.\n\nBack in action\n\nThe broadcast is live as the men’s competition approaches with just a slight change in regular programming. No Joey Chestnut.\n\nBanned after signing an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, Chestnut will be eating later today at the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas.\n\nJoey Chestnut on their minds\n\nMiki Sudo exults after record-breaking performance\n\nRelish the break\n\nGrab yourself a hot dog – beef or plant-based – and hang on during the intermission. The men’s competition will start at noon ET.\n\nMiki Sudo: 'I finally did it'\n\nSudo had another pink championship slung across her shoulder after shattering the women’s contest record with 51 hot dogs and gun – more than any other competitor but Joey Chestnut ate last year.\n\n\"I mean, I finally did it,\" Sudo told ESPN’s Tiffany Greene. \"We finally beat 50. So much of this is thanks to (second-place finisher) Mayoi Ebihara, who was pushing me so much. Obviously I prepared even more because I knew she was going to bring it.\"\n\nMiki Sudo shatters record!\n\nSudo ate 51 hot dogs and buns, becoming the first woman to break 50-dog threshold and eclipsing her personal record of 48. She crushed her competitors and won her 10th pink championship belt.\n\nEbihara finished second with 37.\n\nEmcee George Shea raising the possibility of Sudo outeating the men in the 10-minute competition.\n\nMiki Sudo cruising\n\nShe has a 12-dog lead with just over two minutes to eat. She’s closing in on her personal record.\n\nMiki Sudo’s technique\n\nSudo once experimented with Joey Chestnut-style: two dogs at a time. Not today. She’s putting them down one at a time and has a four-dog league at the six-minute mark. ... Well, check that. On the fly, Sudo starts shoving the hot dogs down her gullet two at a time.\n\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1 …\n\nThe countdown is complete and the devouring has begun. Sudo takes an early lead, devouring 10 hot dogs for a two-dog margin over the field.\n\nHere comes the defending champ, Miki Sudo\n\nClutching a pink championship belt, Sudo takes the stage. So has her most serious challenger, Mayoi Ebihara, a 5-foot-1 eater from Japan. Last year Ebinara wolfed down 33.5 hot dogs and buns during her contest debut at Nathan’s.\n\nWho are these women competing in the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nIntros underway. Miki Sudo, and the 13 competitors she’s about to beat for her 10th title in 11 years. Jocelyn Young? Thanks for coming. Tandra Childress? Good to have you here. Katie Prettyman, take your place on the platform. But, let’s face it, Sudo is the big favorite.\n\nMassive crowd swells for Hot Dog Eating Contest\n\nWell, no massive boycott in Coney Island for the ban of Joey Chestnut. Massive crowd gathered for the contest, which begins with the women's competition at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nWhat time is the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nWomen's competition start time: 10:45 a.m. ET\n\n10:45 a.m. ET Men's competition start time: Noon ET\n\nMiki Sudo and the women get the Nathan's Famous festivities underway at 10:45 a.m. ET.

ESPN2 will carry the men's competition.\n\nWhy isn’t Joey Chestnut competing in the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nChestnut will not be competing in the 2024 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest due to a contractual dispute with Major League Eating, the organization that sanctions the event.\n\nIn June, Chestnut signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods to sponsor a new, meatless hot dog. Representing a rival brand is something that gave MLE and Nathan's Famous more than a bit of indigestion, leading to him not being at the event this year.\n\nThe ban, though, isn't permanent, according to MLE, which wants Chestnut to compete at future events.\n\n\"Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\" MLE said in a statement.\n\nNathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest field 2024\n\nThough Joey Chestnut isn’t competing, there are still plenty of glizzy gobblers on the men’s and women’s side, including chew-perstar eater Miki Sudo.\n\nHere’s the field:\n\nMen’s\n\nGeoffrey Esper\n\nJames Webb\n\nPatrick Bertoletti\n\nNicholas Wehry\n\nGideon Oji\n\nSean Yeager\n\nGeorge Chiger\n\nMax Stanford\n\nRicardo Corbucci\n\nDerek Hendrickson\n\nKing Yamamoto\n\nWilliam Claude Lyon IV\n\nDarrien Thomas\n\nRadim Dvoracek\n\nWomen’s\n\nMiki Sudo\n\nMayoi Ebihara\n\nMichelle Lesco\n\nLarell Marie Mele\n\nKatie Prettyman\n\nTandra Childress\n\nJocelyn Young\n\nMary Bowers\n\nCherish Brown\n\nJulie Goldberg\n\nEllen Straub\n\nCrystal Ocampo\n\nRubianne Garcia\n\nElizabeth Salgado\n\nJoey Chestnut a fan of Geoff Esper\n\nJoey Chestnut is out of the competition, but not out of the loop. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, he offered thoughts on who might win the men’s contest this year.\n\n\"There’s Geoff Esper,\" Chestnut said. \"He’s an amazing eater and he just hasn’t been able to have a good contest on the Fourth of July. But he’s capable of 57. James Webb, he’s new and he’s getting better. So I can see his technique and eventually I think he’ll be in the 60s. He’s just getting started. Pat Bertoletti, I think he did 55 years ago (actually 49) and he started training a lot harder once he realize there was a chance (Chestnut would not complete).\n\n\"They’re awesome dudes.\"\n\nNathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest records\n\nIn 2021, Joey Chestnut set the world record for hot dogs and buns eaten with 76. Chestnut set the world record twice in the prior three contests: In 2018, he shattered the world record, devouring 74 hot dogs and buns, and in 2020, he again set the standard, eating 75 hot dogs and buns.\n\nOn the women's side, Miki Sudo is the top dog (eater), munching 48 ½ hot dogs and buns in 2020.\n\nHow many times has Joey Chestnut won the Hot Dog Eating Contest?\n\nChestnut holds the record for most Mustard Belts, winning the contest 16 times. On the women's side, Miki Sudo has been an unstoppable eating force, winning nine of the last 10 Ketchup Belts.\n\nJoey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi\n\nThough he's not eating hot dogs on the Fourth of July, Chestnut will return to the competitive eating spotlight in a big, big way in 2024, by facing an old rival.\n\nChestnut will take on nemesis Takeru Kobayashi on Sept. 2 in a live Netflix special titled \"Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef.\"\n\n\"Through all of my years in competitive eating, Kobayashi stands out as my fiercest rival,\" Chestnut said in a statement. \"Competing against him pushed me to be so much better. I know that fans have waited a long time for another chapter of our rivalry and I can't wait for our massive showdown live on Netflix!\"\n\nKobayashi and Chestnut last jawed off in 2009, with Chestnut chewing out the six-time Mustard Belt winner.\n\nWho won the Hot Dog Eating Contest last year?\n\nNo surprises here: Joey Chestnut won a rain-soaked event that was threatened to be canned by Mother Nature. But the show went on, and so did Chestnut: He won the event by downing 62 dogs and buns, with Geoff Esper coming in second with 49 dogs and buns.\n\nList of past Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest winners\n\n 2023: Joey Chestnut, 62 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 39 1/2 (women's)\n\n 2022: Joey Chestnut, 63 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 40 (women's)\n\n 2021: Joey Chestnut, 73 (men's) | Michelle Lesco, 30 3/4 (women's)\n\n 2020: Joey Chestnut, 75 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 48 1/2 (women's)\n\n 2019: Joey Chestnut, 71 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 31 (women's)\n\n 2018: Joey Chestnut, 74 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 37 (women's)\n\n 2017: Joey Chestnut, 72 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 41 (women's)\n\n 2016: Joey Chestnut, 70 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 38 1/2 (women's)\n\n 2015: Matt Stonie, 62 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 38 (women's)\n\n 2014: Joey Chestnut, 61 (men's) | Miki Sudo, 34 (women's)\n\n 2013: Joey Chestnut, 69 (men's) | Sonya Thomas, 36 3/4 (women's)\n\n 2012: Joey Chestnut, 68 (men's) | Sonya Thomas, 45 (women's)\n\n *2011: Joey Chestnut, 62 (men's) | Sonya Thomas, 40 (women's)\n\n 2010: Joey Chestnut, 54\n\n 2009: Joey Chestnut, 68\n\n 2008: Joey Chestnut, 59 (defeated Takeru Kobayashi in an untimed eat-off, eating five hot dogs in 50 seconds)\n\n 2007: Joey Chestnut, 66\n\n 2006: Takeru Kobayashi, 53 3/4\n\n 2005: Takeru Kobayashi, 49\n\n 2004: Takeru Kobayashi, 53 1/2\n\n 2003: Takeru Kobayashi, 44 1/2\n\n 2002: Takeru Kobayashi, 50 1/2\n\n 2001: Takeru Kobayashi, 50\n\n 2000: Kazutoyo Arai, 25 1/8\n\n 1999: Steve Keiner, 21 1/2\n\n 1998: Hirofumi Nakajima, 19\n\n 1997: Hirofumi Nakajima, 24 1/2\n\n 1996: Ed Krachie, 22\n\n 1995: Ed Krachie, 19 1/2\n\n 1994: Mike DeVito, 20\n\nWhat is a ‘glizzy?’\n\nA \"glizzy\" is a slang term for a hot dog. The word has unknown origins, but some trace it back to handguns: A \"Glizzy\" is a slang term for a Glock handgun. The word then evolved to mirror the magazine of a handgun, which is approximately the length of a hot dog.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

No other competitor has eaten more than 64½.\n\nAlmost all other competitive eaters do it part-time because they can't earn enough from it to make a living — much less the millions of dollars Chestnut said he has amassed.\n\nLast week, days before the hot dog eating contest he has dominated since 2007, Chestnut reflected on his decision in 2010 to leave his job with a construction management company in Northern California and become a full-time competitive eater.\n\n“My mom was worried,\" he said. “I mean, it’s nice to have a job. You’ve got health care and retirement, all that stuff. So I had to convince my mom that I still had a plan for all that stuff.\"\n\nA major Pepto-Bismol moment\n\nBy 2010, Chestnut had won the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest three times. Yet he still was working full-time for the construction management company and competing in food contests on weekends.\n\nThen came an offer from Pepto-Bismol.\n\nThe company wanted him to promote and participate in four competitive eating contests and would pay him $10,000 for each event, according to Chestnut, who said the problem was he'd have to miss several days of work.\n\n“So I ran it by my boss and he was like, ‘Oh, why don’t you just take the month off?’ \" said Chestnut, who did just that.\n\nIn a 2010 press release, Pepto-Bismol announced the promotion: The company would host four eating contests over five weeks during which teams of challengers would compete against Chestnut at food festivals in Portland, Oregon, Austin, Texas, San Francisco and Orchard Park, New York.\n\nDamon Jones, chief communications officer at Procter & Gamble -- the parent company of Pepto-Bismol -- on Saturday said he didn't have immediate access to the financial information. But as a matter of practice, he said, the company doesn't disclose payment terms with any promotional partners.\n\nAfter collecting on the four promotional contests, Chestnut said he made a decision.\n\nWith the blessing of his mother, he became a full-time competitive eater. Proof it was financially viable came in 2014, when at the age of 30, Chestnut, then living in San Jose, California, bought his first house – for $618,000, according to property records.\n\nDuring the process of obtaining a loan, Chestnut said there was an awkward moment of explaining he generated his income as a competitive eater – and was making more than $200,000 a year.\n\n“They’re like, ‘Oh, how long have you been doing it, though?’ \" Chestnut said. “I was able to show them that I guess I actually am stable.\"\n\n17 pounds of cherry pie with Goldman Sachs\n\nChestnut, who lives in the Indianapolis area with his fiancée, said he travels about 150 days a year for contests and appearances. This year, that included a burrito-eating contest in Milwaukee, where he scarfed 14½ burritos in 10 minutes and pocketed the first-place payout of $5,000.\n\nHe also devoured a half-dozen Coney Island hot dogs in 60 seconds during a paid appearance at a Detroit Pistons game. And ate 17½ pounds of cherry pie last year during an appearance at a Goldman Sachs' small business summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe declined to provide specific figures for his paid appearances. But with the hopes of further leveraging his celebrity, Chestnut signed with Everest Talent Management a year ago. The company’s clients include Pau Gasol, the retired six-time NBA All-Star who won two titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Alyssa Thompson, the 18-year-old soccer phenom and No. 1 overall pick of the 2023 NWSL Draft.\n\n“I’m really good at eating, (but) I don’t know my worth,\" Chestnut said. “I’m not good at negotiating contracts or making sure the contracts don’t conflict with each other. So it was really important.\"\n\nPepsi deal a 'game-changer'\n\nOver the past year and a half, the company secured him promotional deals with DUDE Wipes, Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, Wonderful Pistachios and Pepsi.\n\nThe deal with Wonderful Pistachios features Chestnut in a national commercial, and Pepsi has him in the company’s current campaign for Pepsi Colachup, billed as the world's first Pepsi-infused condiment.\n\nChestnut declined to say what the promotional deals were worth, but did offer, “The Pepsi one is definitely a little bit of a game-changer.\"\n\nIt has helped change the bottom line, with Chestnut saying 2022 marked the first year his income exceeded $500,000.\n\nEvan Sroka, a co-founder of Everest Talent Management, said he had no comment on the agency's work with him.\n\nAs far as his net worth is concerned, Chestnut said he has amassed more than $4 million thanks to his good fortune. That includes buying stock in a company later acquired by Tesla.\n\nThe truth is, Chestnut could be earning more. Potentially much more.\n\nMatt Stonie, the last man to beat Chestnut at Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2015, now focuses on his lucrative YouTube Channel. He has more than 16 million subscribers and is widely believed to have made several million dollars for his food-eating exploits. He no longer goes head-to-head with Chestnut on the Fourth of July. Stonie did not respond to messages from USA TODAY Sports.\n\nChestnut said he has dabbled with his own YouTube channel, but it lacks what he loves most about competitive eating. On Tuesday, he likely will pocket another $10,000, which goes to the winner, but said money is not what drives him back to Coney Island every Fourth of July, where thousands of spectators cheer his every bite.\n\n“I love the competition,\" he said. \"The competition is the best.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/08/29/joey-chestnut-concern-for-kobayashi-showdown/74998743007/", "title": "Joey Chestnut worries about quirk in hot dog showdown with ...", "text": "Among the special rules for the Joey Chestnut-Takeru Kobayashi hot dog eating contest Monday is no dunking hot dog buns in water.\n\nBut it's another rule that has prompted concern from Chestnut.\n\nNeither he nor Kobayashi will be permitted to separate the hot dog from the bun to pour water on the hot dog.\n\n\"It worries me a little,\" Chestnut told USA TODAY Sports. \"Sometimes the (hot dog) rolls out of the bun. It’s not clear if I have to put in back in or I can just grab 'em both at the same time.\"\n\nAlthough Chestnut tried to preserve dunking, he said he generally likes the rules.\n\nIn a news release Thursday, Netflix said penalties may be issued for breaking of rules, or regurgitation. It’s unclear what those penalties will be.\n\nThough he lost the negotiations over dunking, Chestnut said he prevailed elsewhere. Such as the height of the table, which will be 36 inches rather than 30 inches when the competition takes place at HyperX Arena Las Vegas inside Luxor Hotel & Casino.\n\n\"Instead of eating off a normal shorter table, I got counter height,\" said Chestnut, who at 6-1 is five inches taller than the 5-8 Kobayashi. \"I won't have to bend over as much.\"\n\nOn the metaphorical table once sat a curious rule: The winner would be the first to eat 80 hot dogs rather the person who at the most hot dogs in 10 minutes. Kobayashi said he rejected it.\n\n\"My managers pitched it to Netflix before asking me about it,\" Chestnut said. \"They knew my goal was to eat 80 on the Fourth (before he was banned from competing at Nathan's).\"\n\nThey're actually in agreement about something, too. The contest will be less messy than the other times they've devoured hot dogs.\n\nKobayashi said dunking hot dogs is \"messy and filthy\" and he also had the viewers in mind with the rule barring it.\n\n\"It is a lot cleaner,\" Chestnut said. \"My fiancee says it's less gross to watch.\"\n\nJoey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi undercard\n\nMatt Stonie, who beat Chestnut at Nathan’s in 2015 and remains the last person to beat Chestnut there, will compete against a trio of medal-winning Olympic swimmers.\n\nThe trio is Ryan Lochte, a 12-time medalist with six golds; Ryan Murphy, a five-time gold medalist; and Max Irving, who won a bronze at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThey’ll be eating chicken wings.

A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate stood at 3.14%.\n\nThe last time the average rate surpassed 7% was in April 2002.\n\nMortgage rates have risen almost every week since late August and have more than doubled since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe rapid rise has been fueled by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of hiking interest rates in order to tame soaring inflation. The combination of the central bank’s rate hikes, investor’s concerns about a recession and mixed economic news has made mortgage rates increasingly volatile over the past several months.\n\nThe rising rates are leading to stagnation in the housing market, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\n“As inflation endures, consumers are seeing higher costs at every turn, causing further declines in consumer confidence this month,” said Khater. “Many potential homebuyers are choosing to wait and see where the housing market will end up, pushing demand and home prices further downward.”\n\nThe average mortgage rate is based on a survey of conventional home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit, according to Freddie Mac. But many buyers who put down less money up front or have less than perfect credit will pay more.\n\nInflation remains stubborn\n\nWhile the Fed does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they make moves which send yields higher and mortgage rates rise.\n\nThis week the 10-year yield remained above 4%, a level last seen in 2008.\n\nInvestors are anticipating another rate hike at next week’s Fed meeting, said Hannah Jones, economic data analyst at Realtor.com.\n\nAnalysts expect the central bank to announce another 75-basis-point hike since the most recent inflation data has not shown sufficient signs of cooling. If that happens, it will be the fourth 75-basis-point hike in a row, marking the largest series of Fed rate hikes in more than three decades.\n\nAffordability continues to take a hit\n\nHigher mortgage rates are making it even harder for prospective buyers to afford a home.\n\nOver the past year, mortgage rates have climbed nearly four percentage points and listing prices have increased 13.9%. That has made the monthly payment on a median priced home close to 75% higher today compared to one year ago, according to Realtor.com.\n\nAt this time last year, a buyer who put 20% down on a $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 3.14% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,339, according to calculations from Freddie Mac.\n\nToday, a homeowner buying the same priced house with an average rate of 7.08% would pay $2,093 a month in principal and interest. That’s $754 more each month.\n\n“Home shoppers are hamstrung by the rising cost of homeownership and inflation, which has led many to drop out of the market,” said Jones. She pointed to the recent report on existing home sales, which declined 23.8% year-over-year in September marking the eighth consecutive month of slowing, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nDemand for mortgages has dropped dramatically as well, with applications at their slowest pace since 1997, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\nHomebuyers who remain on the hunt are finding homes they can afford in lower priced markets, Jones said. “As a result, affordable markets are seeing sustained housing demand.”\n\nBut as long as mortgage rates and prices remain high, Jones said, many buyers will remain on the sidelines or downsize their expectations.\n\n“Some may find renting to be the better option in the short term, while others may consider other home types such as condos,” said Jones. “Buyers who remain in the market may see lower prices and have some leverage relative to the last few months, though they will have to be cognizant of how higher mortgage rates impact housing costs.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/12/13/fed-interest-rate-hike-live-updates/71896343007/", "title": "Fed stands pat on interest rates again, predicts 3 rate cuts in 2024", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged again Wednesday, hinted that rate hikes are likely over and forecast three cuts next year amid falling inflation and a cooling economy.\n\nThat’s more rate cuts than many economists expected.\n\nThe decision leaves the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% following a flurry of rate increases aimed at subduing the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in four decades. The central bank has now held its key rate steady for three straight meetings since July.\n\nThat provides another reprieve for consumers who have faced higher borrowing costs for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans as a result of the Fed’s moves. Yet Americans, especially seniors, are finally reaping healthy bank savings yields after years of paltry returns.\n\nIn recent weeks, with inflation slowing more emphatically and the economy and job market cooling, talk has shifted from whether the Fed would hike again to how rapidly it will trim rates next year.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\n401(k) boon:Stocks surge, Dow Jones hits all-time high at close after Fed forecasts lower rates\n\nLeaving savings behind:Many Americans are missing out on high-interest savings accounts. Don't be one of them\n\nWhere's economy going?:Is a soft landing in sight? What the Fed funds rate and mortgage rates are hinting at\n\nWill the Fed raise interest rates again?\n\nThe central bank didn’t rule out another rate increase as it downgraded its economic outlook for next year while lowering its inflation forecast. In a statement after a two-day meeting, it repeated that it would assess the economy and financial developments, among other factors, to determine “the extent of any additional (rate hikes) that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time.”\n\nBy adding the word “any,” however, Fed officials underscored there’s a reasonable chance it won’t have to raise rates again, though it stands ready to do so if necessary.\n\n'Not likely we will hike again'\n\n\"It's not likely we will hike again,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, noting the Fed's key rate is \"at or near its peak.\"\n\nBut he said the economy has surprised officials with its strength recently, adding that officials \"didn't want to take the possibility of additional hikes off the table.\"\n\nWill the Fed lower rates in 2024?\n\nPerhaps more significantly, Fed officials estimate they’ll lower the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% next year, according to their median estimate. That amounts to three quarter-point cuts, more than many economists expected and the number the Fed expected in September but fewer than the full percentage point drop that markets anticipated.\n\nSometimes, the Fed reduces rates to dig the economy out of a downturn. Next year, economists believe officials will cut simply to bring borrowing costs closer to normal as inflation eases. Otherwise, inflation-adjusted rates would rise.\n\n\"It's really good to see the progress we're making\" on inflation, Powell said. \"Inflation keeps coming down, the labor market keeps coming into balance. So far, so good.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It is far too early to declare victory and there are certainly risks.\"\n\nSome economists say the Fed is still underestimating how quickly inflation will come down next year and how sharply it will slash rates.\n\n\"We're sticking to our view that the Fed will cut faster than this,\" with 1.5 percentage points in decreases, starting in March or May, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. \"We think inflation will fall faster than they expect.\"\n\nWhy is the 10-year Treasury yield falling?\n\nThe Fed may be reluctant to foresee too swift a rate decrease because of the market rally and recent drop in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.1%, developments that could strengthen the economy and inflation. When the Fed last met in early November, stocks were at a low point and the 10-year Treasury had reached 5% for the first time since 2007, driving up mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 1.37% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high after rising 1.4% following the Fed's signals that it's probably done lifting rates and is forecasting three cuts next year. The 10-year Treasury was down to about 4% from 4.21% on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Powell said high Treasury yields, if persistent, likely would constrain the economy and require fewer Fed rate increases,\n\nIn its statement Wednesday, however, the central bank didn’t acknowledge the recent decline in Treasury yields, suggesting yields are still relatively high and could spike again, crimping the economy.\n\n“Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,” the Fed said, repeating the language of its previous statement.\n\nIs inflation really slowing down?\n\nThe Fed’s middle-ground approach may have been cemented Tuesday by a mixed report on the consumer price index. The good news was that overall inflation barely budged in November amid falling gasoline prices, pushing down annual price gains to 3.1% from 3.2%, still well above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nBut a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items and that the Fed watches more closely rose a sturdy 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the yearly rise at 4%. That underlying measure could stay elevated for several months on climbing services costs, economists say.\n\nAnd while the Fed predicted Wednesday that inflation will slow a bit more rapidly than previously thought, it also expects the economy and job market to stay more resilient despite high inflation and interest rates. That could help the U.S. avoid a recession but it also boosts the risk of a resurgence in inflation, especially if the Fed slices rates too rapidly.\n\nWill inflation get better in 2024?\n\nFed officials expect their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, to fall from 3% in October to 2.4% at the end of 2024, below their 2.5% projection in September.\n\nThe core measure is expected to decline from 3.5% to 2.4% by the end of next year, below the prior 2.6% estimate.\n\nWhat is the economic forecast for 2024?\n\nThe Fed expect the economy to grow at a 2.6% annual rate, above its prior 2.1% estimate. But it predicts just 1.4% growth in 2024, down slightly from its prior 1.5% projection.\n\nThe economy grew a torrid 5.2% in the third quarter but growth is projected to slow to less than 2% late this year and in 2024 as high interest rates, record credit card debt and dwindling COVID-related savings crimp household spending.\n\nWill the job market get better in 2024?\n\nThe historically low 3.7% unemployment rate is projected to end 2024 at 4.1%, in line with the September forecast. Average monthly job growth has downshifted from about 300,000 early this year to a still solid 200,000.\n\nAnd average yearly wage gains have tumbled to 4% from 5.9% since spring of last year. The Fed wants to lower pay increases to 3.5% to align with its 2% inflation target.\n\nBut Barclays says wage growth could decline more slowly now that a rebound in immigration may have peaked. Immigration moderates wage gains by expanding the labor supply.\n\nThat’s another potential reason for the Fed to be leery about cutting rates too quickly.\n\nWant to learn more?

The Federal Reserve System is the U.S.’s central bank.\n\nWhen does the Fed meet again?\n\nThe first Federal Reserve meeting of the new year will be from Jan. 30 through 31.\n\nFederal reserve calendar\n\nJan. 30-31\n\nMarch 19-20\n\nApril 30- May 1\n\nJune 11-12\n\nJuly 30-31\n\nSept. 17-18\n\nNov. 6-7\n\nDec. 17-18\n\nFed dot plot\n\nThe Fed’s dot plot can be found in the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections report. It’s an illustration of where individual Fed officials forecast interest rates will be years down the line. The dot plot was first created in late 2011 and was meant to give more transparency to the Fed's decisions when it came to monetary policy.\n\nThe most recent forecast for the fund rate is 5.5% to 5.75% by the end of this year, and 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2024.\n\nHow is the U.S. economy doing?\n\nThe U.S. economy was strong in the third quarter as consumers continued to spend despite high interest rates and inflation.\n\nThe value of all services and products generated in the U.S., or GDP, rose at a seasonally adjusted 4.9% for the year in the months spanning July to September, according to the Commerce Department. That was more than twice the 2.1% increase in the previous quarter and the most aggressive pace of growth since the end of 2021 when the economy surged back from a recession sparked by the pandemic.\n\nHow likely is a recession in 2024?\n\nEconomists surveyed in September said there was a 48% chance the U.S. will slip into a recession over the next year, down from the 61% odds forecast in May.\n\nBarclays predicted a loss of roughly 375,000 jobs by the middle of next year. But consumer spending remains robust despite high inflation and interest rates that are making credit card use and consumer loans more expensive. And that may help stave off a recession, says Barclays economist Jonathan Millar.\n\nWhat does FOMC stand for?\n\nThe FOMC is the Federal Open Market Committee, the voting body responsible for setting interest rates. The 12-member committee includes seven members of the Board of Governors and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nWhat causes inflation?\n\nInflation can have many roots. Typically, it’s caused by \"a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services,\" said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nThat means more people are wanting items and services than there is adequate supply, leading producers to raise prices.\n\n\"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things,\" Bivens said. \"But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up.\"\n\nInflation can also happen when there are too few producers, or there aren’t enough employees to provide the coveted products and services, Bivens said.\n\nFinally, economies also have some \"built-in inflation\" to help keep inflation in check. In the U.S., that target is 2%, meaning businesses can raise prices 2% annually year and that shouldn’t overburden consumers. That’s also the typical cost of living raise offered by employers.\n\nInflation meaning\n\nInflation is the term for a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, head of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nEverything from food to rent can become costlier due to inflation. But it is the overall impact that determines what the inflation rate actually is.\n\n\"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount,\" Bivens said. The Federal Reserve’s inflation goal is 2%, which means businesses can hike prices by 2% a year and that shouldn’t cause consumers financial distress. Cost of living increases to workers’ pay are also expected to meet that target to ensure consumers can adequately deal with the rising costs of goods and services.\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nIn November, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‒ a measure of the average shift in prices for different products and services ‒ was 3.1%, down slightly from the month before.\n\nAnnual inflation is down dramatically from the 9.1% in June 2022 that marked a 40-year high but remains above the 2% target the Fed sees as the level that signals the rate of price increases is under control.\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve watches two key aspects of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, and those are the main factors it takes into account for its interest rate decisions. The CPI is a primary measure the Fed looks at to help determine if prices are “stable.’’\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices don’t count the volatile costs of food and energy items, giving a more accurate window into longer-term trends.\n\nAre wages going up in 2024?\n\nIf you’re deemed a top performer at a company that is offering raises, you’ve got a pretty good chance of getting a pay boost next year.\n\nAbout 3 out of four business leaders told ResumeBuilder.com they intended to give raises. But half of those company executives said only 50% or less of their staff members would see a pay hike, and 82% of the raises would hinge on performance. For those who do manage to get the salary boost, 79% of employers said the pay hikes would be greater than those given in recent years.\n\nAre U.S. Treasury yields rising?\n\nNot recently.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was above 5% in November when the Fed kept rates steady for the second consecutive month the first time it had left the key rate unchanged two months in a row in almost two years.\n\nThat led to mortgage rates spiking to almost 8% and pushed up other borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Stocks meanwhile sank close to a recent low, leading Fed Chair Jerome Powell to say such financial pressures could achieve the same cooling effect on the economy as additional rate hikes.\n\nBut in the following weeks, 10-year Treasury yields dipped to 4.2% and stocks rebounded. That might make the Fed resist rate cuts in case the economy heats up and causes the broader dip in prices “to stall at an uncomfortably elevated level,” Barclays says.\n\nBarclays and Goldman Sachs forecast that rate cuts won’t happen until the spring, and that there will be only two, to a range of 4.75% to 5%, with more cuts implemented in the next two years.\n\nWhen will inflation go back to normal?\n\nIt may take a little while.\n\nInflation’s decline likely “won’t show much progress in coming months,” Barclays wrote in a research note.\n\nOverall price hikes have eased significantly since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, a four-decade high. And in October, broader inflation as well as core prices experienced a dip, leading to a lower 10-year Treasury yield.\n\nBut core prices, which exclude the volatile costs of food and energy, will probably rise 0.3% each of the next three months, Goldman Sachs says. Used cars and furniture have been getting cheaper as the supply-chain shortages of the pandemic end. Meanwhile, health care, auto repairs, car insurance and rent continue to get more expensive, as employers pay higher wages to attract workers amid a labor shortage lingering from the global health crisis.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which leave out the more volatile costs of food and energy, bumped up 0.3% in November, slightly more than the 0.2% uptick seen the previous month. That kept the yearly increase at 4%, the lowest rate since September 2021.\n\nNew inflation tax brackets\n\nInflation may also impact the amount of taxes you have to pay.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service said in its annual inflation adjustments report that there will be a 5.4% bump in income thresholds to reach each new level in next year’s tax season.\n\nIn 2024, the lowest rate of 10% will apply to individuals with taxable income up to $11,600 and joint filers up to $23,200. The top rate of 37% will apply to individuals earning over $609,350, and married couples filing jointly who make at least $731,200 a year.\n\nThe IRS makes these adjustments annually, using a formula based on the consumer price index to account for inflation and stave off \"bracket creep,\" which happens when inflation shifts taxpayers into a higher bracket though they’re not seeing any real rise in pay or purchasing power.\n\nThe 2024/25 increase is less than last year's 7% increase, but much more than recent years when inflation was below the current 3.1% inflation rate.\n\nWill Social Security get a raise because of inflation?\n\nYes, but it will be a lot less than what recipients received in 2023.\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to Social Security benefits will be 3.2% next year. That’s roughly one-third of the 8.7% increase given in 2023, which marked a forty-year high.\n\nThe 2024 COLA hike is above the average 2.6% raise recipients have received over the past two decades, but seniors remain concerned about being able to pay their expenses as well as the increasing possibility Social Security benefits will be reduced in coming years, according to a retirement survey of 2,258 people by The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group.\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other to borrow overnight. If that rate increases, banks usually pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow as rates rise on credit cards, adjustable rate mortgages and other loans. That’s why the funds rate is the key mechanism used by the Federal Reserve to calm inflation.\n\nSimply put, companies and consumers don’t borrow as much when loans cost them more, and that means an overheated economy can cool and inflation may dip.\n\nWill credit card interest rates continue to rise this holiday season?\n\nThe Fed’s string of rate hikes, aimed at easing the highest inflation in four decades, are a big reason credit card interest rates have reached record highs just in time for the holiday season.\n\nSome retail credit cards now charge more than 33% interest, topping a 30% threshold that stores and banks were previously able to bypass but seldom did - until now.\n\n“They can charge that much,” said Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center. “Credit cards can actually charge whatever they want. It’s a little-known fact.”\n\nThe domino effect of a high benchmark rate and soaring credit card interest could put many Americans in financial straits this holiday season.\n\nThough some consumers are paring back to deal with high prices, rising debt and shrinking savings, the average shopper expects to spend $1,652 this year on holiday purchases, according to the consultancy Deloitte, more than was typically spent in the last three years.\n\nA lot of the buying will be done with credit cards. In an October poll of 1,036 shoppers by CardRates.com, nearly 4 in 10 respondents said they intend to have holiday credit card debt in the new year.\n\nThe nation’s collective credit card debt was $1.08 trillion, at the end of September, a record high. And the average interest rate was 21%, the highest ever documented by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSavings account impact of high rates\n\nThe upside to the Fed’s string of rate hikes has been that consumers were able to earn good interest on their savings for the first time in years. Even when the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, savers can do well.\n\nUnfortunately, most account holders aren’t making the most of that potential opportunity.\n\nRoughly one-fifth of Americans who have savings accounts don’t know how much interest they’re earning, according to a quarterly Paths to Prosperity study by Santander US, part of the global bank Santander. Among those who did know their account’s interest rate, most were earning less than 3%.\n\nBut consumers have time to make a change that could enable them to make more from their savings.\n\n\"We’re still a long way from (the Fed) beginning to cut rates,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services platform Bankrate. “This is great news for savers, who will continue to enjoy inflation-beating returns in the top-yielding, federally insured online savings accounts and certificates of deposit. For borrowers, interest rates staying higher for a longer period underscores the urgency to pay down and pay off costly credit card debt and home equity lines.\"\n\nAmid inflation, Americans seek higher credit card limits\n\nThe string of Fed rate hikes that began in March 2022 has made it costlier for consumers to borrow as interest rates on credit cards and other loans increased dramatically.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has made daily needs more expensive, pushing more Americans to lean on credit cards to get by. But lenders have become more reluctant to issue new cards, so in the midst of the holiday season, more shoppers are seeking higher credit limits, experts say.\n\nIn October, the application rate for higher limits rose to 17.8% from 11.2% in the same month the previous year, and from 12.0% in 2019, New York Fed data showed.\n\nFor some consumers, a higher limit on a card they already have is about their only option.\n\n“After COVID, inflation and interest rates went out of control ... people have less emergency funds for car repairs or buying presents,\" said Brandon Robinson, president and founder of JBR Associates, which specializes in retirement strategies. \"What they’re doing is using more credit card utilization – over 30% or well over 50% of their credit card allowance – and then can’t get approved for another card because their credit rating is down.\"\n\nInflation is leading more Americans to work multiple jobs\n\nThe number of Americans working at least two jobs is at its highest peak since before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to federal data, an uptick that may reflect the financial pressure people are feeling amid high inflation.\n\nAlmost 8.4 million people had multiple jobs in October, the Labor Department said, a figure that represents 5.2% of the laborforce, the highest percentage since January 2020.\n\n“Paying for necessities has become more of a challenge, and affording luxuries and discretionary items has become more difficult, if not impossible for some, particularly those at the lower ends of the income and wealth spectrums,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nPeople may also be moonlighting to sock away cash in case they’re laid off since job cuts typically peak at the start of a new year.\n\nWhen will Fed meet?:What is the Federal Reserve's 2024 meeting schedule? Here is when the Fed will meet again.\n\nWhat is the mortgage interest rate today?\n\nMortgage rates are falling, so is it time to buy?\n\nIt depends.\n\nFirst of all, the Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions have an impact. For instance, when the central bank was steadily boosting its key rate, the yield on the 10-year treasury bond went up as well. Because those bonds are a gauge for the interest applied to an average 30-year loan, mortgage rates increased.\n\nBut over the past six weeks, mortgage rates have been declining, averaging 7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. That’s down from almost 7.8% at the end of October, according to data released by Freddie Mac on Dec. 7.\n\nThat may be giving some wannabe homeowners the confidence to start house hunting. For the week ending Dec. 1, mortgage applications rose 2.8% from the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n“However, in the big picture, mortgage rates remain pretty high,” says Danielle Hale, senior economist for Realtor.com. “The typical mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac data is roughly in line with what we saw in August and early to mid-September, which were then 20 plus year highs.”\n\nSo, many potential buyers may still need to sit on the sidelines, waiting for rates to drop further, says Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac. Hale and many other experts believe mortgage rates will dip next year.\n\nInterest rate projection 2024\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates next year, though markets and economists disagree about how many rate cuts there will be.\n\nFutures markets forecast there will be four or five rate cuts in 2024, amounting to a quarter of a percentage point each. The cuts, they predict, should start by spring, and ultimately drop interest rates as low as 4% to 4.25%.\n\nBut core prices, which leave out the volatile costs of food and energy and are the metric followed more closely by the Fed, ticked up 0.3% in November, higher than the 0.2% increase the month before. That might make the Fed more hesitant to nip rates in the immediate future.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Barclays expect there to be only two rate decreases in 2024. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned in recent public remarks that it was “premature” to talk about rate cuts.\n\nNovember inflation report\n\nInflation dipped slightly last month, with falling gas prices mitigating the impact of rising rents.\n\nConsumer prices overall increased 3.1% from a year earlier, slightly below the 3.2% rise in October, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index.

The company executives did not state a specific date for its adoption. But after the price change goes into effect this summer newcomers will pay a $15 monthly membership fee.\n\nHow long has the $10-a-month rate been in effect at Planet Fitness?\n\nThe gym chain's classic card membership has been priced $10 since 1998, six years after the company was founded in Dover, New Hampshire.\n\nIs the Black Club membership also being raised?\n\nPlanet Fitness will do tests on increased prices for the Black Card membership at about the same time this summer when the classic card membership price increases from $10 to $15 for new members.\n\nThe company expects to offer \"a few different iterations\" of Black Card membership, Benson said, perhaps swapping in and out of perks at different price levels.\n\nWhy does Planet Fitness need to raise prices?\n\nAs with most corporate decisions, the bottom line is the reason for a price increase. For starters, it's costing Planet Fitness more to provide the facilities for its members than in the past. Based on inflation, the $10 monthly membership would be about $20 today, Fitzgerald said.\n\nPlanet Fitness added 900,000 members in the first three months of 2024, below what investors expected – typically, New Year's resolutions lead to new members. A rise in respiratory diseases including RSV and COVID during January may have hindered new members, Benson said.\n\nThe company's January advertising campaign was also not as successful as hoped. \"The lack of a price point in our national funded January sale ads may have created less urgency for consumers to get off the couch and join,\" Benson said. He will step down as interim CEO next month when new CEO Colleen Keating, a hospitality and property management executive, joins the company.\n\nAlso affecting the chain: Attention from media and social networks after Planet Fitness terminated the membership of an Alaska woman who posted a complaint online about “a man shaving in a women’s bathroom,\" as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nBenson said the company's nondiscrimination policy – it allows members to use the fitness center's facilities they choose based on their self-reported gender identity – has been in place for more than a decade and is similar to other fitness centers including the YMCA.\n\nPlanet Fitness – with 2,599 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Panama, Mexico and Australia – reported first-quarter revenue of $248 million, about what analysts expected.

Rates in the region have been negative since 2014.\n\nThe move, which takes effect on July 27, comes as Europe battles record inflation fed by surging energy prices. Annual inflation in the European Union jumped to 9.6% in June. It reached 8.6% for the 19 countries that use the euro.\n\nThe central bank had previously indicated that it would increase rates by a smaller margin, but decided it needed to be more aggressive based on an “updated assessment of inflation risk.”\n\n“Inflation continues to be undesirably high and is expected to stay above our target for some time,” ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a press conference.\n\nThe central bank declined to commit to a definitive trajectory for rate hikes moving forward, seeking to keep its options open.\n\n“From now on we will make our monetary policy decisions on a data-dependent basis,” Lagarde said. “We will operate month-by-month and step-by-step. What happens in September is going to depend on what data we have for September.”\n\nThe ECB also unveiled a new bond-buying tool aimed at keeping a lid on borrowing costs in highly indebted countries in the euro zone, such as Italy and Greece. The central bank wants to maintain cohesion within the region that uses the single currency.\n\nThe so-called Transmission Protection Instrument “can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area,” the central bank said.\n\nThe European Central Bank stands ready to deploy the instrument if necessary, granted that countries meet certain metrics for fiscal and economic health, Lagarde emphasized.\n\n“I can assure you we would rather not use TPI,” she said. “But if we have to use it, we will not hesitate.”\n\nA web of risks\n\nInvestors had a lukewarm reaction to the announcement. The euro, which recently hit parity with the US dollar for the first time in two decades, ticked up after the announcement to about $1.02. European stocks struggled to find direction, leaving the Stoxx 600 index flat.\n\nThe currency’s weakness is making the problem of inflation even worse, since it means European companies need to pay more for imports, including energy.\n\nThe ECB faces an uphill climb as it ramps up efforts to stop the rapid run-up in prices. Although the summer tourism season, pandemic-era savings and a robust job market continue to prop up Europe’s economy, growth is slowing.\n\nThe central bank isn’t penciling in a recession yet. In June, it said that it expects output to expand by 2.8% this year and by 2.1% in 2023.\n\n“The baseline scenario, there is no recession, neither this year nor near year,” Lagarde said on Thursday, though she acknowledged the horizon is “clouded.”\n\nRecession risks could constrain the ECB’s ability to keep hiking interest rates, which help combat inflation but also slow down the economy.\n\nThe ECB is already pacing far behind its peers. After cutting rates to zero at the beginning of the pandemic, the Fed has been on a rate-hiking spree since March, raising its benchmark rate in huge increments over the past few months to combat runaway inflation. Only the Bank of Japan — which on Thursday maintained its super-easy policies — hasn’t budged.\n\nIt also has to deal with a high degree of uncertainty regarding energy supplies, which is making forecasting future inflation difficult.\n\nRussia’s Gazprom resumed gas shipments along the crucial Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Thursday, easing fears that it wouldn’t come back online after a period of scheduled maintenance. But it isn’t operating at full capacity, and anxiety lingers that Russia could still shut off gas at some point in retaliation for Western sanctions.\n\nPlus, Europe’s third biggest economy is in the throes of a political crisis that’s rattling the country’s financial markets. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, an investor favorite, submitted his resignation to the president on Thursday after losing the support of several key parties in his governing coalition. That could lead to early elections.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/energy-independence-fact-check/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Despite claims of Trump-era 'energy independence,' the ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe United States never stopped importing energy from foreign countries under President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth before and after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine contributed to a spike in US gas prices, various Republicans bashed President Joe Biden for supposedly abandoning Trump-era “energy independence.” These Republicans have fostered the impression that the “energy independent” US did not need energy from Russia and elsewhere under Trump, but then, under Biden, has been forced to buy this foreign energy once more.\n\nThe truth is that the US was never close to genuine independence from foreign energy in the Trump era.\n\n“Energy independence” is a political phrase, not a literal phrase. Despite how Trump and others have made it sound, it does not mean the US was ever going it alone.\n\n“A ridiculous term,” said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“A horrible term,” said Jeff Colgan, professor and director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University and an expert on the geopolitics of oil.\n\n“This stupid term,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and a research professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nThe term has various non-literal definitions. And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 — as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy than it consumed.\n\nBut none of that means that the Trump-era US did no energy importing at all. From the beginning of Trump’s term to the end, the US very much relied on oil and gas from abroad.\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, the US imported about 7.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products. That was down from prior years – the US imported more than 10 million barrels per day in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year – but still a whole lot of foreign energy.\n\nIn fact, contrary to prominent Republicans’ suggestions over the last month that the US had just recently started consuming Russian energy under Biden, US energy imports from Russia spiked during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd that isn’t the only thing Republicans have gotten wrong.\n\nContrary to claims from Trump and other Republicans, Biden has not “shut down” American energy: US crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in each of Trump’s first two years and just narrowly shy of production in Trump’s last year, though substantially lower than production in Trump’s record-setting third year. And experts say it is economic factors and cautionary pressures from Wall Street, not anything Biden has done, that has made US oil companies reluctant to dramatically ramp up production from current levels.\n\nMultiple reasons for foreign imports\n\nAmid the US boom in oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, the quantity of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward since early in the second term of President George W. Bush. But there are numerous reasons why the US doesn’t just stop importing entirely.\n\nOne key reason is that there is a mismatch between many of the refineries in the US, which were designed to handle heavy crude oil, and the lighter crude that is produced in the US through fracking.\n\nAnother reason is that domestic energy production isn’t sufficient to fulfill the needs of all US refineries – for which it can be profitable to buy low-cost unfinished energy from abroad, turn it into higher-value petroleum products, and then export some of those products. Colgan noted in an email that even at moments when the US is a net exporter of oil, “it remains tightly integrated into the world market for oil, constantly exporting some grades of oil to foreign customers while importing other grades of oil into the United States. Same for oil products like gasoline and diesel.”\n\nGeographic factors are also at play. For example, refineries in California have relied on imports, some from Russia, because importing has been cheaper than getting oil shipped from various parts of the US, such as the Permian Basin in the Southwest, to which California has no pipeline connection.\n\nUnless the US shifts completely to renewable or nuclear energy, Krane said in an interview, “we are going to be tethered to supply lines that stretch halfway around the world whether we like it or not.”\n\nRussian imports never ceased under Trump\n\nBefore Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian energy last Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the US had suddenly started importing Russian oil under Biden.\n\nFor example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an event in late February: “We were, before Biden took office, for the first time in any of our lifetimes, actually energy independent. Putin didn’t matter. Now, they’re importing millions of barrels of oil from Russia.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said on Fox News on March 6 that Biden’s choices when he first came into office “put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil.”\n\nThe truth is that the US was importing a significant quantity of oil and petroleum products from Russia under Trump: over 137 million barrels in 2018, then 189.8 million barrels in 2019 and 197.7 million barrels in 2020.\n\nImports from Russia did increase again, to 245.2 million barrels, in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have attributed part of the spike in energy imports from Russia since 2018 to the sanctions Trump imposed on Venezuelan oil in 2019, which left US refiners looking for an alternative supplier. Regardless of the cause, it’s just not true that “Putin didn’t matter” to the US energy supply before Biden took office or that the US “became a consumer of Russian oil” under Biden.\n\nWhat is true is that, under both Trump and Biden, imports from Russia made up a fraction of total US petroleum imports – about 8 percent in 2021, just about tied with Mexico for second place.\n\nThe US reliance on foreign energy is in large part a reliance on close ally Canada, which provided 51 percent of US imports in 2021.\n\nBiden’s impact has been overstated\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Biden as an all-powerful enemy of the US oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump claimed in a speech in late February that Biden “shut down American energy.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a Wednesday suggestion that Biden was stopping oil companies from increasing production, writing: “If Biden would let America get back to 2019 production we won’t need a single drop of oil from #Venezuela or #Iran or anyone else.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Biden’s attitude toward the US oil and gas industry is less friendly than Trump’s was. But the truth is that Biden isn’t stopping US energy companies from increasing production and certainly never “shut down” US energy production.\n\n“President Biden hasn’t done anything yet – no offense – because he can’t get anything passed through the Congress,” Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nRather, US oil companies themselves have been reluctant to dramatically ramp up production. While the oil lobby has cast blame on Biden policies, experts cite various other reasons – including supply chain problems, challenges finding workers, and, critically, the current insistence from Wall Street that energy companies restrain spending and return cash to investors.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business for an article in early March, before Biden announced the Russia ban. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nKrane, the energy studies fellow from Rice University, concurred in an interview after Biden announced the ban.\n\n“It’s not a lack of leasing that’s holding back US crude. It’s Wall Street,” he said. “The federal government is like a third-tier player in the US oil market. Market signals themselves are the main driver of energy production and decision-making in the US.”\n\nEven still, US field production of crude oil in 2021, about 11.2 million barrels per day, was only slightly lower than US production under Trump in 2020, when it was about 11.3 million barrels per day – and 2021 production was higher than production in 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years in office, though well below the record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nNumerous Republicans have castigated Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Canada’s oil sands to the US. But the long-delayed pipeline would almost certainly not have been ready this year even if Biden had allowed construction to proceed.\n\nThe federal Energy Information Administration projected this month that US crude oil production will hit 12 million barrels per day again in 2022, then set a new record of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nMoratorium put on hold\n\nBiden has called for a shift away from fossil fuel production and toward renewable energy sources, and he has put forward policies toward that end. Those policies have included an attempted temporary moratorium on new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and offshore waters.\n\nBut the Biden moratorium wouldn’t have stopped drilling on existing leases. A judge put the Biden moratorium on hold in June. And the moratorium was intended to be in place only until the completion of a review by Biden’s interior department – which ended up recommending an increase to leasing fees but not a long-term halt to new leasing.\n\nAs CNN’s Ella Nilsen reported last week, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits in its first year than the Trump administration approved in 2017, 2018 and 2019, though fewer than it approved in 2020.\n\nSince late February of this year, there has been a pause on the issuance of new leases and permits on federal territory. That pause, however, was prompted by a judge’s injunction in a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to note that more than three-quarters of US drilling occurs on non-federal territory.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike/index.html", "title": "Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for the first time since 2018 ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe Federal Reserveis raisinginterest rates for the first time since 2018, the central bank announced Wednesday at the conclusion of its highly anticipated two-day monetary policy meeting.\n\nThe move marks the end of the Fed’spandemic-era easy money policy and comes amid soaring inflation across America. The federal funds rate now stands at 0.25-0.5%.\n\n“We feel the economy is very strong and will be able to withstand tighter monetary policy,” Fed Chair Pro Tempore Jerome Powell told journalists during Wednesday’s post-meeting press conference.\n\nThequarter-percentage-point increase had been well telegraphed by the central bank, with Powell hinting at it repeatedly over the past few months. Earlier this month, he told lawmakers that he favored a quarter-point raise.\n\nThis is the first rate increase since December 2018 and the first time rates have movedfrom their level of near zero since the bank slashed them almost exactly two years ago in March 2020 in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nPrices have soared over the past year for the majority of Americans, pushing inflation well above the Fed’s long-term target of 2% and forcing its hand. The central bank has a dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment at the maximum.\n\nBut during the pandemic, prices have risen on the back of high demand, supply chain chaos and higher energy costs. Initially, Powell referred to the pandemic inflation as “transitory” before retiring the use of the term during a Congressional hearing last November.\n\nAll the expectations for factors that could bring down inflation – such as an improvement in the supply chain gridlock and rising labor force participation – have not materialized, Powell said. So the Fed had to act.\n\nFor the year ended in February, consumer prices rose 7.9%, while the prices US producers received for their goods soared 10% over the same period. Neither figure is adjusted for seasonal swings.\n\nMeanwhile, the US labor market recovery has come along swiftly following the shock of the spring 2020 shutdown, which marked the largest job loss in history. As of February, the nation was still short 2.1 million jobs compared with the same month two years earlier.\n\nBetween the strong job market and high inflation only half of the Fed’s mandate is fulfilled.\n\nWhat will the Fed do next?\n\nWednesday’s policy update also included a new set of projections from the central bank, showing that Fed officials expect a median federal funds rate of 1.9% by the end of this year, before raising it to 2.8% in 2023. But the Fed could also raise rates faster, if inflation does not moderate. The central bank has six meetings left this year. The next one is scheduled for May 3-4.\n\nThe central bankers also revised up their inflation predictions to a median of 4.3% by year-end, compared with 2.6% projected in December.\n\nUS economic growth was meanwhile cut to a median 2.8% this year, from the 4% expected in December.\n\nSpillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict will hit the US economy and are already putting upward pressure on inflation, Powell said Wednesday.\n\n“The implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity,” the Fed said in Wednesday’s statement.\n\nBut there’s no reason to worry just yet.\n\n“We think that will hit GDP to some extent; 2.8% is still really strong growth,” he said. “We feel the economy is very strong and will be able to withstand tighter monetary policy.”", "authors": ["Anneken Tappe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/economy/swiss-interest-rates/index.html", "title": "Swiss National Bank hikes interest rates for first time in 15 years ...", "text": "The Swiss National Bank raised its policy interest rate for the first time in 15 years in a surprise move on Thursday and said it was ready to hike further, joining other central banks in tightening monetary policy to fight resurgent inflation.\n\nThe central bank increased its policy rate to minus 0.25% from the minus 0.75% level it has deployed since 2015, sending the safe-haven franc sharply higher. Nearly all the economists polled by Reuters had expected the SNB to keep rates steady.\n\nIt was the first increase by the SNB since September 2007, and followed a 0.75 percentage point hike in borrowing costs by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday.\n\nOther central banks are also raising interest rates as they attempt to cool inflation driven higher by surging fuel and food prices that are straining budgets for households and businesses.\n\nThe Bank of England raised UK interest rates by a quarter point on Thursday.\n\nThe European Central Bank signaled last week it would hike in July to check euro zone inflation that hit 8.1% last month.\n\nSNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said rising Swiss inflation — which hit its highest level in nearly 14 years in May — meant the central bank may have to act again.\n\nEven after Thursday’s 0.5 point rate rise, the SNB expects inflation in the first quarter of 2025 to reach 2.1%, outside its target for a rate of 0%-2%. In 2022 it expects a rate of 2.8%.\n\n“Without today’s SNB policy rate increase, the inflation forecast would be significantly higher,” Jordan told a news conference.\n\n“The new inflation forecast shows that further increases in the policy rate may be necessary in the foreseeable future,” he added, declining to indicate when or by how much the SNB could raise again.\n\n“We are not in the business of very precise forward guidance, but … at the end of our forecast horizon inflation will again go over 2% so we have to see what measures are necessary,” Jordan said.\n\nFranc no longer overvalued\n\nAnalysts expect more hikes in the quarters ahead.\n\n“Going forward, the monetary policy message is on the hawkish side,” said Gero Jung, an analyst at Mirabaud Asset Management. “For SNB economists, the Swiss franc is not over-valued anymore; second, inflation is expected to be above the limit that is associated with price stability in Switzerland.”\n\nDavid Oxley at Capital Economics said it was likely the SNB will raise rates again, to zero or even into positive territory, before its next scheduled meeting in September.\n\nKarsten Junius, an economist at J Safra Sarasin, expects the SNB to raise rates at its next four quarterly meetings by 25 basis points apiece, before pausing. “We would not rule out a 50bp hike at its next meeting in September either,” he said.\n\nThe SNB said Thursday’s rate increase was necessary to check rising prices in Switzerland, which had spread to goods and services previously unaffected by the impact of the war in Ukraine and supply chain bottlenecks linked to the pandemic.\n\nPrice rises were being passed on more quickly than before, Jordan said, and action was necessary to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. “It would be negligent not to take the inflationary development into account,” he said.\n\nThe recent depreciation in trade-weighted terms meant the Swiss franc was no longer highly valued on currency markets - long a concern for the SNB.\n\nThe bank said it was ready to intervene in markets to check excessive appreciation or weakening of the currency.\n\nSwitzerland’s labour union federation criticised the rate hike, saying the SNB was allowing the strong franc to rise further, putting jobs and wages at risk.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/outdoors/backyard-ramblings/2016/01/06/traverse-sandstone-and-snowscapes-east-zion/78344652/", "title": "Traverse sandstone and snowscapes in east Zion", "text": "Brian Passey\n\nbpassey@thespectrum.com\n\nThe east side of Zion National Park is always fun this time of the year. Sure, it’s cold, but the cold brings snow — and that’s part of the fun.\n\nIt’s New Year’s Eve and we have houseguests. My wife’s friend Rachael is in town from Washington, D.C., with her boyfriend, Pooya. And what do you do when you have visitors? Take them to Zion, of course.\n\nRachael, who has roots in Arizona, had been to the park before. But this is Pooya’s first time. Perhaps I’m doing him a disservice since we’re skipping the part of Zion that most people like to visit: the scenic drive up Zion Canyon. But it seemed like a good opportunity to hike the Canyon Overlook Trail. Plus, my wife, Cammie, had never hiked it before.\n\nThe Canyon Overlook Trail is one of my favorites. It was the first trail I ever hiked in Zion as a pre-teen while on vacation from Idaho with my parents. I returned six or seven years later with a group of friends after we graduated from high school. But since I moved to Southern Utah 11 years ago, I’ve only hiked it alone.\n\nThe trail is located along state Route 9 just east of the Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel. A small parking lot is located just as you emerge from the tunnel. Even though it’s technically the off-season, the parking lot is already full with holiday visitors as we emerge from the 1.1-mile tunnel. However, we manage to find parking just beyond the trailhead.\n\nBecause the elevation is higher here than the canyon, it’s a bit colder and spots of ice have formed along the trail. As we begin to climb the steps at the beginning, we pass a poor woman who is unsure of her footing and scared to go any further. Pooya takes a moment to help her back down the trail before we continue on.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this trail is how much scenic diversity it packs in to its half-mile length. I’m always surprised it’s only a half-mile long because there’s so much to see.\n\nFrom the initial climb at the begging of the trail we have views of the east tunnel opening and the bridge that crosses Pine Creek. The creek itself isn’t visible, but it’s there somewhere at the bottom of the narrow slot canyon it has carved along the mountainside between the trail and the tunnel.\n\nFor much of the way the trail follows a narrow path along the side of the cliff. There are railings in some spots and even a metal walkway/bridge built into the side of the red rock for a short stretch.\n\nIn a couple of places there are large overhangs where the trail passes underneath the cliff. These seem to be favorite spots for photos and my group does the same as we take a short break.\n\nThe footing is a little tricky for the next part as we pass along an extremely narrow portion of the trail and then find ourselves scrambling along an almost bowl-shaped section of slickrock while trying to avoid patches of ice at the bottom. Once we pass this point, however, we are rewarded with a majestic view of towering cliffs to the north.\n\nA few dozen feet more and we reach the end of the line — an overlook facing west and offering a commanding view of the Route 9 switchbacks and Zion Canyon beyond. Obviously, this is another place that begs for many photos, both of the scenery and the people in it.\n\nHaving been here many times before, I’m more surprised by the sheer amount of people. There must be nearly 30 people gathered here, which is probably double the amount I’ve ever seen. But I usually avoid Zion on high traffic days.\n\nAfter we soak in the views, we reluctantly descend back to our car and continue farther along Route 9 in search of bighorn sheep. It’s rare that I drive along the east side of Zion these days without seeing any of the wild sheep.\n\nSure enough, just as we come around a bend in the road we see a small group of them on the cliff ahead. We pull over to watch as they move across the sandstone, looking for tasty shrubs to munch.\n\nSince we’re in the area, we also decide to try our hand at finding the petroglyphs I’ve heard about for many years here on the east side. It’s harder than you might think because the park doesn’t publicize them. I can understand why since we’ve seen some well-known petroglyphs in Southern Utah damaged by vandals in the past.\n\nWe do find the petroglyphs, eventually, after walking right past them once. But I’m not going to give any clues to their location aside from “east of the tunnel.” There are a couple of pretty nice panels, though they aren’t quite as distinct as those at other well-known sites like Land Hill or Little Black Mountain.

She's an avid hiker, and Lafayette wasn't mountainous enough for her.\n\nI chuckled thinking about that story while hiking Sunday at Shades State Park.\n\nHiking is one of my passions, and it took a trip out West for my 36th birthday to reignite my love for the outdoors. After returning from that trip — where I explored Mount Charleston, Lake Mead, the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park — I couldn’t wait to finally experience Indiana’s trails.\n\nNow I’m kicking myself that I ignored them for the year and a half that I’ve lived here.\n\nI heard that Turkey Run can get crowded on weekends, so I opted for Shades. Everything I read suggested Shades is Turkey Run’s far-less-crowded cousin, and that proved to be true. For most of the hike, I got exactly what I wanted: time alone with my thoughts.\n\nBeing new to the park, I guessed on where to go. I took my first right after the entrance and parked in front of the first trail I found. I lucked out by stumbling onto Trail No. 10.\n\nThe trail is well-marked and exceptionally even for the first mile or so. I figured that was the extent of the trail until I passed a family where a young girl warned me, “Get ready to sweat!”\n\nI thought she was crazy until I reached Turkey Backbone, where the trail begins its descent. After some fairly aggressive hikes in Nevada, Arizona and Utah, where the inclines and declines were all on nature’s terms, the artificial steps leading down the trail were fully appreciated.\n\nAtop Turkey Backbone, and as you head into the belly of Pine Hills Nature Preserve, you get some beautiful views of Sugar Creek just over the ledges of the hiking trail. The drop-offs were surprisingly deep.\n\nOnce you reach the bottom, you’re just steps from Devil’s Backbone and Honeycomb Rock. I wasn’t expecting to find myself hiking along a 100-foot-high wall of fossil-filled rock, and happening upon it was probably the highlight of my time on the trail.\n\nThe girl’s words proved to be prophetic, and I definitely broke a sweat in Sunday's humidity walking back up the steps. A few gulps of water and several mosquito bites later, I was back at Turkey Backbone. At that point, I knew I’d be rewarded with the super easy return hike through the park.\n\nA few folks on hiking forums say they’ve done all of Shades’ trails in a day. I have no doubt that’s doable; at three miles roundtrip, the trail I took is the longest of the park’s 10 core hikes.\n\nEnergized by my short time as Shades, I spent the rest of the day researching other hiking opportunities across the Midwest. I already have a list of about a dozen trails I want to take through the fall.\n\nI finished my research amazed that there are so many trails within an easy drive of town. While there are obviously places that out-mountain Greater Lafayette, the reporter who turned us down missed out on exploring a beautiful part of the country.\n\nGeorge Spohr is executive editor of the Journal & Courier.

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office.Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

The package is the product of painstaking negotiations, and its final passage would give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, must approve the bill before Biden can sign it into law.\n\nThe sweeping bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.\n\nIt would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nSenate Democrats, with a narrow 50-seat majority, stayed unified to pass the legislation, using a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the measure without Republican votes. Final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a “vote-a-rama” that stretched nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told CNN that the legislation he helped write is “a good balanced bill.”\n\n“I think we’ll all benefit from it; the country will,” Manchin told CNN. “We have energy security, that’s what we were looking for. And we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future.”\n\nBiden praised the Senate for passing the bill in a statement Sunday, thanking Democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation’s climate investments and health care provisions.\n\n“Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” Biden said.\n\nHow Senate Democrats passed the bill on a party-line vote\n\nSenate Democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nManchin played a key role in shaping the legislation – which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a major breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out.\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals, indicating she would “move forward” on the sweeping economic package.\n\nBut Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill.\n\nTo avoid a last-minute collapse of the bill on Sunday, Democrats created a plan to win over Sinema, who was concerned over the 15% corporate minimum tax’s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity. Senate Democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal, but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota suggested, they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years.\n\nThe change was intended to prevent House Democrats primarily from coastal districts, who have campaigned on repealing limits on the SALT deduction, from breaking from the bill, when they vote on it later this week.\n\nAfter the bill’s passage in the Senate, Sinema said in a statement it would “help Arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices, making health care more affordable and accessible, and securing Arizona’s water and energy future,” while also “boosting innovation and spurring job creation.”\n\nIn a good sign for the bill becoming law, key House Democrats signaled later Sunday that they’ll vote for it despite previous demands over SALT.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey had been part of the “No SALT, no deal” caucus. But he said the bill passes his test because it doesn’t raise individual income tax rates.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, another member of that caucus, echoed his sentiment: “I will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing SALT. Because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.”\n\nRepublicans used the weekend “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate’s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included “giant job-killing tax hikes” and amounted to “a war on American fossil fuel.” The Kentucky Republican said Democrats “do not care about middle-class families’ priorities.”\n\n“And their response to the runaway inflation they’ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,” said McConnell. “The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.”\n\nHow the bill addresses the climate crisis\n\nWhile economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet.\n\nAnalysis from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to President Joe Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.\n\nThe bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles.\n\nLawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what’s needed to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“This isn’t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.”\n\nKey health care and tax policy in the bill\n\nThe bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond.\n\nThis controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs.\n\nDemocrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTo boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion.\n\nConcerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear.\n\nHowever, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.\n\nThe provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats.\n\nIn its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Clare Foran Ali Zaslav Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Clare Foran", "Ali Zaslav", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/05/01/donald-trump-anti-white-racism-dei/73528246007/", "title": "Trump vows to crush 'anti-white' racism, DEI if he wins 2024 election", "text": "Lending his voice to anti-diversity, equity and inclusion fervor sweeping the Republican party, Donald Trump telegraphed a dramatic shift to America's approach to civil rights if he wins a second term as president, vowing to focus on \"anti-white\" racism, not on racism against people of color.\n\nAsked about supporters who believe anti-white racism now represents a greater problem than anti-Black racism, the former president told Time magazine: \"I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and that can’t be allowed.\"\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Trump also said he would use the U.S. military to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants; deploy the National Guard to quash protests and gut the U.S. civil service.\n\nTrump on board with plan to curb 'affirmative discrimination'\n\nLed by the Heritage Foundation think tank – which has helped mold the policies of Republican administrations since the Reagan presidency – conservative activists have drawn up an expansive plan known as Project 2025 in anticipation of Trump’s return to power.\n\nOne of the goals of the presidential transition plan is reversing “the DEI revolution” by eliminating policies and programs such as affirmative action which Project 2025 calls \"affirmative discrimination.\"\n\nThe plan broadly reflects where Trump's policy stood at the end of his presidency in 2020. In September of that year, his administration issued an executive order prohibiting racial sensitivity training by the federal government and government contractors.\n\nThe order had an immediate chilling effect on efforts to reverse historical patterns of discrimination and exclusion in the workplace. President Joe Biden rescinded the order after taking office in January 2021.\n\nTrump aides, allies attack 'DEI revolution'\n\nDuring the Biden administration, conservative activists picked up the mantle, claiming white workers are being unfairly disadvantaged by diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that benefit minorities.\n\nGOP-led legislatures have introduced dozens of bills to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion in education, state government, contracting and pension investments.\n\nLast year’s Supreme Court decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions set off a wave of legal challenges from former Trump administration official Stephen Miller and anti-affirmative-action activist Edward Blum. Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman have also assailed DEI efforts as “racist.”\n\nTwo men fought for jobs in a river town50 years later, the nation is still divided.\n\nThese efforts have gained momentum. In 2021, a federal judge in Florida blocked a debt relief program for Black farmers. Last month, a federal judge in Texas ruled that a government agency created to boost the fortunes of minority-owned businesses was discriminating against white people and must now serve everyone, regardless of race.\n\nCivil rights advocates reject the notion that America has a problem with anti-white racism.\n\nMarc Morial, president of the National Urban League, said conservative activists are \"advocating for the return of white privilege.\"\n\n\"They’re advocating for the policies that were used during a segregated America,” Morial told USA TODAY in March.\n\nCorporate America has a diversity problem\n\nAlvin B. Tillery Jr., director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Diversity at Northwestern University, told USA TODAY that conservatives vilify diversity, equity and inclusion and advance false charges of anti-white racism in an attempt to convince Americans that the nation has solved anti-Black racism.\n\n“These are just codewords they are using to talk amongst themselves about reconstituting the racial order they want,” Tillery told USA TODAY in March.\n\nAs the nation grows more diverse and research studies suggest that diverse companies outperform more homogeneous peers, businesses are working to make their workforces and leadership better reflect the communities they serve.\n\nAfter the 2020 murder of George Floyd forced a historic reckoning with race in America, corporations redoubled those efforts.\n\nRacial parity in the business world is a long way off. A USA TODAY investigation of the nation’s largest companies found that the top ranks are predominantly white and male, while women and people of color are concentrated at the lowest levels with less pay, fewer perks and little opportunity for advancement.\n\nCorporate diversity efforts are broadly supported by the American public. A vast majority of adults – 81% – believe that corporate America should reflect the nation’s diversity, according to a recent study by The Harris Poll.\n\nTrump vows to reverse Biden 'woke equity' programs\n\nTrump has promised to reverse the Biden administration’s “woke equity” programs and said he will call on Congress to establish a restitution fund for those “unjustly discriminated against by these destructive policies.”\n\n\"Every institution in America is under attack from this Marxist concept of 'equity,' \" Trump said last year.\n\nMost white voters supporting Trump believe that racial minorities are favored over white people, according to a CBS poll in November.\n\n\"If you look right now, there’s absolutely a bias against white (people) and that’s a problem,” Trump told Time.\n\nDuring his spate of legal troubles, Trump has frequently claimed he, too, is the target of anti-white racism.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/supreme-court-climate-change-epa-regulations/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court curbs EPA's ability to fight climate change | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court curbed the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, a major defeat for the Biden administration’s attempts to slash emissions at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.\n\nIn addition, the court cut back agency authority in general invoking the so-called “major questions” doctrine – a ruling that will impact the federal government’s authority to regulate in other areas of climate policy, as well as regulation of the internet and worker safety.\n\nThe decision issued Thursday will send shockwaves across the federal government, threatening agency action that comes without clear congressional authorization.\n\nThe ruling was 6-3. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, with the three liberal justices dissenting. Roberts said that “our precedent counsels skepticism toward EPA’s claim” that the law “empowers it to devise carbon emissions caps based on a generation shifting approach.”\n\n“Under our precedents, this is a major questions case,” Roberts wrote, adding that “there is little reason to think Congress assigned such decisions to the Agency.”\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the ruling “could be cataclysmic for modern administrative law.”\n\n“For a century, the federal government has functioned on the assumption that Congress can broadly delegate regulatory power to executive branch agencies. Today’s ruling opens the door to endless challenges to those delegations – on everything from climate change to food safety standards – on the ground that Congress wasn’t specific enough in giving the agency the power to regulate such ‘major’ issues,” Vladeck said.\n\nRegarding the EPA, Roberts wrote that capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal may be a “sensible” solution.\n\n“But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme” under the law in question.\n\n“A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body,” he wrote.\n\nWriting separately, Justice Neil Gorsuch emphasized the court’s move to limit agency power, which he considers unaccountable to the public.\n\n“While we all agree that administrative agencies have important roles to play in a modern nation, surely none of us wishes to abandon our Republic’s promise that the people and their representatives should have a meaningful say in the laws that govern them,” Gorsuch wrote.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenters, sounded the alarm about global warming and said that the court’s decision “strips” the EPA of the “power Congress gave it to respond to ‘the most pressing environmental challenge of our time.’”\n\n“The Court appoints itself – instead of Congress or the expert agency – the decision-maker on climate policy,” she wrote.\n\n“I cannot think of many things more frightening,” she concluded.\n\nThe White House on Thursday blasted the ruling.\n\n“This is another devastating decision from the Court that aims to take our country backwards,” a White House official said in a statement. “While the Court’s decision risks damaging our ability to keep our air clean and combat climate change, President Biden will not relent in using the authorities that he has under law to protect public health and tackle the climate change crisis.”\n\nMeanwhile, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the ruling is “a public health disaster” that will hurt Americans’ health.\n\n“A failure to regulate power plant emissions will lead to increases in asthma, lung cancer, and other diseases associated with poor air quality, and in many places, those impacts are likely to fall hardest in already heavily polluted neighborhoods,” Becerra said.\n\nAction from Congress is unlikely\n\nThe opinion calls into question the future of federal-level climate action in the US, and puts even more pressure on Congress to act to reduce planet-warming emissions.\n\nBut broad action from Congress is unlikely. Democrats in Congress have been embroiled in difficult negotiations on a climate and clean energy bill with their main holdout, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia for months, with no clear end in sight.\n\nIt’s unclear whether those negotiations on a package of clean energy tax credits and other emissions-cutting programs will yield a result. And without both major investments on clean energy and strong regulations cutting emissions by the EPA, President Joe Biden has very little hope of meeting his climate goal, independent analysis shows.\n\nCongressional Democrats also expressed fury at the court’s decision and warned of the environmental consequences.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, said the court has “sentenced our planet to death.”\n\n“Make no mistake, this decision – and all of the decisions this week – will be directly responsible for the harm and deaths of countless Americans,” he said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, who proposed the Green New Deal, said the decision “lets polluters turn back the clock on fifty years of reduced pollution and improved air quality all across the country.”\n\n“The result of this dangerous decision is an EPA that is undermined in its ability to protect the public,” he said, adding that Congress should pass “meaningful climate and clean energy funding” and the “climate justice and clean energy package.”\n\nVladeck said the lack of congressional willpower will lead to the erosion of federal power.\n\n“It would be one thing if Congress could be expected to respond to this ruling by updating all of those delegations to make them more specific, but we – and the Court – know that it won’t, which will almost surely lead to significant deregulation across a wide swath of federal authority.”\n\nClimate impacts of power plants\n\nFossil fuels in the power sector are a huge contributor to the climate crisis. Around 25% of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions around the globe and in the US come from generating electricity, according to the EPA. And coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, powers about 20% of US electricity. Emissions from power production rose last year for the first time since 2014, an increase that was mainly driven by coal use.\n\nThe surge in fossil fuel use is worrying not only for Biden’s climate goals – the President in his first months in office pledged to slash US emissions in half by 2030 – but also the planet. Scientists have become increasingly urgent in their warnings that to make headway on the climate crisis, emissions need to not only be reduced going forward, but the world needs to develop ways to also remove the greenhouse gas that’s been pumped into the atmosphere in decades past.\n\nIn a landmark report last year, scientists reported that the planet is warming faster than they had previously imagined it would. As it does, they said, extreme weather will become more deadly; water crises will develop and worsen; food insecurity will grow and disease will spread. To avoid the worst consequences, the world must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (it’s already passed 1.1 degrees), and the only way to do that is to keep the vast majority of the Earth’s remaining fossil fuel stored in the ground.\n\nScope of Clean Air Act\n\nCentral to the case was the section of the Clean Air Act concerning the scope of the EPA’s ability to regulate power plants.\n\nThe Obama administration interpreted the provision broadly in a way that would justify regulations on a statewide basis. The Trump administration, however, said the EPA’s authority is much more narrow and that it could only target requirements aimed at making individual power plants more efficient.\n\nThe DC Circuit vacated the Trump rule in 2021 holding that it rested on a “fundamental misconstruction” of the law. The Biden administration is currently working on a new rule.\n\nBecause there is no current EPA rule on power plant emissions on the books, court watchers were surprised when the Supreme Court agreed to take up a challenge to the lower court opinion brought by Republican-led states.\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey was the main plaintiff in this case, joined by Republican attorneys general from more than a dozen other states. He was joined by lawyers representing two coal companies: The North American Coal Corporation, and Westmoreland Mining Holdings, LLC.\n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the EPA’s authority to broadly regulate greenhouse gas emissions coming from power plants and said this power should be taken away from the agency and given to Congress. They said a provision of the Clean Air Act did not give the agency such broad authority, and citing a legal principle called “the major questions doctrine,” the challengers said that such decisions with such sweeping implications had to have Congress’ clear authorization.\n\nOn the other side, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the petitioners’ case should be dismissed because there is no federal regulation for power plants on the books right now – with both the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and the Trump-era Affordable Clean Energy rule dead. The EPA has not yet issued a new rule.\n\nRepublicans ‘pleased’ with decision\n\nMorrisey on Thursday said the court “made the correct decision to rein in the EPA, an unelected bureaucracy.”\n\n“We are pleased this case returned the power to decide one of the major environmental issues of the day to the right place to decide it: the U.S. Congress, comprised of those elected by the people to serve the people,” he said. “This is about maintaining the separation of powers, not climate change.”\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, also celebrated the ruling, saying that it “will stop unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. from being able to unilaterally decarbonize our economy just because they feel like it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Ella Nilsen Veronica Stracqualursi", "Ariane De Vogue", "Ella Nilsen", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/biden-administration-sanctions-russia/index.html", "title": "Inside the months of work that allowed the US and its allies to turn ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe speed and ferocity of financial sanctions being deployed against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine are without precedent. Over the weekend, the US and its Western allies took a series of dramatic steps that just days earlier were seen as unlikely.\n\nA number of Russian banks will soon be expelled from the SWIFT global messaging network, in many ways the backbone of global commerce. Even more significant is the commitment to target Russia’s central bank with sanctions that sever its ability to conduct transactions with Western banks.\n\nThe move would undo years of work by Russian President Vladimir Putin to sanction-proof his economy by amassing a $630 billion war chest of foreign currency reserves. If Russia’s central bank is barred from selling those reserves through foreign banks, that stockpile would essentially be rendered useless.\n\nRussia’s economy, already grappling with its stock market’s worst week on record, an all-time low for its currency against the dollar and soaring borrowing costs, now faces a true crisis moment.\n\n“This is not where we wanted to be, but this is Putin’s war of choice, and only Putin can decide how much more cost he is willing to bear,” a senior US administration official said. “In short, Russia has become a global, economic, and financial pariah.”\n\nRussia’s energy exports, its biggest source of revenue, remain largely untouched, but that too is a sign of how the US is moving in lockstep with its European allies, many of whom rely on Russia for a significant amount of their oil and natural gas supplies. It also demonstrates how the alliance is leaving options on the table to use down the road.\n\nUS and European officials working on the technical details of the sanctions were in “near constant contact” over the course of the last two days, one European official said. The official described the 48-hour period as defined by “a level of determination to make this work – and get it right.”\n\nThat official said there was no sign that determination would dissipate any time soon. The images seen worldwide, along with direct conversations between European leaders and their Ukrainian counterparts, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, had dramatically shifted the dynamic.\n\nAfter years of dissension and objections over how best to deal with Russia, in the space of just a few days the US and its Western allies have demonstrated a remarkable degree of collective resolve, something that took months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy to achieve, officials say.\n\nLast October, as alarm spread through President Joe Biden’s national security team over classified intelligence that Russia was building up its military presence around Ukraine, a group of US officials began work on what would become the most sweeping package of sanctions ever deployed against a country with an economy as big as Russia’s.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Biden’s public strategy to forestall an invasion moved to the forefront. It included diplomatic efforts to dissuade Russia from military action and US troop deployments to reassure Eastern European NATO allies. While Biden made clear American troops would not be deploying to Ukraine, behind the scenes, a team of economists, diplomats, finance experts and national security officials were tasked with coming up with another way to project American might.\n\nBy mid-November, officials from the White House National Security Council, as well as from the Treasury, State and Commerce Departments were engaged in an intensive effort to rally foreign allies behind the most tangible threat of action – a sweeping package of sanctions designed to isolate Putin and cripple his country’s economy.\n\nOver dozens of calls, meetings and planning sessions, US officials spent the next few months negotiating with their foreign counterparts to join the US in a sweeping sanctions program. The work appears to have paid off. Within hours of Putin’s invasion beginning last week, more than 30 countries across four continents, comprising more than half of the world’s gross domestic product, had taken part in sanctions against Russia.\n\nRussia’s largest banks are now severed from the global financial system. Key industrial sectors have been cut off from accessing critical technologies. Family members of top officials in Putin’s inner circle have been hit with individual sanctions, including having their US-held assets frozen.\n\nOn Friday, individual sanctions were aimed at Putin himself. By Saturday, the alliance announced its intent to trigger a calibrated version of what is widely seen as the sanctions equivalent of the “nuclear option” – expelling several Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe decision not to include SWIFT sanctions in the initial round of sanctions was done in part to placate European allies, many of which use the system to make payments for fuel from Russia, officials said.\n\nBut the continued escalation of sanctions in the days since the initial sweeping package rolled out gave a window into what officials viewed as the most critical component of the effort: a unified response. Not only would it create a robust sanctions regime, officials said, but it also created the space – and trust – to dial up the punishment if conditions warranted.\n\nMany of the US officials involved in the effort, including Daleep Singh, Biden’s deputy national security adviser for international economics, and Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, worked in the Obama administration and had helped craft sanctions against Russia the last time Putin moved on Ukraine in 2014.\n\nDeputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe lessons learned, both in crafting a more robust package and in the importance of keeping allies on board, served as a road map for the entire push, officials said.\n\nThe process wasn’t a straight line, particularly early on when European officials were skeptical about the scale of the threat outlined by US intelligence, according to officials. Differing legal authorities and capabilities needed to be managed and massaged.\n\nBut as Russian troops and firepower amassed along the Ukrainian border, the talks gained momentum.\n\n“As the crisis intensified, the diplomatic effort intensified,” a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nBy the first week of February, a small team of administration officials was in Europe to hammer out the final critical details as part of a delegation that stopped in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Germany, according to an administration official briefed on the effort.\n\nDeputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo Lenin Nolly/Sipa USA/Lenin Nolly/Sipa USA\n\nInside the White House, officials had become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that sanctions, which have rarely served as a singular tool to dramatically shift behavior, were unlikely to change Putin’s calculation.\n\n“He’s done what we feared,” the official said. “But we still can – and certainly will – make this a failure for him.”\n\nOfficials say the measure of the response, both in participants and in the bite of the sanctions themselves, revealed just how much was learned eight years prior.\n\n“We felt like coming out of it we really understood Russia’s pressure points,” the official said of how the 2014 experience shaped the approach.\n\nJulia Friedlander, a former senior Treasury and National Security Council official, said the Obama administration’s sanctions of Russia after the 2014 invasion of Crimea “came nowhere close” to the actions the Biden administration is now taking.\n\nUkrainian servicemen ride on tanks towards the front line with Russian forces in the Lugansk region of Ukraine on February 25, 2022.

Russia’s oil and gas sector, the engine of its economy, remains untouched. Russia is still allowed to participate in the SWIFT system. And, perhaps most damning to critics, the sanctions package itself wasn’t deployed until after the invasion was under way.\n\nIf it was meant to deter, or shift, Putin’s calculation, it had come up short.\n\n“Sadly, deterrence after the fact is not deterrence at all,” said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the US Senate’s top Republican who had been pressing the administration daily to pre-emptively launch the full scale of the sanctions package.\n\nAdministration officials say that criticism misses the overarching intent of the strategy Biden’s team pursued.\n\n“We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and minimize the impact on the United States and our allies,” Biden said Thursday.\n\nWhile markets have already demonstrated the near-term bite, officials say the full scale of the restrictions compounds the costs over time, squeezing key economic sectors and industrial capacity. The sanctions are designed to limit Putin’s options and ambitions, even as it has grown clear inside the White House that the current crisis is unlikely to end anytime soon.\n\n“Once it starts, there’s no quick end,” a senior White House official said of the Russian invasion. “This is going to take time, and potentially quite a bit of it.”\n\nFinding the pressure points\n\nPutin has spent years preparing for the sanctions onslaught he now faces. He has reduced Russia’s dependence on global debt markets and built up a massive $600 billion war chest of foreign currency reserves, the fourth largest in the world. Russia’s reliance on the dollar has been minimized by a dramatic increase in holdings of euros and Chinese yuan – all meant to insulate Russia against Western sanctions.\n\nStill, the key players crafting the US sanctions see vulnerabilities in Russia’s economy. Restrictions on foreign investment across critical industries, with a particular focus on banks, have been paired with new tools designed to expose Russia’s limited capacity to manufacture components critical to key industrial sectors.\n\nThe Treasury Department led on crafting the economic sanctions designed to go far beyond the 2014 iteration. Commerce Department officials, who have export control authorities, spearheaded an innovative addition to the overall sanctions package that would cut off Russian access to Western technology.\n\nAs European allies initially balked at the idea of kicking Russia out of SWIFT, Treasury officials focused on cutting Russia’s biggest banks off from the West. Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, was severed from doing business on international markets. The second-largest lender, VTB Bank, was hit with full blocking sanctions that froze US assets and any US-related business entirely.\n\n“You’re going to cause the Russian central bank over time to deplete its reserves,” said Friedlander, now the director of the Atlantic Council’s economic statecraft initiative. “It’s in a pretty good position right now, but as these banks have less and less liquidity, the central bank is going to have to prop up. You are causing in effect a banking crisis in the country.”\n\nNo more tech\n\nA central pillar of the package are the export controls designed to sever Russia’s access to critical technologies.\n\nIn crafting their strategy, Biden administration officials sought to take an idea from the 2014 sanctions – efforts to degrade Russia’s energy production over time – and expand on them by using a more direct and potent tool to target key industries, including military, biotechnology and aerospace.\n\nThe inclusion of export controls marks an evolution in the crafting of a comprehensive economic crackdown, one designed to weave in the restrictions on a multilateral scale without precedent.\n\nItems ranging from semiconductors and lasers to information security equipment and sensors will face restrictions. The more countries that joined, the fewer options Russia would have to backfill items it has no capacity to manufacture at home.\n\nCommerce Department officials worked to secure similar commitments from allies, which would eventually include the EU, Japan, Australia and the UK, among others. Taiwan, which plays an outsize role in the critical semiconductor market, joined as well.\n\nWaiting to strike\n\nAs administration officials worked to rally allies abroad, back in Washington, the White House faced pressure from Congress to act more quickly against Putin. In January, a bipartisan Senate proposal that would have imposed pre-emptive sanctions against Russia took shape, sources directly involved said.\n\nBut the White House was wary of any pre-emptive, unilateral move that would undercut the carefully coordinated coalition it was working to craft. The effort eventually fell apart over partisan disagreements over the timing and scale of sanctions.\n\nAdministration officials viewed pre-emptive sanctions as having the potential pretext for invasion in and of itself, something Biden and his team went to unprecedented lengths to avoid through near real-time disclosures of intelligence information designed to front-run any false flag or disinformation efforts.\n\nBut keeping the coalition together and limiting economic spillover remained the overarching goal throughout – something officials feared would be at risk if a more aggressive package moved forward in the weeks leading up to the eventual invasion.\n\nA SWIFT window into a delicate balance\n\nThe initial absence of sanctions to cut Russia and its financial institutions off from SWIFT also drew criticism – and pleas from top Ukrainian officials, including the country’s besieged president.\n\n“We demand the disconnection of Russia from SWIFT,” Zelensky tweeted Thursday.\n\nBut even as White House officials took pains not to publicize any disputes or disagreements as the scope of the package took shape, Biden last week provided a glimpse into the tensions when asked about SWIFT by reporters.\n\n“It is always an option, but right now that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,” Biden said.\n\nIt was a technically true statement – the EU, not the US, is the primary player in deploying sanctions that would require SWIFT to disconnect any entity or country. But it also hinted at the broader balancing act.\n\nFor those who have questioned the decision to leave Russia’s energy sector largely untouched, the SWIFT outcome should “be all the evidence you need that it was the only way to keep the West together,” one European diplomat involved in the discussions told CNN.\n\nOfficials stressed that the disagreement didn’t mean SWIFT-related sanctions were off the table entirely. The penalties can be calibrated, including sanctions that would remove a single bank from the system.\n\nBut with Europe relying on Russia for nearly half of its natural gas supply and a quarter of the crude oil it consumes, energy sanctions threaten to undercut the carefully constructed unity.\n\nWeaponizing Russian energy\n\nThe concerns aren’t confined to the Europeans, however.\n\nBiden, two officials said, repeatedly raised concerns in private meetings with advisers about the effects of the Western response on prices for an American public already grappling with pandemic-driven inflation that, year over year, sits at a 40-year high.\n\nBut as the deal came together, US officials and their counterparts agreed that energy sanctions would be off the table.\n\nUS officials have calculated that Putin, particularly in the face of crippling sanctions across other sectors of his economy, can’t afford to weaponize his energy supplies by cutting off sales to Europe. But there was a clear effort to be prepared if that did occur.\n\nBiden is also heavily leaning toward further tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease price pressure at the gas pump, two officials told CNN. While no final decisions have been made, the November decision to release 50 million barrels in coordination with Japan, South Korea and China may serve as a model for future action should oil prices surge.\n\nOfficials say they will continue to monitor events and respond. By Friday, the US, UK and EU had imposed sanctions on Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, along with other members of Putin’s inner circle.\n\nAn asset freeze was slapped on the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund with close Putin ties. Officials are prepared to continue to dial up sanctions on the country’s biggest lenders and have explored whether sanctions on Russia’s cryptocurrency market are feasible, officials said.\n\nOfficials continue to say they will monitor events and respond. The events of the last two days demonstrate their seriousness to ratchet up the costs for Putin. The scale of the central bank sanctions are still under discussion and could have even more bite than officials telegraphed. US officials are even exploring the possibility of whether sanctions on Russia’s cryptocurrency market are feasible, officials said.\n\n“He’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together,” Biden said of Putin. “And we will. We will, and it will impose significant costs on him.”", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/14/president-biden-new-tariffs-on-china-economy/73684903007/", "title": "President Biden's new tariffs on goods from China will affect EVs ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden imposed sweeping tariff hikes Tuesday on electric vehicles, semiconductors and other goods imported from China, countering what the White House calls unfair trade practices by China that it says have put U.S. industries at a disadvantage.\n\nThe Biden administration has accused China of flooding the global markets with goods at artificially low prices, giving Chinese competitors an unfair advantage against their U.S. counterparts.\n\n\"Bottom line: I want fair competition with China, not conflict,\" Biden said at a White House Rose Garden ceremony before signing a memorandum ordering the tariff hikes.\n\nWhite House officials say the tariff hikes are designed to create a \"level playing field\" for U.S. manufacturing in clean energy and microchips − areas the Biden administration have targeted with major government investments to try to catch up with China.\n\nOther goods from China slapped with higher tariffs include solar cells, batteries, battery materials, cranes used at ports, and certain medical supplies, as well as steel and aluminum imported from China.\n\nMore:Biden sets huge new tariffs on electric vehicles, chips and other goods from China\n\nHere's what to know about the tariff increases:\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nA tariff is a tax imposed by one country on goods and services imported from another country, according to Investopedia.\n\nA tariff can have several purposes: to raise revenue in the country that imposes the tariff, to protect domestic industries against competition from abroad, or to leverage political influence in the country that pays the tariff, among others.\n\nBottom line: A tariff generally makes an imported product less appealing to domestic consumers.\n\nWhy is Biden doing this now?\n\nThe White House says the tariff increases are designed to protect American industries the administration has targeted with major investments to try to catch up with China. These sectors include manufacturing in clean energy, electric vehicles and microchips.\n\nBiden has staked his economic agenda on reigniting a U.S. manufacturing boom centered on clean energy, but the White House has accused China of flooding the markets with cheaper products that put U.S. industries at a disadvantage.\n\nHow large are the tariff hikes?\n\nBiden has levied substantial tariff hikes.\n\nThe tariff rate of electric vehicles imported from China will increase from 25% to 100% beginning this year, while tariffs on semiconductors from China will double from 25% to 50% by 2025.\n\nAmong other changes, the tariff rate on lithium-ion batteries from China used in electric vehicles will triple from 7.5% to 25%. The tariff on solar cells imported from China will double from 25% to 50%. And steel and aluminum products will triple this year to 25%.\n\nHow many electric vehicles does the U.S. import from China?\n\nChina is not a major player in the U.S. market for electric vehicles, at least not yet, according to an analysis by the Atlantic Council think tank. China shipped $368 million in electric vehicles to the U.S. in 2023. By contrast, the European Union exported nearly $7.4 billion in EVs to the U.S. last year.\n\nEV imports from China are low largely because the U.S. already charged a relatively steep tariff on Chinese imports, 25%.\n\nBiden accuses China of unfairly flooding the market. What does that mean?\n\nWhite House officials say China wields unfair trade practices to deluge global markets with exports at artificially low prices.\n\nWhat are the unfair practices? China subsidizes manufacturers with cheap land and easy credit, the Biden administration says, and affords few rights to workers, who often earn low wages and work long hours. In the automotive industry, components such as steel and electronics are relatively cheap in China, giving Chinese manufacturers another advantage.\n\nChinese factories are producing more products than its citizens can buy in a slowing economy. That surplus gives China another incentive to export underpriced items.\n\nMore:Biden sends message to China ― and working-class voters ― with tariff threat\n\nWhat will it mean for consumers?\n\nAnalysts and automakers warn that a trade battle with China could raise costs for EVs, ultimately hurting consumers and impeding the Biden administration’s climate goals.\n\nHigher tariffs on electric vehicles, solar cells, semiconductors and other items will potentially make those products more costly for American consumers.\n\nTo many economists, tariffs amount to an extra tax on consumers because they raise prices. Biden officials counter that they do not expect the new tariffs to significantly raise prices, because they affect a narrow range of items.\n\nWill it worsen inflation?\n\nBiden officials say the new tariffs are “carefully targeted” and unlikely to raise inflation, which has vexed the nation over the past few years.\n\nAn analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found no link between Trump-era tariffs, imposed during his presidency, and the subsequent run-up of inflation in 2021 and 2022.\n\nHowever, economists and politicians have long recognized a connection between tariffs and higher prices. Tariffs effectively add an extra tax on what consumers already pay for imported goods.\n\nIs Biden playing election politics?\n\nWhite House officials insist the tariff hikes were not done for political reasons, but it's impossible to ignore that the 2024 election is now six months away.\n\nHigher tariffs play into Biden's efforts to court the support of working-class voters in Midwest battleground states including Michigan, the center of the U.S. auto industry.\n\nWhat does Donald Trump say about it?\n\nBiden is borrowing the trade playbook of former President Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, who routinely raised tariffs on Chinese goods during his four years in office.\n\n\"Where have you been for the last three and a half years? They should have done it a long time ago,\" Trump said Tuesday of Biden's tariffs.\n\nYet Biden's moves are significantly more limited in scope than Trump's campaign proposals. While the Biden White House opted for targeted tariffs in certain industries, Trump has proposed a 60% or more tariff on all Chinese imports as well as imports from other countries. Biden has warned Trump's plan would result in higher consumer prices for Americans.\n\n\"They've also got to do it on other vehicles, and they have to do it on a lot of other products,\" Trump said. \"Because China's eating our lunch right now.\"\n\nWill this spark a trade war with China?\n\nPotentially. Last week, as the likelihood of the tariffs was reported by several media outlets, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized the move. “China will take all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests,\" the spokesman said.\n\nStellantis plans to sell Chinese EVs in other parts of the world\n\nAmsterdam-based Stellantis and Chinese EV startup Leapmotor have teamed up to sell Chinese-made electric vehicles in nine European countries and other parts of the world, starting this September.\n\nThe Tuesday announcement did not include any plans for bringing Chinese EVs into the U.S. market.\n\n“There is no real Chinese competition right now in the U.S. market,” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, noting that Europe is a different case. “It looks like the U.S. is going for a very strong protectionism whereas for the time being Europe is keeping the market reasonably open with a lower tariff of 10%.”\n\nWhether Stellantis, which owns the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat brands, would consider bringing Leapmotor EVs to the United States in the future would depend on tariffs, Tavares said, also weighing in on the possibility of entry through Mexico.\n\n“I understand that, of course, if the Chinese would like to come to the U.S. they would eventually use Mexico as a sourcing base. I don’t know if this is something that would be acceptable for the U.S. administration,” Tavares said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/us-putin-sanctions/index.html", "title": "US to impose sanctions on Putin following Ukraine invasion | CNN ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe US will impose sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House announced Friday.\n\nThe Russian leader will become the highest-profile target in the effort to impose costs on the Russian economy and Putin’s inner circle in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union, United Kingdom and Canada also announced Friday that they would introduce sanctions targeting Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the US move to sanction Putin and Lavrov, which was first reported by CNN, was made in the last 24 hours in coordination with European allies.\n\n“It’s been on the table for some time, but through coordination and discussion with our European partners over the last day or so,” Psaki said when asked for details on the timing of the decision.\n\nThe decision to target Putin directly across Western allies marks the most personal escalation of a sweeping effort to respond to Russia’s actions through economic penalties. While it’s unclear the extent of the direct effect – officials have long said Putin’s finances are opaque and difficult to track – the symbolism of targeting the Russian leader is clear.\n\nPsaki also said she “believes” a travel ban of some kind will be included in the US sanctions against the Russian President, but she did not have specific details yet.\n\n“There are very limited examples of of this being done, as you all know, but that is a standard part,” she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had said sanctioning Putin had been an option under consideration, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday it was “on the table.”\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday announced sweeping sanctions targeting Russia, enacting penalties across industries, including asset freezes for the largest banks, debt and equity restrictions on critical mining, transportation and logistics firms and a large-scale effort to shut down access to critical technology for key Russian military and industrial sectors.\n\nAs part of its first two rounds of sanctions, the US targeted key members of Putin’s inner circle, both in government and in business. But in what would mark a new strategy, they also expanded sanctions to the adult children of several of the officials.\n\nIt was a calculated effort to cut off what officials say has been a pathway utilized by Russian officials to shield their wealth by transferring it to family members.\n\nOn Friday evening, the Biden administration announced that several members of Russia’s National Security Council will also be sanctioned, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov.\n\n“Treasury has previously designated eleven members of the Russian Security Council and will continue to impose costs on the ruling elite as Russia prosecutes this brutal war of choice,” a US Treasury Department statement said.\n\nThe EU and UK have also targeted a series of Russian officials.\n\nEarlier this week, the US also allowed sanctions against the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to go forward, after Germany said it would not certify the pipeline following the Russian invasion.\n\nThose sanctions were issued in coordination with European countries to punish Moscow for its attack on Ukraine.\n\nBut the White House and European Union faced calls from Ukrainian leaders – as well as lawmakers in Congress – to take additional steps, including shutting Russia out from the SWIFT financial messaging system used for international transactions, as well as targeting Putin directly.\n\nEuropean counties, which rely on SWIFT to buy Russian gas and energy, were not yet ready to take that step, however, which Biden alluded to at his Thursday news conference.\n\n“We’ve never taken that off the table, of course, and I’m certainly not taking it off the table today,” Psaki said of SWIFT. “So certainly there’ll be ongoing discussions about that.”\n\nThe plans from the US, UK and European Union to collectively sanction Putin personally came after a call with NATO leaders on Friday. NATO leaders also announced the alliance was activating the NATO Response Force for the first time as a defensive measure in response to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe EU announced Friday it was adding Putin and Lavrov in its sanctions list. And UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday he will introduce new sanctions against Putin and Lavrov “imminently” on top of sanctions the British government announced on Thursday.\n\nA readout of Johnson’s call with NATO leaders published on the UK government’s website said that Johnson also urged NATO countries “to take immediate action against SWIFT to inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime.”\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also on Friday announced a “third set of severe, coordinated sanctions.”\n\n“First, we will be imposing sanctions on President Putin and his fellow architects of this barbaric war, his chief of staff and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov,” he said.\n\n“Additionally, I am confirming Canada’s support to remove Russia from the SWIFT payment system, a critical part of the global banking system,” Trudeau added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly Jeremy Herb", "Phil Mattingly", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/27/biden-trump-presidential-debate-fact-check/74160563007/", "title": "Fact check of presidential debate: What did Trump, Biden get wrong?", "text": "President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both strayed repeatedly from the truth as they squared off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season.\n\nHere are the claims the USA TODAY Fact Check Team dug into.\n\nBiden claim: We lowered the cost of an insulin shot from $400 to $15\n\n“We brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400.”\n\nThis is false. The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law in August 2022 capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month for all seniors on Medicare, according to the White House. Several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, followed suit and limited the monthly cost of the drug to $35 per month as well. But there is no evidence Biden limited the cost of insulin beyond this.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe price of insulin was also never set at $400, though many paid about this much. The price a person pays for insulin depends on a variety of factors, including what type of insulin they are using, insurance status and whether they're eligible for a rebate from the drugmaker, according to NBC News. While estimates vary, one government study published in December 2022 reported that in 2019, the average insulin user with private insurance spent $456 on insulin annually, while those with Medicare spent $449 a year and those without health insurance paid $996, comparatively.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: He is endorsed by Border Patrol agents\n\n“The border patrolmen endorsed me, endorsed my position.”\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council – the labor union that represents more than 18,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents – posted to X, formerly Twitter, minutes after Biden made the claim and said, “To be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.”\n\nBut the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive\n\n“I've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.”\n\nBiden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week.\n\nIn remarks posted on June 26, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action.\n\nHowever, immigration experts have cautioned that it’s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim.\n\nImmigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned\n\n“I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.”\n\nThis is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a “bad thing.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: Historians voted Trump ‘worst’ president in history\n\n“(Trump) was the worst in all of American history. … He can argue (the historians) are wrong, but that’s what they voted.”\n\nBiden was presumably referring to the 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey, which is a joint project from University of Houston professor Brandon Rottinghaus and Coastal Carolina University professor Justin Vaughn.\n\nThe survey respondents in late 2023 voted Trump the lowest in “overall presidential greatness,” behind James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln was rated highest. Joe Biden ranked at No. 14.\n\nRespondents included scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in related scholarly journals or academic presses and current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, which the survey described as “the foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics.”\n\nOut of 525 respondents invited to participate, the survey received 154 usable responses, yielding a 29% response rate.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: I brought in National Guard during 2020 Minnesota unrest\n\n“If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city (Minneapolis) would have been destroyed.”\n\nIt was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who activated the state’s National Guard to respond to unrest following the death of George Floyd, according to a press release issued by Walz’s office on May 28, 2020.\n\nWalz said at the time that he was responding to “local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.”\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale also looked into the claim back in 2020, detailing the timeline of events provided to the network by Walz’s press secretary, Teddy Tschann. In a statement to CNN, Tschann said Walz activated the National Guard at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before the governor spoke with the White House.\n\n“Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No,” Tschann said in the statement, according to CNN.\n\nOn May 30, 2020, the Minnesota National Guard posted on Twitter, now X, that Walz had “announced the full mobilization” of the Guard for the first time since World War II.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nBiden claim: Trump praised Hitler, saying he did 'some good things'\n\n\"This is a guy who says Hitler has done some good things\"\n\nBiden's quote of Trump is a reference to comments the former president allegedly made while talking with his White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, in 2018 during a trip to Paris, according to excerpts from an upcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\n“Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly told Kelly, according to a CNN report.\n\nTrump later denied that he made the comments and denied that the conversation took place. Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson, told CNN the claim is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"President Trump never said this,\" Harrington said. \"It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\nTrump has previously faced criticism for saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and describing his political opponents as \"vermin,\" reminding many of language used by authoritarian leaders.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: Record ‘approval rating’ from VA\n\n“I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.”\n\nThis is both false and a mischaracterization of what the quarterly customer experience surveys from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs measure.\n\nThe Veteran Signals surveys track the proportion of servicemembers who express having trust in the VA. It's not a presidential approval rating.\n\nIt has topped 80% twice: It was at 80% in 2020 during Trump’s administration, and it reached a high of 80.4% in May under Biden.\n\nTrump made a similar version of the claim during a May rally in Wisconsin, according to a report from Wisconsin Watch.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: More illicit drugs coming into US under Biden\n\n“The number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far.”\n\nThis is false. When measured by weight, drug seizures are trending down.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations seized nearly 549,000 pounds of illicit drugs in 2023, according to federal data. That’s down 16% from 2022, when 656,000 pounds of substances were confiscated. More than 900,000 pounds were seized in 2021, according to federal data.\n\nMost of the drugs involved were marijuana (150,000 pounds) and methamphetamine (140,000 pounds).\n\nFentanyl seizures were up, however, with the 27,000 pounds in 2023 accounting for nearly twice the 14,700 pounds confiscated in 2022.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Biden indicted me because I’m his political opponent\n\n“He [Biden] indicted me because I'm his opponent.”\n\nThis is false. Trump was indicted and convicted in New York for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But there is no evidence Biden or his administration had anything to do with these charges. Since the charges were brought by the state of New York, Biden and the federal government are not party to the indictment and have no say in the charges, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“When you’re dealing with state prosecutions, it’s district attorneys elected by the voters of their jurisdiction,” said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. “That has nothing to do with the federal government.”\n\nThe idea of Biden interfering in Trump's prosecution is further weakened by the fact that the agency under his purview declined to file charges. The Justice Department had the authority to pursue a case against Trump over the hush money circumstances but chose not to do so.\n\nIn Trump's two federal cases, things are a bit different. The charges he faces cover the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents in Florida and a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from Biden in Washington.\n\nThere is no law that prohibits a president from involving himself in a federal case, experts acknowledged. But they also said Biden has kept himself separate from the prosecution of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Biden publicly vowed not to speak to Attorney General Merrick Garland about any specific case. And a key reason for the November 2022 appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel for the federal cases against Trump was to add a layer of separation between the investigation and the Biden Administration.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Food prices have 'doubled and tripled and quadrupled' under Biden\n\n\"You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.\"\n\nThe cost of food has gone up under Biden, but not to the extent Trump claimed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's all-food consumer price index shows food prices rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer behavior and led to supply chain disruptions, driving large increases in some foods. In 2022, food costs increased faster than any year since 1979, \"partly due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that affected egg and poultry prices,\" according to the department's report.\n\nBut grocery prices have stabilized over the last year, increasing by just 1.2% in the past 12 months, according to the Consumer Price Index report from March 2024.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: No sex with porn star\n\n“I didn’t have sex with a porn star.”\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nOn May 30, a New York state jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels testified at trial that she had sex with Trump in July 2006 following a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTrump has denied the sex happened.\n\nThe trial focused on a $130,000 payment that was arranged by Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Biden called African Americans ‘super predators’\n\n\"He did a crime bill. 1994. Where you called them super predators. African Americans. Super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\"\n\nWhile Biden once warned of “predators” in 1993 while advocating for a 1994 crime bill he sponsored as a senator, he never referred to African Americans as “super predators.” Rather, it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton who linked that term to the 1994 crime bill, as USA TODAY previously reported\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband in 1996, Clinton praised the 1994 crime bill for curbing gangs, saying, \"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\"\n\nNotably, she did not connect this comment to Black people.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Unprecedented numbers of murders by immigrants under Biden\n\n“People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\nWhile Trump has made a version of this claim before, there is no data that points to a wave of homicides being led by people living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA review of 2024 crime data by NBC News suggests the opposite might be true. Overall crime levels have fallen in cities where a Texas program has transported migrants from the border, the network reported in February.\n\nCrime is down year over year in Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles, according to the report. Washington experienced an increase, but officials do not attribute that spike to migrants, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump previously made a version of the claim during a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nResearch suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Corporate tax cut from 39% to 21%\n\n“The corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that.”\n\nTrump was off with one of his numbers.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower the corporate tax rate to 21%. But it started at 35%, not the 39% that Trump claimed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Trump meant with his reference to “plus beyond that.” He promised business leaders that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, The New York Times reported June 13.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Trump told Americans to inject bleach to treat COVID-19\n\n\"He said it’s not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm, you’ll be all right.\"\n\nBiden is referring to comments Trump made during a press conference early in the pandemic when he suggested disinfectants might be a possible treatment for COVID-19. But he overstates what Trump said.\n\nTrump's statement came after Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed a new study that found sunlight and household disinfectants effectively killed the virus on surfaces or in the air.\n\n\"And then I saw the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, though, never directly instructed people to inject bleach or any other disinfectant. Some states issued warnings following Trump's comment, as did Lysol, which told people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nBiden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office.\n\nBut the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier.\n\nBiden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Hunter Biden's ongoing legal troubles sure to hang over campaign\n\nIn early June, a jury found Hunter Biden – Joe Biden's son – guilty of three federal gun charges, making him the first child of a sitting president to be convicted at trial. The situation has been politically charged as it coincides with the elder Biden's ongoing campaign for reelection.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, repeatedly alleging that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nJoe Biden, who earlier said he wouldn't pardon his son, released a statement shortly after the jury's verdict was announced reiterating that position.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” he said. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nHunter Biden is expected to stand trial again in September in California, where he faces tax charges.\n\nBut even before his legal troubles, the president's son has been a frequent target for misinformation. Here are some of the claims we've already debunked:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Vast differences between Biden, Trump on gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues\n\nWith Pride Month winding down, LGBTQ+ issues – specifically, those related to gender identity – remain pivotal for voters in both parties.\n\nThe candidates have taken widely different positions on those issues, with President Joe Biden – hailed as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history – marking his first day in office with an executive order on LGBTQ rights.\n\nHis administration is challenging Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. He also unveiled in April a set of sweeping changes to Title IX rules that protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on their gender identity, but a federal judge blocked their enforcement in four states.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump vowed in May to roll back transgender student protections “on Day 1” of his presidency by reversing an executive order issued by Biden in 2021. Trump also vowed in February 2023 to punish medical professionals and facilities that provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors and said he would support banning transgender women from women’s sports.\n\nHere are some of the false claims related to LGBTQ+ issues that we’ve debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Israel’s war against Hamas sparks unrest in US as peace deal remains elusive\n\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response, plunged President Joe Biden into the second major international conflict of his term. He has been forced to balance America’s military support for Israel with calls from the left to broker a ceasefire deal as casualties mount in the Palestinian territory.\n\nBiden said in May that it is “time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,” laying out a proposal that called for Israel to cease military operations in the Gaza Strip and Hamas to release hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut a peace deal has proved elusive, leading to unrest on college campuses across the country after pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up protest camps. Former President Donald Trump cheered police crackdowns on demonstrators, calling them “a beautiful thing to watch.” But he’s also called on Israel to finish its war, saying the violence is hurting its standing among the international community.\n\n“Israel has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done,” Trump told Israeli outlet Israel Hayom in an interview posted in March. \"And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for Israel, and for everybody else.”\n\nThese are some claims related to the Israel-Hamas war that we’ve already addressed:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts spotlight on US involvement in foreign wars\n\nRussia’s war against Ukraine entered its third year in February, and the conflict has had political implications in the U.S., where pushes to approve war aid for Ukraine have been met with contentious debate over the extent of American involvement in foreign wars, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has remained committed to supporting Ukraine and its effort to join NATO, signing a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 13.\n\n“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” Biden said at a press conference about the agreement. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime … in the future.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the Oval Office, but he’s offered few details about his plan. The Washington Post reported Trump’s plan could include pressuring Ukraine to give up territory, which Ukraine has opposed.\n\nHere are some fact-checks about claims related to the war in Ukraine:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Fight over immigration reform plays out during presidential campaign\n\nImmigration has become one of the most heated topics of the 2024 election, as President Joe Biden grapples with high levels of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and former President Donald Trump vows to deport millions of migrants if re-elected.\n\nThe situation at the Southwest border – where U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.5 million migrant encounters in fiscal 2023 – prompted Biden to take executive action earlier this month to implement new restrictions on asylum access.\n\nThe action came after Republican lawmakers in February blocked an immigration bill blocked by Biden that would have revamped the country’s immigration and border policies.\n\nBiden blamed the legislation’s failure to gain traction in Congress on opposition from Trump.\n\n“Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor,” Biden said at the time. “Why? A simple reason. Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to reinstate policies from his first term in office and limit asylum access if elected in November. He also wants to institute a merit-based immigration system and deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement “to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals,” according to his campaign website.\n\nHere are some immigration-related claims we previously debunked:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Biden and Trump face age-related concerns, though both insist they're fit to serve\n\nAt 81 years old, Joe Biden is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. His age has been a concern for voters and a frequent target for critics, including Donald Trump, who often suggests Biden's age makes him unfit to be president.\n\nTrump is 78 years old, three years younger than Biden, but he has also faced criticism related to his age and mental acuity, including when he confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama in multiple campaign speeches.\n\nEither man would be the oldest person to take the oath of office if sworn in next January.\n\nIn February, Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur released a report indicating Biden wouldn't face charges for his handling of classified documents that included multiple comments about Biden's age and memory, describing him as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities,\" including memory loss. However, Biden and his administration pushed back, with Biden saying his \"memory is fine\" during a televised speech.\n\nWhile Trump's doctor said multiple times he was healthy during his presidency, there were – and still are – reports of him slurring words during his speeches. Late in his term, Trump was recorded slowly descending a ramp after a speech at at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, during which he used both hands to drink a glass of water. Trump dismissed concerns raised about his age after that incident, claiming the ramp was long, steep and \"very slippery.\"\n\nHere are a few of the age-related claims we've already addressed:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Election integrity remains key issue – even without evidence of widespread voter fraud\n\nThroughout the campaign one question has persisted: Will the candidates and their supporters trust – and abide by – the results of the election?\n\nMost recently, former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure “transparency and fairness.” The move has drawn criticism from opponents who say it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nState-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nClaims questioning the integrity of the election frequently center around a handful of predictable themes that include assertions of widespread voter fraud and election “hacking.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Trump’s conviction, pending trials loom over debate, election\n\nThe first former U.S. president convicted of a felony will take the debate stage as an ex-president for the first time in an attempt to convince voters to give him his old job back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s felony conviction and his three pending criminal trials continue to loom large over both the race and the debate – his first of the presidential election cycle – with President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election. Days before the debate, the judge in that case lifted the gag order restrictions that protected the witnesses and jurors. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 – days before the start of the Republican National Convention, during which he is expected to formally receive the party’s nomination.\n\nTrump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nTrump’s legal problems have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats. The Senate passed the bill in a late-night vote Thursday.\n\nIn his remarks Saturday, the President announced he’d host members of Congress who supported the landmark gun safety legislation at a White House event on July 11, following his return from Europe, to celebrate the new law with the families of gun violence victims.\n\nThe package represents the most significant new federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994 – though it fails to ban any weapons and falls far short of what Biden and his party had advocated for, and polls show most Americans want to see.\n\n“While this bill doesn’t do everything I want, it does include actions I’ve long called for that are going to save lives,” Biden said. “Today, we say more than ‘enough.’ We say more than enough. This time, when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential.”\n\nBiden added, “If we can reach compromise on guns, we ought to be able to reach a compromise on other critical issues, from veterans’ health care to cutting edge American innovation and so much more. I know there’s much more work to do, and I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”\n\nIt includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs. The money can be used to implement and manage red flag programs – which through court orders can temporarily prevent individuals in crisis from accessing firearms – and for other crisis intervention programs like mental health courts, drug courts and veterans courts.\n\nThis bill closes a years-old loophole in domestic violence law – the “boyfriend loophole” – which barred individuals who have been convicted of domestic violence crimes against spouses, partners with whom they shared children or partners with whom they cohabitated from having guns. Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met. He said their activism in the face of loss was a difference-maker.\n\n“I especially want to thank the families that Jill and I have (met), many of whom we sat with for hours on end, across the country. There’s so many we’ve gotten to know who’ve lost their soul to an epidemic of gun violence. They’ve lost their child, their husband, their wife,” Biden said.\n\n“Nothing is going to fill that void in their hearts. But they led the way so other families will not have the experience and the pain and trauma they’ve had to live through.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Saturday.", "authors": ["Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/06/25"}]}

But “allegations against the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh triggered” her recollection, according the The Guardian, which has seen extracts of the new book.\n\nShe “does not name the senator or his party or give any other clues as to his identity”, the paper said.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Michigan-born Abedin, who grew up in Saudi Arabia, wrote that the event was like being at “an Arab wedding back home”.\n\nShe goes on to describe a Washington dinner attended by “a few senators and their aides”. Clinton was not present.\n\n“I ended up walking out with one of the senators, and soon we stopped in front of his building and he invited me in for coffee,” Abedin continued. “Once inside, he told me to make myself comfortable on the couch.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n“Then, in an instant, it all changed. He plopped down to my right, put his left arm around my shoulder, and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth, pressing me back on the sofa.\n\n“I was so utterly shocked, I pushed him away. All I wanted was for the last ten seconds to be erased.”\n\nThe senator is then said to have apologised, claiming that he “misread” her “all this time”.\n\nAbedin wrote that she avoided the unnamed senator “for a few days” before running into him on Capitol Hill. She said that she nodded when he asked if they were still friends, before Clinton joined them, “as if she knew I needed rescuing even though I’d told her nothing about that night”.\n\nIn an interview with New York-based television network CBS on Sunday, Abedin said the senator “kissed me in a very... shocking way”. Asked whether she felt she was a victim of sexual assault, she replied: “I'm suggesting that I was in an uncomfortable situation with a senator and I didn't know how to deal with it and I buried the whole experience.”\n\n‘Conveniently remembering’\n\nAbedin has claimed that allegations made by Professor Christine Blasey Ford against then Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in 2018 “dredged up” her “memory of her own alleged assault”, the Daily Beast said.\n\nIn the memoir extract seen by The Guardian, she wrote that she had “buried the incident” until Blasey Ford was “being accused of ‘conveniently’ remembering” her alleged assault by Kavanaugh – an allegation he denied.\n\n“Kavanaugh became a leading symbol of the #MeToo era, in which allegations of sexual misconduct and assault have brought down prominent men,” said the paper. But “Republicans did not waver” in their support and he was “duly confirmed to the court”.\n\nAbedin is no stranger to #MeToo-related controversy. The book also details “her anger at her ex-husband, former Democratic New York congressman Anthony Weiner, whose career was destroyed by sex scandals”, the BBC said.\n\nWeiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after admitting to using his public Twitter account to send an indecent image to a woman who was following him on the social media site. The row erupted after he accidentally posted the image publicly.\n\nHe was then drawn into the spotlight again in 2013 while taking part in the New York City mayoral race. The New York Post revealed that had sent explicit pictures to a woman under the alias “Carlos Danger”, before reporting that he had also sent another woman “a lurid crotch shot with his toddler son in the picture”.\n\nFollowing the second sexting scandal, Abedin released a statement saying that “after long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband”.\n\nWeiner became mired in scandal again in September 2016, when he was accused of engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina. After pleading guilty to a charge of sending obscene material to a minor, the former congressman was sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to register as a sex offender.\n\nIn an extract of Abedin’s memoir published in Vogue, she wrote that after Weiner admitted sending explicit images to other women back in 2011, she had “felt something explode inside my chest, and suddenly it was hard to breathe”.\n\n“I was simultaneously filled with rage and stunned to my core. It felt like a bolt of lightning had struck me and run straight through my body,” she added.\n\nHowever, she and Weiner, “who have reportedly separated but are not yet divorced”, still appear to be on speaking terms, said the Daily Mail.\n\nThe pair “have occasionally been seen out together since they filed for divorce in 2017” and were “spotted shopping in New York City” this week, the paper reported.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Catherine Garcia", "Peter Weber", "Sorcha Bradley", "David Faris", "Rafi Schwartz"], "publish_date": "2021/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/09/04/supreme-court-justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-book/75075955007/", "title": "Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson speaking out on book ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Ketanji Brown Jackson was in elementary school when her mother enrolled the future Supreme Court justice in a public speaking program.\n\n“She wanted me to get out there and use my voice,” Jackson told an audience of about 2,000 which greeted her with a standing ovation when she walked onto the Kennedy Center’s concert hall stage Wednesday night.\n\nHer voice has been heard a lot recently.\n\nJackson, the high court’s most junior justice, is on a media blitz to promote her new memoir, “Lovely One.”\n\nBecoming the first Black woman Supreme Court justice in 2022 had generated a wave of curiosity about the details of her life, she wrote in the book.\n\nAfter her nomination, reporters dug into her genealogy – and that of her husband’s, whose earliest ancestors crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower while Jackson’s forebears had been brought from Africa in chains.\n\nJackson was inundated by a wave of letters as well as by personalized artworks and handicrafts, including a crocheted doll in her likeness that played a recording of part of Jackson’s post-confirmation remarks: “I have now achieved something far beyond anything that my grandparents could possibly ever imagined.”\n\nJackson wrote that she understood why people would want to know how she got to the highest court in the land – and she wanted to be the one to tell that story.\n\nThe memoir describes the pride in her African heritage installed by her parents – including her name, Ketanji Onyika, which means “ means “lovely one” in an African dialect -- along with a drive to never give up.\n\n“I distinctly remember thinking that other parents seemed so much more cuddly than mine,” she wrote about their insistence that nothing was too hard to accomplish if she was willing to work for it.\n\nDescribing her personal journey\n\nWhile detailing her climb up the success ladder, she writes about the impact of being one of the few Black students in her classrooms, her interracial marriage to a surgeon, the difficulty of being a new mother, and of raising a daughter with autism.\n\nJackson was worried that the Supreme Court spotlight would bring unwanted attention to her children, giving both daughters a chance to tell her if they would prefer that she stay on the D.C.

The essay included a new sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh, but it originally did not include the detail that the unnamed alleged victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the alleged incident.\n\nWhat The New York Times left out\n\nBy Paul Janensch\n\nOn Sunday morning, I pulled out the Sunday Review section of The New York Times.\n\nOn page 2, I saw a big spread about past sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh when his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was under consideration by the Senate. It was by Times staffers Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, authors of the forthcoming book \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\" from which this essay was adapted.\n\nAfter reading it, I thought the essay was missing something important.\n\nThe first 10 paragraphs were devoted mostly to Deborah Ramirez, who went to Yale when Kavanaugh was a student there, and also to Christine Blasey Ford, who attended a Washington-area secondary school near his.\n\nBoth have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Ford testified before the Senate’s Judiciary Committee. Ramirez was interviewed by the FBI.\n\nWhat did the essay tell me that I had not already read or heard? Not much, until the 11th paragraph, which said:\n\n“We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the FBI about this account, but the FBI did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.”\n\nDemocrats' big miscalculation: Conservative women like me won't abandon Brett Kavanaugh\n\nWhoa! Another woman who may make an accusation against Kavanaugh? Did the authors interview the female student? I read the essay to the end, but it did not say.\n\nIn Washington, where the essay was seen by many online, the reference to “a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh” made a big splash.\n\nLeading Democrats called for Kavanaugh's impeachment. President Donald Trump tweeted, \"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel.\"\n\nCommentators critical of The Times essay learned that the new book provides more information about the “previously unreported story.” In the book, the authors say that the woman declined to be interviewed about any incident with Kavanaugh, and that “several of her friends said she does not recall it.”\n\nWhen I was a newspaper reporter and editor, I made sure crucial information like this was in the story.\n\nAfter the essay was posted online and published in the newspaper’s early print edition, The Times finally corrected its mistake.\n\nA sentence was added to the paragraph about the “previously unreported story.” It says, “The female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.”\n\nAn editors’ note is attached to the end of the revised story:\n\n“An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate,” it says, repeating what Stier claimed he witnessed.\n\nThe editors’ note goes on to say: “The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.”\n\nAm I satisfied? No.\n\nThe “earlier version of this article” never should have appeared in The New York Times.\n\nPaul Janensch, a seasonal resident of Vero Beach, Florida, was a newspaper editor and taught journalism at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. This column originally appeared in the TCPalm.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nMimi Rocah, USA TODAY: \"The new information, reported by The New York Times, raises fresh questions about whether Kavanaugh lied in his confirmation hearings about the sexual assault allegations and other matters (very possibly), whether his testimony rises to the level of criminal perjury (maybe) and whether he is fit to continue to be seated on the Supreme Court. ... It is crucially important to the integrity of our judicial system, not only that all of the allegations against Kavanaugh be thoroughly investigated but also that the public understands who limited the investigation and how. This was never just about Kavanaugh or a seat on the Supreme Court. This is a lens for whether our elected officials are capable of listening to women and sexual assault survivors.\"\n\nNoah Rothman, Commentary: \"Not only did The Times reporters manage to further exculpate Kavanaugh by impugning the credibility of his accusers, it further undermined Ford’s claims by revealing that her star character witness, Leland Keyser, does not believe her friend was assaulted by the justice. ... The strained efforts by politicians and media outlets to insist that the absence of evidence against Kavanaugh amounts to an indictment of his conduct and character has spilt the Democratic Party, unified their opposition, energized Republican voters, and sacrificed the credibility of the left-leaning news outlets that dedicated themselves to the promotion of a perfidious narrative over the plain and simple truths of the case.\"\n\nKate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, The Atlantic: \"As mothers of daughters, we were prone to believe and support the women who spoke up. As mothers of sons, we had to imagine what it would be like if the men we loved were wrongly charged with these offenses. As people, our gut reaction was that the allegations of Ford and Ramirez from the past rang true. As reporters, we uncovered nothing to suggest that Kavanaugh has mistreated women in the years since. Ultimately, we combined our notebooks with our common sense and came to believe an utterly human narrative: that Ford and Ramirez were mistreated by Kavanaugh when he was a teenager, and that Kavanaugh over the next 35 years became a better person. We come to this complicated, seemingly contradictory, and perhaps unsatisfying conclusion based on the facts as we found them.\"\n\nBecket Adams, Washington Examiner: \"The press in the United States suffers from a crisis of credibility. It is almost entirely self-inflicted. ... Newsrooms talk a big game these days about the pressure they are under operating in a world where the president of the United States is openly hostile to the press. Journalists and commentators complain a lot about how difficult it is to reach audiences when their credibility is challenged daily by the White House. But I assure you, nothing this president does or says comes close to matching the wounds the press inflicts on itself with its slipshod, ham-fisted brand of politically skewed reporting. No one forced The Times to misreport the allegations against Kavanaugh. No one forced The Times to omit crucial context. The paper did that all on its own.\"\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nThe alleged \"victim\" does not even remember this happening. This is the most bald-faced, blatant slam job I've ever seen.

Late Thursday, Mary Trump's legal team filed her affidavit and a 70-page brief seeking to vacate that restraining order on First Amendment grounds.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n\"Robert Trump is pursuing this unlawful prior restraint on core political speech because the President and his family do not want the American people to hear Mary Trump’s story,\" the brief opened. \"The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids prior restraints against the publication of books, especially books comprising core political speech relating to a sitting president running for reelection.\"\n\nIt is not clear when a decision will be made on this aspect of the case but probably not until next week at the earliest. The courts are closed Friday for the July 4 holiday.\n\nRobert Trump argues in his lawsuit that Mary Trump was part of a settlement almost 20 years ago that included a confidentiality clause explicitly saying members of the family would not “publish any account concerning the litigation or their relationship,” unless they all agreed.\n\nMary Trump, in her affidavit, said she has not received any money from the settlement since April 2001, and that she agreed to it after relying on asset valuations of her grandfather's estate that she now believes were inaccurate based on New York Times reporting. Moreover, her uncles and aunt have been talking in public about the family for years without seeking her permission.\n\n\"I never believed that the Settlement Agreement resolving discrete financial disputes\n\ncould possibly restrict me from telling the story of my life or publishing a book discussing anything contained in the Book,\" she said. \"Moreover, my uncle, the President, has spoken out about our family and the will dispute on numerous occasions.\"\n\nThursday night on CNN’s “Cuomo Prime Time,” Mary Trump’s attorney, Ted Boutrous, argued to host Chris Cuomo that the settlement agreement silencing Mary Trump is null and void because it was the product of fraud. “President Trump and his family didn’t disclose the truth about the assets that were involved in the agreement.”\n\nBoutrous also argued that Mary Trump’s book is protected by the First Amendment, which precludes prior restraints. “The Supreme Court has never upheld one in the context of a speech that involves public concern. And this is speech in a book that is of utmost public concern.”\n\nBoutrous said he would filing a brief with the court Thursday night arguing their legal position.\n\nWhile Boutrous would not disclose any of the revelations contained within the book, he said, “Mary Trump had an up close and personal look at President Trump for many, many years and has an insight into his character.\" He added, \"She has information that I think will shed a lot of light on what made him the person he is and that will help all of us think about whether he is the right person to be president.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to some of the dozen lawyers listed as representing the publisher, Mary Trump or Robert Trump to discuss the status of the case. So far, none have responded.\n\nBut Katie Townsend, legal director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, who filed a friend-of-the court brief in the case, told USA TODAY the case is \"very unusual.\" If Mary Trump is still under a restraining order, how can she participate in the promotion of her book?\n\n\"It's a good question,\" Townsend said. \"We were shocked by the trial court issuing a temporary restraining order. We argue in our brief that it's prior restraint\" and thus counter to the First Amendment.\n\nIn the meantime, Simon & Schuster intends to proceed with its plans for publishing the book, scheduled for July 28, according to Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for the publisher.\n\nTownsend says that Mary Trump's alleged contractual obligations don't apply to Simon & Schuster and that's why the appellate court ruled as it did. Even if Mary Trump breached a contract, the courts typically would call for her to pay damages later, not be restrained from speaking.\n\n\"When there is a breach of contract, that does not stop speech,\" Townsend said. \"There's a strong preferences in the law for post-publication remedies rather than prior restraint.\"\n\nSimon & Schuster has said thousands of copies of the 75,000-copy first run of the book have already been sent to bookstores and others. According to the publisher, the book is a \"revelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J. Trump and the toxic family that made him.\"\n\nThe book's description says Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, \"shines a bright light on the dark history of their family in order to explain how her uncle became the man who now threatens the world’s health, economic security, and social fabric.\"\n\nMary Trump, 55, is the niece of both Trump brothers as the daughter of their elder brother, the late Fred Trump Jr.\n\nThe appeals ruling restrained Mary Trump and any agent of hers from distributing the book, but the court made clear it did not consider Simon & Schuster to be an agent, though that issue could be decided in further proceedings at the lower court.\n\n“The evidence submitted is insufficient for this Court to determine whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed in establishing that claim,\" the appeals court said.\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Simon and Schuster said it was gratified with the ruling, which it said would let Mary Trump tell her story. The publisher said the book was of “great interest and importance to the national discourse that fully deserves to be published for the benefit of the American public.\"\n\nIt added: “As all know, there are well-established precedents against prior restraint and pre-publication injunctions, and we remain confident that the preliminary injunction will be denied.\"\n\nBoutrous, Mary Trump's lawyer, said in a statement it was “very good news that the prior restraint against Simon & Schuster has been vacated. He added that he believed a similar finding was necessary for Mary Trump, “based on the First Amendment and basic contract law.”\n\nCharles Harder, lead lawyer for Robert Trump, did not return messages about the appellate ruling or his next legal moves in the case.\n\nRobert Trump's first attempt to halt the book was rejected last week by a New York City judge. Surrogate's Court Judge Peter Kelly said the claims were not appropriate for his court, where disputes over estate matters are settled.\n\nThe case then moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where Supreme Court Judge Hal Greenwald in Dutchess County granted Robert Trump the temporary restraining order he sought and his request for a preliminary injunction.\n\nNow that the appellate court has ruled, the case returns to Greenwald.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press, Andrea Mandell, Barbara VanDenburgh, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2023/12/21/alex-murdaugh-supreme-court-justice-murder-jean-hoefer-toal-judge-clifton-newman-walterboro-hampton/71992859007/", "title": "Murdaugh to face first female SC Supreme Court Justice for new trial", "text": "South Carolina's most notorious modern criminal, a disbarred attorney who has made Palmetto State history with a multi-million dollar financial crime spree capped off by two murders, will now stand before a judge who has her place in state history.\n\nOn Dec. 18, the Supreme Court of South Carolina ordered that Jean Hoefer Toal, a retired Chief Justice of the S.C. Supreme Court, will assume jurisdiction over all lower court matters related to Murdaugh's recent murder convictions and a pending motion for a new trial.\n\nToal is the first woman and the first Roman Catholic to serve as a Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nThe order, signed by Donald W.

Jean Hoefer Toal's biography, credentials\n\nThe following information is available on the S.C. Judicial Branch biographical webpage at sccourts.org:\n\nChief Justice Jean Hoefer Toal began her service as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of South Carolina on March 17, 1988, becoming the first woman to serve as a Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court. She was re-elected in February of 1996 and was installed as Chief Justice on March 23, 2000, for the balance of the term of her predecessor, which expired June 30, 2004. She was re-elected as Chief Justice in February of 2004 and again in February of 2014, each time for 10-year terms.\n\nShe is the first native Columbian and first Roman Catholic to serve on South Carolina's highest court.\n\nBorn August 11, 1943, in Columbia, South Carolina, she attended parochial school and public school in Columbia and graduated from Dreher High School in 1961 where she was recognized as the state's top debater.\n\nChief Justice Toal received her bachelor of arts degree in philosophy in 1965 from Agnes Scott College where she served on the Judicial Council, and National Supervisory Board of the U.S. National Student Association and played goalie for the field hockey team. She received her J.D. degree in 1968 from the University of South Carolina School of Law where she served as managing editor, leading articles editor and book review editor of the South Carolina Law Review. She is a member of the Order of the Coif, Mortar Board and Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nChief Justice Toal practiced law for 20 years before her election to the South Carolina Supreme Court, first as an associate with the Haynsworth Law Firm in Greenville, and then as an associate and partner with Belser, Baker, Barwick, Ravenel, Toal & Bender in Columbia. When she was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1968, women comprised less than one percent of the licensed lawyers in South Carolina. Now almost 20 percent of South Carolina's lawyers are women.\n\nAs a lawyer, she appeared frequently in all levels of trial and appellate courts in South Carolina. She also had considerable experience as a litigator in the United States District Court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and made one appearance as co-counsel before the United States Supreme Court. Her 20 years as a practicing lawyer included a balance of plaintiff and defense work, criminal trial work, and complex constitutional litigation. She wrote many trial and appellate briefs at all court levels. She also had considerable administrative law experience in litigation involving environmental matters, federal and state procurement, hospital certificates of need, employment matters and election matters.\n\nIn addition to practicing law, Chief Justice Toal utilized her law degree in public service. Beginning in 1975 she served in the South Carolina House of Representatives representing Richland County for 13 years. She was the first woman in South Carolina to chair a standing committee of the House of Representatives. She served as Chairman of the House Rules Committee and Chairman of the Constitutional Laws Sub-Committee of the House Judiciary Committee. Her legislative service included floor leadership of complex legislation in the fields of constitutional law, utility regulation, criminal law, the structure of local government, budgetary matters, the structure of the judicial system, banking and finance legislation, corporate law, tort claims, workers' compensation, freedom of information act and environmental law.\n\nDuring her 27 years on the Supreme Court, Justice Toal has written opinions addressing the full range of issues both criminal and civil which come before her Court. Also, she and two of her law clerks have authored a book entitled Appellate Practice in South Carolina.\n\nIn addition to her work on the bench, Chief Justice Toal has become the chief advocate for South Carolina's Judicial Automation Project. Under her leadership, technology initiatives are being integrated into the eight levels of the South Carolina court system. Some of the technology projects include high-speed network connectivity to all 46 county courthouses and an online, statewide case management system. Because of her efforts in promoting technology as a way to create a more efficient court system, Chief Justice Toal was recognized by Government Technology magazine as one of the 2002 \"Top 25 Doers, Dreamers & Drivers\" of technology in government.\n\nShe is a member of the Richland County, South Carolina and American Bar Associations, the South Carolina Women Lawyers Association, the National Association of Women Judges, and the John Belton O'Neall Inn of Court. She serves on the Board of Trustees of the American Inns of Court Foundation, is Past President of the Conference of Chief Justices, and is Past Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Center for State Courts.\n\nChief Justice Toal received the South Carolina Trial Lawyers Outstanding Contribution to Justice Award in 1995. She has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees by the University of South Carolina, Francis Marion University, The Citadel, Columbia College, College of Charleston, Charleston School of Law and Converse College.\n\nIn 2004, Chief Justice Toal received the prestigious Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award from the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession. The award, named in honor of the first woman lawyer in the United States, is given annually to five women who have achieved professional excellence in their field and have actively advanced the status of women within the legal community.\n\nIn 2011, Chief Justice Toal was named the first recipient of the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) Sandra Day O'Connor Award for the Advancement of Civics Education. NCSC established the award in 2010 to honor an organization, court, or individual who has promoted, inspired, improved, or led an innovation or accomplishment in the field of civics education. Chief Justice Toal was instrumental in making South Carolina one of the first pilot states for Justice O'Connor's iCivics web-based interactive civics education program for students, and she has encouraged and supported the use of \"Justice Case Files,\" a graphic novel series developed by the NCSC that teaches students how the courts work.\n\nUnder Chief Justice Toal's leadership, the South Carolina Judiciary has a long history of supporting civics education. In addition to iCivics and the \"Justice Case Files\" series, South Carolina has implemented three state civics programs:\n\nThe Class Action Program brings middle- and high-school students to the state Supreme Court to hear oral arguments.\n\nThe Case of the Month Program provides streaming video of a case argued before the state Supreme Court. Students are allowed to review the briefs submitted for the case and watch the proceedings.\n\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court Institute, which is held for middle- and high-school social-studies teachers to teach them how to bring law to life for their students.\n\nChief Justice Toal is a member of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Columbia where she serves as a lector.\n\nChief Justice Toal is married to her law school classmate, William T. Toal, of Johnson, Toal & Battiste. Chief Justice Toal and Bill were the only husband-wife team to serve as editor and managing editor of the South Carolina Law Review. They live in Columbia and have two daughters, Jean Toal Eisen, a 1993 Yale graduate who serves on the United States Senate Appropriations Committee Staff at the appointment of Senator Barbara Mikulski; Lilla Patrick Toal Mandsager, a 2003 bachelor of arts, 2005 master of arts graduate of Stanford University; one grandson, Patrick Eisen; and one granddaughter, Ruth Margaret Mandsager. Chief Justice Toal is an avid gardener, golfer and sports fan who maintains a shrine in her den to her beloved Atlanta Braves and Carolina Gamecocks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/21"}]}

Amazon does deliver a portion of its packages through UPS, but its use of the company has been waning.\n\nThough Amazon is expected to fare better than smaller retailers if UPS Teamsters strike, logistics experts warn that some Amazon deliveries may take longer in rural areas that rely more heavily on UPS. Others say a strike could influence union organization among Amazon delivery drivers.\n\n\"Just in general, in the e-commerce space, people need to be expecting more delivery delays,\" said Jason Miller, interim chairperson for the department of supply chain management at Michigan State University. “Even with Amazon, even for folks who get the Amazon deliveries from the post office, there could be some delays.”\n\nHow will the UPS strike affect Amazon shoppers?\n\nOf the 8 billion parcels shipped by Amazon last year, 60% were sent through Amazon’s logistics network, according to shipping technology company Pitney Bowes.\n\nThat leaves 40% – or about 3.2 billion packages – shipped by other carriers. About 28% was shipped by the United States Postal Service and 8% by UPS, according to Pitney Bowes.\n\nWhile UPS’s 160,000 nonunion employees are expected to work during a strike, a work stoppage from its 340,000 Teamster members means the company would be able to handle just a fraction of the nearly 25 million packages it typically delivers daily. Competitors like FedEx and the postal service could also see delivery times slow if the carriers get inundated with additional demand from UPS customers.\n\nAmazon has “a lot more ability to move orders in and around their network,” said Gregg Zegras, executive vice president of Pitney Bowes. “That said, they rely pretty heavily on a combination of the USPS and UPS.”\n\nThat could affect delivery times for Amazon shoppers in rural areas, who are more likely to have their packages delivered via UPS or the Postal Service.\n\n\"Amazon's delivery service providers, the Amazon vans, those are more for denser urban areas where you have a lot more package density, so deliveries per square mile,\" Miller said. \"So your Amazon shoppers in rural areas, and just in general areas that have less customer density, they're the ones that are most likely to be affected.\"\n\nPurchasing from third-party sellers on Amazon also could take more time because some handle their own shipping, Miller said. That means \"there's a good chance that they could be using UPS.\"\n\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly said the company has been working to streamline its network and expects record Prime delivery speeds this year.\n\nWhat would a strike mean for unionization efforts at Amazon?\n\nAmid the ramp-up to a possible UPS strike, Teamsters leaders have been clear that they have their eyes on Amazon.\n\nLast year, the Teamsters launched an Amazon Divison dedicated to organizing Amazon employees, with General President Sean O’Brien noting that the division offers a network of resources to all Amazon workers ‒ including those \"behind the wheel of any truck.\"\n\nThe division already has seen some success. Earlier this year, 84 Amazon drivers and dispatchers working with Battle-Tested Strategies, an Amazon delivery service partner, organized with Teamsters Local 396 in Los Angeles. It was the first union contract to cover Amazon delivery network workers.\n\nO’Brien called the contract “just the beginning” in a press release and said Amazon had “better pay attention because there’s more to come.”\n\nA UPS strike could help pave the way for further organization efforts at Amazon, accordion to Robert Anthony Bruno, a professor at the University of Illinois’ School of Labor and Employment Relations.\n\n“I think it would have an enormous effect on Amazon,” he said. “Whatever agreement they got at UPS would serve as a platform to take to Amazon workers.”\n\nThe efforts would come amid rising public support for unionization, with 2022 Gallup data showing Americans' support for unions is at its highest point since 1965. That could bode well for unionization efforts at companies like Amazon, especially if they see UPS Teamsters pull off what would be the largest single employer strike in U.S. history.\n\nWhite House on UPS:White House 'confident' UPS, Teamsters will reach agreement ahead of potential workers strike\n\n\"Striking is contagious,\" said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of Labor Education Research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University. Other workers might say \"'If they can do it, we can do it.'\"\n\nBut because Amazon's logistics network is made up of more than 1,500 independent delivery service partners that contract with Amazon ‒ meaning many of Amazon's drivers are not technically Amazon employees ‒ organization among drivers is expected to be difficult.\n\n“The delivery service providers are independent of Amazon, and they're going to be spread out among hundreds of companies. And so that effectively makes unionization broadly, I think, nearly impossible,” Miller said.\n\nUnionization efforts aside, Amazon may need to prepare for changes once Teamsters and UPS finalize their new contract.\n\n“All the things that Teamsters has achieved through their negotiations with (UPS) thus far will create a new standard as it relates to how delivery workers are treated,” said Terry Esper, a logistics professor at The Ohio State University. “Amazon is going to have to react to that in some capacity.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/10/26/pharmacy-chains-dangerous-conditions-medication-errors/71153960007/", "title": "Pharmacy chains ignored pleas to fix broken system. Now it's in revolt", "text": "Pharmacists with the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain felt dangerously burned out.\n\nIt was August 2020. The pandemic was in full swing, straining an already weary workforce hit by a decade of relentless budget cuts and rising demands.\n\nOne by one, the pharmacists dialed into a weekly conference call with their boss. He could have empathized with them or addressed the reality of their pressure-cooker environment – one that breeds medication errors and creates missed opportunities to prevent potentially deadly mistakes.\n\nInstead, CVS District Leader Khalil Haidar turned up the heat. He harped on his Texas-and-Louisiana-based team to hit corporate quotas: Sell more store memberships. Push for more prescription pickups. Vaccinate more people. He threatened discipline and staff cuts unless pharmacists convinced at least five customers that week to get a flu shot before flu season had even officially started.\n\n“If you get your goal, nobody will come after you,\" Haidar said on the call, one of several recorded and shared with USA TODAY. \"And many patients, they are ignorant. They don’t know what the flu is ... How are you going to convince them? How can you persuade them? That’s your job as a pharmacist.”\n\nPharmacists take an oath to hold patient safety in the highest regard when preparing and dispensing medication. But rising pressures inside the nation’s largest retail chains have forced pharmacists to choose between that oath and their job.\n\nThe situation was bad before the pandemic. COVID-19 made it worse. It has only gone downhill since then. Frustrations boiled over this autumn in a series of high-profile walkouts that left a string of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies shuttered or short-staffed. Those actions might have caught consumers off guard. But inside the troubled industry, it was the clarion call of a beleaguered workforce pushed to the brink.\n\nCorporations like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart have consistently slashed pharmacy staffing levels while simultaneously saddling their frontline workers with a burgeoning list of additional duties.\n\nStores that a decade ago might have had two pharmacists and six pharmacy technicians filling an average of 500 prescriptions a day now may have half the staff and an even higher prescription volume – plus an endless crush of vaccine appointments, rapid tests and patient consultation calls.\n\nEvery task is timed and measured against corporate goals that reward speed and profits. Staff who do not fill prescriptions fast enough, answer the phones quickly enough or drum up enough vaccination business can face discipline, reassignment or termination.\n\nPharmacists said it’s nearly impossible to meet all the demands without cutting corners, and when corners get cut, patients can get hurt.\n\n“The public’s health is in danger,” said Oklahoma City pharmacist Bled Tanoe, who quit her job at Walgreens in August 2021 over what she considered unsafe staffing levels and an emphasis on hitting corporate targets. “The incidents of error are multiplied by infinity.”\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed four dozen current and former retail pharmacists from different chains across the nation and spoke with industry leaders, patient advocates and patients harmed by pharmacy errors. Many pharmacists spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs.\n\nThe media organization also reviewed more than 100 emails from chain pharmacists sharing their concerns; inspected internal emails, text messages, metric score sheets and coaching notes; and listened to more than five hours of recorded conference calls.\n\nThese interviews, audio recordings and documents – along with dozens of pharmacist workplace surveys, task force studies and state board of pharmacy reports – add up to a prescription for disaster.\n\n“I could cry as to what’s happening in my profession,” said Daniel A. Hussar, a professor and dean emeritus at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he taught for 52 years before retiring in 2018 to focus on his family and his blog, The Pharmacist Activist.\n\nHussar lamented the transformation of a once-vaunted career into the equivalent of a fast-food job whose workers are pressured to upsell every customer and race through every order. Mistakes in that environment are not only common, he said, they’re potentially fatal.\n\n“At corporations like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid – the huge pharmacies – errors are a cost of doing business,” Hussar said. “I don’t think the boards of pharmacy or the colleges of pharmacy or the professional associations are doing enough to address the issues.”\n\nFor years, pharmacists have reported these problems to their state boards, complained to their professional organizations and warned the media. The New York Times wrote about how the dangerous workload imperils patient safety just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.\n\nPromises were made and broken – documented by pharmacists themselves in state surveys that followed.\n\nIn California, 91% of chain pharmacists surveyed by the state Board of Pharmacy in 2021 said they lacked the staff needed to ensure adequate patient care. More than half of pharmacists polled by the Kansas Board of Pharmacy in 2022 said they didn’t feel they could perform their jobs safely; the biggest reasons cited were a lack of adequate staffing and employer-imposed metrics, like filling a specific number of prescriptions a day or providing service to customers within a set time.\n\nHundreds of pharmacists in Ohio responded to a 2020 callout from their state board about the toll of their workload on patient safety in a report made public in the next year.\n\n“I feel a mistake is breathing down my neck as I try to manage all the tasks that I am asked to perform,” one wrote. Another said they had left the profession because “the environment was set up for me to fail.”\n\nState regulatory bodies overseeing pharmacies have for years refused to intervene. Their role is mainly to protect consumers, not pharmacists, and they traditionally considered many of these complaints – staffing, metrics, workload – outside their purview. They were seen as business decisions, not consumer safety issues, said Karen Winslow, interim executive director of the Virginia Pharmacy Association.\n\nThat’s starting to change, but not without a fight.\n\nOhio proposed a series of rules this year aimed at improving pharmacy working conditions. Among them: A ban on quotas and requirements for sufficient staffing. The rules are currently pending a vote amid overwhelming support from pharmacists and opposition from retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS.\n\n“The Board should stay focused on the regulation of the practice of pharmacy rather than the business of pharmacy,” wrote CVS Director of Regulatory Affairs John Long in opposing an early version of Ohio’s rules last year.\n\nVirginia passed emergency regulations in late September also banning production quotas and bolstering pharmacy staffing. Those rules are in effect until March 2025, giving the state time to develop and pass more permanent measures.\n\nEnforcing these rules could prove challenging. California, one of the first states to outlaw pharmacy production quotas and mandate minimum staffing, is coping with routine violations by retail pharmacies that then fail to provide records to inspectors seeking to verify complaints, state Board of Pharmacy minutes show.\n\nProfessional associations, meanwhile, have earned their members’ scorn for hosting workshops on resiliency rather than advocating for better working conditions. Many pharmacists told USA TODAY they feel like no one stands up for them.\n\nThat, too, is starting to change. In the wake of the CVS walkouts last month, the new head of the American Pharmacists Association, the industry’s largest professional organization, flew to Kansas City to meet with the organizers and committed to more aggressive leadership on these issues.\n\n“The APhA has been focused on longer-term fixes, and what we’ve heard loud and clear is we need to focus on the acute problems,” said Michael Hogue, the association’s chief executive officer and executive vice president. “That’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid for comment.\n\nRepresentatives of CVS and Walgreens generally acknowledged the challenges their pharmacists have faced in recent years but denied allegations of dangerous working conditions. They said goal-based metrics on measurable objectives such as quick prescription turnarounds, short telephone hold times and vaccination volumes are standard within the industry and meant to assess quality rather than penalize staff.\n\nCVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart all emphasized their commitments to patient safety and described their various efforts to continually reduce error rates.\n\n“Patient safety is our highest priority,” Amy Thibault, CVS Pharmacy’s lead director of external communications, told USA TODAY. “Our more than 30,000 CVS pharmacists approach this responsibility with seriousness and dedication and we work hard to earn the trust of our pharmacy patients.”\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Walmart also said they have invested in new technologies to streamline services, increased wages to better recruit and retain staff, and rolled out new initiatives to support their teams and reduce their workloads.\n\nThe major chains now provide half-hour lunch breaks for staff. Many also recently announced reduced pharmacy hours at locations nationwide. Walmart spokesman Tyler Thomason said reduced operating hours promote a “better work/life balance.”\n\nBut pharmacists told USA TODAY their workloads remain the same and that they’re pressured to work through lunch and stay late to finish everything. At locations where hours were cut, many pharmacists said, they’ve seen their salaries decrease accordingly.\n\n“I’ve given the company thousands and thousands of dollars in free labor,” said a CVS pharmacist who was on Haidar’s team during the pandemic-era conference calls. “Our bosses can log into the computer any time and tell how far behind we are. They will send group texts and say, ‘I see you’re trending behind. What are your plans to finish it tonight?’ Very intimidating comments. You fear for your job all the time.”\n\nHaidar, who now leads a different team, told USA TODAY the recordings must have been altered and that he never threatened staff with discipline for falling short of vaccination goals. He also said they are not an accurate depiction of his leadership. When asked if he would like to listen to the recordings, Haidar declined.\n\nMichael DeAngelis, CVS’ executive director of corporate communications, said it is not the company’s “policy or practice to penalize pharmacy teams regarding the number of vaccinations they administer” and that it “is committed to compensating our colleagues appropriately for the hours they work.”\n\nDeAngelis also said CVS recently reduced its pharmacy metrics by 50%, but he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWalgreens announced last year the complete elimination of performance-based metrics, the only major chain to have taken such a step. But interviews with pharmacists and documents provided to USA TODAY show the company continues to push staff to hit unrealistic goals.\n\nOne Walgreens pharmacist said she was reprimanded earlier this month for taking too long to verify prescriptions, even though her extra diligence had caught several serious mistakes.\n\nAccording to notes from her coaching session, shared with USA TODAY, she should take less than 30 seconds to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of every prescription, in addition to checking for potential problems like drug allergies or interactions.\n\n“I pray every day that I don’t miss something or cause a patient harm,” said the Tennessee-based pharmacist, who estimates she handles several hundred prescriptions daily. “I feel guilty knowing that I would want someone to double check the math on a prescription of antibiotics for my child, but I don’t have time to do that for their child.”\n\nMedication errors: A pharmacist's worst nightmare\n\nMedication errors are a pharmacist’s worst nightmare. Many told USA TODAY they lie awake at night wondering if, in their haste, they made a mistake that might hurt or kill someone.\n\nIn May 2021, that someone was Brenden Fisher.\n\nThe Sarasota, Florida, child overdosed on a newly prescribed anti-seizure medication after the CVS pharmacy near his home dispensed the drug with the wrong instructions on the label.\n\nBy the third dose, Brenden was lethargic, dazed and struggling to breathe. His parents, Paris Bean and Jason Fisher, rushed their then-2-year-old to the hospital, thinking he was dying.\n\nHospital staff didn’t know what was wrong with him, Bean recalled, until a nurse asked if he was taking his 1.2 ml of levetiracetam twice daily.\n\nWhen Bean told her the instructions said to give him 7.5 ml, “you could almost hear her jaw drop,” Bean recalled. “She said, ‘Did you give that to him?’ And I said, ‘Yes. Is that why we’re here?’ She said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised.’”\n\nBrenden still suffers from a full-body tic he first developed during the incident, his parents said. Dozens of times a day, he will suddenly stop whatever he is doing, clasp his hands together, clench his jaw and tense every muscle in his body while staring off into space. Each episode lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds.\n\nHis parents haven’t been able to definitively link the tic to the overdose, but they said they have no other explanation for it.\n\nAnti-seizure medications like levetiracetam depress the central nervous system, Hussar said. Because nerves tell muscles when to contract and relax, he said, there could be a connection between the overdose and Brenden’s involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nBean said she blames CVS for the mistake but also herself: “I’m the one who physically administered it ... I could have killed him.”\n\nCVS declined to comment on the error.\n\nBean and her husband filed a lawsuit against CVS in February that was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. But they said they did not file a complaint with the Florida Board of Pharmacy.\n\nThat means it’s one of countless errors for which there’s no official tally or public record.\n\nDespite a widespread industry belief that medication errors are on the rise as a result of unsafe working conditions, there is no reliable or comprehensive public data to prove it.\n\nNo federal agency requires pharmacists to report medication errors, and few state boards of pharmacy mandate it. Many pharmacies and pharmacy chains track errors internally but do not share the numbers with the public. CVS and Walgreens both declined to share their data with USA TODAY.\n\n“There really is no way of knowing how many errors are actually out there,” said Larry Selkow, a retired California pharmacist who recently served on the American Public Health Association’s task force on pharmacy medication safety issues.\n\nThe group estimated U.S. pharmacies annually make 54 million dispensing errors, of which 2.3 million are potentially harmful. It recommended the establishment of a national pharmacy reporting system to collect data on errors and their underlying causes. Having such information, Selkow said, would allow pharmacies to adopt practices to prevent future mistakes.\n\nNumerous pharmacists told USA TODAY that errors are not consistently reported – even internally. Small mistakes and those caught early are routinely hidden.\n\n“Some pharmacists don’t report it especially if they’ve already had, like, five errors that year,\" said Shane Jerominski, a California pharmacist who worked for both Walgreens and CVS. \"For every error that gets found out, there will be an error that never gets caught.\"\n\nEven when they do report potentially fatal errors, some pharmacists said, no one from their companies investigates how they occurred or makes changes to prevent them from repeating.\n\nA former CVS pharmacy manager at a short-staffed, high-volume store in Georgia said he was horrified when one of his patients who was prescribed Bisoprolol for high blood pressure accidentally received a sleeping aid called Belsomra and got sick after she started taking it.\n\nThe pharmacist, who now works for Walmart, said he had hoped the error would be a wake-up call for higher-ups who might finally give his store adequate staffing. It didn’t work out that way.\n\n“They had me do that little report, but my manager, nobody ever followed up,” he said. “They were like, ‘OK, cool, see if she would like a gift card, and we’ll handle it from here.’ And that was it. It’s like they could care less. Like it didn’t even happen.”\n\nCVS did not comment on the incident, but Thibault said that the company’s first priority when it learns of any error is the patient’s safety. She said it then takes steps to correct the error and learn from it. Walgreens said in a statement that it’s mandatory for employees to report errors under the company’s “Continuous Quality Improvement Program.”\n\n“We take any prescription error very seriously and have a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the rare chance of human error,” said Marty Maloney, Walgreens’ senior manager of media relations.\n\nPharmacists are personally liable for medication errors and risk fines, discipline and loss of license if investigated and found responsible by their state board. Many told USA TODAY they get little or no support from their company when mistakes happen, even if the conditions imposed by those companies contributed to the error.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Pharmacy in September fined and suspended the licenses of two CVS pharmacists who accidentally gave a pregnant woman the abortion drug misoprostol instead of the fertility treatment she was prescribed. The mistake, which was first reported by 8NewsNow in Las Vegas, ended the woman’s pregnancy.\n\nThe Nevada board also fined CVS $10,000 over the objections of company attorney William Stilling who argued CVS itself did nothing wrong.\n\n“The only allegation” against CVS, Stilling said, “is that they had these pharmacists.”\n\nPharmacy benefit managers played role in the current crisis\n\nRetail pharmacy wasn’t always this bleak.\n\nTwenty years ago the industry was thriving. CVS and Walgreens were opening new locations at a rapid clip. New pharmacy schools popped up to meet the needs of a profession in high demand. Meanwhile, Americans’ appetite for prescription drugs was soaring.\n\nIndependent and chain pharmacies alike were earning relatively healthy profits from drug sales and could afford to hire and retain enough staff to keep their operations humming.\n\nA constellation of factors contributed to the industry’s downturn. They include rising drug costs, changing consumer habits and the emergence of online pharmacies.\n\nBut none looms larger than the outsized influence of pharmacy benefit managers. These third-party administrators of health insurers’ prescription drug programs have eroded the profits of retail pharmacies to the point where they now lose money on many sales.\n\n“In today’s world, 7 out of 10 medicines dispensed by a pharmacy are dispensed at a loss,” Hogue said, referring to the non-generic drugs that represent pharmacies’ largest expense.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, commonly referred to as PBMs, act as a middleman between the insurers, the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies. They negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, determine which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and set reimbursement rates for pharmacies that buy and sell the drugs.\n\nAs the power of PBMs rose over the years, they demanded bigger rebates from drug manufacturers and pocketed increasingly bigger shares of those savings instead of passing them along. They also lowered pharmacy reimbursement rates and tacked on hefty fees known as Direct and Indirect Remuneration.\n\nThe three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, owned by Cigna; CVS Caremark, owned by CVS Health; and OptumRx, owned by the same company as UnitedHealthcare – control a majority of the market.\n\nWhile PBMs’ collective profits skyrocketed over the past decade, their tactics plunged retail pharmacies into financial distress and left them scrambling for alternative sources of revenue, like vaccinations, to stay afloat.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry last year into PBM practices, which have already been the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nIndependent pharmacies have been hit especially hard. Not only are their reimbursement rates lower than those of chains, but their patients have been steered away by PBMs that insist they use a preferred chain pharmacy instead.\n\nCharles Thompson, a pharmacist and independent owner of Grove Park Pharmacy in Orangeburg, South Carolina, said he has lost countless customers who were told by their PBMs to use CVS and Walgreens instead. Between that and the lower reimbursements, he said, Grove Park had to diversify to stay open. It now offers an in-store medical clinic, hospice services and medical equipment rentals.\n\n“If I had to rely only on filling prescriptions,” Thompson said. “I would be out of business.”\n\nOther independent pharmacies simply closed. The United States has lost more than 3,500 mom-and-pop pharmacies in the past decade, according to data from the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies.\n\n“The independents have been the canaries in the coal mine,” said B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association.\n\nNow the chains are following suit. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid all recently announced the closure of hundreds of pharmacies as they face slumping revenues and the fallout from multiple lawsuits for their alleged roles in the nation’s opioid crisis. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\n\n“It’s all coming home to roost,” Hoey said of the PBMs’ unchecked power and their practice of steering patients away from the independents and into the chains. “It has overloaded the system, and also that corporate mentally of just, ‘we’re going to work the workers to death,’ I think that’s coming home to roost, too.”\n\nPharmacists bleeding, crying, working alone\n\nLike the metaphorical frog boiling in the pot, Wendy Lear said she didn’t realize how bad her job at CVS had gotten until there were so few staff left that she was forced to work alone, even when she had no business being behind the pharmacy counter.\n\nLear’s stint with CVS started in 2009 when the chain bought the independent pharmacy where she worked in Lexington, Kentucky. The transition was dramatic but initially tolerable, Lear said, because CVS retained enough pharmacists and technicians to meet the patients’ needs.\n\nBut that changed over the years as CVS whittled away its staff while heaping more work upon the few who remained.\n\nOne time, Lear recalled, she went to work while miscarrying her first child because her boss couldn’t find anyone to cover her overnight shift and begged her to go in. Bleeding, cramping and emotionally distraught, Lear said, she fielded phone calls and filled prescriptions until she had to lie down on the floor.\n\nAnother time when she was sick with norovirus and vomiting in a trash can behind the pharmacy counter, Lear said, she was asked to keep working until her boss could find someone to replace her. Lear toughed it out for two hours before texting her boss for an update.\n\n“Any word???” she wrote. “I can’t stay here. I am so sick. I am going to have to close.”\n\nHer boss texted back, instructing Lear to have the store manager take care of patients in her absence.\n\n“That’s illegal,” Lear told USA TODAY of her boss’ request. “You have to have a pharmacist on premises to sell prescriptions. She was so frustrated I had to go home, and, it’s like, you have to have contingencies for when people fall ill during their shift.”\n\nEventually, Lear said, the demands of the job became too intense and the risk of errors too great – especially during solo shifts – that she quit CVS in 2021 and found a new job at an independent pharmacy, Remington Drug Co., in northern Virginia.\n\n“Answering phone calls, taking prescriptions at drop off, entering those prescriptions, verifying once, filling those prescriptions, verifying twice, running the register, giving vaccinations, making metric-monitored phone calls, all fell on one person,” she said of her job at CVS. “In a double-check system, who’s checking me? This is when patient safety is most compromised.”\n\nDeAngelis told USA TODAY it is not CVS’ policy or practice to require staff to work when they are ill.\n\nBut retail pharmacists from CVS and other chains across the country shared similar stories of corporate pressure and severe burnout:\n\n“All day long stuff’s blowing up and management is yelling at us because we can’t answer the phones fast enough and we’re not giving enough immunizations,” said a current Walgreens pharmacist in Arizona. “I’ve seen pharmacists cry back in the pharmacy because it’s so busy.”\n\n“This situation has slowly worsened, but the big turning point was when we started giving COVID shots,” said a current Walmart pharmacist in Iowa. “One day it was just me there, and I did 77 COVID shots.”\n\n“There was not a single week where I didn’t work 80 hours, but I was only paid 42,” said a former CVS pharmacist from Virginia. “We were behind on prescriptions the entire year. I was begging, ‘please can we get more hours?’ Instead, corporate would suggest we do these overnighters to get caught up.”\n\nThousands of retail pharmacists left the industry during the first two years of the pandemic, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported a 6% drop in employment numbers between 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlthough those numbers have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the latest data shows, overall interest in the profession has nosedived, raising questions about the future of pharmacy.\n\nApplications to U.S. pharmacy schools plummeted nearly 70% from their peak in the fall of 2009 to the fall of 2021, according to the most recent data published by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Those schools, which graduated nearly 15,000 students a year at their peak, are expected to produce just 11,000 new pharmacists annually by 2025, Hogue said.\n\nStuart Beatty, dean of Ohio Northern University’s Raabe College of Pharmacy, said his school is facing the same enrollment slump despite efforts to recruit students and reassure them of a bright future.\n\nIf he and his academic peers can’t reverse the tide, he said, the nation soon could face a severe pharmacist shortage.\n\n“It makes sense. Why would you go into a doctoral degree when all this is happening?” said Janan Sarwar, a Louisville-based pharmacist, publisher and career coach. “They want to help patients. They don’t want to enter a profession that oppresses their ability to help and do good in the world.”\n\nMistakes like this are why pharmacists say they're leaving\n\nShelby Richards blames chronic pharmacy understaffing for the medication error that cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Memphis Walgreens she frequented was always “busy, low staffed, lines out the door,” Richards said, including the day in March 2021 when she retrieved a newly prescribed anti-anxiety medication to treat panic attacks after a car wreck.\n\nInside the bottle were two sizes of round, white pills. Richards said she assumed they were different doses of the same drug because her doctor had mentioned wanting to start her on 5 mg of Buspar before increasing it to 10 mg.\n\nSo she started taking the smaller of the two pills, not realizing it was a different drug altogether – a calcium channel blocker called amlodipine to treat high blood pressure.\n\nWithin days, Richards said, she began to feel nauseous, light-headed and her legs were swelling – all common side effects of amlodipine. Uninsured, she racked up $15,000 in bills from three hospital visits as doctors tried in vain to determine the cause, records show.\n\nIt wasn’t until her boyfriend took a closer look at her medication and noticed the different-sized pills that she had an answer.\n\n“I told her it … should always be a separate bottle,” said her now-husband Taylor Richards, who researched the two pills online and learned the one she had been taking was the highest dose of amlodipine available.\n\nThe couple called Walgreens to report the error and said they were dismissed without an apology. They tried to sue but missed the state statute of limitations, so they filed a complaint with the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, which they provided to USA TODAY.\n\n“It seems like their staff is working like slaves,” Taylor Richards said. “There are usually two people back there, and it’s probably one of the busiest pharmacies around. I imagine they’re requiring them to fill so many prescriptions that it will continue to cause these types of errors.”\n\nWalgreens declined to comment on the error.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, said it’s a prime example of how working conditions put patients at risk and why so many of them are quitting the profession altogether.\n\nIt’s also why dozens of pharmacists recently walked out recently in protest. Another walkout is planned for Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Pharmacists are calling it Pharmageddon.\n\n“The primary reason is our concern for public safety,” said Corey Schneider, one of the CVS pharmacists who participated in the Kansas City walkout. “It’s also about basic decency. Pharmacists shouldn’t have to cry at work or go home worried that they made a mistake.”\n\nA few, like Tanoe, have funneled their frustration into advocacy. The former Walgreens pharmacist launched a public campaign in 2021 around the hashtag #PizzaIsNotWorking to highlight the dangerous working conditions that gestures such as free pizza from corporate won’t fix.\n\nSince then she has connected with thousands of retail pharmacy workers through her Facebook page, LinkedIn account and the online pharmacist advocacy community, RPhAlly, of which she is the vice president. She also helped organizers of the recent CVS and Walgreens walkouts share their messages and recruit participants and supporters.\n\nTanoe said it’s time the state pharmacy boards, professional organizations and corporate owners take these concerns seriously. If not, she said, the nation will see fewer pharmacies, fewer pharmacists and more incidents of patient harm.\n\n“For so long we have been told our patients come first – no matter what you do, your patient comes first,” Tanoe said. “Now, we are saying, no. We come first. We hold our patients’ lives in our hands. If we’re not well, they’re not well.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

It was a deal he hailed as a “win for tens of thousands of rail workers.”\n\nBut many of those workers didn’t see it that way.\n\nAnd as a result, rank-and-file members of four of the 12 unions have voted no on the ratification votes, starting the clock ticking to a potentially catastrophic industry-wide strike that could start at Dec. 9 at 12:01 am ET.\n\nWhile the rejected contracts would have granted workers their biggest wage increases in 50 years – immediate 14% raises with back pay and 24% raises over the course of five years, plus $1,000 cash bonuses every year – wages and economics were never the big problems in these talks.\n\nThere were scheduling rules that kept many of the workers on call seven days a week, even when they weren’t working, the lack of sick pay common for workers in other industries, and staffing shortages.\n\nThe tentative agreements made some improvements in those issues, but they didn’tcome close to what the union was seeking. Anger among the rank-and-file about staffing levels and scheduling rules that could penalize them and cost them pay for for taking a sick day had been building for year. Working through the pandemic only brought the issues more front and center. And that, plus the record profits being reported by many of the railroads last year and likely again this year, prompted many workers to vote no.\n\n“Some of this vote, I think, wasn’t necessarily a referendum vote against the contract as much as it was against their employers,” said Jeremey Ferguson, president of the transportation division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail Transportation union, the largest rail union which represents 28,000 conductors.Its members voted against the tentative agreement in vote results announced Monday.\n\n“Members aren’t necessarily voting on the money issues,” he told CNN Tuesday. “It’s quality of life, and how they’re treated. When big corporations cut too deep and they expect everybody else to pick up the pace, it becomes intolerable. You don’t have family time, you don’t have time to get adequate rest.”\n\nThere was widespread opposition to the contract even at some of the unions whose members ratified the deal.\n\nOnly 54% members in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), the second largest rail union, voted for the deal. Union members across the industry who opposed the proposed deal did so knowing that Congress might vote to order them to stay on the job or return to work under terms of a contract that could beeven worse than the ones they rejected.\n\nWorkers have a disadvantage by law\n\nThere are many reasons the nation is now on the precipice of a strike, some going back nearly a century, to the passage of the Railway Labor Act.\n\nPassed in 1926, itwas one of the nation’s first labor laws and put all types of restrictions on strikes by rail workers that don’t exist for union members at most other businesses.\n\nWhile the law may allow Congress to eventually block a strike or order union members back to work once a strike begins, the unions argue that limiting the right to strike has weakened the leverage unions need to reach labor deals acceptable to the majority of their members.\n\n“Congress staying out of it would obviously giving unions leverage,” said Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET.) He said other businesses know they face costs if a union goes on strike that the railroads don’t have to pay.\n\nA strike would be a body blow to the nation’sstill-struggling supply chain, as 30% of the nation’s freight as measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail. It’s impossible to run a 21st century economy without this 19th century technology.\n\nThe US economy, which many think is at risk of tipping into recession, would be severely damaged by a prolonged rail strike. Shortages of everything from gasoline to food to automobiles could occur, driving up the prices of all of those products. Factories could be forced to close temporarily due to the lack of parts they need.\n\nThat is why many expect Congress to step in and impose a contract on members of the four unions that have yet to the proposed deals.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” said Ian Jefferies, CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the industry’s trade group.\n\nWould a divided Lame Duck Congress be able to find bipartisan agreement to act, and act quickly, to prevent or end a strike? “This is not a political issue. This is an economic issue,” he said.\n\nForJefferies, the “best outcome” is for the railroads and the unions that have rejected the deals to come agree on new deals that can be ratified by the rank-and-file. One rail union, the machinists, initially rejected the deal, only to ratify a slightly revised agreement, albeit with only 52% of members voting in favor.\n\n“There’s absolutely opportunities if a ratification fails the first time to sit down and come to additional agreements and put that out and get the [tentative agreement] ratified,” said Jefferies.\n\nWill Congress act?\n\nBut the unions say that railroads are unwilling to negotiate on issues such as sick time because they are counting on Congress to give them a deal they want, even if the record profits (or near record profits) being reported by the railroads suggest that the companies have the resources to give the unions what they are demanding.\n\n“They’re telegraphing they expect Congress to save them,” said Pierce, president of the engineers’ union. He and the other union leaders membersare concerned that Congress will act, even though Democrats, who still control both houses in the current Lame Duck session, were reluctant to vote to block a strike in September as the strike deadline approached.\n\n“It’s hard to say what Congress will do,” said Pierce.\n\nSome union supporters who are not returning to Congress next year might not even attend the Lame Duck session, he added.And the railroads’ and business groups’ hope of quick action by Congress could be derailed by other items on the Congress’ busy agenda.\n\nStill, Pierce and other union leaders worry that even some pro-union members of Congress could vote to block or end a strike rather than be blamed for the disruptions a strike would cause.\n\n“I didn’t get sense they had stomach to let a strike upend the economy,” he said.\n\nThe unions intend to lobby Congress to try to block any legislation ordering them to keep working or return to work soon after a strike starts. But they expect to be outgunned by lobbyists for the railroads and other business interests.\n\n“I expect they’ll have about one lobbyist for every member of Congress,” Pierce said.\n\nA strike would once again put Biden in a tough spot, as the pro-union president would be caught between angering union allies who want to be allowed to go on strike or risking the economic upheaval that the strike would cause.\n\nWhile Biden doesn’t have the authority at this point in the process to unilaterally order the railroad workers to stay on the job, as he did in July, he would need to sign off on any Congressional action for it to take effect.\n\nTuesday White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated earlier White House comments that “a shutdown is unacceptable because of the harm it would inflict on jobs, families.” But she wouldn’t answer questions as to whether or not Biden is prepared to agree to Congressional action mandating a contract that workers find unacceptable.\n\n“We are asking the parties involved, to come together in good faith and resolve this,” she said, adding that “the President is directly involved” in discussions once again.\n\nIf Congress does act, the Railway Labor Act is doing what it was designed to do, the railroads say.\n\n“The goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage,” said the AAR’s Jefferies. “And it’s been remarkably effective in doing that. The last work stoppage we had was 30 years ago, and it lasted 24 hours before overwhelming bipartisan congressional [action to end the strike]. I think all parties agree that a work stoppage or a shutdown of the network is not helpful to anybody involved.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/25/teacher-strike-eagle-paradox-forest-restoration-news-around-states/50638451/", "title": "Teacher strike, eagle paradox: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: City leaders complained, yet agreed to a $5 million bailout to help the World Games 2022 reduce a roughly $15 million debt from the sporting event held in the city last month. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the metro area did benefit from the 11-day Olympics-style competition. But he also joined council members in criticizing a lack of transparency about the finances of the event, which featured sports ranging from parachuting to billiards. “I know each of you enough to know this sucks,” Mayor Randall Woodfin told the council at their meeting Tuesday. “I feel the same way you feel.” The World Games lost $2.5 million in expected sponsorships in May, and ticket sales fell about 200,000 short of projections, said Nick Sellers, chief executive of the World Games Organizing Committee. While expenses were lower than projected, the lack of revenue still caused a budget crunch, he said. More than 100 companies or individuals, many of them from Alabama, are owed about $15 million, officials said. Some area companies also complained about a decline in business during the event, which didn’t draw the expected number of international visitors during its run July 7-17. The Birmingham games marked only the second time a U.S. city played host to the World Games in its four-decade-long existence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. House candidate Tara Sweeney said Tuesday that she plans to end her campaign, saying she does not see a path to victory or to raise the resources needed to be successful in the November general election. Sweeney was positioned in fourth place after last week’s U.S. House primary as elections officials continued to count ballots. But she was far behind the top finishers, Democrat Mary Peltola and Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, who were already poised to advance to the November general election. An election process approved by voters in 2020 calls for the top four vote-getters in a primary to advance to the general election, in which ranked-choice voting will be used. Tiffany Montemayor, a spokesperson with the state Division of Elections, said if a candidate who advances from the primary withdraws 64 or more days before the general election, the fifth-place candidate would advance instead. She said that determination would come after the Sept. 5 withdrawal deadline. Peltola, Palin and Begich also were the three candidates competing in last week’s ranked-choice special election that will determine who serves the remainder of the late U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term, which ends early next year. The results of that election aren’t expected until Aug. 31.\n\nArizona\n\nMarana: A massive, beloved cactus has fallen. “Strong-Arm,” a saguaro that stood in the Tortolita Preserve in Marana near Tucson, fell Aug.4 after living for roughly 150 to 200 years, the town said on its website. The 40-foot-tall saguaro, marked with its own metal sign proclaiming its name, had 34 arms in all and was home to many birds, including a great horned owl and some woodpeckers. In the memorial post on Marana’s government website, Jason Grodman, natural resources supervisor with the Marana Parks and Recreation Department, called it a “saguaro motel” to its many animal residents. “It saw all of the development grow up around us, and it’s really a sentinel for the preserve,” Grodman said in a tribute video for the plant. Marana’s recreation superintendent Bob Stinson said his predecessor had given the saguaro its name since it was one of the largest cacti in the area, and the trail went right by it. “It was just a beautiful specimen,” Stinson said. He said, gauging from the many people he had spoken to about it, Strong-Arm would be missed in the community. Grodman said in the video that the trunk of the saguaro, which remains upright, will likely stand for the next few years, while the arms will likely decompose of the course of about five years.\n\nArkansas\n\nMulberry: The attorney for a man seen on video being punched and kneed by officers said Tuesday that the violent arrest is part of an alleged pattern of excessive force by a sheriff’s deputy, and policing experts said some of the blows appeared to be unjustified or even criminal. A bystander’s video of 27-year-old Randal Worcester’s arrest Sunday in the small town of Mulberry sparked outrage after it was posted online. All three officers were later suspended, and state and federal authorities have opened criminal investigations into their actions. It’s the latest case in which increasingly omnipresent cameras have led to consequences for officers and raised questions about what level of force police are justified in using and when. A deputy was caught in the video repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down as a third also kneed him over and over. Carrie Jernigan, an attorney for Worcester, said the deputy who punched him, Levi White, used excessive force against other people she’s representing. “There’s something going on, and we just need to get it addressed,” she said during a Tuesday news conference with the two other clients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Victims who receive unsolicited sexually graphic material by text, email, app or other electronic means could sue the sender under a bill that lawmakers sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. The bill targets what’s known as “cyber flashing,” when victims receive such unwelcome surprises, often from strangers. “Just as individuals suffer sexual harassment and abuse in their physical, non-digital lives, there’s a growing incidence of individuals being harassed by receiving unsolicited, sexually explicit images and videos including from people they do not know,” Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry said when the Assembly approved the bill. The Assembly passed the measure 76-0 last Thursday, and the Senate sent the bill to Newsom on a 37-0 roll call Monday. There was no recorded opposition. The most common recipients are young women, Aguiar-Curry said. The Pew Research Center in a report last year on online harassment found that 33% of women under 35 had been sexually harassed online – three times as often as men. In a 2017 report, the center said more than half of women ages 18-29 had been sent unsolicited explicit images, as had 37% of men in the same age range. The bill would allow recipients to recover at least $1,500 and as much as $30,000 from senders of obscene material.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Colorado businessman charged in a “We Build the Wall” fraud case that once included former presidential adviser Steve Bannon among defendants wants his October retrial moved from New York to Colorado to save money and spare him from what his lawyer says is bias from political polarization he’ll otherwise face. Attorney John Meringolo wrote in papers submitted to a Manhattan federal court judge late Monday that Timothy Shea cannot get a fair and impartial retrial in New York. He also asked that the retrial be moved from Oct. 24 to early December, saying prosecutors have recently produced a previously seized laptop computer taken from Shea’s Castle Rock, Colorado, residence that contains an email exchange not introduced at the first trial, which ended in June with a deadlocked jury. In requesting a change of venue, Meringolo cited what he called the “obviously politically charged atmosphere of the jury room” at the first trial and said the effect of “political polarization” became obvious when the trial ended in a mistrial after 11 jurors tried to force one juror off the panel, saying he possessed political bias. A similar venue-change request was denied before Shea’s first trial. Meringolo said the first trial was an immense financial burden for his client, and a move would enable him to have witnesses who live closer to Colorado testify on his behalf.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A department store security guard who was shot outside a mall was wounded when he struggled with an alleged shoplifter who pulled a handgun on him, according to an arrest warrant affidavit released Monday. The affidavit was released as Richard LaPlante was arraigned in court on attempted murder and other charges in connection with Friday’s shooting outside The Shoppes at Buckland Hills in Manchester. A judge kept the 30-year-old Windsor resident’s bail at $1 million. Tirso Polanco, a 27-year-old loss prevention officer at the Macy’s store at the mall, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized, police said. According to the affidavit, LaPlante fled the mall after the shooting and took a transit bus home. Police said they were able to track and identify him through mall and bus security cameras. LaPlante turned himself in to police Saturday. His next court date was set for Sept. 7. His lawyer, Ronald Johnson, said after Monday’s court hearing that LaPlante “feels bad” about the shooting.“We’re praying for the victim and hope that the victim is OK, and we’re praying for his family,” Johnson said. “And the most important thing is let the judicial process go through its process.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of prisoners has sued the state’s prison system and its private health care contractor, claiming they’ve been left to suffer chronic and sometimes debilitating pain after officials banned certain pain medicines. Aside from complaints involving the pandemic, the lawsuit is the first large-scale litigation filed against Centurion of Delaware, the private health care provider for the state’s prison system. Centurion won a $47 million contract to provide health care for those imprisoned by the state starting in 2020, taking over after years of complaints and scandals involving the prisons’ prior health care provider. The lawsuit names 24 plaintiffs. All but one are currently in a Delaware prison. They each claim that they suffer from chronic pain or nerve damage caused by a range of issues from gunshot wounds to things like degenerative joint and spinal conditions, pain that was treated by medications that were effectively banned by the prison in 2019, the lawsuit says. The suit claims that after that, inadequate alternatives were provided. In some cases, they were given psychiatric drugs or alternative methods such as “distraction” and yoga, which leave the prisoners suffering behind bars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A homeless encampment in Northwest D.C. was cleared Wednesday morning, leaving many people looking for a new location to live, WUSA-TV reports. The National Park Service closed Reservation 70 about 7 a.m. The closure was due to imminent threats to public health and safety from unsheltered encampments in the parks, National Mall and Memorial Parks Chief of Communications Mike Litterst said. The closure will allow for turf rehabilitation, cleaning and maintenance of the park area, and removal of rodent infestation. Fencing will enclose the park and will remain closed while the park is under restoration. There was no information on how long the people who were living there were notified ahead of the closure to make arrangements to relocate. The site is one of many encampments that have been closed to homeless residents in the district this year. Once an encampment is closed, the unhoused people who were living there typically migrate to a different one, which can cause overcrowding.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz as a toddler was intellectually and physically behind other children, which caused him to isolate himself and hit and bite to get what he wanted, a day care administrator and former neighbor testified Tuesday at his penalty trial for mass murder. He remained socially and behaviorally stunted through elementary school, a special education counselor also testified. Cruz’s attorneys began the second day of their defense by building on testimony that his birth mother’s cocaine and alcohol abuse during pregnancy left him severely brain-damaged, putting him on a road that led to him murdering 14 students and three staff members at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018. They are trying to persuade his jury to sentence him to life without parole instead of death. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to the murders, and the trial is only to determine his sentence. Prosecutors say no drugs were found in Cruz’s system at birth. The defense says that’s because his birth mother was put in a residential drug rehab program when she was six months pregnant, but the damage had been done. The defense is trying to overcome the prosecution’s case, which featured surveillance video of Cruz mowing down students and staff as he stalked a three-story building for seven-minutes, photos of the aftermath and a jury visit to the building.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMorrow: Two white Atlanta police officers who clashed with Rayshard Brooks acted reasonably during the 2020 encounter that ended with the 27-year-old Black man’s fatal shooting, a specially appointed prosecutor said Tuesday in announcing his decision not to pursue charges against them. Officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Brooks in June 2020, and Officer Devin Brosnan faced a “quickly evolving” situation when Brooks lunged and grabbed one of their Tasers during an arrest attempt, said Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia. “We did not look at this with 20/20 hindsight. Given the quickly changing circumstances, was it objectively reasonable that he used deadly force? And we conclude it was,” Skandalakis said. The shooting happened against the backdrop of heightened tensions and protests nationwide after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer less than three weeks prior. Sometimes-violent protests had largely subsided in Atlanta, but Brooks’ killing set off a new round of demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice. Skandalakis said he believes context is important and acknowledged encounters between police and the African American community are sometimes “very volatile,” but he said he doesn’t believe race played a role in this instance.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A food distribution company has agreed to pay $90,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging a Black employee was subjected to racial slurs and racist references to slavery, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Wednesday. According to the lawsuit, a supervisor at Suisan Co.’s Hilo warehouse shouted racial slurs at the worker, who was fired after complaining to management. A manager who investigated also used a racial epithet during a meeting with the employee, the lawsuit said. During a second meeting, the manager and another supervisor made jokes about slavery, the lawsuit said. The commission alleged in the lawsuit filed last year in U.S. District Court in Honolulu that the man was later fired in retaliation for reporting the harassment. In addition to the money, Suisan agreed to measures to address and prevent discrimination, the commission said, including outlining an internal complaint process and providing anti-discrimination training. “Even though Hawaii is a racially and culturally diverse state, we continue to see race discrimination and harassment complaints filed with our agency in this region,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the commission.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Tuesday called a special session of the Legislature beginning Sept. 1 to use the state’s projected $2 billion budget surplus for a record $500 million income tax rebate this year to help residents deal with increased food and gas prices due to inflation. The Republican governor also proposed an ongoing tax cut of more than $150 million annually by creating a corporate and individual flat tax rate of 5.8% starting next year. The first $2,500 of income for individuals and $5,000 for those filing jointly would be exempt from taxes. Finally, Little wants to bolster K-12 public schools and ongoing education with $410 million annually from sales taxes starting next year. Language in Little’s proclamation calling the special session cites high inflation, currently about 8.5%. “Idaho taxpayers and the education system are especially imperiled by the consequences of historic inflation,” Little’s proclamation said. The proposed bill already has enough co-sponsors in the 70-member House and 35-member Senate to make it to the governor’s desk for his signature. The Legislature would decide when it meets in regular session in January how to spend the education money. Of the $410 million, $330 million is proposed for K-12 and $80 million for ongoing education.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A former prison guard could face life in prison after a jury convicted him Tuesday of violating the civil rights of a 65-year-old inmate who died after correctional officers beat him in a lockup more than four years ago. The jury of six men and six women deliberated about three hours before returning guilty verdicts on five counts against ex-correctional Lt. Todd Sheffler, 54, of Mendon. Sheffler is the second ex-guard convicted in the death of Larry Earvin in May 2018. A separate jury convicted Alex Banta, 31, of similar charges in April. That jury could not reach a verdict on Sheffler, so the government tried him again. “The defense made a statement about the long, cruel arm of government,” assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Miller said in his closing statement. “Todd Sheffler violated his training, violated the U.S. Constitution and allowed, participated in and covered up the brutal beating of a 65-year-old man, defenseless, a fellow citizen, handcuffed behind his back and lying on the cold, hard concrete floor. He was the long, cruel arm of government.” Like Banta, Sheffler was convicted of depriving Earvin of his civil rights, conspiracy to deprive civil rights, tampering with a witness, destruction or falsification of records and intimidation or force against a witness. The civil rights charges alone carry sentences of as much as life in prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nLakeville: Democrat Paul Steury has been confirmed as the party’s candidate for the special election to complete the congressional term of Republican U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski following her death in a highway crash. Democratic precinct committee members from Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District confirmed Steury’s selection during a caucus vote Tuesday evening in Lakeville. “With Paul Steury, Democrats have an educator and proven community leader who is ready to fight climate change, create more good-paying jobs, and build a better tomorrow for Hoosiers across Indiana’s Second Congressional District,” Indiana Democratic Party Chair Mike Schmuhl said Tuesday night in a statement. Steury is a high school science teacher from Goshen and will face Republican Rudy Yakym and Libertarian William Henry. Yakym won a Republican caucus Saturday to replace Walorski on the November ballot after gaining the endorsement of Walorski’s husband. Yakym, an executive with Elkhart distribution company Kem Krest, will be a heavy favorite to win in the solidly Republican district. All three candidates are running both in the special election to complete Walorski’s term that ends in early January and the regular election for a full two-year term. Both elections will be on the November ballot.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is undertaking an ambitious project to survey the condition of every house in Des Moines. The Property Condition Survey intends to survey more than 50 neighborhoods and 96,000 houses across the city, officials said. The initiative employs coordinators to evaluate properties with a focus on safety, according to SuAnn Donovan, the city’s deputy director of Neighborhood Services. As a part of the survey, coordinators will survey the condition of each property’s roof, siding, windows, fence and gates, porch and balconies, and foundation. Properties are then ranked on a scale of one to five, with one indicating the property is in good condition and five indicating it is in need of repair, according to Donovan. The overall score will help the city and Invest DSM, a neighborhood revitalization project, decide where to invest in next, she said. The survey is being used in the development of a voluntary neighborhood assistance program coined “Improving Our Neighborhoods,” Donovan said. Between 2011 and 2021, developers, homeowners and businesses have invested $2.1 billion in the city’s downtown, supplemented by government tax breaks and incentives. She emphasized that the initiative is voluntary and that the city will not be issuing any violations in regard to the findings of the survey.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An anti-abortion activist is now suing for a complete hand recount of an election in which voters soundly rejected a proposal to remove abortion rights from the state’s constitution. Mark Gietzen is representing himself in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Sedgwick County District Court after a nine-county hand recount that his supporters largely funded wrapped up over the weekend. Fewer than 100 votes changed out of more than 500,000 cast in those counties. The measure failed by about 165,000 votes statewide. Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab said in a news release that the recount results should “put to rest the unfounded claims of election fraud.” In the lawsuit, Gietzen alleges without evidence that votes statewide might have been vulnerable to the same type of programming error that initially switched results in a county commission race. The suit also seeks a revote “where necessary.” A judge quickly dismissed a lawsuit Gietzen filed before the election seeking to have ballot drop boxes removed across the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nJackson: In the wake of the worst flooding in eastern Kentucky memory, 59 Breathitt County residents have signed onto a lawsuit against Blackhawk Mining and a contracted company, Pine Branch Mining, alleging nearby strip mining operations amplified the flood damage. Ned Pillersdorf, a local attorney representing the plaintiffs, said a majority of those 59 residents are now homeless, and those who aren’t won’t have access to clean water for months. The mining operations were a “ticking time bomb ready to explode with any type of heavy rainfall,” the filing in Breathitt County Circuit Court alleges. Following the late July flooding, residents said they found fish on their property that would normally reside in the silt ponds of coal mining operations, which the plaintiffs say indicates failure on the part of the coal companies to properly maintain its silt ponds and overall operation. Kentucky Administrative Regulation 20:060 requires coal companies to keep any debris or water from its operation from escaping its property into non-permitted areas, such as the residences below. The filing also accuses the coal companies of failing to continuously reclaim strip mined land, as required under Kentucky Revised Statute 350.100, damaging residents’ water supply, and causing property damage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: About two dozen juvenile inmates at a troubled detention center won’t be moved to the notorious state penitentiary at Angola until at least the middle of next month, as a legal battle over their transfer plays out, officials said Tuesday. The juveniles are currently being held at the Bridge City Center for Youth in Jefferson Parish. Officials have long acknowledged issues at the center, which wasn’t designed to house certain high-risk inmates. There have been at least four escapes this year, as well as a riot in which 20 juveniles took over parts of the complex. But the plan to move them to Angola has been sharply criticized by criminal justice advocates, former officials and parents of children currently held at the center, The Times-Picayune/The News Orleans Advocate reports. A federal lawsuit to block the state from moving forward with the transfer was filed Friday on behalf of a teenager currently held in Bridge City who is set to be transferred to Angola, the newspaper reports. The defendants in the case – which include Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Office of Juvenile Justice – and their attorneys said Tuesday that they would not transfer any of the inmates until at least Sept. 15. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s public defender system wants to more than double its budget to better represent people who can’t afford an attorney. The Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services voted to recommend a $62.1 million budget next year. The proposal would open four public defender offices in the state and raise the hourly fee from $80 to $150 for court-appointed lawyers. Maine is the only state in the nation without a public defender’s office for people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. The state relies on private attorneys who are reimbursed by the state, but the number of lawyers willing to take court-appointed cases has declined in recent years. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine is suing the state, contending there’s a failure to train, supervise and adequately fund a system to ensure the constitutional right to effective counsel. The budget request, which will be considered by lawmakers, comes against a backdrop of states grappling with public defender systems across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Texas man was sentenced to six months in federal prison Tuesday for threatening a Maryland doctor who has been a prominent advocate for COVID-19 vaccines, a federal prosecutor said. Scott Eli Harris, 52, of Aubrey, Texas, pleaded guilty in February to threats transmitted by interstate communication. U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek L. Barron announced the sentence, which will be followed by three years of supervised release, in a news release Wednesday. “While we are all entitled to our own opinion, no one has the right to threaten the life of someone because of race, national origin, or because of holding different views,” Barron said in a statement. “Threats like these will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” According to Harris’ plea agreement and statements made in connection with the plea hearing, Harris sent a threatening message from his cellphone to the doctor. Court documents identify the doctor only as “Dr. L.W., who had been a vocal proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine.” Harris’ message included violent statements such as: “Never going to take your wonder drug. My 12 gauge promises I won’t. .… I can’t wait for the shooting to start.” Harris’ message also made reference to the doctor’s Asian American background and national origin.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nKingston: A project underway in the woods of coastal Massachusetts seeks to restore a 32-acre former Catholic summer camp on the banks of the Muddy Pond in Kingston to something closer to what it might have looked like before European colonization transformed it. Through the Wampanoag Common Lands, the Native Land Conservancy – the local Native group that received the donated forestland this year – envisions a natural environment filled with indigenous plants and animals where Wampanoags can practice cultural ceremonies and educate new generations in traditional ways. Ramona Peters, a Mashpee Wampanoag who founded the conservancy, said the effort is all the more meaningful because the land is some 5 miles from where Pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower established the English colony of Plymouth, near the remnants of a Wampanoag community wiped out by European disease. “This is basically where the first impact of colonization of this country happened,” she said. “It’s very significant that it’s been returned to us.” The Wampanoag Common Lands is part of a growing movement of Indigenous-led conservation efforts helping to preserve and reinvigorate Native culture and identity, said Beth Rose-Middleton, a professor at the University of California, Davis, focused on Native American environmental policy and conservation.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: University of Michigan researchers are studying how well people with autism spectrum disorder can detect road hazards, and they plan to assist the young motorists in sharpening their driving skills. The upcoming effort will be the second phase of a project funded by Ford Motor Co. that teams the Ann Arbor university with a local driving school. During phase one of the study, researchers found that students with autism spectrum disorder detected fewer hazards than control participants during simulated drives. But lead researcher Elise Hodges said some extra work behind the wheel did the trick. “Those folks that underwent training improved in two-thirds of hazards in the simulated drive,” said Hodges, a clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan’s neuropsychology program. Ann Arbor Academy, a school for students with learning and social differences, hosted driving lessons. Hodges designed the simulated drives and oversaw the study. Ford footed the bill. The goal, in part, was to provide an opportunity for those with autism spectrum disorder to improve their driving skills. “Many of them … would like to drive, but getting from wanting to drive and being able to drive are two different things,” she said. The individualized driving sessions planned for phase two are expected to start in a month or two, Hodges said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEden Prairie: A suburban Minneapolis mall resumed normal business hours Tuesday after a fatal shooting that had earlier locked down the shopping complex. Police responded to the Eden Prairie Center mall Monday night and found a man dead of what they said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooting happened in the Scheels sporting goods store, which also sells firearms. Police Chief Matt Sackett said it’s not clear whether the man brought a weapon to Scheels or accessed one of the store’s guns. “It’s obviously an active and fluid investigation, but again, we do believe it to be an isolated incident. There is not a threat to anybody else in the public,” Sackett said at a briefing. Will Dammann was shopping in Scheels when he heard an alarm sound and a commotion near a door. Seconds later a store announcement told people to evacuate immediately. “So then it was, you know, the hustle bustle of getting out. Then everyone was just standing out in front, and that’s when the police just started rolling in,” Dammann said. He said people seemed calm, including store employees. He did not hear a gunshot, Minnesota Public Radio News reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nLorman: The Honors Curriculum Program at Alcorn State University is being renamed in honor of Myrlie Evers-Williams. The program will be renamed the Myrlie Evers-Williams Honors Program in recognition of the civil rights leader, author and journalist who spent over three decades seeking justice for the 1963 murder of her former husband, Medgar Evers, the university said in a news release. Evers-Williams attended Alcorn A&M College for a year, and there she met and fell in love with Medgar Evers. The two later married in 1951. Alcorn said the honors program attracts academically successful and socially conscious students and assists the university in cultivating global citizen scholars. Evers-Williams expressed her appreciation to the school for recognizing her. “This designation is a special recognition that I hold close to my heart, acknowledging my time on Alcorn’s campus, my life’s work, and my dedication to furthering the fight for equality and human rights,” she said. Alcorn President Dr. Felecia M. Nave praised Evers-Williams’ achievements and said she was proud to recognize the civil rights leader on campus. “She’s an ideal example of the strength, courage, and character that Alcornites exude. We’re thrilled to recognize her for extraordinary contributions and ongoing activism,” Nave said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: John Wood, a Republican running as an independent for U.S. Senate, announced Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the race. Wood said on Twitter that he decided not to challenge Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Democratic nominee Trudy Busch Valentine in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. Wood said he has significant differences with Schmitt and Valentine, but “it has become evident there is not a realistic path to victory for me as an independent candidate.” Wood, a lifelong Republican, former U.S. attorney and most recently a top investigator for the U.S. House committee examining the Jan. 6 riot, said he entered the race when disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens was the front-runner for the Republican nomination. He said it would have been “unacceptable” for Greitens to be Missouri’s new senator. Schmitt soundly defeated Greitens in the Aug. 2 GOP primary. Greitens resigned as governor four years ago after a sex scandal, two criminal charges that were eventually dropped and a legislative investigation that could have led to impeachment hearings. This year, his ex-wife accused him of abuse. Wood’s candidacy was backed by a political action committee led by retired Republican Sen. John Danforth, which spent millions on his campaign.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Visitors to the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Great Falls will have the unique opportunity Monday to get close to some of Montana’s most powerful predators: hawks, falcons and owls. Educational staff from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks will be in the city with two or three live “ambassador birds” in conjunction with FWP’s Montana WILD program. Three 40-minute programs will give attendees an up-close encounter with the birds, along with insights into what makes raptors unique from other types of birds, why they are so important to our ecosystems, and simple things property owners and recreationalists can do to protect and conserve raptors. “The mission of the ambassador bird program to educate and hopefully get people interested in the outdoors and what we’re doing in terms of conservation,” said Ali Pons, of FWP’s Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. The Montana WILD program is an outgrowth of the work being done at the center in Helena, which takes in injured and orphaned raptors for rehabilitation and release. Montana WILD cares for 15 ambassador birds too injured to be released on their own. “They wouldn’t make it,” Pons said of raptors who’ve become stars of the educational program. “They also have a personality and a demeanor that makes them good education birds.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge has dismissed the discrimination lawsuit of a former Lincoln Police Department spokeswoman, saying her allegations did not sufficiently prove a hostile work environment. Erin Spilker said in her lawsuit that she faced years of discrimination and that the department not only mishandled allegations of sexual assaults by male officers but also disciplined the women who complained. “She is under a microscope, and has been subjected to assaults, harassment, intimidation, threats and retaliation, which affect her ability to do her job,” Spilker’s attorney, Kelly Brandon, said in the complaint. In his order issued Monday, District Judge Kevin McManaman acknowledged Spilker’s string of allegations, from male colleagues making sexualized remarks about female colleagues to suffering various acts of retaliation after she complained, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. But McManaman said, citing case law, that the allegations amounted to “an amalgamation of discrete incidents … and not one unlawful employment practice.” The allegations “are not so similar in nature, frequency and severity as to be considered part and parcel of a hostile work environment,” McManaman wrote. Spilker, who was a 20-year veteran of the department before she resigned earlier this year, is among several female Lincoln police officers who have sued, alleging sex-based discrimination in the department.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A new herd of wild horses is descending on the Black Rock Desert for 2022’s Burning Man festival. The Wild Horses of the American West project is rounding up more than a dozen life-size sculptures from local and international artists to bring awareness to environmental concerns surrounding the West’s wild horses. “Everyone loves horses. Wild horses are beautiful,” said organizer Adrian Landon. “But the bottom line is they need to be managed.” A longtime metalwork artist, Landon’s career has largely focused on equine sculptures. In 2019, he created “Wings of Glory,” a giant, flying Pegasus with moving parts now on display in England. This year, Landon had a vision of creating a herd of horses to bring awareness to the plight of Western ecosystems and the need to bring wildlife, plant life and water resources into balance. He put out a call to other artists interested in creating equine art and received dozens of replies. He selected 10 artists and used a grant from Burning Man to help fund their pieces. Now, the herd includes a sculpture from British artist Simon Bellamy, who fashioned a galloping steel piece based on the work of pioneering motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge, and Turburam Sandagdorj, a paper-cutting artist who learned the ancient art from his dad.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Continuing with its efforts to close gaps and recover from missed learning, the state Department of Education has selected Tutor.com to provide 24/7 online tutoring for every middle and high school student in the state. Through the partnership, more than 100,000 middle and high school students will gain unlimited access to Tutor.com – anytime, anywhere, from any internet-connected device. The service will be available to students at all New Hampshire schools (public, non-public and charter), as well as students in Home Education and Education Freedom Account programs. “This tutoring will not only facilitate and enhance learning but serve as a tremendous resource for students hoping to enhance their educational experience, or those students in need of individualized instruction. This partnership will also support teachers in their ongoing efforts to assist students who may be struggling and seeking additional guidance,” said Frank Edelblut, the state education commissioner. School districts are being encouraged to register for Tutor.com’s free access for their students; students outside those districts will be able to register individually.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEdison: Mayor Sam Joshi said symbols of hate and discrimination are not welcome in the township, after a piece of construction equipment, viewed as a symbol of hate by the Muslim community, was featured in the Aug. 14 India Day Parade. The parade, from Edison to Woodbridge, marked the 75th anniversary of India’s independence and the division of the South Asian subcontinent into two nations, Hindu-oriented India and Muslim-oriented Pakistan, after years of civil strife. In a statement Monday, Joshi said Edison is committed to celebrating and working in harmony with people from all cultures. But an American-Islamic relations group said it’s disappointed the mayor has not gone further in rebuking the parade organizers, whom the group called to apologize. The parade, organized by the Indian Business Association, featured a piece of construction equipment with the photos of political leaders in India, who are described as proponents of hate against Muslims and other minorities, according to Azra Baig, chair of the South Brunswick’s Human Relations Commission. In India, Baig noted, homes, businesses and houses of worship are being bulldozed because of people’s faith and when they stand up for their rights. “Something this hateful should never be included in a parade in Edison,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will no longer deny licenses to practice law solely because of an applicant’s citizenship or immigration status, including some aspiring law students who arrived in the U.S. as children and don’t have a clear path to citizenship. Announced Monday, the rule change from the New Mexico Supreme Court is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. Several states already have provisions that disregard residency or immigration status in licensure decisions. “The change in the licensure rule is grounded in the fundamental principle of fairness, and is consistent with New Mexico’s historical values of inclusion and diversity,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Shannon Bacon said in a statement Tuesday. She said the shift aligns New Mexico with recommendations by the American Bar Association and provisions in at least eight other states that provide attorney licensing to some immigrants. All applicants are still required to graduate from law school, pass the bar exam and undergo further character vetting by a board of bar examiners. The rulemaking drew immediate criticism from state Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce, at a time when GOP candidates are challenging two incumbent state Supreme Court justices in the November general election.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is headed to Harvard this fall as a teaching fellow at the university’s schools of government and public health. De Blasio, a Democrat who served as mayor from 2014 to 2021, will take part in “a variety of discussions, events, and programming” at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School and will teach classes on leadership and public service at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the schools said in separate announcements Wednesday. Dean Michelle A. Williams cited the former mayor’s time grappling with public health crises including COVID-19, homelessness and the opioid epidemic. Setti Warren, interim director of the Institute of Politics, said de Blasio’s “decades of experience in local government, federal agencies, national campaigns, and running the largest city in the country will provide invaluable insight to our students and the Harvard community.”De Blasio, who grew up in Massachusetts and is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, was prevented by term limits from seeking a third four-year term as mayor. After an unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, de Blasio flirted this year with running for governor of New York and later mounted a brief run for a congressional district that includes his Brooklyn home.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal appeals court on Tuesday blocked a local district attorney from prosecuting state Attorney General Josh Stein or anyone else for his 2020 campaign ad through a criminal libel law. The majority of a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, granted the request by Stein’s campaign committee and others associated with his campaign to prevent enforcement of the law while they sue to attempt to have the law overturned as unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision came the day after a Wake County grand jury formally asked the Wake district attorney’s office to submit an indictment against Stein and two of his advisers or any one of the three for jurors to consider. Wake County DA Lorrin Freeman said Monday that could have happened as soon as next month. Any formal charges could harm the political future of Stein, a Democrat and possible 2024 gubernatorial candidate. The law, which dates back to at least 1931, makes it a misdemeanor to circulate “derogatory reports” about a candidate with the intent of hurting that candidate’s chances in the election. Stein’s Republican opponent in 2020, Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill, cited the law while demanding that the board investigate a political ad that accused the Republican of letting more than a thousand rape kits go untested. O’Neill said the ad was false because police agencies, not prosecutors, are responsible for testing the kits.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A school board reversed course on its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at its monthly meetings, following complaints from conservative lawmakers and an angry backlash from citizens around the country. Seven of the nine members of the Fargo Board of Education, including four newcomers who took office in June, voted earlier this month to cancel a previous board edict that was approved a couple of months before the election. The new board agreed with member Seth Holden, who said the pledge did not align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code in part because the phrase “under God” does not include all faiths. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum last week promoted new legislation that would require public schools and governing bodies to administer the pledge without mandating that people recite it. Republican state Rep. Pat Heinert, a retired county sheriff, is suggesting that sanctions be put in place for public boards and commissions that don’t require the patriotic oath. Angry emails and voicemails dominated Thursday’s special meeting to reconsider the vote. Nyamal Dei, a refugee who fled war-torn Sudan, played a profanity-laced voicemail from a man who called her a slave, racist and Nazi. Several board members apologized to Dei, the lone Black member on the board, for taking the worst of the abuse. Dei said reversing the decision would be giving in to hate. She paused for several seconds before casting the lone “no” vote to reinstate the pledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A strike by teachers in the state’s largest school district entered its third day Wednesday – the first day of school for some 47,000 students, with some of those students and their parents rallying to their sides. Parents, students, teachers and other employees gathered at schools across the Columbus School District with plans to picket for hours, advocating for safer buildings, better heating and air conditioning, smaller class sizes, and a more well-rounded curriculum that includes art, music and physical education. It’s the union’s first strike in the district since 1975. Picketers blasted music on the sidewalks outside Whetstone High School in Columbus and waved to honking drivers. Some held up signs reading:“Columbus schools deserve working air,” “a history lesson in progress,” and “my feet hurt but I’ll walk as long as it takes.” The school district and the union resumed bargaining Wednesday afternoon. The school board said its offer to the union put children first. The Ohio Education Association said more than 94% of the Columbus Education Association members voted to reject the school board’s final offer late Sunday. The union represents more than 4,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and other employees, though it isn’t clear how many of those 4,000 members were not on the job Wednesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday rejected clemency for a man facing execution Thursday for the 1997 hammer killing of a Choctaw man, despite a recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that his life be spared. James Coddington was convicted and sentenced to die for the beating death of a friend and co-worker, 73-year-old Albert Hale, inside Hale’s Choctaw home. Prosecutors say Coddington, who was 24 at the time, became enraged when Hale refused to give him money to buy cocaine. Coddington’s execution is scheduled for Thursday morning. “After thoroughly reviewing arguments and evidence presented by all sides of the case, Governor Kevin Stitt has denied the Pardon and Parole Board’s clemency recommendation for James Allen Coddington,” Stitt’s office said in a statement. During a clemency hearing this month before the state’s five-member Pardon and Parole Board, an emotional Coddington, now 50, apologized to Hale’s family and said he is a different man today. “I’m clean; I know God; I’m not … I’m not a vicious murderer,” Coddington told the board. “If this ends today with my death sentence, OK.” Coddington’s attorney, Emma Rolls, said Coddington doesn’t have any pending appeals that would delay or stop his execution Thursday.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: The Klamath Irrigation District in southern Oregon plans to defy a U.S. government order issued last week for a halt to water deliveries to farmers in the drought-stricken basin. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation manages the Klamath Project, which includes Klamath Irrigation District and serves 266 square miles of farmland around the Oregon-California border. A limited allocation of water was allowed for irrigators from Upper Klamath Lake this year because of extreme drought. The bureau has said the project is now out of water and ordered a shutdown last week, but irrigation district directors met Monday and authorized the district’s manager, Gene Souza, to continue operations, the Capital Press reports. The district operates a canal that provides water to nine irrigation districts encompassing about 191 square miles. Souza said in a letter to Alan Heck, acting area manager for the U.S. agency, that it has not provided a legal basis for shutting down the project and that doing so would deny farmers of the water they have legal rights to receive. “I am not doing my duty if I just comply because I do not have a legal justification to deny the people I serve their property,” Souza told the Capital Press.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State elections officials said Wednesday that a push last week to recruit new poll workers produced more than 1,100 applicants, including at least one in 58 of 67 counties. The effort tied to Help America Vote Day, organized by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, brought in the most applicants in some of the populous suburbs of Philadelphia – 221 in Montgomery County, 132 in Chester and 91 in Delaware. Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh, drew 100 applicants, while Philadelphia brought in 47. In central Pennsylvania, Lancaster received 71 applications, Dauphin 40 and Cumberland 39. Poll workers, often older people, are paid to help run elections in some 9,000 polling places across the state, but it has been a challenge to recruit and train sufficient numbers of them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poll worker shortages predate the pandemic, however, in part because their work can require 14- or 16-hour days. Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said the influx of 1,146 new candidates was a welcome boost. Some counties promoted the recruitment drive last week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new report suggests ways the city can atone for its extensive ties to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and centuries of racism and discrimination by, among other things, establishing home repair funds, launching financial literacy programs, and boosting aid to Black and Indigenous organizations. The report, issued Monday by the Providence Municipal Reparations Commission, notably doesn’t recommend giving out direct payments to Black and Native American residents, as some had called for. Instead, it defines “reparations” as efforts that close the “present-day racial wealth and equity gaps,” and it outlines 11 areas for the city to focus its reparations work, including criminal justice reform, neighborhood development, health equity, and improving educational and cultural opportunities. Providence’s reparations effort was launched the same year Rhode Island voters approved a ballot referendum getting rid of the words “and Providence Plantations” from the state’s formal name because of its slavery connotations. The new report suggests creating a dedicated fund to support residents touched by urban renewal policies that displaced and negatively affected communities of color. It also calls for forgiving certain municipal court debts; ending police use of so-called no-knock warrants; decriminalizing consumption of alcohol in public; and creating a school curriculum based on the city’s research into its racist and discriminatory policies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A showdown between defense attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh who say prosecutors are unfairly withholding evidence and prosecutors who want the defense to agree to secrecy rules first is heading for a courtroom next week. In their latest court filing, defense lawyers said the secrecy rules as Murdaugh awaits a murder trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and younger son are hypocritical because prosecutors are leaking evidence to media outlets, including a video the leaker said was taken not long before the killings. Prosecutors, including South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson himself, denied the leaks last week. A hearing about the matter is scheduled for Monday at the Colleton County courthouse, where defense attorneys want the murder trial to take place in January. The cellphone video from Murdaugh’s son included Murdaugh talking to his wife outside the family’s Colleton County home where the killings happened, said defense lawyers, who said they hadn’t been given the video, but it was shown to Murdaugh’s family by state agents. The leaked media reports did not include that the conversation was friendly and about dogs, the defense said. Defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian said the state contends that Murdaugh killed his wife and son “for no apparent reason” within minutes of the light-hearted conversation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota is joining other states in filing an amicus brief in defense of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The friend of the court brief involves the U.S. Supreme Court case Brackeen v. Haaland, which challenges the act that establishes federal standards for placement of Native American children in foster of adoptive homes. The act seeks to give the child’s family and tribe the opportunity to be involved in decisions from which they previously may have been excluded, including placement and services. Arguments in the case are scheduled before the high court this November. Stephanie Amiotte, legal director for the South Dakota ACLU, said if the court overturns the law, it could be devastating for tribes. “ICWA was enacted by Congress to address a situation where disproportionate numbers of Indian children were being removed from their homes, and eventually a disproportionate number of them were being adopted into white families,” Amiotte told South Dakota Public Broadcasting. The act’s opponents say the race-based policy is unconstitutional. Amiotte said keeping Indigenous children connected to their culture improves outcomes. “Native American Children have been essentially invisible within the American society,” Amiotte said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The superintendent of the state’s largest school district has resigned as he was being investigated by an outside attorney for allegations that he abused his power and violated policies. The Shelby County School Board accepted the resignation of Joris Ray during a specially called meeting Tuesday evening, officials said in a news release. Ray was appointed to lead Memphis-Shelby County Schools in 2019, and he had worked in the district for more than 24 years. The board had suspended Ray during an investigation stemming from allegations made in divorce proceedings between Ray and his wife, who is also a school district employee. A board resolution says it took action “to review the allegations to determine whether Superintendent Ray, during his tenure as Superintendent, engaged in relationships with District employees violative of MSCS policies.” The investigation was being led by former U.S. Attorney Edward L. Stanton III. In a statement posted on Twitter, Ray thanked colleagues for their “many, many small but powerful acts of devotion and commitment.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas officials have accused the state’s most populous county of defunding some of its law enforcement agencies in violation of a new law that prevents such funding cuts. In a letter sent Monday, Texas Comptroller Glen Hegar alleged leaders in Harris County, where Houston is located, reduced funding for the offices of its constables in the current fiscal year and would again reduce funding next year. Harris County officials pushed back against the claims they were defunding law enforcement, saying they have actually increased funding, proposing a budget for the next fiscal year that would allocate $1.4 billion for justice and safety – which is 75% of the county’s budget and the most ever allocated by the county for public safety. Hegar accused the county of ending a policy that would have let the constables’ offices automatically roll over unspent departmental funds from one fiscal year to the next, resulting in a loss of more than $3 million. He also accused the county of reducing funding for the constables by up to $12 million for the 2022-23 fiscal year. Constables and their deputies are licensed peace officers who have the same powers as regular police officers but also have the added responsibility of civil law enforcement.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican state leaders sued the Biden administration Wednesday over the president’s decision last year to restore two sprawling national monuments on rugged lands sacred to Native Americans that ex-President Donald Trump had downsized. The lawsuit over Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments alleges President Joe Biden’s action violates the authority granted in a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historically, geographically or culturally important. The legal argument has been repeated for years by Republicans, and the legal challenge had been expected since Biden made the move in October 2021. The lawsuit is the latest twist in a years­long debate spanning three presidential administrations about proper protections of lands that include ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. Trump’s decision to cut them in size opened them for mining and other development, although market dynamics kept that in check. “President Biden made no attempt to explain how 3.23 million acres constituted the ‘smallest area compatible with the proper care and management’ of these supposed monuments,” the lawsuit claims, citing the 1906 Antiquities Act outlining rules for designating national monuments.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A woman was attacked by a black bear over the weekend while walking her two dogs on trails on her Strafford property, the state Fish and Wildlife Department reported Tuesday. The 61-year-old woman was treated at Gifford Medical Center in Randolph on Saturday for non-life-threatening injuries, including a bite wound on her leg and multiple scratches, the department said. Fish and Wildlife game wardens and a bear biologist visited the site and concluded that the bear was a female with cubs who was likely provoked when the woman and her dogs surprised the group. They were unable to find the bear and say such attacks are extremely rare in the state. At the time of the attack, the woman had called her two dogs, who were out of sight, when she heard a large noise and realized a bear was charging her, officials said. She told game wardens that she tripped on a stone wall as the bear was charging her and then realized the animal was on top of her and had bitten her. The woman said her Jack Russell terrier barked at the bear, prompting the animal to get off her. She said she left with her dogs without seeing the bear again and called 911 when she got home. She also texted a neighbor to take her to the hospital.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A ratepayer protection that state regulators included in a recent order approving Dominion Energy Virginia’s application to build and recover the costs of a massive offshore wind farm would force the utility to scrap the project, Dominion said in a filing this week. The State Corporation Commission granted approval this month for the 176-turbine, multibillion-dollar project off Virginia Beach. Dominion immediately raised concerns about the commission’s inclusion of a performance guarantee for the wind farm and in a petition Monday asked the regulators to reconsider that element of their order. Dominion “shares the Commission’s concern, as expressed in the Final Order, that the Project be constructed and operated in a way that reasonably mitigates risk for its customers. The Commission’s unprecedented imposition of an involuntary performance guarantee condition on its approvals, however, is untenable,” the filing said. “As ordered, it will prevent the Project from moving forward, and the Company will be forced to terminate all development and construction activities.” The commission’s Aug. 5 order included three “consumer protections,” including the performance guarantee, which it said would protect customers who are paying for the wind farm “from also having to pay for replacement energy if the Project does not generate the amount of electricity upon which Dominion bases its request and its cost estimates.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An analysis of Washington State Ferries data shows ferries are running behind schedule this year more than they have in the past decade, with a consistent decline in on-time performance. Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling told The Seattle Times that with 50% more passengers traveling by ferry in the summer, it is not unusual to see a dip in on-time performance from June to September. But the delays are more pronounced this year, and passengers on the Anacortes/San Juans route face particular problems, according to WSF data. While this route usually records more delays than others, in June, nearly half of all sailings on this route ran behind schedule. The newspaper reports that was a 40 percentage point gap from WSF’s target to run on time for 95% of trips. WSF attributes the lower on-time performance to a staffing shortage and a higher number of passengers on busy routes. On weekends, especially holiday weekends like Labor Day, passengers on popular tourist routes such as Anacortes/San Juans and Port Townsend/Coupeville are more likely to face delays on Thursday and Friday afternoons leaving the Seattle area and returning on Sunday and Monday afternoons. As of July this year, WSF had a 6% decline in staffing since 2019, when it was running at full capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A cleanup project is planned for the Kanawha River next month. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan is sponsoring the 32nd annual Great Kanawha River Cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon Sept. 10. Cleanup sites will be in Kanawha, Putnam and Fayette counties. Anyone who wants to volunteer should register with the department at (800) 322-5530 or christopher.j.cartwright@wv.gov. Bags and gloves will be provided for volunteers, and REAP will arrange for the trash to be hauled away. Volunteers will receive a T-shirt. Last year, 59 volunteers helped remove 1.9 tons of litter and 301 tires from five sites along the Kanawha River.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has rejected a motion by the Milwaukee Police Department that sought to dismiss a case brought by two city residents who claimed their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested near a memorial site for a Black man fatally shot by an officer in 2016. The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin is representing the residents, including Jarrett English and a plaintiff who did not wish to be named. They were arrested Aug. 30, 2016, in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood, where police killed Sylville Smith approximately two weeks earlier. The 23-year-old Smith, who was armed, was running from police who suspected him of dealing drugs. The officer who killed Smith, also Black, was acquitted in the fatal shooting. Smith’s death touched off days of rioting in which businesses were burned, including a gas station, an auto parts store and a beauty supply shop. Firefighters were held back from the gas station blaze because of gunfire. The two plaintiffs, in their 2019 lawsuit, said their rights to the freedoms to assemble and to express themselves were violated when police in riot gear cleared Smith’s memorial site and arrested each of them at separate locations in the neighborhood.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The rush to build wind farms to combat climate change is colliding with preservation of one of the West’s most spectacular predators – the golden eagle – as the species teeters on the edge of decline. Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming, a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate, scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best. Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat to the species: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century, according to a National Audubon Society analysis. That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable – to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world. “We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming, but it doesn’t mean the population is not at risk,” said Bryan Bedrosian, conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, Wyoming. “As we increase wind development across the U.S., that risk is increasing.” Turbines blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles, which are routinely shot, poisoned by lead, hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2023/09/29/banned-books-read-these-books-now-and-why-in-defense-of-books/71008499007/", "title": "Banned books: Why you should read these 51 books right now", "text": "USA TODAY staff\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAs journalists, it's our job to seek out the truth even when it's uncomfortable. We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\nBanned books explained:Book bans are on the rise.

Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/28/pancake-record-battered-sea-tortoise-tourist-coronado-motel-news-around-states/118974670/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A federal judge paved the way for Alabama to proceed with a lethal injection next month, but also reprimanded the state attorney general’s office for giving false information to the court during the litigation centered on forms given to death-row inmates for selecting an execution method. Chief U.S. District Judge Emily C. Marks dismissed a lawsuit that argued the state failed to give Willie Smith, who has an IQ below 75, required help under the Americans with Disabilities Act in filling out forms that affected the timing of his execution. Smith is scheduled to be executed on Oct. 21 by lethal injection for the 1991 kidnapping and murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham. After Alabama authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, the state gave death row inmates a brief window to select that as their execution method. The state has not yet developed a protocol for using nitrogen hypoxia and is not setting execution dates for inmates who requested it. Smith did not turn in a form selecting nitrogen. His attorneys argued that the state was required by law to help intellectually disabled inmates like Smith with the form. Marks dismissed the claim, saying the form was not required by state law and that Smith could have have written on his own to request nitrogen.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state plans to emphasize telework for state employees for the next month as the COVID-19 pandemic strains Alaska’s health care system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, in a memo to state department leaders last week, said the state “must take measures to protect its health care infrastructure while still providing essential government services to its residents.” He wrote that, effective Monday, the state will emphasize telework “to the maximum extent practical, while still maintaining public facing presence and services.” This is to be in effect until Oct. 29, he said. A determination on any possible extensions will be made later, he said. Brian Penner, director of the union that represents supervisory employees, told the Anchorage Daily News the decision was welcomed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Gov. Doug Ducey has ousted and replaced all five members of the Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy in the wake of a newspaper’s critical report about the occupational regulatory panel’s handling of complaints about alleged sexual abuse by therapists. Ducey’s announcement Friday didn’t mention the Arizona Republic’s Sept. 15 investigative report that the board was lax in disciplining therapists accused of abuse, but he said it was crucial that the board “protects massage clients, especially those who are in a vulnerable position.” The announcement also said Ducey’s appointments implemented legislation enacted in 2020 to have the massage board and certain other regulatory panels have majorities of public members once current members’ terms expired. Public members are people not in the regulated occupations. Ducey noted that three of the five new members have experience in victim advocacy and support. The other two are licensed massage therapists with more than 25 years of experience.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:A new individualized-approached, tuition-free charter school will open for Fort Smith high school students next year. The Premier High School-Fort Smith will start enrolling in May and start its first school year in August, said Dennis Felton, state director of Premier schools. The school offers an educational environment that is individualized and small by design, according to the Premier website. “(It’s) for students when traditional school isn’t a fit for them,” said Jake Kurz, director of communications for Responsive Ed. “Sometimes that means a schedule and sometimes that means they need to recover credits (from where) they got behind. Sometimes that means they want to graduate early.” The school's curriculum is more student mastery-based, giving them a chance to work at their pace as opposed to a teacher’s pace, Felton said. The school offers different sessions for students so they can deal with a job or attend to other obligations if needed, Kurz said. The first Premier high school in Arkansas opened in Little Rock in 2013. The Fort Smith school will mark the fourth location in the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: U.S. Rep Karen Bass, D-Calif., intends to launch a campaign for Los Angeles mayor, joining a field of candidates that has rapidly grown over the last week, according to three people familiar with her plans. Such a move would deliver another shakeup to a contest that had been a sleepy affair for much of the year. Bass, a high-profile Democrat who has served in Sacramento and Washington, could announce her entry into the mayor’s race as early as this week, those sources told the Los Angeles Times. If Bass enters the race, she would be a formidable competitor, said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who described himself as an ally of Bass since 1978.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:The Coronado Motel, once one of the few spots in the city Black travelers could rely on for safe accommodation – it was one of a handful of places listed in “The Negro Traveler’s Green Book,” a guidebook that identified facilities hospitable to Black guests during the Jim Crow era – received the Stephen H. Hart Award from History Colorado’s State Historical Fund for its commercial, architectural and ethnic significance. It is one of five sites in Colorado to receive the award this year. The motel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places last year. The owners of the then-Coronado Lodge began officially listing the motel in the Green Book in 1957. The Green Book listed hotels, service stations, restaurants, drug stores and other locations that were safe ports of call for Black travelers, who faced discrimination and the threat of harm while traveling throughout the segregated country. Victor Hugo Green published the book annually until just after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 70 members of the Connecticut National Guard were honored Saturday for their service after completing nearly one-year tours of duty. A welcome home ceremony was held for members of the Middletown-based 143rd Regional Support Group and several members of Detachment 2, Company B, 2nd Battalion, 641st Aviation Regiment at the state armory in Hartford. The Middletown-based soldiers supported Operation Spartan Shield in Jordan from October 2020 to July 2021, overseeing base operations and contracts at various facilities. The Windsor Locks-based aviation regiment conducted 166 C-12 air movement missions throughout eastern Africa in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa from September 2020 to July 2021. “These soldiers left their homes and families during a very difficult time in this country to answer the nation’s call and support U.S. security interests abroad,” Maj. Gen. Francis Evon said in a written statement. “We thank them for their sacrifice and their families who took care of the home front for almost a year. It’s always a great feeling when we get to welcome our people back home after completion of a successful mission.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings has filed a lawsuit against chemical company Monsanto and spinoffs Solutia and Pharmacia, alleging long-lasting damage to the state’s natural resources. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court last Wednesday alleged Monsanto knew as early as 1937 that polychlorinated biphenyls had systemic toxic effects on humans and animals and it seeks to recover damages and clean-up costs, Jennings said in a news release. “Monsanto knew that PCBs were toxic and that once they entered the environment, they would be there to stay,” Jennings said. “Even as PCBs’ environmental harms became undeniable, Monsanto not only continued to manufacture and sell PCBs, but increased production. Now, decades since PCBs were banned, Delaware taxpayers are still footing the cleanup bill. We’re suing Monsanto and its spinoffs to make them pay to clean up their mess.” The suit also claims Monsanto understood and “actively promoted the fact that PCBs do not naturally break down; and continued to manufacture, market and sell PCBs despite full awareness of these dangers.” Bayer, which purchased Monsanto in 2016, responded to the lawsuit saying the company voluntarily ceased all PCB production in 1977, two years before production was banned, The News-Journal reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Students at George Washington University continue to voice concerns about possible mold exposure on campus. In early September, the university ordered 175 students to temporarily evacuate their housing in Townhouse Row, along 23rd Street NW, because of environmental concerns. According to Maralee Csellar, director of communications at George Washington University, a team that inspected the housing identified conditions “conducive to biological growth”. The university did not say it had discovered mold. Around the same time of that investigation, another GW student also claimed he and his roommates had found a mold-like substance in Shenkman Hall, which is a residential tower located across the street from Townhouse Row. Shenkman resident and GW sophomore Luc Saint-Genies said his roommates were coughing for over a week after they found the material in parts of their living unit. Saint-Genies said he and his roommates were recently moved by the university to emergency housing at the River Inn hotel in Foggy Bottom after GW’s facilities division conducted an inspection of their residence. GW moved Townhouse Row students to two hotels, including the River Inn, after its inspection of that site as well.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral:Space Florida, the state’s spaceport authority and aerospace development agency, is investigating what it will take to bring more Space Force operations to Brevard County, an area already home to two military installations, NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, and dozens of commercial spaceflight companies. The branch established in late 2019 still needs to make decisions on where to establish some operations like training centers. Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station were among the first former Air Force facilities to be renamed as Space Force installations. Much like the Marine Corps falls under the purview of the Navy, the Space Force is positioned under Air Force leadership. Mark Bontrager, Space Florida’s vice president for spaceport operations, said, Florida could be an ideal location for training facilities, or what are known as technical schools. Tech schools usually come immediately after basic training and prepare new military members – in this case, Space Force guardians – for their specific roles. Vandenberg Space Force Base near Los Angeles, California, was already selected for the first of five STARCOM sub-commands, or “deltas,” but more selections are expected in the coming months. Its command headquarters, however, is still up for grabs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: Leaders on one of Georgia’s most popular coastal islands are considering letting developers build closer to sand dunes. The Brunswick News reported that a planning commission that governs construction on St. Simons Island is discussing reducing the required setback for new construction in areas with active dunes from 40 feet to 25 feet. The new rule would increase the required setback from 20 feet to 25 feet for an area without dunes. Commissioners agreed Tuesday to postpone action until November to allow time for a public workshop. The idea originated from a planning commission meeting with Glynn County commissioners to discuss growth on the island. Glynn County Commissioner Cap Fendig said the proposed changes would match Georgia Department of Natural Resources rules. Current Glynn County rules are more restrictive. Dunes can protect beaches and inland areas and also provide habitat for plants and wildlife. Alice Keyes of the environmental group One Hundred Miles said rising sea levels make setbacks even more important.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The island of Kauai is planning to revise its coronavirus restriction structure as the delta variant continues to impact the county. Mayor Derek Kawakami said officials will continue to enforce strict COVID-19 safety measures even as the state approaches a vaccination rate of 70%, a milestone earlier set for loosening rules under a tiered reopening plan, The Garden Island reported Friday. “Throughout this pandemic, we have adjusted to the changing realities of COVID-19, and we continually work to keep our community safe while doing everything we can to keep our businesses and activities open,” Kawakami said. Changes will need to be approved by Gov. David Ige. The current tier system would have allowed for all restrictions, including business capacity rules and gathering sizes, to be dropped when the population was 70% vaccinated. About 67% of state residents and 65% of Kauai residents are fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene:, The Coeur d’Alene School District’s Board of Trustees canceled a special meeting on Friday to consider a temporary COVID-19 mask mandate after protesters swarmed the building. The crowd gathered outside of the Midtown Center Meeting Room at 1 p.m., KREM-TV reported. The meeting agenda included a reopening plan for the 2021-2022 school year, including masking and quarantine. Earlier this month, the board adopted a plan that strongly recommended masks be worn in schools. The school district has seen hundreds of positive COVID-19 cases since the first day of school Sept. 7. The meeting was postponed officials said for safety reasons after the crowd banged on doors and shouted at police. A video tweeted by a reporter for KREM showed a large group of people standing outside of the meeting room chanting, “No more masks.” Estimated at up to 200 people, the group then moved to the district’s administrative center, which was placed on lockdown for safety precautions. Many protesters said school board members should be fired for refusing to hold the meeting.\n\nIllinois\n\nEast Moline: Inmates at East Moline Correctional Center have begun a Bachelor of Arts program through Augustana College. State officials said 10 students began studies late in the summer. They are taking courses from professors who lecture on the same subjects on Augustana’s Rock Island campus. It’s the first BA program offered East Moline inmates in more than 20 years. The initial program offers a communications studies major with other majors to be added. The liberal arts curriculum includes history, literature, math, foreign languages, religion, science and the arts. Illinois Department of Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys said a college degree is key to those in custody who want to change their lives and provide financially for their families. Augustana modeled its program after the Bard Prison Initiative. It was featured in the 2019 PBS documentary “College Behind Bars.” Students in the Augustana Prison Education Program pay no tuition or any costs associated with coursework. The program is funded by the Austin E. Knowlton Foundation.\n\nIndiana\n\nGreenwood: Another Indiana school board meeting was disrupted when residents refused to wear face masks while objecting to the district’s requirement. Sheriff’s deputies were called to the Center Grove school board meeting last Thursday night after those not wearing masks wouldn’t leave so the meeting could start, the (Franklin) Daily Journal reported. Those protesting left after two deputies arrived. A similar disruption happened in the southern Indianapolis suburbs as the Clark-Pleasant board meeting in Whiteland was adjourned after just two minutes last week because some people refused to wear masks. State officials have allowed mask rules and other steps to stem COVID-19 spread even as several school boards have faced vocal – and sometimes misleading – opposition to such actions. A man was arrested in July when a handgun fell from his pocket during a Carmel school board meeting, The Bartholomew Consolidated school board in Columbus decided this past week it will hold meetings virtually because of parent conduct. Center Grove’s board could make a similar move, district Superintendent Rich Arkanoff said.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville:Residents gathered to help break a syrupy Guinness World Record on Saturday by plating 14,280 pancakes in a single-serving. A Hy-Vee store in Blue Springs, Missouri, a Kansas City suburb, set the record of 13,000 pancakes in June. Hy-Vee donated 2,400 pounds of pancake mix to help residents break the record during Centerville’s Pancake Day celebration. The Guinness World Record attempt took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. Pancake Day started in 1948 as a way for manufacturers, including a Pillsbury facility, across Centerville show appreciation for their employees by giving them free pancakes. Community members took on the event and turned it into a regional celebration as manufacturers left Centerville. The town typically serves about 17,000 pancakes on Pancake Day, said Centerville Tourism Director Delaney Evers. This year, pancakes had to be made to strict specifications of at least 5 inches in diameter, but no more than 1 centimeter in thickness. About 100 people volunteered to accomplish the feat.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: A suburban Kansas City school district is investigating after a student asked a girl to homecoming using an offensive sign. The sign reads: “If I was Black I would be picking cotton but I’m white so I’m picking you for HOCO.” A picture of two white students holding the sign and smiling that was posted online drew sharp criticism on social media, according to the Kansas City Star. School officials in Olathe said they are working to contact everyone involved, including the parents of the students. “The type of behavior displayed in the social media post does not meet the expectations of our core values,” Olathe South High School Principal Dale Longenecker said in a letter sent to parents. “Any behavior like this will be immediately addressed in accordance with our Student Code of Conduct.” A copy of the photo posted on Twitter was criticized by the Arizona Cardinals Isaiah Simmons’, who grew up in Olathe. “This is disgusting. Sad that people think this is funny or acceptable,” he wrote. “Very disappointing and honestly just sad to see this kind of stuff happening in my hometown. I hope this is handled in the correct manner.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Horse Soldier Bourbon plans to create more than 50 jobs with a new $200 million tourism project in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The Pulaski County site will contain a 27,585-square-foot distillery visitor center; 5,000-person amphitheater; 500-person outdoor event space; 3,200-square-foot wedding chapel; and an activity center, shops and more. Horse Soldier Bourbon was founded by retired members of the U.S. Special Forces who were among the first to enter Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The company has been approved by the Kentucky Tourism Development Finance Authority for $29.9 million in incentives for the project.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGrand Isle: Grand Isle officials said the narrow barrier island is closed to all but people who live there or those who own camps there as residents try to recover from Hurricane Ida’s devastating impacts. In a posting on the town’s website Saturday, officials said the widespread devastation caused the town council and the mayor to make the decision to close the island, which is a destination spot for fishing and vacation getaways. “The decision to close the island was a difficult one,” said Mayor David Camardelle in the announcement, “but it is in everyone’s best interest.” Ida came ashore on Aug. 29 just a few miles away near Port Fourchon. The Category 4 hurricane’s ferocious winds and storm surge destroyed the city’s electrical infrastructure. The town said in its announcement that 80% of the structures on the island sustained damage. According to the post, about 200 personnel from various agencies are on the island specifically to help with the recovery. That number is expected to increase as energy provider, Entergy, works to restore the grid, the statement said. But Grand Isle residents have vowed to come back, despite the damage.\n\nMaine\n\nHampden: The northbound stretch of a $45 million bridge replacement project in the Bangor area is almost finished. The project is called the Hampden Bridge Bundle. The Maine Department of Transportation said it planned to shift traffic onto the fourth of four new northbound Interstate 95 bridges on Monday. The transportation department said traffic is still using three temporary bridges to accommodate construction work on the southbound side of the highway. The department said more southbound traffic shifts are expected, and the project will continue into next year. The entire project requires rebuilding eight bridges and rehabilitating a ninth along a 4-mile stretch of the interstate in Hampden.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Four enormous container cranes have arrived in their new home in Baltimore after a two-month trip from China. The cranes, which are some of the tallest in the world, squeezed under the Chesapeake Bay and Key Bridges on their way to the Port of Baltimore, stopping traffic on the spans on Sept. 9, news outlets reported. Each crane is about 450 feet tall, about 25 feet taller than the current cranes, port officials said. With the cranes hanging off each side of the ship, they were about 176 feet tall, leaving just about 10 feet of clearance under the bridges, according to the state and Coast Guard. The new cranes will help double the port’s container capacity once the Howard Street Tunnel is expanded to allow freight trains to carry containers stacked two-high. Ports America Chesapeake, which runs the Seagirt Marine Terminal under a lease with the state, purchased the massive cranes, which will allow longshoremen to unload two even larger and wider container ships at once. The 1,740-ton cranes can reach 23 containers across a container ship and each can lift 187,500 pounds of cargo at once.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLowell: A University of Massachusetts Lowell researcher has received a $2.7 million federal grant to continue her research into the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The National Institutes of Health grant will help engineering associate professor Joyita Dutta look at the disease from a network perspective, viewing the interconnections between the regions of the brain, the university said in a statement last week. She will use machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to build models from existing patient imaging data. She aims to develop models that predict the progression of primary protein markers for Alzheimer’s disease. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 5.8 million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s last year. That number is projected to rise to 14 million by 2060. There is no known cure for the disease.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast China Township:Three years after DTE Energy paid more than $5,000 to relocate rare milkweed plants at its future Blue Water Energy Center site in East China Township, the plants are thriving. Daniel Okon, a DTE Energy senior environmental specialist, said 400 Sullivant’s milkweed stems were relocated in 2018 and the population has grown to 502 stems. Milkweed is the host plant for the monarch butterfly, a candidate under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Milkweed and flowering plants are needed for monarch habitat. Adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many flowers, but they breed only where milkweeds are found, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Sullivant’s milkweed differs from common milkweed, with smooth leaves instead of the common variety’s rough leaves, and a pink vein pressed closely to the stems. Sullivant’s milkweed is classified as threatened and legally protected in Michigan. It has been observed in eight Michigan counties with the most occurrences found in St. Clair County, according to scientific biodiversity resource the Michigan Natural Features Inventory.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz proposed a $10 million relief package for farmers who suffered losses because of drought across most of Minnesota this summer – a plan that would require a special legislative session to approve. The Democratic governor’s proposal includes $5 million in rapid response grants for livestock producers and specialty crop growers for costs of water-related equipment such as tanks, pipelines, wells, water wagons and irrigation equipment. It also includes $5 million for zero-interest disaster recovery loans for losses not covered by insurance. But Walz said he’s still insisting that Senate Republicans agree not to fire Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm if he calls lawmakers back for a special session that was already in the works for a $250 million bonus package for front-line workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Negotiators from the House Democratic and Senate GOP majorities and the Walz administration missed a Labor Day target for agreeing to which workers are most deserving and how much money they should get. Republicans so far have not backed off a threat to use the Senate’s confirmation powers to oust Malcolm over the administration’s pandemic response. Walz called on them to “put the political posturing and things aside” and get both packages done without ousting his health commissioner.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A hospital in the Mississippi Delta has been losing millions of dollars a year, and its CEO said the problems are exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic as nurses, laboratory technicians and respiratory therapists are being hired by out-of-state hospitals for short-term contract work at higher salaries. Leaders of Greenwood Leflore Hospital held closed-door hearings in the past week to brief local officials and its employees about proposals for a financial turnaround. CEO Jason Studley said no layoffs or terminations are anticipated, although some positions might not be filled as employees leave, the Greenwood Commonwealth reported. Studley told the newspaper he would publicly release details of the financial plan in the coming week. The hospital has about 1,000 employees and is owned by the city of Greenwood and Leflore County. Local government officials asked for Tuesday’s meeting. “I think we’re on the right track to move forward,” said Leflore County Supervisor Sam Abraham after emerging from the closed-door session with the hospital board and top administrators. The hospital has spent nearly all of the $25 million in federal pandemic relief money. For the first 11 months of the current budget year, it has lost $13.2 million, even after using $11 million in federal grant money. For the same period last year, the loss was $755,000 when $15.5 million in coronavirus grant money was used. The hospital started the current budget year with $52.8 million cash on hand. By the end of August, it had $28.3 million.\n\nMissouri\n\nWoodson Terrace: The FBI has opened an investigation into the arrest of a Black man during which cellphone video showed three white officers allowing a police dog to repeatedly bite him. Woodson Terrace police Chief Randy Halstead said in an email to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that his department was “fully cooperating” with the investigations being conducted by the FBI and the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office into last week’s arrest. Federal officials and St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell declined to discuss their investigations with the newspaper. Officers were called Monday morning to a report that a man had broken into a business in Woodson Terrace, according to a police statement posted on Facebook. The man appeared to be on drugs and threatened officers, and they warned him the dog would be used if he continued to resist arrest, the department wrote. Cellphone video from an onlooker showed the dog biting the man’s foot as he yells. The dog’s handler holds it by a leash but allows the biting to go on for about 30 seconds. After the officer pulls off the dog, the man appears to take a step but stumbles and the dog lunges at him again, biting a leg for another 30 seconds until the officer stops the animal. The man was treated at a hospital and released. He hasn’t been charged with any crimes. Protesters gathered outside the Woodson Terrace Police Department on Friday to demand the firing and prosecution of the three officers.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A coalition including worker unions and a disability rights group filed a lawsuit last Wednesday against Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over a law passed earlier this year that eliminates same-day voter registration. The lawsuit was filed by the Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana AFL-CIO, the Montana Association of Centers for Independent Living, and several citizens. Montana Federal of Public Employees president Amanda Curtis called the law “a slap in the face” to the tens of thousands of Montana residents who use same-day voter registration and to the majority of Montanans who voted to maintain election-day registration when the question was on the ballot in 2014. “People who work for a living do not always have the privilege to register to vote or address their issues with their registration during the regular business hours,” said Montana AFL-CIO Executive Secretary James Holbrook. County election offices are open later on Election Day. Montana Independent Living Project advocacy coordinator Joel Peden said same-day registration eases the experience of people living with disabilities by saving the need for two trips to election offices. Republicans who supported the measure have said the law would help election officials conduct elections more efficiently while reducing long lines and voter frustration on election day. Secretary of State spokesman Richie Melby called the lawsuit “completely baseless.” This is the fourth lawsuit challenging the same law passed earlier this year by the Republican-dominated Legislature.\n\nNebraska\n\nDakota City: The owners of a defunct biogas plant in northeast Nebraska have agreed to pay a $1.1 million fine to the state and federal governments for repeated violations of environmental rules. Big Ox Energy and its owners agreed to pay the fine as part of a settlement with regulators. The company and its insurers previously agreed to be part of a separate $1.75 million settlement with homeowners who accused the plant of sending rancid fumes through the city sewer system and ruining their homes. Big Ox began operations in September 2016, separating solids from industry wastewater to create methane. The plant sold the methane and injected it into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Big Ox was subject to odor complaints soon after it began operations and was cited for numerous environmental violations until it shut down in 2019. “The Big Ox facility’s operations presented a significant risk to their workers and nearby property owners,” said acting regional EPA Administrator Edward H. Chu. The EPA said that some of the liquid wastewater went over the sides of the facility’s roof and onto the ground at least 16 times between 2017 and 2019. On one occasion in 2018, a malfunction at the plant resulted in 80,000 gallons of liquid wastewater overflowing from its equipment. At times the plant was also discharging methane at levels that could be flammable and hydrogen sulfide in amounts that could cause injury or death if it was inhaled.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Great Basin Institute has been awarded a $160,000 federal grant to establish a professional recreational trail building school, which would be the first of its kind in the nation. The funds came from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. The proposed school will be in Ely. The hope is to draw outdoor recreation professionals from all over the U.S. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto praised the idea of the school. She said it will enhance Nevada’s reputation as an outdoor recreation destination, create more jobs and give students practical experience. Kyle Horvath, director of White Pine County Tourism and Recreation, said Ely is an ideal spot with its proximity to the Mountain West.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is making some of its pandemic-related graduation ceremony changes permanent. The school traditionally has held one large ceremony in its outdoor football stadium, but because of the pandemic, it divided seniors up by their colleges and held a handful of separate ceremonies. That gave students the chance to walk across the stage and receive their diplomas instead of being recognized all at once, and officials have decided to keep that practice going forward. Starting in May, commencement exercises will be moved indoors to the Whittemore Center and graduates will be split up by academic college, the Foster’s Daily Democrat reported.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Construction of a nearly 120-mile-long proposed natural gas pipeline from northeastern Pennsylvania to central New Jersey will not go forward, the group behind the project said Monday. PennEast Pipeline Company, which won a recent legal fight against New Jersey at the Supreme Court, nonetheless said the state has failed to provide certain permits and is putting the project on ice. “PennEast partners, following extensive evaluation and discussion, recently determined further development of the Project no longer is supported. Accordingly, PennEast has ceased all further development of the Project,” spokesperson Pat Kornick said in an email. The decision is the latest swing in a long-running effort to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. It’s also a major victory for environmental groups who opposed the project, arguing it would cut a scar across the landscape, threaten wildlife and contribute the use of fossil fuels. PennEast, a company made up of five energy firms, won federal and Pennsylvania permitting approvals including a key Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate that could allow the firm to use eminent domain to acquire land. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court said companies building interstate pipelines can obtain the land they need even in the face of state opposition, once their projects have been given the green light by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Trump and Biden administrations had supported PennEast. Nineteen states had urged the Supreme Court to rule the other way and side with New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Rio Rancho Public Schools canceled classes Monday because of an internet service outage. Officials sent a letter to parents Sunday saying a damaged fiber optic circuit was causing the outage. With no internet, some key systems that involve safety and student transportation would be at risk. District officials said contractors are coming from out of state to do the repairs. Classes were expected to resume Tuesday.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has stopped paying legal bills for employees who worked for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo as he faces ongoing investigations on the state and federal levels. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s spokesperson Haley Viccaro said last Wednesday that the state stopped paying for those aides’ legal bills after Sept. 2. The administration is now deciding whether there is a legal basis for the state to pay bills for legal services on or before Sept. 2. Viccaro did not specify how many staffers had legal bills paid for by the state. Cuomo and his former aides face an ongoing investigation by the state attorney general into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote about his leadership during the pandemic and scrutiny from federal prosecutors who are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. Cuomo is also facing a state ethics commission inquiry. The state has agreed to pay a maximum of $9.5 million in bills for attorneys representing Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, as well as for attorneys investigating the former governor and his administration, according to the Associated Press’ review of available contracts. That figure includes up to $5 million for attorneys who have represented Cuomo’s office. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, Rita Glavin, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A construction company founded by former NFL players and brothers Torry and Terrence Holt will build a project designed to honor the contributions of African Americans in North Carolina. Leaders of the North Carolina Freedom Park initiative announced Monday that the Black-owned Holt Brothers Construction has been awarded the contract to complete the $5.4 million project in Raleigh. The park, to be located between the Executive Mansion and the Legislative Building. will be anchored by the Beacon of Freedom, a piece of public art that will be illuminated at night. Freedom Park’s leaders broke ground last fall on the park, which is expected to be completed by next year. The Holts grew up in Gibsonville and played at North Carolina State University. Torry Holt was an All-America wide receiver and played on the Super Bowl-winning St. Louis Rams in 2000. The brothers’ construction company has completed other projects such as a Durham County library renovation and North Carolina Central University’s new student center. Freedom Park was designed by the late architect Phil Freelon, who also designed the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington, and the Durham firm Perkins & Will.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota’s only congressman, is in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus. Armstrong said in a Twitter post Sunday that he had been experiencing mild coronavirus symptoms and took a test which came back positive. The 44-year-old Republican said he has been vaccinated. “I have been fully vaccinated since January, and I am taking all precautions and recovering at home in North Dakota. I have been advised by my doctor to quarantine for ten days,” Armstrong wrote. Armstrong said he has contacted friends in Congress and will be casting his votes this week by proxy, as Capitol Hill gears up for a busy week that includes a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure package. “Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to be in D.C. next week,” Armstrong wrote. “However, the votes we are taking are simply too important to miss, so I have reached out to friends in Congress and I will be casting my votes by proxy.”\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:Summa Health is reducing inpatient hospital beds by more than 20% and temporarily stopping some elective surgeries while the Akron-based health system tries to adjust to a nationwide staffing shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a memo distributed to staff at 9 a.m. Monday, hospital executives said Summa would make multiple adjustments to help the care of patients as health care staff at Summa and nationwide are in some cases burned out and leaving the health care field. “We are no longer able to maintain the current level of capacity in our hospitals and we must make adjustments to align with the current level of clinical staff,” Summa executives said. The following measures will go into effect immediately: adjusting the combined inpatient bed capacity at Akron City and Barberton hospitals from 551 to about 430 by Oct. 24; the number of available inpatient beds will be cut from 439 to about 350 at Akron City Hospital and 112 to 80 at Barberton Hospital; improve Emergency Department flow by embeding specialists, primary care physicians and/or hospitalists in the emergency department on the Akron and Barberton campuses to initiate care more efficiently. There will be no changes at St. Thomas Hospital, which treats Summa’s behavioral health patients.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:A northwest Oklahoma City church hopes to become a transitional living community to temporarily house individuals experiencing homelessness and provide support to help them find permanent housing and a brighter future. Clark Memorial United Methodist Church wants to build up to 20 small structures similar to tiny homes or tiny housing units on its property. The Rev. Bo Ireland, the church’s senior pastor, is also executive director of what is being called the Lazarus Community at Clark Memorial. The name of the new housing community comes from well-known scripture which told the story of Jesus raising a man named Lazarus from the dead. “It’s a ministry that will be bringing back those who are homeless to a restored state,” Ireland said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Despite a threat to block new political maps, Republican state lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday – the final day for the Legislature to complete redistricting. Enough GOP lawmakers returned to the House floor to achieve a quorum required to vote. With the Republican reverse, it is likely Democrats will pass new district maps – including a sixth, U.S. House seat. Congressional plans were sent to the redistricting committee on Monday morning to be formally adopted and the House was scheduled to reconvene at 1 p.m. Although Oregon Democrats hold the majority in both legislative chambers, they don’t have enough seats to vote without a few Republicans present. As the House convened Monday morning,47 of 60 House members were present – 40 lawmakers are needed to meet quorum. The Oregon Legislature had until the end of the day on Monday to participate in the once-a-decade job of redrawing the state’s congressional and legislative districts in accordance with new U.S. Census numbers. If lawmakers missed the deadline, the job of redrawing congressional maps would fall to a panel of five current and former judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court, and Democratic Secretary of State Shemia Fagan will be tasked with redrawing the state’s legislative districts. On Saturday, Republicans in the House did not show up for a floor session, upset that Democratic House Speaker Tina Kotek earlier this week rescinded a deal she made with them to split power in the redistricting debate, even though Democrats have large majorities in the Senate and House.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Transgender women in Pennsylvania tried again Monday to knock down state rules that govern legal name changes for people with felony records. The state requires them to wait two years after completing their sentence to apply for a name change. People who have committed the most serious felonies, including rape and murder, are barred from changing their legal names. The 1998 rules are meant to enhance public safety and thwart fraud attempts. However, advocates said the transgender community simply wants the right to use names that match their identities rather than their dead or given names. Gabriel Arkles, senior counsel of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, said his clients risk being harassed if they apply for jobs, or are stopped by police, and show identification that doesn’t match their gender identities. “For the people it affects, it has such a profound affect,” Arkles said. “Our clients are transgender people who are just trying to live their lives and are not trying to commit any fraud.” Similar efforts have been underway in other states, with varying degrees of success, he said. Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court, which handles cases involving state agencies, dismissed a related lawsuit last year on procedural grounds without addressing the underlying constitutional claims.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An open government coalition is asking Democratic Gov. Dan McKee to allow public agencies to hold meetings online because of a surge of COVID-19 infections. ACCESS/RI said it sent a letter to McKee asking him to issue an executive order because his previous order to waive the requirement that members of public bodies meet in person expired in July. Since then, the coalition said, some public bodies have had difficulty getting enough members to attend in person for a quorum and some members of the public have been reluctant to attend. “Members of the public face a choice between their health and their ability to participate in our democracy,” the coalition said. State legislatures in neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts codified similar executive orders to allow for online meetings until the spring, the coalition added. Rhode Island’s legislature considered allowing online meetings until July 2023, which ACCESS/RI opposed because of the length of time and the belief that in-person meetings should be the default.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: Crews are getting ready to start restoring windows in a century-old building in Beaufort that were damaged by hurricanes over the past several years. The work on the 29 windows of the Carnegie Library building is being paid for through a $188,000 federal grant, The Island Packet of Hilton Head reported. Work is expected to start in October and last six months. The windows were damaged when Hurricane Matthew passed just offshore in 2016 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. Beaufort officials also hired a building preservation expert to look at the entire former library and provide an estimate for any other worked needed to preserve it. The library in downtown Beaufort is one of 14 in South Carolina and more than 1,600 public libraries across the United States funded by steel industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The old library now houses the Beaufort/Port Royal Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been awarded an $11 million federal grant to develop better material and manufacturing technology to withstand cold weather. South Dakota Mines will partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Cold Regions and Engineering Lab. The research will be done over five years and is aimed at developing better materials and technology to support the Army’s military objectives in cold and remote regions. U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said funding for the project has been his top defense appropriation request for three years, the Rapid City Journal reported. Dr. Jim Rankin, president of South Dakota Mines, said the research is a win-win for the university and for national defense.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:A state senator charged with stealing $600,000 in federal grant money from a health care school she operated has been acquitted on 15 of 20 charges, according to court records. U.S. District Court Judge Sheryl Lipman filed the order Sunday after attorneys for Sen. Katrina Robinson filed a motion Friday seeking acquittal on all charges, Memphis news outlets reported. Robinson, 40, a Memphis Democrat elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2018, was charged in July 2020 with wire fraud, as well as theft and embezzlement involving government programs after the FBI searched the school and her home. She was accused of stealing federal grant money awarded to The Healthcare Institute, which provides training in the health care field, including nursing assistant jobs in geriatric care. The school received more than $2.2 million in federal grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The federal grant money was earmarked for student scholarships from 2015 through 2019. Robinson’s attorneys argued for an acquittal Friday after federal prosecutors rested their case. They argued that prosecutors didn’t prove allegations that Robinson used the federal grant funds on personal expenses. The trial was expected to continue Tuesday on the five remaining charges, court filings showed..\n\nTexas\n\nSouth Padre Island: A large loggerhead sea turtle rehabilitated at the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital was flown by private plane Sunday to live at a conservation facility in Texas. The 230-pound female turtle took the nearly 5-hour flight from the Middle Keys to South Padre Island, with the help of “Turtles Fly Too,” a nonprofit group that works with general aviation pilots who donate their aircraft, fuel and time to provide emergency transport for endangered species. Matthew, named for one of her rescuers before her sex was determined, suffered injuries to her shell in May 2020 from a boat strike that left her unable to dive and forage for food – a condition termed “bubble butt syndrome” by the hospital’s rehabilitation staff. “She’s being transported to Sea Turtle Inc. in South Padre Island because she’s unable to dive,” said Bette Zirkelbach, the Turtle Hospital’s general manager, who accompanied the reptile during the flight. “That makes her nonreleasable and she will act as an ambassador for her species there at the Texas facility where they see lots of visitors.” The reptile joins other rehabilitated, nonreleasable turtle patients at Sea Turtle Inc., located on the Gulf of Mexico. The organization’s conservation outreach programs are designed to raise public awareness about sea turtles and the threats to their survival. Matthew’s carapace has been fitted with weights, fashioned to adhere to the shell and help the turtle submerge and rest comfortably during her residency at the Texas center.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The St. George Marathon returns Saturday for its 45th edition and the first since 2019 after the 2020 race was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is set to start at its usual spot north of the city along State Route 18 at the base of the Pine Valley Mountains and descending nearly 2,600 feet in elevation back to the finish line downtown. The race starts at 7 a.m. and will force some road closures and detours along SR-18 and a number of streets in and around downtown. “We are so excited to have the marathon back in 2021. It is St. George’s signature event,” said Michelle Graves, race director and the Deputy Director of Arts and Events for the city of St. George. “This might be the best St. George Marathon ever. There has been a vibrant return to racing and we are happy to have a strong field of runners for this year's event.” This year's event will include a mini-marathon starting at 6:15 a.m, with races of 1 mile and 200 meters at Vernon Worthen Park. Children ages 3 to 12 and people with special needs are invited to participate. After the races, a party in the park is set to last until 8 a.m. Organizers expect about 7,000 runners to participate. Many others have signed on to be volunteers. The annual Mayor's Walk is also scheduled for Saturday morning, with Mayor Michele Randall leading a 1-mile walk from the Washington County School District offices at 121 W. Tabernacle Street over to Vernon Worthen. The marathon has been run every year except last year since 1977 and is regularly rated as one of the most scenic races in the country, as well as one of the fastest because of its downhill course.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Registration opened Monday for Vermonters ages 75 and older to get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster. On Wednesday, people 70 and older can start signing up followed by the 65-and-older age group on Friday. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed booster shots for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans six months after receiving their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. On Friday, those ages 18 to 64 with underlying medical conditions or who work in certain occupational settings will become eligible for boosters, the state said. The state is waiting for guidance from the CDC on the type of underlying medical conditions and occupational settings. Booster shots are available where Pfizer vaccines are offered, including at a Health Department clinic, pharmacy or health care provider, state officials said. People must make an appointment to get a shot at a state clinic and are asked to bring their vaccine cards with them. Information can be found on the Vermont Health Department website.\n\nVirginia\n\nLafayette: A small earthquake shook southwestern Virginia on Monday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 2.6 happened about 9:37 a.m. It was centered about 2.5 miles north of Lafayette, and was about 8 miles deep. News outlets reported that people in nearby Salem reported feeling the ground shaking, but there were no immediate reports of damage.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Twenty-five media and transparency groups are asking the state Supreme Court to allow the release of the names of the Seattle police officers who attended events in the nation’s caital on Jan. 6. The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press and the news organizations filed an amicus brief Friday asking the court to deny an injunction filed by the officers that seeks to block the release of public records that identify the officers. Police officers “are public servants who, when on-duty, wield tremendous power to detain, arrest, jail, and, in extreme circumstances, employ deadly force in connection with their duties,” the groups said. “Without access to officer names, the public has no insight into whether certain officers have been the subject of multiple misconduct investigations or whether police oversight boards are effectively evaluating and responding to repeated misconduct complaints, particularly when such complaints are deemed unsubstantiated.” The officers have argued that they did nothing wrong and revealing their names would violate their privacy. But the media groups said their attendance at a public demonstration that drew thousands of people and news organizations was not a private activity. A message left for Mike Solan, the president of the Seattle Police Officer’s Guild, seeking comment was not immediately returned. Arguments before the Supreme Court are set for Nov. 9.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia internet customers are being asked to take a broadband speed test to improve access in the state. “Data collected from the speed test will be instrumental in making decisions about broadband access in West Virginia moving forward,” state Department of Economic Development Secretary Mitch Carmichael said in a news release. Information from the tests will be used to create a map identifying where investment in broadband is needed most, the agency said. The test is available at broadband.wv.gov. Click the red button that reads “TAKE THE SPEED TEST” at the top of the page and follow the steps. A few additional questions about location and internet service follow the test, and the whole process takes about 5 minutes. The Broadband Enhancement Council is also involved in publicizing the speed test through a campaign using text messages and digital advertising.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Cardinal Raymond Burke, 73, one of Catholic Church’s most outspoken conservatives and a vaccine skeptic who was placed on a ventilator after contracting COVID-19, said he has moved into a house but is still struggling to recover from the disease. Burke posted a letter on his website Saturday saying he left a hospital Sept. 3 and moved into a house near his family. He didn’t say where. Burke said he’s going through in-home rehabilitation, still suffers from fatigue and has difficulty breathing. He didn’t detail what his rehabilitation regimen included but said he is making steady but slow progress. He said a secretary from Rome has moved in with him to help him with his rehabilitation and catch up on his work. “I cannot predict when I will be able to return to my normal activities,” Burke wrote. “Seemingly, it will be several more weeks.” He said God saved him for “some work” he wants him to carry out with the help of the church and asked people to pray for him, the world and the church, all of which are “beset with so much confusion and error to the great and even mortal harm of many souls.” He didn’t elaborate.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Felicia, a mama grizzly bear whose troubles won the hearts of the Internet, has successfully shepherded her cubs through a perilous summer. Her fans miss seeing the bear family grazing and frolicking along Togwotee Pass. But they hope, for Felicia’s sake, that she will stay out of sight. This spring, record numbers of tourists were clogging the roads around Wyoming’s national parks when Felicia emerged from hibernation with two fuzzy, bumbling, roly-poly cubs, and established herself by the side of the highway. Passersby were mesmerized. Bear jams proliferated. The congestion wasn’t just a nuisance, however. Too many drivers were spotting Felicia and her cubs, swerving to the side of a 55 mph highway and leaving their cars to approach the bears – in violation of posted signs that forbade exactly that, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Three government agencies that watch over Felicia, the highway and the land she inhabited, lacked the resources to continually enforce parking laws or uphold the protections that grizzlies, a threatened species, are afforded under the Endangered Species Act. So rather than attempt to manage the people, officials managed the bear. Rangers typically use pain and noise to train bears to fear undesirable locations. That strategy, known as hazing, separated Felicia from her surviving cub for a month in 2019. Though the two ultimately reunited, the cub didn’t survive the following winter. Hazing, though less risky than relocation, isn’t a perfect solution. It can cause bears to act erratically around roads, increasing the risk of collisions. It can separate mothers from their cubs – sometimes temporarily, like with Felicia in 2019, and sometimes permanently. But it can also work. In Felicia’s case, hazing has been effective. Nearly four months after Felicia – known to rangers as grizzly 863 – fled a barrage of rubber bullets, beanbags and noisemakers, the bear has maintained her distance from roads, vehicles and people, and has kept her cubs by her side.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/02/mikiztil-festival-exorcism-ranch-storms-underwater-impact-news-around-states/50894879/", "title": "Mikiztil festival, exorcism ranch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: As early as next summer, Tuskegee University plans to move the needle in cancer genomics – the study of DNA sequence and gene expression differences between tumor cells and normal cells. With a $7.93 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the university will build a new biomedical annex to its Carver Research Center to focus on cancer research and health disparities in underrepresented populations. “This award is recognition for the dedicated effort of the faculty, staff and students within the Center for Biomedical Research to eradicate health disparities, particularly in Alabama Black Belt,” Center for Biomedical Research director Dr. Clayton Yates said in a statement. “Students, particularly African-Americans and other underrepresented minorities, will receive training to become excellent biomedical research scientists, significantly benefitting from this state-of-the-art enhancement.” Booker T. Washington founded the historically Black university in 1881 with the purpose of educating Black teachers. Since then, the school has expanded its mission to include educating students for careers in the sciences, architecture, business and engineering. It also forged a path in bioethics for HBCUs. Tuskegee formed its National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care in response to the violations committed during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed in state court is challenging the eligibility of a legislative candidate to hold the seat. The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Democrat Jennifer “Jennie” Armstrong did not meet residency requirements on the date she filed to run for office. The complaint seeks an injunction barring state elections officials from certifying Armstrong as the winner of her Anchorage House race should she garner the most votes. Armstrong faces Republican Liz Vazquez in next week’s election. The case, brought by Chris Duke, Randy Eledge, Steve Strait and Kathryn Werdahl, names the state Division of Elections and its director as defendants. The plaintiffs are described as “public interest litigants.” Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson with the state Department of Law, said Tuesday morning that the department had not yet been served an official copy of the complaint and could not comment on the specific allegations. But she said that Armstrong has been certified for the ballot based on information she provided in her declaration of candidacy and that the time for any challenge to her eligibility under a state law and regulation has expired. “There is no process for the Division to find a candidate disqualified based on residency at this point in the process,” Sullivan said by email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Crowds gathered at Steele Indian School Park on Sunday to honor the Indigenous roots of Día de los Muertos at the annual Mikiztil festival. “The Mikiztil is the painted decorated skull that you see, and it represents not death but transcendence,” said Zarco Guerrero, president, chair and co-founder of Cultural Coalition, the host organization of the event. Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, an ancient Mexican celebration with Indigenous Aztec roots, is typically observed Nov. 1-2 during the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day. During this time, people honor their deceased relatives and invite their spirits back from beyond to join their families in the celebration. The Día de los Muertos celebration well-known today in the U.S. is a medley of Indigenous origins of the tradition mixed with forced Spanish and Catholic influence from the Europeans who conquered the lands of Indigenous people, according to Carmen Guerrero, executive director and co-founder of Cultural Coalition. The Mikiztli festival aims to revive and celebrate its Indigenous origins. “We’re trying to go back to the ancestral understanding of what this event really means. ... It was never about death. It was always about transcending to the next life,” Zarco Guerrero said. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego acknowledged the city’s support and welcomed the crowd to the event. Shortly after began the Danza Mexica, a form of ancestral worship to what the Aztecs described as the four sacred directions: north, south, east and west.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The FBI is investigating after several people in the city told police someone called and said their children had been kidnapped and then demanded a ransom. The calls’ claims have been fake but are being investigated by local and federal law officers. Since Thursday, police took reports of a series of calls from across the city about kidnappings. The caller used the same phone number to claim that the targets’ children had been kidnapped and that they would only give the children back if a ransom were paid, police said. “These calls have been investigated and are confirmed to be scams,” according to a Fort Smith news release. In one of the calls, the victim’s child was confirmed safe. In another, the victim did not even have any children. “When the caller is pressed, their knowledge of the victims and the area appears to be limited and superficial,” police said. Anyone who gets a kidnapping call or any other suspicious call can report it to Fort Smith police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at fbi.gov/tips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Hoopa Valley Tribe alleged in a lawsuit Monday that the federal government is violating its sovereignty and failing to collect money from California farms that rely on federally supplied water to pay for damages to tribal fisheries. The tribe, which has a reservation in northwest California, says in its lawsuit against the Biden administration that the Trinity River that it relies on for food and cultural purposes has been decimated by decades of the federal government diverting water. The suit alleges the U.S. Department of the Interior has failed to follow laws that require the contractors who use that water to pay money for habitat restoration projects. It says those contractors owe $340 million for environmental restoration work along the Trinity River and other places damaged by water diversions. “The river has become a place that is no longer a healing place, but a place that is a sick place,” said Jill Sherman-Warne, a member of the Hoopa tribal council. The suit also alleges that the federal government has failed to appropriately consult with the tribe on matters related to the river. The Interior Department declined to comment through spokesman Tyler Cherry.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man has been sentenced to more than 23 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to shooting a ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park last year. The ranger was wearing a bulletproof vest and wasn’t seriously injured. Daron Ellis, 29, of Aurora, was sentenced Monday in federal court in Denver after pleading guilty to attempted murder of a federal officer and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, The Denver Post reports. The Dec. 8 shooting occurred after a Colorado State Patrol officer tried to stop Ellis outside the park for speeding. The trooper learned the car was stolen and ordered Ellis to leave the car, but Ellis sped off, authorities said. A National Park Service Law Enforcement ranger spotted the car at the Fall River entrance to the national park in Colorado and ordered Ellis to show his hands. Ellis shot the ranger in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun; the ranger returned fire, wounding Ellis, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The ranger’s identity hasn’t been released. Rocky Mountain National Park is about 50 miles northwest of Denver.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A former state representative pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than $1.2 million in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven, using some of the money for gambling at a casino, according to prosecutors. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud conspiracy. DiMassa’s wife and his former business partner also pleaded guilty earlier this year, while a fourth person charged in the scheme awaits trial. At the time of the theft, DiMassa was both a state representative and an aide to the West Haven City Council. Prosecutors alleged he used his city position, which had authority to approve the reimbursement of COVID-19 expenditures, to steal the funds – some of which he used for gambling at the Mohegan Sun Casino in eastern Connecticut. DiMassa resigned from both positions after his arrest last year. No sentencing date was set for DiMassa. The sentencing guideline range for the charges to which he pleaded guilty is 41 to 51 months.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After years of hovering slightly under 1 million residents, the First State has surpassed that milestone − but just barely, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The government estimated this summer that in July 2021, Delaware had 1,003,384 residents. Census Bureau data lags by about a year. While Delaware’s overall population growth has remained steady at an average of 1% per year since 2010, adults 65 and older have seen the fastest-growing numbers, with that population increasing 55% in the 11-year period. In contrast, the 35-to-49 age group declined the most, dropping 4.2% in the same time frame. Currently, the 50-to-64 age group makes up the largest share of Delaware’s population, at 20.5%. The 65-and-up age group comes in close second, however, making up 20.1% of the state’s population. Though adults ages 50 to 64 still account for the largest percentage of the state’s population, the rapid growth of the 65-plus age group comes as no surprise given the trend is also being seen nationally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living found.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After decades of planning and years of delays, the D.C. region’s Metrorail system will open a long-awaited extension to Dulles International Airport in about two weeks. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Monday that the second phase of its Silver Line extension into Loudoun County and the northern Virginia airport will open to passengers Nov. 15. The $3 billion extension adds more than 11 miles of track and six new stations. It has been plagued by cost overruns and criminal charges against contractors who falsified records to try to hide faulty concrete. It was originally scheduled to open in 2018 but faced numerous delays. The opening comes at a time where the Metrorail system continues to face a significant drop in ridership from its pre-pandemic levels, as well as an anticipated budget gap. In recent weeks, Metro officials had said they could not open the new line until safety regulators allowed the system’s 7000 series rail cars to return to use. They had been pulled from service after a derailment. Regulators approved a plan last week to return enough of the cars to service ahead of Thanksgiving to allow the Silver Line extension to open.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Hurricane Ian ravaged southwest Florida on land but was destructive underwater as well. It destroyed human-made reefs and brought along red tide, the harmful algae blooms that kill fish and birds, according to marine researchers who returned last week from a six-day cruise organized by the Florida Institute of Oceanography. Researchers who used the cruise to study marine life in the Gulf of Mexico following the hurricane say it left in its wake red tide and destroyed artificial reefs from as far away as 30 miles from the coast of southwest Florida. “The onetime vibrant reefs are now underwater disaster sites themselves,” said Calli Johnson, safety dive officer for the research cruise. “Where there used to be a complete ecosystem, there are now only fish that were able to return after swimming away.” Before the Category 4 storm made landfall a month ago, southwest Florida had a reputation for being one of the best saltwater fishing destinations in the U.S. Saltwater and freshwater fishing in Florida has an economic impact of about $13.8 billion, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Time will tell how this affects our greater economy because changes in the fishing industry and tourism will come from changes in our underwater world,” Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by two women who served as election workers in Georgia in November 2020. In the lawsuit filed last December, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss accused Giuliani of defaming them by falsely stating that the pair had engaged in election fraud while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Giuliani repeatedly pushed debunked claims that the mother-and-daughter pair pulled out suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of fraud to try to alter the outcome of the presidential election in Georgia. In an opinion accompanying Monday’s order, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell in Washington described the situation that followed the November 2020 election, when the vote totals in several key states were so close that the results were not immediately clear. “As election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election, the Trump Campaign and its allies, including Giuliani, engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned, and at worse condemned, their work,” Howell wrote. Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012 and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election. Freeman, her mother, was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The pilot of a helicopter that crashed on a remote lava field during a sunset tour in June told investigators that the engine had been swapped out but three earlier flights that day were normal. The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday released various documents related to the crash that injured all six people on board, but the agency has yet to release a probable cause for why the helicopter suddenly made “violent and uncommanded yaw and pitch changes.” The morning of the crash, the pilot and a mechanic took the helicopter on a operation control flight after its engine had been changed and there were no issues with the flight, according to the pilot’s accident report. The documents did not specify exactly when the engine was changed. The pilot then took the helicopter on two tours, which were also normal and uneventful. The helicopter crashed during a third tour and was found lying on its left side with significant damage to the cockpit, and the tail boom was nearly 800 feet from the main wreckage, according to one of the reports. A large piece of lava rock penetrated about 13 inches into the cockpit area. In a passenger statement, a 48-year-old man on the tour with his two 18-year-old daughters told investigators the helicopter suddenly felt upside down about 30 minutes into the flight.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former longshot Idaho gubernatorial candidate was convicted Monday of kidnapping and killing a 12-year-old Colorado girl who went missing nearly 40 years ago. Jurors found Steve Pankey, 71, guilty of felony murder, second-degree kidnapping and false reporting in the disappearance and death of Jonelle Matthews in 1984, the office of district attorney Michael Rourke said. A judge then sentenced him to life prison with the possibility of parole, the Greeley Tribune reports. It was Pankey’s second trial in the case. Last year, jurors were unable to reach verdicts on the kidnapping and murder charges, and prosecutors decided to put him on trial again. Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle and her family when she vanished after being dropped off at her empty home by a family friend after performing at a Christmas concert in Greeley, Colorado, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. He emerged as a person of interest in the case three decades later – shortly before Jonelle’s body was found in 2019 – after claiming to have information about what happened to her and asking for immunity from prosecution. Prosecutors said Pankey kept up to date on the case throughout the years even as he moved his family to several states before settling in Idaho, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Constitution Party candidate for Idaho governor in 2014 and in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018, the year authorities said he was named as a person of interest in the girl’s death.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The owner of a North Side senior housing facility where three women earlier this year died amid a brief May heat wave that caused temperatures in the building to soar into the low 90s has been fined $1,500 by the city’s buildings department. Citing city records, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the fine was levied after an inspection by the buildings department found 11 code violations – two of which were the result of a rooftop air conditioning “chiller” that did not appear to be suitable for use on the exterior of the building. Records show, according to the newspaper, that the department determined that issues noted in the city’s first inspection had been addressed and that a second inspection determined there were “no dangerous and hazardous conditions.” By that time, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation – a nonprofit organization that owns and manages the James Sneider Apartment – had, among other things, provided individual air conditioning units to every tenant. Mike Puccinelli, a buildings department spokesman, said the fine was levied before city officials had access to autopsy records that showed the deaths of the three women whose bodies were discovered May 14 were linked to the heat. He said the fine was based completely on the violations found during the inspection.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: After years of overcoming legal challenges and governmental hurdles, more than 200 people gathered excitedly Saturday to break ground on the Islamic Life Center in Carmel. “My heart is pounding so fast with no fear or sadness but truly with a feeling of joy and pleasure,” Nadeem Ikhlaque, Al Salam’s founding president, said from a podium at the site of the future center. “In my 54 years of life, I never had this feeling, but today I have – standing in front of you.” Carmel leaders, the Al Salam Foundation, Muslim members, and those from other faith communities and the public broke ground on the city’s first mosque. The center will be under the umbrella of the foundation, which is an Islamic nonprofit organization. “We are practicing our faith rituals – daily and weekly prayers, nightly prayers, fasting through the month of Ramadan,” Ashhar Madni, president of the Al Salam Foundation, told the crowd. “The other half of our faith is to do good deeds. ... While we worship our creator, we need to serve his creation as well.” The road to this point was not a straight line and showed the clash that can occur as cities become more diverse. While city, community and religious leaders largely supported the project, many Carmel residents of different cultural and religious backgrounds in nearby upscale neighborhoods protested against it, saying they were largely concerned with property values. Center members said Saturday that they looked forward to being a good and inviting neighbor.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu – the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa, about 80 miles north of Des Moines, housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn’t been detected again until a backyard flock was infected Oct. 20, and then the latest infection was confirmed Monday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s top elections official warned voters Monday that text messages from outside the state were giving them incorrect information about where to vote, but groups involved in the texting said they weren’t trying to confuse or mislead people. Several Democrats said they began hearing about the texts Sunday or had received them. Each message said it was from a representative of Voting Futures, Voto Latino or Black Voters Matter and provided the address of a voting site, with a picture of a building. In some cases, the person already had voted; in others, people couldn’t vote in advance at the listed site, and in some, people could vote in advance there, but not on Election Day, Nov. 8. Movement Labs, a vendor headquartered in Oakland, California, working for both Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter, tweeted that texts also went to voters in Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. Kansas Democrats who learned of the texts worried that a disinformation campaign had targeted their voters in hopes of preventing their ballots from counting or discouraging them from voting. And Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, said voters should be on “high alert” about potential election misinformation from such texts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Former U.S. Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., whose tenacity and personal integrity formed the foundation of a long career in politics and public service, died Tuesday at his home in Louisville. He was one day shy of his 90th birthday. Charlie Mattingly, his former chief of staff, said Mazzoli’s mental acuity never waned, although his health declined, particularly in recent months. Throughout his 24 years in the House, Mazzoli defied the usual stereotypical descriptions applied to political figures. His unpredictable voting patterns occasionally prompted the casual observer describe him as a maverick, a term Mazzoli disliked. “I don’t like labels,” he said in 1988. “I don’t consider myself anything but thoughtful.” Mazzoli’s nature frequently put him in conflict with his party on issues of substance and matters of conscience. Although he pledged in his first House speech to support the Equal Rights Amendment, he alienated women’s groups that were trying to keep the amendment alive in 1983 by voting to defeat an ERA resolution. He said Democratic leaders had not provided enough time to discuss its impact on abortion and women in the draft. A devout Catholic, Mazzoli strongly opposed abortion, putting him at odds with members of his party’s liberal Washington establishment. He frequently angered organized labor by refusing to support protectionist legislation and voted once to support the veto of a Democratic bill to raise the minimum wage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nFerriday: The family of legendary rock ’n’ roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis has announced details of memorial services planned this weekend for his birthplace. Lewis, known for hits such as “Great Balls of Fire” and many others, died Friday at age 87. The funeral service is set for 11 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Saturday at Young’s Funeral Home in Ferriday, family members said. There will be very limited public availability, but the ceremony will be livestreamed, with details to be announced later on Lewis’ Facebook page. A private burial will follow. A celebration of life is also planned for 1 p.m. that day at the Arcade Theater in Ferriday, Lewis’ representatives said. Lewis was the last survivor of a generation of artists that rewrote music history, a group that included Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nMaine\n\nEtna: A 74-year-old man who spent nearly 30 hours lost in the woods was hypothermic and unable to move when he was found by a game warden using a tracking dog, officials said. Joseph Nolin knew his ordeal was over when he heard a bell attached to the Labrador retriever’s collar, and then the dog bounded up and started licking him Monday afternoon, his son told wardens. Nolin walked until he couldn’t move and told wardens he wouldn’t have survived another night in the woods. He was found a mile from his house deep in the woods at the edge of the Etna Bog, officials said. A Maine Forest Service helicopter was used to retrieve Nolin, and he was released after being hydrated and warmed up, officials said. Nolen had been last seen Sunday morning, when he departed to check on game cameras in the woods. He son reported him missing Sunday evening.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: A representative for the company staging a Halloween magic performance at Six Flags America says an emergency call that medics described as a serious injury caused by sword swallowing was caused by an “unrelated medical condition,” WUSA-TV reports. The call for help came from Six Flags in Bowie between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Saturday evening. “It was not for an accident during the show but rather for other unrelated health conditions,” said Josh Bowren, production manager for Aaron Radatz Productionz, which staged the show, according to Six Flags officials. Bowren did not name the actor, whom he described as “our sword swallower,” and authorities have not released the name of the injured person. The performer was a 59-year-old man who was in serious but not life-threatening condition when he was transported to Capital Region Health Hospital in Largo on Saturday night, rescuers said. Rescuers described the weapon to medical workers as “a haunted house sword” and said it occurred during a “Halloween show.” A spokesperson for Six Flags said the company’s “thoughts and prayers are with the performer and his family.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A retired state trooper who was killed in what authorities described as a shooting motivated by racism and an officer who drowned while trying to save the life of a teenager were honored Tuesday with awards for exemplary acts of bravery. A total of 32 Massachusetts law enforcement personnel were named recipients of the annual George L. Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery by Gov. Charlie Baker during a ceremony at Mechanics Hall in Worcester. Hanna was a state trooper shot and killed during a traffic stop in Auburn in 1983. Two of his children participated in Tuesday’s ceremony. “Like Trooper George Hanna, the dedicated women and men in law enforcement perform exceptional work guided by their deeply rooted commitment to helping others, no matter the risk to themselves,” Baker said in a statement. Retired state Trooper David L. Green, 68, left his Winthrop home in June 2021 to investigate a truck crash and was shot multiple times by a white man who authorities say had expressed antisemitic and anti-Black views. Green and Ramona Cooper, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran, were killed. Both were Black.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The family of Porter Burks, a Black man fatally shot during an early morning confrontation with Detroit police, is suing the city for $50 million, their lawyer announced Tuesday. Five unnamed officers also are named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. It claims gross negligence and assault and battery, among other things. Burks’ Oct. 2 death was recorded by police body cameras as officers pleaded with him to drop a knife he was carrying. They initially were called to a home on the west side about a knife-wielding man who was having a mental health crisis and spoke to a man who identified himself as Burks’ brother. The man said Burks had slashed the tires on his car. “Drop the knife for me, man. Come here real quick. You’re OK,” a member of the Detroit Police Department’s crisis intervention team can be heard telling Burks. “You’re not in any trouble. Can you just talk to me and drop the knife?” “You’re not in any trouble, OK?” the officer continued. “I just want to help you. I just want to help you, man. OK? Can you just drop the knife for me please? Please? Whatever you’re going through, I can help you.” Burks – who police say had schizophrenia – was shot as he sprinted toward officers from the middle of the street.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A man is accused of fatally shooting his daughter’s boyfriend who he suspected was abusing her. The 45-year-old Brainerd father is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bryce Brogle, who was reported missing after going to the man’s storage unit Oct. 26. According to a criminal complaint, the father shot Brogle in the back of the head from a distance and then buried his body in Crow Wing County. The defendant’s daughter reported her boyfriend missing Oct. 28, telling police he hadn’t been seen since he went to the storage unit with her father. Investigators executed a search warrant Oct. 29 at the storage unit and said they found the presence of blood and bleach on the concrete floor and signs something had been dragged across the floor. The following day, law enforcement officers searched land in Crow Wing County on foot and found a grave site. The complaint said that after it was excavated, they found a body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. An autopsy confirmed it was Brogle. According to the charges, the landlord for Brogle and his girlfriend called the sheriff’s office, saying the father has asked if Brogle had hurt his daughter. The landlord said his daughter had been seen with two black eyes. The complaint said the father then told the landlord he was going to kill Brogle, and he’d already dug a hole.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Monday that the city’s water is safe to drink, after months of sampling at a treatment plant overwhelmed by August flooding that caused wide supply disruptions. The beleaguered O.B. Curtis water treatment plant fell into crisis after the late summer flooding left 150,000 people without running water for several days. People waited in lines for water to drink, bathe, cook and flush toilets. The crisis also added to the rising costs for business owners already saddled with a labor shortage and high inflation. The city had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. But current water samples pass muster for safe consumption, the EPA said. “Current sampling confirms water delivered from J.H. Fewell Water and O.B. Curtis Water Treatment is safe to drink,” said Maria Michalos, a spokesperson for the EPA, referring to the city’s two water treatment plants. The agency encouraged Jackson residents to stay vigilant about updates and follow all future boil water advisories, as “localized issues” may resurface. It is not yet certain whether Jackson has too much lead and copper in its water. Sampling has been completed, and results are expected in mid-November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state’s health department is investigating whether a hospital violated federal health care rules in denying a woman an emergency abortion, an agency spokeswoman confirmed Monday. Missouri Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox in a statement said the agency launched an investigation into southern Missouri’s Freeman Health System’s treatment of Mylissa Farmer. Farmer, who is from Joplin, told the Associated Press she went to the system’s local emergency room when her water broke months early Aug. 2. She said tests showed she had lost all of her amniotic fluid because of a pregnancy complication, and doctors told her the fetus was not expected to survive. Doctors also told Farmer that “awaiting a medical emergency may put her at further risk for maternal mortality” or the removal of her uterus, medical records show. But because her fetus still had a heartbeat, and her condition wasn’t considered a life-threatening medical emergency at that moment, they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy in Missouri, they told her. She eventually got an abortion in Illinois. Records from that visit say doctors told Farmer that the law supersedes their medical judgment, and “contrary to the most appropriate management based (on) my medical opinion, due to the legal language of MO law, we are unable to offer induction of labor at this time.” “They were telling me to basically get out of the state to get the care that I needed,” the 41-year-old told AP.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A woman was cited for animal cruelty Thursday for shooting and skinning a 6-month-old husky and posting pictures of herself with the animal online bragging that she had shot a young wolf, officials said. The husky was among a group of 18 dogs and puppies, including German shepherd mixes, that had been abandoned on national forest land in northwestern Montana in mid-September, the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office has said. The investigation led the woman to be cited with a misdemeanor and not charged with a felony because officers believe they can prove negligence but not intent, the Sheriff’s Office told NBC Montana. The citation gives the woman two weeks to appear in Justice Court, Officer Paul Charbonneau said. The Flathead County Animal Shelter cared for the dogs, some of which had parvo, a viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Charbonneau said he believed all the dogs had been adopted.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Halloween celebration turned frantic after a man drove through a barricaded area and was shot by a police officer Monday night, police said. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the shooting occurred during the popular annual “Halloween on the Boulevard” block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood in Omaha. Children and adults were out in the neighborhood trick-or-treating when a car drove recklessly through a blocked-off area shortly after 7 p.m., Omaha Police Lt. Neal Bonacci said. The driver of the vehicle was shot by an Omaha police officer and taken to Nebraska Medical Center with serious injuries. The name of the driver has not yet been released. Police say no one else was injured. Chrissy Lopez, a resident of the neighborhood, told the Omaha World-Herald that the vehicle initially drove slowly through the crowd as people yelled at the driver to stop. “He would stop and then drive a little more,” she said. “I heard his engine rev, and people started screaming, and I thought, ‘Oh no.’ And then I heard the gunshots, and everybody just started screaming and running and crying.” Police and firefighters were already on the scene for the block party, which is put on by the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association and draws thousands of people to the area each year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Republican National Committee is asking a judge to order election officials in Las Vegas to hire more GOP poll workers to correct what a legal filing calls a disproportionate imbalance favoring Democrats. A Clark County District Court judge is scheduled Wednesday to consider accusations that county elections chief Joe Gloria “stacked” a key ballot signature verification board with 23 Democrats, 33 nonpartisans and “a mere” eight Republicans. Dan Kulin, spokesman for Gloria, declined Monday to comment on a matter pending before a judge. “The registrar’s lopsided staffing of the signature verification board is not remotely ‘as equal as possible’ ” under state law, attorneys representing the RNC alleged in a document filed Friday. “He created a signature verification board with a partisan makeup that tilts sharply against Republicans.” Judge Timothy Williams had signed off Oct. 5 on a pact between the two sides after the county agreed to provide to the RNC a roster showing job titles and political party affiliations of poll workers. The RNC dropped a demand to obtain workers’ names. Voter registration leans Democratic in Clark County, the most populous area of Nevada and home to nearly 1.3 million, or more than 71%, of the state’s 1.8 million active registered voters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A U.S. House candidate on the ballot in next week’s election would be the youngest woman ever in Congress if she wins. Karoline Leavitt recalls being in her college dining hall in 2018, filling out an application for a White House intern job while her friends were tailgating at a football game. “I remember thinking, ‘If I made this opportunity, it’s worth missing any football game in the world,’ ” she told the Associated Press in an interview She got the job. That eventually led to a position in President Donald Trump’s White House press office, then another as communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Inspired by Stefanik, the youngest woman elected to Congress when she won in 2014 at age 30, Leavitt is now running for a House seat of her own. At age 25, she could make history on Election Day: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won at 29 in 2018. Leavitt, an unabashed pro-Trump Republican, would also be the youngest person in the next session of Congress if she were to defeat two-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in one of the most competitive races this year. Leavitt is seven months younger then fellow Gen Z candidate Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat favored in his race. Leavitt won her 10-way Republican primary in September in part by going to the right of the other candidates. “I consistently continue to be the only candidate in this race who says that I believe the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,” she said during a debate.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: While COVID-19 has been at the forefront of health concerns for more than two years, another group of infections has continued to spread among New Jersey residents. Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have become more prevalent among adults and teens over the past decade, according to data from the New Jersey Health Department. Incidences of the three infections rose 40% between 2012 and 2019, according to state data. While it caused a small drop-off in disease rates, the COVID-19 pandemic failed to significantly slow down the spread of sexually transmitted infections across the state, said Dr. Edward Liu, the infectious disease section chief at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. “Even during the pandemic … their behaviors didn’t change that much,” he said. “Or maybe they were so cooped up that they had to have some type of outlet.” While rates of infection for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis did drop during 2020, the rate still exceeded the rate for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although all three infections are treatable with certain antibiotics, experts worry that they may soon run out of medications capable of treating gonorrhea. Greta Anschuetz, the assistant acting commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health who leads the division of HIV, STD and TB Services, said her office is concerned about the infection. “Gonorrhea has figured out how to be resistant to every drug, and we’re on the last of the (known, effective) drugs,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A sheriff’s department has submitted its investigative findings to prosecutors in the death of a cinematographer shot and killed by Alec Baldwin on a film set in New Mexico in October 2021. Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office spokesman Juan Ríos said Thursday that two binders of information were turned over to the Santa Fe-based district attorney’s office, without setting forth any recommendations about possible criminal charges. He said the case file outlines all the evidence collected, including investigative interviews and forensic analysis of physical evidence by the FBI. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said through a spokeswoman that investigators and prosecutors will now begin a thorough review to make a timely decision about whether to bring charges, without mention of specific deadlines. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded by a gunshot during setup for a scene in the western movie “Rust” at a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The debut of a giant “Bluey” balloon, Lea Michele and the Broadway cast of “Funny Girl,” and the legendary Dionne Warwick are some of the highlights slated for this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year’s parade – the 96th annual – will feature 16 giant character balloons, 28 floats, 40 novelty and heritage inflatables, 12 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups and, of course, Santa Claus. New balloon giants joining the line-up Nov. 24 include Stuart the one-eyed Minion from “Despicable Me 2”; a new green dinosaur, an Apatosaurus; the debut of the animated sensation “Bluey”; and a new “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” balloon. Other celebrities slated to be on hand include Paula Abdul, making her parade debut; Fitz and the Tantrums; Big Time Rush; “Blue’s Clues & You!” host Josh Dela Cruz; Gloria Estefan along with her daughter, Emily, and grandson, Sasha; Kirk Franklin; Mario Lopez; Ziggy Marley; and Miss America 2022 Emma Broyles. The singers Joss Stone, Jordin Sparks and Betty Who will all be part of the festivities, as will the stars of Peacock’s “Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin” – Adam Devine, Sarah Hyland and Flula Borg. Jimmy Fallon & The Roots will be on a float celebrating Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a new commission tasked with making recommendations on changing how the boards guiding the University of North Carolina system and its 17 member schools are chosen, bidding to broaden their membership by political leanings, race and gender. The Democratic governor essentially blamed the Republican-controlled Legislature for contributing to problems within the governing structure of one of the country’s leading public university systems – with 240,000 students and UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University as its flagship campuses. “The UNC system is the envy of the nation for what we have built here,” Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference. “But there are signs of trouble that come when all of the appointed leaders are chosen by too few … we have an appointed university leadership that doesn’t come close to reflecting our diversity.” As a reminder of partisanship he blames for the system’s stumbling, Cooper stood beside commission co-chairs Tom Ross and Margaret Spellings, two recent UNC system presidents. Both got pushed out in different ways by previous editions of the UNC Board of Governors that were controlled by GOP-approved members.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A judge ruled Monday that he will keep the state’s ban on abortion from taking effect, saying there’s a “substantial probability” that a constitutional challenge to the law will succeed. Judge Bruce Romanick’s ruling means abortion is still legal in North Dakota, though the state’s only clinic – the Red River Women’s Clinic of Fargo – shut down as it challenged the ban and has moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota. Romanick last month rejected a request from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley to let the law take effect while the Red River clinic’s lawsuit went forward. Romanick based his earlier decision on several factors, but Wrigley argued he had not sufficiently considered the clinic’s chances of prevailing in court. The North Dakota Supreme Court agreed and told Romanick to take another look. In his earlier ruling, Romanick noted the clinic’s uphill battle. But in his ruling Monday, he said the clinic has a “substantial probability” of succeeding, though he noted that the question of whether abortion is a constitutional right in North Dakota has been contentious and has not been decided by the state’s highest court.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A man was arrested Saturday at the Hamilton County Board of Elections after officials say he yelled through a megaphone on the premises and refused to leave. Stephan Pryor, 43, of Over-the-Rhine, is charged with criminal trespassing after the weekend incident at the Norwood facility. Officers engaged with Pryor about 1:30 p.m., while early in-person voting was underway for the day. According to board of elections director Sherry Poland, the board implemented a policy in March banning the use of bullhorns on the premises because they can be heard inside. Ohio law prohibits campaigning inside a polling location. Pryor was reportedly asked to stop using the bullhorn and to leave the property. He refused, Poland said, and Norwood police responded to ask him to leave. He was arrested after refusing again, an incident report says. In an interview Monday evening, Pryor said after he cast a ballot, he went to advertise candidates as he often does for elections. It is not the first time he’s used a megaphone at the facility, he said. He said he was standing the proper distance from the building and didn’t break laws regarding polling place advertisements. He cited that the board’s recent rule regarding megaphones is not protected directly by Ohio Revised Code. “They did me wrong. They arrested me in front of everybody – that was wrong,” Pryor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nRamona: A ranch with a history of exorcisms is being revamped into a resort. When Amber Stewart found out that Tri County Technology Center was selling a 114-acre property just off Highway 75, she leapt at the opportunity to own the land despite its history. “My husband (David) and I had wanted to buy it for years and years and years,” Amber Stewart said. “It was something that we had talked about, dreamed about and didn’t really think would come to fruition. But when we found out the property was for sale, we were feeling like this is the Lord’s will for us.” Jarrett Farm Resort, 24 miles north of Tulsa, has a history as a commercial property tracing back to the 1940s. It’s been a commercial farm, a conference and retreat center and, for a few years, home to an order of Catholic priests known for performing exorcisms. The Stewarts hope to restore its reputation as a vacation getaway, but it has been an immense challenge. “There were dead mice and large spiders ... there was a raccoon living in the attic,” Amber Stewart said. The Stewarts actually spent the first night of their honeymoon 20 years ago during its previous iteration as a resort. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa then purchased Jarrett Farm and used it from 2014 to 2018 as a home for an order of priests known for performing exorcisms, according to county records and reports from the diocese. The Stewarts have faced a mix of curiosity and resistance from some residents in Ramona’s small community, but they intend to “honor the story” of Jarrett Farm.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s pioneering motor voter program, in which residents who interact with the motor vehicle division are automatically registered to vote, hit a minor software speed bump, but Oregon’s secretary of state said Monday that it’s being resolved. Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said the Oregon Elections Division on Friday discovered the software error, which for the past six years has failed to preregister some 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. “As a result, 7,767 eligible voters in Oregon … were not given the opportunity to become automatically registered voters for the 2022 election. The issue has impacted voters during the last three election cycles,” Fagan’s office said in a statement. Fagan will direct Oregon’s 36 county clerks to issue ballots to affected voters – those who will be 18 or older Nov. 8. “Eligible voters not receiving their ballots in Oregon is unacceptable,” Fagan’s statement said. “As long as I am Oregon’s Secretary of State, I will do everything in my power to ensure that no eligible voters are disenfranchised.” The Oregon Elections Division was alerted to the issue by a voter who didn’t receive a ballot. Fagan said her technical staff worked through the weekend to resolve the software error.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nStroudsburg: Prosecutors say they have found no evidence of criminal negligence in a gas main rupture under an eastern Pennsylvania roadway and a subsequent fatal single-vehicle crash early on Christmas Day almost two years ago. The Monroe County district attorney’s office said Monday that all parties involved were cooperative in the investigation into the Pocono Township rupture and crash on Route 314 that killed 33-year-old Ana Abreu, of New York City. Township police said Abreu, her husband, their 2-month-old child and another family member were in a sport utility vehicle heading north toward the intersection with Route 611 about 1:30 a.m. on Christmas morning in 2020. Police said a natural gas main beneath the roadway ruptured, flipping the SUV over onto its roof and killing Abreu. The rupture left a large hole in the road, exposing the gas main underneath and a fracture in the pipeline, prosecutors said. A UGI Utilities spokesperson told LehighValleyLive.com that the company was “encouraged” by the decision but declined additional comment.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Bus drivers have reached a tentative settlement with their employer, First Student, avoiding a strike that was scheduled to begin Wednesday. The bus drivers, monitors and aides are members of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. The strike would have affected bus drivers in Lincoln, West Warwick and the state bus yard in Cranston, who transport students with special needs, among others. The settlement includes a four-year contract that provides a fair wage increase and an increase in guaranteed hours, the union said. The 275 members of the union are expected to ratify the contract, at which time more details will be provided. “I’ve been a school bus driver for 13 years, and many of the kids I transport have special physical and behavioral needs that require special accommodations and increased attention,” said Mike McDermott, a bus driver at the metro yard in Cranston. “We are happy that First Student was finally willing to come to the table with proposals that will help us better take care of our families and do our jobs. Even before the pandemic, First Student could not recruit bus drivers, monitors to do this work, and we are hopeful that better hours and pay will go a long way in attracting more workers to the field. At the end of the day, it’s our students who benefit most.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGrenville: Voters in Greenville County will be allowed to wear “Black Lives Matter” and “Make America Great Again” paraphernalia to the polls this Election Day, according to a notice sent to poll workers by county Elections Director Conway Belangia. He said the county’s decision is the result of a court ruling in Minnesota allowing the same practice. He said the American Civil Liberties Union alerted the county to the ruling. The county attorney was brought in to review the situation, and he determined the Minnesota court ruling, which found BLM and MAGA gear should not be considered prohibited campaign materials, applied to Greenville County. Belangia said the change of interpretation applies only to voters in Greenville County, but the state election commission had previously ruled in a similar manner. The county was a “Johnny-come-lately” in its determination to allow BLM and MAGA gear, Belangia said. Voters are still prohibited from wearing gear for any specific candidate inside polling places.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower court’s decision to block parts of a South Dakota law that would have required ballot petition workers to publicly disclose their personal identification information. The Republican-controlled Legislature in 2020 passed a law that would have required paid ballot measure circulators to list their personal information, including phone number, residential address, email address and driver’s license information, in a directory. The law was just one attempt by lawmakers in recent years to add barriers to ballot measures, which have given progressive causes a chance at enactment in the politically red state. Circuit Judge Steven Grasz wrote in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that being forced to disclose the information would be “chilling in today’s world” and the law would violate the First Amendment. United States District Judge Lawrence Piersol issued a temporary injunction against the law last year. Dakotans for Health, an organization that was formed around a ballot measure to expand Medicaid eligibility, sued to have the law overturned. The organization is now focused on placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to codify abortion rights.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A man accused of intentionally setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic and of firing shots later at a federal courthouse died months ago, officials announced Monday in disclosing both the man’s death and the allegations. Federal court documents indicate that the man, Mark Thomas Reno, 64, died Aug. 15. Yet many of the documents in his case were sealed until this week, including records showing he had been arrested in connection with the Planned Parenthood arson fire. “The government’s investigation has revealed that (Reno) engaged in a series of violent acts of property destruction in Knoxville since early 2021,” a newly unsealed complaint said. The complaint said Reno fired a shotgun at the clinic’s doors in early 2021, shattering glass and leaving holes in the reception area. Reno then set the clinic ablaze in December 2021, the document said. The building was unoccupied during the fire but had to be closed for months to undergo an $2.2 million renovation. Other court documents show that the FBI began surveillance of Reno in April of this year after he told an undercover agent he belonged to a group with a mission to resist actions opposed to Catholic orthodoxy. The agent was secretly recording Reno, who said that his group had “plenty of targets,” according to the documents.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The leaders of a group that promotes election conspiracy theories were jailed Monday for not complying with a court order to provide information in a defamation lawsuit over some of their claims. Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, who run True the Vote, were ordered detained by U.S. marshals, according to an order signed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston. They will be held for at least one day or “until they fully comply with the Court’s Order,” Hoyt wrote. Houston-based True the Vote provided research for a debunked documentary that alleged widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Engelbrecht, Phillips and their nonprofit organization are being sued by Michigan-based election software provider Konnech Inc. over True the Vote’s claims of a Chinese-related conspiracy involving U.S. poll workers’ information. Alfredo Perez, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Houston, said Monday that Engelbrecht and Phillips were in the law enforcement agency’s custody. True the Vote said in a statement read during a video livestream Monday that its attorneys would appeal Hoyt’s ruling.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For years, water conservation advocates have urged the state to offer money to residents to incentivize them to remove their lawns. For some, at least, that proposal came closer to reality Friday, with water officials set to start taking applications for a pilot program that could pay up to $1 per square foot to Utahns who want to replace their water-guzzling grass with drought-resistant landscaping. The Legislature earlier this year approved a $5 million expenditure to fund a statewide grass removal rebate program. State water officials plan a full launch of the program next spring via a new website, UtahWaterSavers.com, but in the meantime, residents can apply for the pilot program on the Utah Division of Water Resources website, conservewater.utah.gov/grass-removal-rebates, with a limited number of spaces available. Applicants who are approved get a year to complete their landscaping project as long as they meet the criteria, which include requirements for the type of replacement landscaping allowed in each part of the state. Turf removal programs have proven successful in desert cities like Las Vegas, dropping per-capita use, but have been slow to develop in Utah, with water managers often citing a lack of funding.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: In a national assessment of learning, Vermont student performance in math and reading was about average compared to the nation but continued a downward trend the state has seen on national standardized tests since before COVID-19. Vermont students predictably performed below 2019 levels – the last time the test was administered – in math and reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test and in most cases aligned with the average U.S. score. The test was administered to fourth and eighth graders in math and reading. The test is usually given every two years as a way to measure national and statewide progress over time but was postponed in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vermont, 202 schools participated in 2022. For the second time in a row, Vermont’s fourth grade math scores dipped below the national average, albeit by one point. Vermont fourth graders’ math scores fell five points overall compared to 2019. This year’s score was 234 on a scale of 500. Math proficiency for both fourth and eighth graders in Vermont had been increasing from the mid-1990s until about 2013, when the scores turned the other direction, and have been in a gradual decline ever since. In 2022, about 35% of fourth grade students were proficient in math.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: In the past four years, the state has seen opioid overdose deaths among Black residents more than triple – the highest death rate, by far, of any demographic. The numbers underscore the lethality of a fentanyl-polluted drug supply, as well as structural barriers to entering recovery, a critical first step in preventing fatal overdose, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The numbers – made publicly available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention death certificate database – tell the story of a striking rise, particularly in the Richmond metropolitan area. Chesterfield County had 34 deaths in 2021, up from 11 in 2018. Henrico County spiked similarly, up to 44 deaths from 14, and Richmond accounted for 135 deaths, up from 41 deaths in 2018. The spike was more acute in Richmond than in any other county in the state. “It desensitizes you to death,” said Darryl Cousins, whocounts three friends who have died of an overdose in the past two months. Cousins, a Black man, works for Starfish Recovery and Wellness, a Richmond-based recovery residence for people with addiction. He’s been sober for 15 years, he said, and shares a long view on how the city has changed in that time. Most frightening is the drug that seems to be everywhere these days. “All of a sudden it’s in every drug being sold,” Cousins said. “Fentanyl has taken over the drug world.”\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: A flatbed truck carrying 500 gallons of liquid detergent hit the median on Highway 3 on Monday evening near Gorst, spilling the fluid onto the road and then into the Puget Sound. The crash near milepost 35 was reported at 5:40 p.m. and cleared about 7 p.m., blocking traffic in each direction for the duration, according to Washington State Patrol Trooper Katherine Weatherwax. The driver told investigators he fell asleep, Weatherwax said. The state Department of Ecology was notified. The detergent that spilled is designed to clean trucks.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State transportation officials say construction has begun on a full-service Division of Motor Vehicles regional office in Morgan County. The new office being built in Berkeley Springs will bring additional driver’s licensing and vehicle services to the citizens of the Eastern Panhandle, officials said in a news release Thursday. It is expected to open in the spring of 2023. “We know how busy our Martinsburg and Charles Town Regional Offices are on a daily basis,” said Everett Frazier, commissioner of the state’s Division Of Motor Vehicles. “Population continues to grow in that location, and opening an office in Morgan County will help us to provide accessible, more efficient and convenient customer service to that area.” A staff of a dozen people or more could be employed at the Morgan County office, and hiring will begin soon, Frazier said. Full-service DMV regional offices offer driver’s license skills testing, written knowledge tests, vehicle registration renewals, title work and other services. A motorcycle course will also be built at the new office.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Monday scheduled a two-day sentencing hearing for a man who killed six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee last year. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow set Darrell Brooks’ sentencing for Nov. 15-16 to accommodate dozens of people who want to speak at the proceeding. Prosecutors told the judge they expect at least 36 people will speak. Brooks said he anticipates about 20 people will speak on his behalf. A jury last Wednesday convicted Brooks of 76 counts in connection with the Nov. 21, 2021, incident in Waukesha. The charges include six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety. Each homicide count carries a mandatory life sentence, although Dorow can decide whether Brooks could be released on extended supervision at some point. Each endangerment count carries a maximum sentence of 171/ 2 years.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A contentious “glamping” development is in question again, with Teton County officials saying they might force a pause to construction underway near Teton Village, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. County commissioners warned the companies involved might be told to obtain county permits in the wake of opposition from neighbors and advocates worried about the effects on the land and water supplies, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2022/07/24/uaw-convention-detroit-voting-process-corruption-scandal/10134638002/", "title": "UAW convention bringing hundreds of delegates to Detroit", "text": "As an estimated 900 UAW delegates from across the country and Canada descend on Detroit this weekend and over the coming days, many observers will be watching for signs of change, whether there has been enough of it or whether this is effectively the same organization stained by years of scandal and corruption.\n\nIn June 2018, Gary Jones took the helm of the United Auto Workers as president at that year’s convention, promising delegates that “I’m here to fight for you.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/19/bart-workers-killed/3077949/", "title": "Train kills 2 track workers amid S.F. strike", "text": "Terry Collins and Tracie Cone\n\nAssociated Press\n\nOne BART employee and one contractor died\n\nBART workers are striking over contract issues\n\nThe accident happened 25 miles northeast of San Francisco\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A San Francisco Bay Area commuter train returning from routine maintenance struck and killed two workers who were inspecting the tracks Saturday afternoon — an accident that comes amid a strike that has shut the Bay Area Rapid Transit system down to riders for the past few days.\n\nThe four-car train was being run in automatic mode under computer control at the time of the accident, BART's Assistant General Manager Paul Oversier said at a news conference.\n\nThere were several people aboard the train, Oversier said, but he would not say who had been the operator. In an earlier statement, BART said only that the person was an experienced operator.\n\nOne system employee and one contractor were killed in the accident in the East Bay city of Walnut Creek shortly before 2 p.m. The train had been at a yard where workers had been cleaning off graffiti, BART officials said.\n\n\"This is a tragic day in BART's history,\" the system's general manager, Grace Crunican, said. \"The entire BART family is grieving.\"\n\nOfficials from the unions representing BART's train operators and some of the system's other workers have warned of the danger that could come with allowing managers to operate trains as BART had planned to do in case of a strike. The unions have been on strike since Friday.\n\nOne of the unions on strike, Amalgamated Transit Union 1555, announced that its 900 workers would not be picketing on Sunday out of respect for the victims and their families.\n\nAlso Saturday, ATU local president Antonette Bryant said she was taking a final contract offer from BART before members for a vote, but expects it will be rejected.\n\n\"It's our hope we can get it to members this week,\" Bryant told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. She said she expects the vote to be \"a resounding no.\"\n\nBryant later issued a statement, saying Saturday's accident was a \"terrible human tragedy.\"\n\nThe two workers killed were performing track inspections about a mile from the Walnut Creek station in an area some 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, BART said.\n\nThey were responding to a reported dip in the track and both had extensive experience.\n\n\"They understand the railroad, they understand how to work around moving trains,\" Oversier said. \"They were doing today what they have done 100 if not 1000 other times in their career.\"\n\nThe procedures for such maintenance require one employee to inspect the track and the other to serve as a lookout for oncoming traffic, BART officials said. They did not immediately say whether that procedure had been followed.\n\nPolice placed yellow tarps over the two dead who were about 100 yards apart on the tracks.\n\nThe victim's names and ages were not immediately released.\n\nOversier said that the BART worker who was killed is a member of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\n\nBART officials wouldn't address questions on the union's warnings about train safety during a walkout.\n\n\"The labor issues are not in the forefront of our mind,\" Oversier said. \"We've just lost two people in the BART family.\"\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board announced late Saturday that it has informed BART and the California Public Utilities Commission that the federal agency will take over the investigation.\n\nThe deaths were the first of a BART employee in five years.\n\nIn October 2008, about one stop down on the same line, 44-year-old BART employee James Strickland was hit from behind while inspecting the tracks. Trains in both directions were sharing the same stretch of track at the time because of maintenance and Strickland had apparently been unaware.\n\nBefore Saturday's accident, union leaders spent much of the day attempting to convince the riders who make 400,000 daily trips on the system that workers' demands are not unreasonable amid increasing hostility in social media and other outlets.\n\nThere was general agreement by both sides on on the economic parts of the contract, but union officials said they came to an impasse over work rules, including the length of the work day and when overtime pay kicks in.\n\nBART spokesman Rick Rice said that the two sides remain in communication though they were not expected back at the bargaining table.\n\nMessages left for negotiators from the Service Employees International Union, which also represents workers, were not immediately returned.\n\nHowever, SEIU president Roxanne Sanchez said earlier Saturday they were willing to sign off on pay, health care and pension issues, and send the remaining snarl — work rules — to an arbitrator, a proposal BART has previously refused. But BART officials later said they would be willing to send the entire contract to arbitration but not the work rules alone.\n\nWeekend BART use is light compared with the workweek, and frustrated commuters Friday said they hoped an agreement could be quickly reached.\n\nThe system carries its ridership through tunnels under the bay and into the region's urban core of San Francisco from four surrounding counties, relieving what would otherwise be congested bridges.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate delays, many of the Bay Area's other 27 transit systems added bus, ferry and rail service. Carpools and rideshare programs were also busy, and more cyclists took to the streets.

Kay Ivey said Monday that she will end a health order meant to guard against the spread of an illness that has killed nearly 11,000 people statewide. Citing improved infection rates, fewer hospitalizations and more widespread immunizations, Ivey said the current order recommending that people follow health guidance and requiring some precautions for senior citizens and long-term care facilities will end May 31, barring a sharp rise in cases. The declared state of emergency will end July 6, she said in a statement. “For over a year now, Alabamians, like people around the globe, have made sacrifices and adjusted to a temporary ‘new normal.’ We have learned much since last year, and this is absolutely now a managed pandemic. Our infection rates and hospitalizations are in better shape, and over 1.5 million Alabamians have had at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine,” Ivey said. Still, Dr. Ellen Eaton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said physicians are seeing more and more young, unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. With only 22% of Alabamians fully vaccinated, leaders should aim for more widespread protection before any return to business as usual, she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: An advocacy group is evaluating the use of tiny homes to provide housing for people in the city who are homeless. Gayle Young, co-founder of the Sitka Homeless Coalition, said there are few services in the southeast Alaska city for those who are homeless, and over the years a number of groups have worked on ideas to fill in the gaps. A project on which her group is working involves building a tiny-home community to help provide a safe place to stay. Young estimates between 15 and 25 people in the city of about 8,500 residents are chronically experiencing homelessness. Young said most of those who have not had a home for years are men who were raised in Sitka and are now in their 50s and 60s, Alaska’s News Source reports. She said they often leave Sitka on a ferry in the winter due to limited services. Planning for the tiny-home community is in its early stages. For example, there still needs to be a feasibility analysis, identification of partners, and development of a business and financing plan. The plan envisioned would involve a plot of land north of town, with at least 12 tiny homes and a building for laundry and showers, Young said. Coalition members also would like to develop a community atmosphere with communal features like a fire pit, she said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Jobless residents will again have to show they’re looking for work in order to receive unemployment benefits after Gov. Doug Ducey announced Monday that he will stop waiving the job-seeking requirement. Ducey said state officials will begin enforcing the rule during the week of May 23. He waived the mandate in March 2020 when some businesses were ordered to close to slow the spread of COVID-19. Ducey, a Republican, said it’s time to reinstate the mandate because all adults now have access to the COVID-19 vaccine, and there are plenty of jobs available. Everyone currently eligible for unemployment benefits will continue to receive them as long as they show that they’re actively looking for a job, according to Ducey’s office. In other coronavirus developments, Pima County and the Federal Emergency Management Agency launched two mobile vaccination unit Monday in an eight-week effort to provide vaccinations in the hardest-to-reach communities. Each unit will offer 250 vaccines at a site in and around Tucson for three days before moving to another one. The locations include Pima Community College campuses, casinos and Rillito Race Track. Both units will accept walk-ins. The mobile sites will be held in Pima County through June 26.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s finance office on Tuesday said Arkansas’ surplus for the current fiscal year has grown to nearly $717 million. The Department of Finance and Administration said the state’s net available general revenue for the fiscal year that began July 1 now totals nearly $5.5 billion. That’s more than $651 million more than the state reported at the same time a year ago, the department said. The state’s net revenue in April totaled nearly $780 million, which was $242 million above the same month last year and nearly $167 million more than was forecast. The department said net available revenue came in better than the forecast in nearly all major tax categories last month. Individual income tax collections were $2.3 million above forecast, while sales tax collections were $81.7 million above forecast. Corporate income tax collections were $63.2 million above forecast.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Capacity at restaurants, breweries and more will be allowed to double to 50% as Los Angeles and San Francisco lead the way toward a broader reopening of California businesses. On Tuesday, they became the first major urban areas in the state to meet infection thresholds to move into the least-restrictive tier for reopening, allowing indoor bars to welcome people again, larger crowds to cheer on Major League Baseball’s Dodgers and Giants, and expanded capacity at restaurants, movie theaters, amusement parks, gyms and other establishments. A total of seven of the state’s 58 counties are now in the so-called yellow tier, the final stage of a phased reopening plan before a projected return to business as usual June 15. The five other counties are all remote areas of Northern California. It’s a remarkable turnaround for LA considering it was ground zero for infections and deaths when California was the nation’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak just a few months ago. Now, the Golden State has the lowest infection rate in the country. Los Angeles County, which is home to a quarter of the state’s nearly 40 million people and has endured a disproportionate number of California’s 60,000 deaths, didn’t record a single COVID-19 death Sunday or Monday.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: As part of an outreach effort targeting the homeless, the Pueblo Police Department teamed up with other local government agencies to bring COVID-19 vaccinations and bags full of food to those in need in a makeshift camp near Fountain Creek. “We’re here offering food packages with Pueblo Food Project and COVID vaccines,” said the department’s public information officer, Sgt. Franklyn Ortega. “A lot of the times, people who are living homeless here on the Fountain Creek don’t have too many resources available to them. So we want to offer these resources with food and the vaccine to try to help them out.” For the project, police teamed up with the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, Pueblo Food Project, the Beulah Fire Protection and Ambulance District, and the Pueblo Fire Department to target homeless camps in west Pueblo. Pueblo Food Project supplied 60 bags of food, containing essentials like bread, bananas, peanut butter and jelly, which were distributed throughout the camps. Registered nurses from PDPHE also brought 120 doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which were administered to anyone that wanted them. Ortega said the J&J shot was selected because it is effective with just one dose, so there’s no need to schedule a follow-up appointment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state plans to distribute $13 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to 27 municipalities and local health departments to help reach residents who haven’t yet been vaccinated, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. While touting CDC data that shows the state is the first in the U.S. to have more than 50% of adults age 18 and older fully vaccinated, the Democratic governor said there continues to be a slowdown in the rate of vaccinations. “You can tell it’s not going up as quickly any longer,” Lamont said. “So what we are doing is reinforcing our messaging. That’s the $13 million of federal support that’s going to go out to messaging, going out to door-knocking, going out to telephone calls, working with our amazing local public health departments and community support groups, making an extra effort right now to do everything we can to convince those that are maybe a little hesitant … that this is the time to do it.” Earlier this month, the Connecticut Department of Public Health requested applications from local health districts and departments for the grant funding. Each applicant was required to describe ways their partnerships with community and medical provider groups planned to address vaccine equity in their coverage areas across the state.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Christina School District’s newest defense against the pandemic is virus-fighting robots. The district is now among the first schools in the country to use the disinfecting ADIBOTs, which use UV-C light to kill viruses like the coronavirus. After taking part in a two-week pilot program in January, the district now owns seven of the bots, paid for by a donation from Friends of Christina School District, a parent-run nonprofit. The tall cylindrical machines can be wheeled into the center of a classroom, where they emit “hot and intense” UV-C light, said Christopher Sherlock, facilities manager for the district. The ultraviolet rays break down the outer cell wall of viruses and bacteria. Unable to replicate, they die instead of spreading through a classroom. “We can disinfect any surface that the light catches in about 3 minutes,” Sherlock said. “Desks, chairs, the floor, wall, ceilings, the air. It will disinfect everything.” Before the pandemic, UV-C technology was primarily used in health care settings to sterilize operating rooms. Only recently have companies like UBTECH, which manufactures the ADIBOT, started making the disinfecting light financially accessible for schools and businesses. At $15,000 each, all seven ADIBOTs cost $105,000, said Naveed Baqir, co-chair of Friends of Christina.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A D.C. pediatrician is recruiting 100 children for a Novavax COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, WUSA-TV reports. Spring Valley Pediatrics is partnering with Meridian Clinical Research for the trial. “Kids aren’t just little adults, and so it’s really important that we study the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, devices, all specifically in children,” said Dr. Joanna Sexter, principal investigator for the trial. “And we know that we have to vaccinate kids to get them back safely and fully to day cares and schools.” Sexter said the trial will last two years, and each child will receive two doses 21 days apart. She said there will also be 11 visits throughout the trial, some in-person, some virtual. And throughout the process, she said participants will be required to fill out electronic diaries. She said it’s a placebo-controlled trial, so only some participants will receive the vaccine at first. “If they initially received the placebo, then at a particular point, during the course of the trial, they will have the opportunity to get the vaccine,” Sexter said. She said researchers are enrolling 100 children ages 12 to 17. In the future, she said there should be trials for those 6 to 11 years old.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A school district is encouraging eligible students to get vaccinated by bringing COVID-19 shots to their campuses. Starting Tuesday, the Broward County School District is offering vaccines at all its high school campuses over an eight-day span, the South Florida SunSentinel reports. The vaccine will be administered by the county’s health department on a walk-up basis, officials said. Students 16 and older are eligible to receive the Pfizer vaccine, which will also be offered to school staff, faculty and parents, the newspaper reports. Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by a parent to get a shot. “I think the health department is looking for unique ways to get the whole community vaccinated, so this is just another way that they can ensure that everyone has access to it,” Broward Schools Chief Portfolio Services Officer John Sullivan said. “So we’re very happy to partner with them to make it available to our school community.” The health department will return in three weeks for the second shots. In Orlando, some 1,500 students and their families turned out to get vaccines at three high schools Wednesday through Saturday, WKMG reports. Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings announced last week that mobile sites will be popping up around the area as officials move toward more community-driven vaccine events.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Some business owners blame a prolonged construction project for keeping customers from their doors. The state’s oldest city is seeing a healthy rebound in tourism a year after the coronavirus pandemic struck, WTOC-TV reports. But shops in a two-block area of Broughton Street in Savannah’s historic district aren’t getting much of that business because of paving and landscaping work that’s shut down part of the road. David Huynh, who owns Envy Nail Bar on the normally busy downtown thoroughfare, said his business is down 55% over the past year. He blamed construction work that has reduced the foot traffic on which Huynh relies for walk-in customers. “We gauge it with the other business owners down the street; they have higher foot traffic,” Hyunh said. “And when you get to this side of Broughton, it’s dead. It’s a ghost town on this side.” The construction project is repaving the busy street and adding new trees, sidewalks and parking. Work on the first phase near Hyunh’s salon was supposed to take a few months but has now lasted more than a year. City officials say that’s because some construction materials were hard to get during the pandemic. Crews also had to deal with some decaying water mains in the area.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The pandemic is putting the brakes on the city’s bicycle-sharing program. Known as Biki, the program is considering decommissioning as many as 50 of about 130 stations currently in service, Bikeshare Hawaii Executive Director Todd Boulanger said. The pandemic has taken a financial toll on the program launched four years ago, and the next three to six months will be crucial in determining its future, Boulanger said. The program logged 1.4 million rides in 2019, but the number of trips and generated income were slashed in half when the pandemic hit, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s possible Biki will have to completely shut down, but Boulanger would like to see the program integrated into the city’s strategy for more eco-friendly transportation. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said he has asked transportation officials to gather financial and operational data for the program “so my administration can evaluate the need and consider options to keep our city’s bike-share system alive and well.” Blue Planet Foundation, which is focused on accelerating clean energy usage, started a petition to show that Biki is essential. Blue Planet Communications Director Leigh Anne Mayberry said the goal would be to get Biki recognized as public transportation, then funded and included in that public transportation network.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Republican-dominated state Senate on Tuesday failed for the second time to override GOP Gov. Brad Little’s veto of a measure seeking to curb a governor’s power to respond to emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate voted 21-12, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed. The pandemic spurred the legislation, with lawmakers taking aim at rules intended to stem the spread of the virus, like limiting gatherings and nonessential travel. Both bills vetoed by Little sought to give the Legislature a greater say in the handling of declared emergencies and how long restrictions associated with them could last. Democratic Sen. Grant Burgoyne voted against the override, citing the Legislature’s problems this session that is now the third-longest in state history. “If this legislative session has shown anything, it is the incapability of this Senate and the House of Representatives to handle an emergency in the manner that the executive would,” he said. “The override of this veto would constitute a clear and present danger to the people of this state.” Supporters of the measures said the governor has too much power during emergencies. Opponents said the Legislature shouldn’t have emergency authority because it would be too slow to act during a time of crisis.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Indicators of coronavirus transmission appear to be on track to allow the state to transition to the “bridge phase” of economic reopening sometime next week, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday. “It feels to me, it looks to me, if you look at the hospital admissions data, like we’re in decent shape and moving exactly as I would hope we would toward the bridge phase,” he said at a news conference in Chicago. Pritzker also said the Illinois State Fair in Springfield will go on as planned Aug. 12-22, after a year’s hiatus because of the pandemic, “barring some highly unusual event occurring that would prevent a large gathering” at what he called “a very large fairgrounds.” “I am very much looking forward to the Illinois State Fair,” the Democrat said. “I think we’re going to have a lot of fun this summer.” When it comes to Illinois’ potential move from the current Phase 4 restrictions to the bridge phase, the prediction Pritzker made Monday was much the same as one he made a week ago. He said his minimum requirements for the percentage of the population vaccinated have been met, while hospital admissions for patients with COVID-19 need to be “at least stable or going down.” The bridge phase would allow for fewer restrictions on retail stores, offices, and indoor and outdoor recreational activities before a full reopening.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The conservative pushback over the state’s COVID-19 restrictions is turning into a tangled legal standoff among Republicans who dominate the Statehouse. Gov. Eric Holcomb is arguing that the GOP-controlled General Assembly is violating the state constitution with a new law giving itself the power to call a special legislative session during emergencies and wants the courts to decide who is correct. Some legal experts question legal arguments that Attorney General Todd Rokita – a past Holcomb political rival – filed with a Marion County court Friday asking a judge to throw out the governor’s lawsuit because state law gives him alone the authority to determine whether the governor can even go to court. Lawyers hired by the governor’s office over Rokita’s objections filed the lawsuit last week after lawmakers voted to override Holcomb’s veto of the bill allowing what the law calls an emergency session. Holcomb said he worried any action taken by the Legislature during such a session could be challenged as illegal and lead to “significant uncertainty” during a time of emergency. While Rokita maintains the law is constitutional, long-standing legal precedents are that such disagreements between the governor and the Legislature should be decided by the courts, said former state Supreme Court Justice Frank Sullivan.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The 80/35 music festival is off for the second year in a row because of COVID-19 concerns, the Des Moines Music Coalition announced Tuesday. The festival, which had been slated for July 9-10, typically draws upward of 30,000 people to Des Moines’ Western Gateway Park. First held in 2008, it has featured performances by headliners such as the Flaming Lips, The Roots, Wu-Tang Clan and Modest Mouse. DMMC instead will hold a one-day Riverview Music Festival at the Riviera at the north side’s Riverview Park on Sept. 4. Other central Iowa music festivals are making a comeback this summer, including Hinterland and Big Country Bash. DMMC board Chair Kuuku Saah said the decision to delay 80/35 to 2022 in favor of a scaled-back event was not easy. “A non-profit festival at 80/35’s scale takes an immense amount of advanced planning, volunteers, corporate sponsors, community grants, ticket sales and much more,” Saah said in a statement. “With the level of uncertainty in all of those areas, and the desire to always deliver the maximum 80/35 experience for attendees, we felt postponing was the best choice to ensure we can come back even stronger in 2022.” DMMC said Riverview Music Festival will feature national, regional and local acts, with details tobe announced this summer.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state needs to boost funding for public higher education or else risk jeopardizing federal pandemic aid to public schools and universities, officials warned in a memo to legislators Monday. The warning from Budget Director Adam Proffitt comes as lawmakers wade through a heated debate on how to fund K-12 education. Republican legislators acknowledge the risk that exists to federal relief for both public K-12 education and the state’s colleges and universities. “I think it is going to be a problem,” said Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, chair of the House Appropriations Committee. State universities are in line to get more than $161 million from the latest congressional relief package alone, and school districts are set to receive $1.3 billion over the three packages approved since March 2020. The two most recent federal relief bills contain so-called maintenance of effort requirements, which in effect force states to continue funding education at a similar level as they have in the past. The state budget as written would not meet that standard for higher education funding. Proffitt suggested legislators add $159 million over each of the next two fiscal years in an effort to meet federal guidelines.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear signaled Monday that he will consider relaxing more coronavirus-related restrictions before the state reaches a key vaccination target. Nearly 1.85 million Kentuckians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine – slightly more than half the state’s 16-and-up population, the Democratic governor said at a news conference. With the vaccination rate slowing in recent weeks, several hundred thousand residents still need to get inoculated before hitting the threshold Beshear has set. Once 2.5 million Kentuckians receive at least their first COVID-19 shot, he has pledged to lift capacity and physical distancing restrictions for nearly all businesses, venues and events catering to 1,000 or fewer patrons. Earlier Monday during an appearance in Louisville, the state’s most powerful Republican, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, made another pitch for vaccines, saying they’re “the only thing that ultimately gets us out of” the pandemic. “It is disturbing to see that vaccinations seem to be receding, as everybody kind of thinks it’s over. For whatever audience I have, I want to encourage everybody: Finish the job.” Acknowledging that fatigue has set in regarding mask-wearing and other virus-related restrictions, Beshear said that “we’re going to work on loosening” more rules.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBroussard: A company that makes personal protective equipment will open two factories near Lafayette, hiring more than 1,200 people. SafeSource Direct made the announcement Monday, saying it would invest $150 million in the venture. The company is a joint venture of Jefferson-based Ochsner Health, Louisiana’s largest hospital system, and Trax Development. SafeSource Direct will make and sell equipment to health care and other industries in Louisiana and nationwide. “COVID-19 brought to light our nation’s dependence on foreign countries, primarily China, for PPE,” CEO Justin Hollingsworth said in a statement. SafeSource Direct will spend $73 million to renovate an 80,000-square-foot building in Broussard that will serve as SafeSource’s headquarters and as a factory for masks, hair covers, shoe covers and isolation gowns. The company will spend another $77 million to build a 400,000-square-foot factory in nearby St. Martin Parish with multiple manufacturing lines, with its main product planned to be nitrile rubber gloves. “Even now, the need for PPE is great, and that demand will continue for the foreseeable future,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said. “I am proud to say that, with this new project, Louisiana will play a key role in preventing the U.S. from facing such a shortage again.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s largest city is preparing for another election that will be disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Portland is scheduled for a special municipal election June 8 that will concern the Charter Commission and school budget referendum. City officials are promoting the use of absentee voting, as they did during the 2020 general election. Absentee ballots will become available early this month and provided to voters, officials said. The last day to request an absentee ballot is June 4. Polls will also open at 7 a.m. on the day of the election, officials said. Portland officials said polling locations will once again also look different than during a typical year because of the pandemic. Voting booths will be spread out, and election workers will have plexiglass barriers and personal protective equipment, officials said. City officials said Portland voters are also encouraged to wear a face covering when voting.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will offer a $100 incentive for state employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday. The Republican governor described it as another way to reinforce the importance of getting vaccinated. Hogan is encouraging businesses across the state to consider offering incentives to their workers as well. All state employees who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are eligible. To receive the incentive, employees must provide proof of vaccination and agree to receive all subsequent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended booster vaccinations within 18 months of being fully vaccinated. The incentive is retroactive, so state employees who already have been fully vaccinated will be eligible. People who refuse subsequent CDC-recommended booster vaccinations, after receiving the vaccination incentive, will be required to repay the $100. According to official CDC data, 62% of Marylanders 18 and older and 84.8% of those 65 and older have received a COVID-19 shot.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Striking nurses and leaders at St. Vincent Hospital are scheduled to return to the bargaining table Wednesday morning, after the hospital presented a new proposal for staffing Saturday. “The hospital’s offer was very complex, and the nurses have been meeting and will be meeting all day today to craft a comprehensive proposal to present on Wednesday that will provide what we need to end the strike,” David Schildmeier, the spokesman for the Massachusetts Nurses Association nurses union, said in an email Monday. “We look forward to negotiating as long as it takes to reach a settlement.” St. Vincent Hospital CEO Carolyn Jackson also welcomed the negotiating session. “I am hopeful they will accept the proposal completely or with minor changes when they come back,” Jackson said Monday. Monday marked the 57th day of the strike – the longest nurse strike in Massachusetts in two decades, according to the union – as the hospital and nurses remained at odds over staffing. Nurses are mainly advocating for a 1-to-4 ratio of nurses to patients on medical or surgical floors and telemetry units, in most cases, with a resource nurse to pitch in; increased staffing in the emergency department; and ancillary support in each unit. The nurses have said the current, primarily 1-to-5 ratio is unsafe.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: While many businesses have struggled to stay afloat, the state’s budding recreational marijuana industry has flourished amid a growing acceptance of cannabis use and a surge in new consumers turning to the plant to deal with the stresses brought on by the pandemic. Michigan’s adult-use marijuana market opened up just a few months before the state announced its first COVID-19 cases. The industry has grown steadily since then. Sales in the adult-use market have more than quadrupled during the pandemic, starting at $21.9 million in March 2020 and reaching nearly $97.6 million in March 2021, the latest sales figures from the Marijuana Regulatory Agency show. For consumers, an increase in supply has helped bring down prices at a time when retailers say pandemic-induced stress has grown their customer base. To reach their customers, retailers have added curbside pickup and delivery and even changed their product lineup. Mike Elias, CEO of Common Citizen, with retail locations selling recreational-use products in Battle Creek, Flint and Hazel Park, said his stores turned to more “COVID-friendly” products. The company, for example, started making smaller joints designed for individual use as opposed to large ones meant to be passed around at social gatherings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials say the state saw a 27% increase in drug overdose deaths last year, with the first, largest increase coinciding with the outbreak of COVID-19. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, 1,008 residents died of drug overdoses in 2020. Drug-related deaths increased 64% in March 2020 compared with the previous year, then peaked at more than 100 fatalities in the months of May and August. Outreach resources became limited due to the pandemic. “With COVID there’s this terrible storm about lack of access to treatment medications, housing and treatment facilities,” said Dr. Ryan Kelly, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Kelly said people died because of limited access to treatment, the Star Tribune reports. “COVID has led to a huge increase for a lot of reasons,” said Marissa Bonnie, who does outreach for Southside Harm Reduction Services in Minneapolis. “A lot of people have isolated way more, which can lead to people using alone or having limited resources.” That includes access to lifesaving naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose, as well as clean needles to prevent infections, Bonnie said. As in previous years, opioids are among the substances that led to the most overdose deaths.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The mayor says he’s considering lifting the city’s mask mandate, which remains in place even after Gov. Tate Reeves removed nearly all pandemic-related statewide orders, but more residents need to get COVID-19 shots. Hundreds of first-dose vaccine appointments are going unfilled every day, Mayor Toby Barker said Monday, which he called concerning. “We can do better if more of us will go and encourage our friends and neighbors to get their vaccine as well,” Barker said. Hattiesburg’s current mask order expires at 5 p.m. May 15, but whether it will be lifted or extended is yet to be determined. Barker said the mandate was previously extended to allow everyone a chance to get vaccinated, and he encouraged anyone who has not been vaccinated to make an appointment. He said case numbers and hospitalizations must remain low if the mask mandate is to be lifted. “We’re on track to do that, but we know there are still a large portion of both Forrest and Lamar counties who have not received their vaccine yet,” Barker said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state’s third-largest city is easing its coronavirus restrictions, at least for outdoor activities. The Springfield City Council on Monday passed a bill removing the requirement that people wear masks outdoors in most cases. In a news release, the city cited new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that say fully vaccinated Americans don’t need to cover their faces outdoors anymore unless they are in crowds. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department determined that just 1,043 of the 28,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in those counties since the start of the pandemic were linked to outdoor exposure, with most of those happening at large gatherings such as sporting events. St. Louis city and county on Monday lifted their limits on the number of people allowed in restaurants, with officials citing a decline in new COVID-19 cases and increased access to vaccines. Restaurants must still space tables at least 6 feet apart, and masks are required indoors and outdoors if there isn’t enough space to socially distance. The state health department announced that its weekly review of death records found 66 additional COVID-19-related deaths. All told, Missouri has recorded 8,814 COVID-19 deaths and 503,615 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Tuesday that the state will end its participation next month in the federal unemployment program as it struggles with a worker shortage. Beginning June 27, unemployed workers will no longer receive $300 in extra weekly benefits, forgoing pandemic-related payments that were approved through Sept. 6. Instead, the state will launch a new program to provide bonuses to unemployed workers who return to work. “Montana is open for business again, but I hear from too many employers throughout our state who can’t find workers. Nearly every sector in our economy faces a labor shortage,” Gianforte said in a statement, adding that the federal unemployment benefits are “doing more harm than good.” Under the new incentive program, workers currently receiving unemployment benefits can qualify for a one-time $1,200 bonus after they have completed four weeks in a new job. The governor approved $15 million in funding for the incentives from federal coronavirus relief dollars allocated to the state. About 25,000 people are currently claiming unemployment insurance in the state, according to the Montana Department of Labor. The department also estimates there are about 14,000 job openings in the state.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of new coronavirus cases in the state has declined to levels not seen since last July, but the pace of vaccinations is also slowing down across Nebraska. The state reported 1,166 new cases during the seven days that ended Saturday, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s down 29% from the 1,653 cases reported the week before. “We are going in the right direction,” Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska decreased over the past two weeks, going from 323.14 new cases per day April 18 to 199.00 new cases per day Sunday. The state said more than 70,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered across Nebraska last week. But that is down from 93,284 doses the week before and well below the mid-April peak of 211,057 in a week. More than 45% of the state’s population has now been fully vaccinated against the disease, and 1.46 million doses have been given statewide. The state said 220,481 COVID-19 cases and 2,244 deaths have been reported since the pandemic began. The number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state remains relatively low at 139.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Local authority over pandemic restrictions has now been granted to all of the state’s 17 counties after Washoe County commissioners approved a revised plan for the Reno-Sparks area Monday and successfully submitted the necessary endorsements to the state’s mitigation task force. Masks remain mandatory, but control over most all other COVID-19 mitigation measures began May 1 under local plans in Las Vegas and all other Nevada counties, where capacity limits and social distancing limits vary through the end of the month. Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, has set a June 1 date for lifting coronavirus mitigation restrictions statewide, including all capacity caps, with the exception of a mask mandate. Washoe County’s new plan allows full capacity in businesses that have enough space to comply with a 6-foot social distancing mandate. In Las Vegas and Clark County, the capacity cap rose from 50% to 80% on Saturday and will be eliminated when 60% of eligible residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine. On Monday, the percentage was 47% in Clark County. It was 45.4% statewide and 53% in Washoe County. Health officials say they hope to administer more than 1,000 doses a day at a big drive-thru COVID-19 shot clinic that opened Tuesday at the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Independence Day fireworks celebrations are returning to some communities, though they come with changes. In Portsmouth, the City Council voted to hold the celebration July3, with a rain date of July 5. Last year’s event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. City Manager Karen Conard said this year there will be no entertainment, food or vendors “so as to discourage gathering.” The Fourth of July fireworks display in Dover was moved to an area that will allow more of a 360-degree view for spectators, organizers said. “We usually see between 8,000 to 10,000 people in downtown Dover for a typical Fourth of July,” said Gary Bannon, the city’s recreation director. “We needed a location that would provide enough room for people to spread out. This location allows a lot of people to see it from their neighborhoods, too, so they can meet with their neighbors and safely have more smaller group settings outside.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will begin focusing on municipalities with low vaccination numbers to boost rates and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Gov. Phil Murphy in his press conference Monday listed 16 municipalities with populations over 10,000 where less than 40% of residents had received a first vaccine dose. As part of Murphy’s “Operation: Jersey Summer,” the state will work to encourage more residents to get shots. On the list were Garfield and Fairview in Bergen County, plus the city of Passaic. “This is not going to be a competition between towns and communities and/or meant to shame any community,” Murphy said. “To the contrary, having these numbers out there for everyone to see is important to ensure everyone is working and pulling together.” The Democratic governor said the state is putting together “an army of boots on the ground safely knocking on doors” in underserved communities across New Jersey to supply information and resources. A call center at the Department of Health will contact residents who preregistered for a vaccine but haven’t made an appointment. The state will continue to work with local religious leaders for a new initiative called “Grateful for the Shot” to make it possible for congregants to go directly from religious services to vaccination sites, Murphy said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators will return in July to in-person committee meetings amid evidence of retreating coronavirus infections and risks, the state House speaker announced Monday. Legislative hearings have been conducted largely by web conference since spring 2020 as a precaution against the pandemic. “We’re going to return to our normal protocol of in-person meetings just like before the pandemic,” House Speaker Brian Egolf, D-Santa Fe, told a panel of leading legislators via videoconference. The Capitol building reopened to the public last week, and a lead budget-writing committee gathered on the floor of the House of Representatives to hear testimony from a top state health official and other experts. Also Monday, Democrats appointed a new task force on rural economic opportunity and shuffled leadership posts on some year-round committees. First-term Sen. Siah Correa Hemphill of Silver City and state Rep. Candie Sweetser of Deming will together lead the new task force as co-chairwomen to identify barriers to rural prosperity and bring forward proposals to ensure universal access to full indoor plumbing, electricity and internet that often are unavailable in remote areas of the state. Sen. Bill Soules of Las Cruces will take the reins as chairman of the Legislative Education Study Committee.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Lawmakers passed a bill Monday to extend eviction protections for tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic amid growing calls for them to protect landlords from further income losses. Both the COVID-19 Emergency Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2020, touted as one of the strongest pieces of anti-eviction legislation in the nation, and the COVID-19 Emergency Protect Our Small Businesses Act of 2021, meant to provide eviction and foreclosure protection for small businesses, went into effect in late Dececember and expired Saturday. The Legislature voted Monday afternoon to extend the programs until Aug. 31. An unofficial tally showed the Senate passed the bill 42 to 21, and the Assembly later passed it 91 to 57. “This new extension will continue to ensure that New York tenants, homeowners, business owners and small landlords will not have to fear losing their homes or businesses,” Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said. “This pandemic has been devastating on so many levels, and this legislation will help give our residents and businesses time to get back on their feet.” It will now be up to Gov. Andrew Cuomo to sign or veto the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State House members no longer have the option to cast floor votes remotely – a result of improving conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The House returned this week to operating rules in which members must be present in the chamber to vote. House leaders offered proxy voting starting last spring. Members concerned about contracting the coronavirus could vote from their homes or offices through the majority or minority leader. Those emergency operating rules rolled over into the first months of this year’s session. The number of members using proxy voting has dwindled as more legislators have received COVID-19 vaccines. Still, committees can continue to use online technology to conduct hybrid meetings, Speaker Tim Moore said. The Senate never offered proxy voting but continues to let senators participate in committees online. Indoor mask-wearing has been encouraged but never required in the legislative complex. Legislative building security stopped taking visitors’ temperatures last month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Department of Health is encouraging residents to get vaccinated and continue to practice prevention measures to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. The increase in the number of active cases since early March, the emergence of new coronavirus variants and the increase in the number of hospitalizations highlight the fact that the virus is still circulating in the state, the agency said. The state’s emergency declaration was lifted Friday, but “COVID-19 cases continue to be reported from our communities in North Dakota, and people continue to be hospitalized for COVID-19,” said Kirby Kruger, disease control and forensic pathology section chief. Interim State Health Officer Dirk Wilke said residents should “keep using preventative measures including physical distancing, wearing a mask when you can’t distance, getting tested and most importantly getting vaccinated.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As teachers pivoted to online learning last school year, some faced a unique challenge: What would happen to their class pets? “Those are some of the pandemic things people don’t think about,” said Katie Guehl, a fourth grade teacher at Indian Run Elementary School in Dublin. Kids “are excited to befriend her,” Guehl said of Daphne Phyllis, a red-eared slider turtle. “They may not remember my math lesson at the end of the day, but they’ll remember feeding the turtle.” Daphne Phyllis went between the houses of two students during the spring and summer. Guehl, who is still teaching remotely because of parent requests, brought the turtle back to the classroom in the fall and starts every school day by wheeling her laptop on a cart right up to the tank. “Class pets are definitely more fun when you have the children in the room,” she said. Kyle Campbell, a zoology teacher at Westerville North High School, has 23 tanks in his classroom full of species including an alligator, turtles, snakes, toads, a bearded dragon, crabs, geckos, catfish and a tarantula. He couldn’t take all the animals home when schools closed last spring, so he went into the classroom three days a week throughout the spring and summer to take care of them. “The pandemic wasn’t good for anybody, but it was hard on the animals, too,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt lifted the state’s COVID-19 emergency declaration, effective Tuesday, citing data that shows declining new cases and hospitalizations. Stitt noted that Oklahoma’s seven-day average of new cases is down 94% from its peak and that hospitalizations also are down 90% and have stabilized over the past two weeks. “My promise has been to make decisions based on the data in our state, not what’s happening anywhere else,” the Republican governor said. The emergency declaration eased some licensing restrictions for medical professionals and gave state agencies more flexibility to shift funding and employees to respond to the pandemic. The ending of the emergency will also require governmental bodies to begin meeting in person within 30 days.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A lack of adequate shelter beds has long plagued the state, where a recent estimate suggests 10,000 people sleep outside on any given night – a number that has likely increased during the pandemic. But on Monday, lawmakers passed a bill that will make it easier and quicker for communities to create emergency shelters and temporary housing. House Bill 2006, which the Senate passed 26-1, will remove barriers to siting shelters by temporarily adjusting land use laws and waiving some design, planning and zoning regulations. “Multiple cities have come out in support of the bill because they recognize the need in their communities – in every community – for us to take steps toward alleviating the suffering of our neighbors who have lost their housing,” Sen. Deb Patterson, D-Salem, during the Legislature’s floor session. “It should not take an emergency for us to recognize this need. But we are in an emergency now. We must act.” A similar bill was passed in June but expired after 90 days. The new bill, awaiting consideration by Gov. Kate Brown, would expire in July 2022. The state’s 2019 point-in-time count indicated nearly 16,000 people were experiencing homelessness, with 10,000 living in unsheltered locations. Experts say the pandemic and 2020 wildfires have likely exacerbated the situation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will lift all COVID-19 restrictions – except an order to wear a mask while in public – on Memorial Day, the Wolf administration announced Tuesday, promising to restore some semblance of normalcy more than a year into pandemic. Capacity restrictions on bars, restaurants and other businesses, as well as indoor and outdoor event gathering limits, will go away May 31, the Department of Health said. The state made the announcement with little fanfare, via news release. “We continue to make significant progress in the fight to stop the spread of COVID-19 and as more Pennsylvania adults get vaccinated and guidance from the CDC evolves, we can continue to move forward with our reopening efforts,” Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said in the statement. The Health Department said an order requiring people to wear masks while away from home will be lifted once 70% of Pennsylvanians age 18 and up are fully vaccinated. That percentage stood at nearly 42% on Tuesday, according to federal data, while 63% of adults had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The Health Department said municipalities and school districts can continue to impose their own restrictions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Federal authorization to use Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15, which is expected to come soon, will not only help get more of the general population protected but also help improve prospects for fully reopening high schools in the fall, coronavirus expert Dr. Ashish Jha said Tuesday. “Right now, we have about 44% of Americans who have gotten at least one shot. These 12- to 15-year-olds represent another about 4% or 5% of the population – about 16 million,” Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, said in his weekly podcast hosted by the Providence Journal. “Let’s say half of them get vaccinated in the next month or so. That will cause another dampening effect on lowering infection rates across the country.” When schools reopened this past year, high schools were always the hardest-hit by coronavirus outbreaks. With more high school students vaccinated, “there just is no explanation anymore and no medical and public health reason that high schools cannot be open 100%, full-time normal, this fall,” he said. He also said he expects the federal government this summer to lift the emergency use authorization label from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and give them full license status, which could ease hesitancy to get a shot.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Private schools and colleges asked a federal judge Monday to strike down the provision in the state’s constitution that bars public money for private and religious schools, saying the 1895 measure is discriminatory. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston and South Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities filed the lawsuit last month. The state Supreme Court has blocked Gov. Henry McMaster’s efforts to share COVID-19 relief money with private schools or private school parents, citing the state constitution. Daniel Suhr, an attorney for the plaintiffs with the Washington, D.C.-based Liberty Justice Center, told U.S. District Judge Bruce Hendricks on Monday in Charleston that the amendment is blocking historically Black colleges and universities and Catholic schools from receiving “fair, equitable access” to the money. “South Carolina has come a long way since 1895,” Suhr said, according to The Post and Courier. “But though the state has come a long way, its past is with us still.” The provision is one of a number of “Blaine Amendments” embedded in state constitutions, named after Maine Republican James Blaine, who advocated for them in the late 1800s as a way of blocking public money from going to Catholic schools.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: At the recommendation of university presidents, a systemwide mask requirement for all public indoor spaces on campuses in place since last fall will end next week. Masks will be optional at the state’s public universities starting Monday, the South Dakota Board of Regents announced Tuesday. “Our system has continuously responded to changing circumstances caused by the (COVID-19) pandemic,” Regents executive director and CEO Brian Maher said in a statement. “With vaccines now widely available, our institutions are eager to adjust as we look forward to the fall semester.” Administrators will continue to monitor conditions, making “the best decisions possible” with information available to them, Maher said. The announcement follows the Regents’ plan for a return to normal campus operations this fall.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: For Brad Paisley, getting a COVID-19 shot at Expo Park in Franklin felt like a patriotic act. “It was emotional seeing the National Guard – in many ways on the forefront of defending this country – manning the post of making that (vaccine) available,” he said. “We can’t let the noise drown out the achievement here.” Paisley spent much of the past month encouraging others to get inoculated, a vital step to return to normalcy in a live entertainment industry bulldozed in the last year by COVID-19 cancellations and restrictions. He appeared in a national public service announcement produced by Vanderbilt Health that shows him inside an empty Bridgestone Arena, encouraging viewers: “Be a fan. Take the shot.” But Paisley and the health community face an uphill battle in the South, where vaccine hesitancy deeply intertwines with divisive politics. In Tennessee, the most conservative counties lag the furthest behind, per a recent USA TODAY Network investigation. Still, Paisley stands with Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and others in mainstream country music who encourage listeners to get a vaccine. He returns to the road this summer – including a headlining performance at Nashville’s 4th of July celebration, billed by the city as its “first major post-pandemic event” – and hopes to perform for audiences of mostly vaccinated or immune onlookers.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Objecting to COVID-19 vaccines as “experimental injections” and coronavirus tests as invasive medical procedures, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller asked a state judge Tuesday to void Texas Senate rules limiting access to Capitol visitors who obtain a negative test or show proof of vaccination. “I believe in the statement in the constitution that the citizens of Texas have the right to petition their government,” Miller testified. “I can’t see where it says if they’ve taken a COVID vaccine, or if they’ve taken a COVID test, or they take a, you know, strep test or if they take an HIV test.” During a three-hour hearing, he told state District Judge Jan Soifer of Travis County that the requirement “restricts the public’s access.” Senators unanimously adopted rules for this legislative session that require a negative virus test, administered at no cost at the Capitol’s north entrance, to get a wristband granting access to a committee hearing room or the gallery overlooking the Senate floor. Those showing proof of vaccination can also get a wristband. Lawyers for Attorney General Ken Paxton defended the rule as a reasonable effort to protect health and ensure the Senate’s continued operation under authority granted by the Texas Constitution. Soifer ended the online hearing by saying she hoped to issue a ruling by Friday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported 2,581 new coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, down 3.5% from the previous week. Utah ranked 34th among the states where the virus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. With 0.96% of the country’s population, Utah had 0.75% of the country’s cases in the past week. Utah ranked 34th among states in share of people receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 39.8% of its residents at least partially inoculated. The national rate is 44.3%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 132,249 shots, including 56,176 first doses. In the previous week, the state administered 164,421 vaccines, including 82,104 first doses. In all, Utah reported it has administered 2,167,913 total doses. Across the state, 22 people were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday. In the week before that, 18 deaths were added. A total of 398,012 people in Utah have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and 2,204 people have died from the disease, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is now leading the nation in the number of COVID-19 vaccines administered per 100,000 people but is slightly below the national average in the number of 18- to 29-year-olds getting the shots, state officials said Tuesday. Nearly 95% of Vermonters over age 65 have gotten at least one dose, but only about half of people under age 30 have been vaccinated or made an appointment to get a shot, Gov. Phil Scott said. The state needs to increase those numbers in order to hit the June 1 goal of having more than 70% of eligible residents vaccinated so that by July, enough of the state will be immunized for mandates and restrictions to be dropped, Scott said. “So if you want to attend concerts, fairs and festivals, if you want restaurants and bars to stay open past 10, do your part and get vaccinated,” the Republican governor said. “This is truly is a moment of service.” The state is hosting a number of pop-up clinics at colleges, worksites, fairgrounds and speedways that will allow walk-ins, said Human Services Secretary Mike Smith. Those included clinics at Middlebury College and Bennington College on Tuesday; St. Michael’s College on Thursday; Northern Vermont University in Lyndon on Friday; Castleton University on Saturday; and Northern Vermont University in Johnson on May 11.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Legislators don’t want to wait until fall for a report on the Virginia Employment Commission’s progress in processing unemployment claims. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission will study problems the employment commission has encountered during the pandemic. It faced an increase in claims because of coronavirus-related job losses and additional federal assistance in response. At a legislative commission meeting Monday, Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William County, called it a “fundamental failure” when people need action and aren’t getting it. Del. Ken Plum, the legislative panel’s chairman, assured McPike and other members that staff will update them before study findings are scheduled to be presented Nov. 15. The Fairfax County Democrat said he expects progress “along the way” at the employment commission.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: More people will be allowed at indoor and outdoor spectator events and indoor religious services if there are designated sections for those vaccinated against COVID-19, under new guidance issued by Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday. The change – which takes effect immediately – affects capacity at sporting events, graduations and other events for counties in the second and third phases of the state’s economic reopening plan. A vaccination card or other documentation that proves inoculation status will be needed for access to vaccination sections. While previously there were only limited circumstances in which spectator events were allowed to reach 50% capacity, under the new guidance, outdoor facilities may add vaccinated sections until their total capacity – including vaccinated and unvaccinated sections – is at 50% or 22,000 people, whichever is lower. There can be no more than 9,000 unvaccinated people at the outdoor event. For indoor facilities, vaccinated sections can also be added until their total capacity is 50% maximum, though the maximum number must not exceed 2,000 people, and the number of indoor unvaccinated spectators varies depending on the size of the room and what phase of the state’s economic opening plan a county has reached.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state will offer free vaccination clinics at state parks and forests through Memorial Day. Currently, clinics are open at 10 sites, and that will expand to all parks and forests on Memorial Day weekend. Vaccines are available to guests, employees and families of employees. The clinics will be held outdoors. More details are available at wvstateparks.com. The sites that currently have clinics are Berkeley Springs State Park, Cedar Creek State Park, Chief Logan State Park, Coopers Rock State Forest, Greenbrier State Forest, Kanawha State Forest, Little Beaver State Park, Pipestem Resort State Park, Tu-Endie-Wei State Park and Tygart Lake State Park. Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that clinics will also be set up at “high-traffic areas” such as fairs and festivals, church parking lots, sporting events, businesses and other places.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: About 22% of Milwaukee County House of Correction inmates have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, data released last week shows. Officials said they are working to address vaccine hesitancy among inmates in an effort to get more shots in arms. Vaccination is seen as key to returning to a level of normalcy in the facility, where it’s much harder to maintain social distance. It’s unclear how the 22% figure for those incarcerated at Milwaukee’s House of Correction compares to vaccination rates for jail inmates in other counties, as few seem to be releasing the data. That figure will fluctuate as people move in and out of House of Correction custody. Geoffrey Swain, president-elect of the Wisconsin Public Health Association, praised the county’s transparency. “I think what the county is doing is really leading the way in terms of what we should expect in terms of reporting on progress for vaccinations for facilities that have incarcerated people,” Swain said. When it comes to those at state Department of Corrections facilities, 6,437 prisoners had received at least one dose of vaccine as of April 27, online records show. That’s about 33% of the approximately 19,500 prisoners incarcerated at DOC facilities.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A state official has said the 2022-23 state budget will be developed without cuts thanks to improved revenue projections made public last week. Michael Pearlman, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, said Friday that there will be zero reductions to the general fund and the budget reserve account, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The announcement came on the heels of a string of budget cuts in the past year that stemmed from the pandemic and a downturn in the energy industry. State officials determined there would be no cuts after a report by the state’s Consensus Revenue Estimating Group released in January was informally updated to show the state has more money than previously projected. The group is tasked with developing projections each year for the state’s main source of income. The update Thursday was not an official report amendment but is a conservative indicator, officials said. It showed Wyoming’s general fund budget exceeds the January projection by 4.6%, or $45.5 million, and the budget reserve account exceeds the January projection by 16.2%, or $25.7 million. Still, some state leaders have cautioned against the early estimate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/05"}]}

The letter listed Shein and Temu as platforms that raise specific concerns.\n\nUSA TODAY could not immediately identify any specific products sold by Temu or Shein that have been linked to the deaths of babies.\n\nThe commissioners cited an article in The Information last month reporting that products deemed dangerous for babies and toddlers can still be purchased on bargain sites. The article listed \"padded crib bumpers\" banned by Congress in 2022 for being a suffocation hazard for babies as an example of a product still available on the sites.\n\nThe letter urged the commission to fulfill its obligations of \"protecting consumers from items that pose an unreasonable risk of injury.\"\n\nShein, Temu assure safety regulations are enforced\n\nA Temu spokesperson said in a statement that all sellers using the platform are required to comply with applicable safety laws and regulations.\n\n\"Our interests are aligned with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in ensuring consumer protection and product safety, and we will cooperate fully with any investigation,\" Temu's statement read.\n\nShein said it has invested millions of dollars toward customer safety, which a spokesperson called a \"top priority.\"\n\nOver the last year the company has spent $10 million toward developing its global compliance function and enhancing safety practices.

The agency also pressured Facebook to block the sale of recalled Boppy loungers on Facebook Marketplace, saying that on average the agency finds 1,000 of the products listed there each month.\n\n“We call on you to identify recalled and violative products and to prevent their listing by your users,” the commissioners wrote in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook parent company Meta. “By allowing such products to be posted, you are putting Facebook Marketplace users at risk.”\n\nThe CPSC and The Boppy Company recalled 3.3 million Boppy Newborn Loungers in September 2021, saying infants could suffocate while using them.\n\n“Loungers and pillow-like products are not safe for infant sleep, due to the risk of suffocation,” Robert S. Adler, then the agency’s acting chairman, said in a statement at the time. “Since we know that infants sleep so much of the time – even in products not intended for sleep – and since suffocation can happen so quickly, these Boppy lounger products are simply too risky to remain on the market.”\n\nThe month after the recall, another infant died after being placed on the lounger for sleep and rolling underneath a nearby adult pillow, according to the agency.\n\nThen in November 2021, an infant was found dead after being placed in a Boppy lounger in an adult bed – the 10th child known to have died.\n\nDangerous recalled products still popping up on Facebook Marketplace\n\nThe CPSC and safety advocates have for years urged Facebook to stop the sale of recalled products on its site.\n\nLess than two months ago, CPSC Chairman Alexander Hoehn-Saric wrote the company regarding another dangerous product for sale on the site, the Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play. The product, which was recalled in April 2019, has been linked to about 100 infant deaths, including eight since the recall.\n\nNews:Despite 100 reported infant deaths, Rock ‘n Play sleeper still for sale on Facebook Marketplace\n\nAnd yet, Hoehn-Saric said that the agency had found nearly 4,000 of the inclined sleepers on resale sites over a 13-month period, mainly on Facebook Marketplace. Even though Facebook quickly removes listings flagged by the CPSC, he wrote that there is no way to know how many of were missed or sold before the ads were taken down.\n\nIn Tuesday’s letter to Zuckerberg, the commissioners said that Facebook appears to have since blocked the ability to search for certain terms related to the Rock ‘n Play, “limiting – but not eliminating – the ability for consumers to search and find such products.”\n\n“This is a helpful first step, but a system that prioritizes prevention of such sales should be able to spot recalled products in real time, not just restrict searches when the matter gains government attention and public notoriety,” the commissioners wrote.\n\nMeta spokeswoman Ashley Settle acknowledged in a statement that, as with other resale sites, there are instances of “people knowingly or unknowingly selling recalled goods on Marketplace.”\n\n“We take this issue seriously and when we find listings that violate our rules, we remove them,” she said.\n\nThough it is illegal to sell any recalled products, many are regularly found for sale on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nA 2021 USA TODAY investigation found deadly recalled children’s products regularly changed hands through Facebook Marketplace even though technology such as photo or text recognition makes them relatively easy to find and remove.\n\nUSA TODAY found listings for 14 recalled products that had contributed to the deaths of at least 121 children and hundreds more reports of incidents or serious injuries. Many were listed by their brand names. Dozens were later marked as sold. Reporters also were able to purchase recalled goods on Facebook Marketplace and create posts for recalled items as if they were for sale.\n\nWhy is the Boppy lounger dangerous?\n\nInfants can suffocate when using the Boppy lounger if they roll into or are placed in a position that obstructs their breathing, or if they roll off the lounger onto a surface such as soft bedding.\n\nThe CPSC on Tuesday, in its warning issued jointly with The Boppy Company, reiterated that the safest place for a baby to sleep is on a firm, flat surface in a crib, bassinet or play yard.\n\n“Parents and caregivers should never add blankets, pillows, padded crib bumpers, or other items to an infant’s sleeping environment,” the agency said in a news release. “Babies should always be placed to sleep on their backs.”\n\nWhich Boppy loungers were recalled, and what should I do if I have one?\n\nThe 2021 recall included the Boppy Original Newborn Lounger, the Boppy Preferred Newborn Lounger and the Pottery Barn Kids Boppy Newborn lounger.\n\nIf you own any of these products, immediately stop using them.\n\nConsumers who take part in the recall can receive a refund or partial refund, depending on the product’s age.

The pandemic was in full swing, straining an already weary workforce hit by a decade of relentless budget cuts and rising demands.\n\nOne by one, the pharmacists dialed into a weekly conference call with their boss. He could have empathized with them or addressed the reality of their pressure-cooker environment – one that breeds medication errors and creates missed opportunities to prevent potentially deadly mistakes.\n\nInstead, CVS District Leader Khalil Haidar turned up the heat. He harped on his Texas-and-Louisiana-based team to hit corporate quotas: Sell more store memberships. Push for more prescription pickups. Vaccinate more people. He threatened discipline and staff cuts unless pharmacists convinced at least five customers that week to get a flu shot before flu season had even officially started.\n\n“If you get your goal, nobody will come after you,\" Haidar said on the call, one of several recorded and shared with USA TODAY. \"And many patients, they are ignorant. They don’t know what the flu is ... How are you going to convince them? How can you persuade them? That’s your job as a pharmacist.”\n\nPharmacists take an oath to hold patient safety in the highest regard when preparing and dispensing medication. But rising pressures inside the nation’s largest retail chains have forced pharmacists to choose between that oath and their job.\n\nThe situation was bad before the pandemic. COVID-19 made it worse. It has only gone downhill since then. Frustrations boiled over this autumn in a series of high-profile walkouts that left a string of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies shuttered or short-staffed. Those actions might have caught consumers off guard. But inside the troubled industry, it was the clarion call of a beleaguered workforce pushed to the brink.\n\nCorporations like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart have consistently slashed pharmacy staffing levels while simultaneously saddling their frontline workers with a burgeoning list of additional duties.\n\nStores that a decade ago might have had two pharmacists and six pharmacy technicians filling an average of 500 prescriptions a day now may have half the staff and an even higher prescription volume – plus an endless crush of vaccine appointments, rapid tests and patient consultation calls.\n\nEvery task is timed and measured against corporate goals that reward speed and profits. Staff who do not fill prescriptions fast enough, answer the phones quickly enough or drum up enough vaccination business can face discipline, reassignment or termination.\n\nPharmacists said it’s nearly impossible to meet all the demands without cutting corners, and when corners get cut, patients can get hurt.\n\n“The public’s health is in danger,” said Oklahoma City pharmacist Bled Tanoe, who quit her job at Walgreens in August 2021 over what she considered unsafe staffing levels and an emphasis on hitting corporate targets. “The incidents of error are multiplied by infinity.”\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed four dozen current and former retail pharmacists from different chains across the nation and spoke with industry leaders, patient advocates and patients harmed by pharmacy errors. Many pharmacists spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs.\n\nThe media organization also reviewed more than 100 emails from chain pharmacists sharing their concerns; inspected internal emails, text messages, metric score sheets and coaching notes; and listened to more than five hours of recorded conference calls.\n\nThese interviews, audio recordings and documents – along with dozens of pharmacist workplace surveys, task force studies and state board of pharmacy reports – add up to a prescription for disaster.\n\n“I could cry as to what’s happening in my profession,” said Daniel A. Hussar, a professor and dean emeritus at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he taught for 52 years before retiring in 2018 to focus on his family and his blog, The Pharmacist Activist.\n\nHussar lamented the transformation of a once-vaunted career into the equivalent of a fast-food job whose workers are pressured to upsell every customer and race through every order. Mistakes in that environment are not only common, he said, they’re potentially fatal.\n\n“At corporations like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid – the huge pharmacies – errors are a cost of doing business,” Hussar said. “I don’t think the boards of pharmacy or the colleges of pharmacy or the professional associations are doing enough to address the issues.”\n\nFor years, pharmacists have reported these problems to their state boards, complained to their professional organizations and warned the media. The New York Times wrote about how the dangerous workload imperils patient safety just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.\n\nPromises were made and broken – documented by pharmacists themselves in state surveys that followed.\n\nIn California, 91% of chain pharmacists surveyed by the state Board of Pharmacy in 2021 said they lacked the staff needed to ensure adequate patient care. More than half of pharmacists polled by the Kansas Board of Pharmacy in 2022 said they didn’t feel they could perform their jobs safely; the biggest reasons cited were a lack of adequate staffing and employer-imposed metrics, like filling a specific number of prescriptions a day or providing service to customers within a set time.\n\nHundreds of pharmacists in Ohio responded to a 2020 callout from their state board about the toll of their workload on patient safety in a report made public in the next year.\n\n“I feel a mistake is breathing down my neck as I try to manage all the tasks that I am asked to perform,” one wrote. Another said they had left the profession because “the environment was set up for me to fail.”\n\nState regulatory bodies overseeing pharmacies have for years refused to intervene. Their role is mainly to protect consumers, not pharmacists, and they traditionally considered many of these complaints – staffing, metrics, workload – outside their purview. They were seen as business decisions, not consumer safety issues, said Karen Winslow, interim executive director of the Virginia Pharmacy Association.\n\nThat’s starting to change, but not without a fight.\n\nOhio proposed a series of rules this year aimed at improving pharmacy working conditions. Among them: A ban on quotas and requirements for sufficient staffing. The rules are currently pending a vote amid overwhelming support from pharmacists and opposition from retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS.\n\n“The Board should stay focused on the regulation of the practice of pharmacy rather than the business of pharmacy,” wrote CVS Director of Regulatory Affairs John Long in opposing an early version of Ohio’s rules last year.\n\nVirginia passed emergency regulations in late September also banning production quotas and bolstering pharmacy staffing. Those rules are in effect until March 2025, giving the state time to develop and pass more permanent measures.\n\nEnforcing these rules could prove challenging. California, one of the first states to outlaw pharmacy production quotas and mandate minimum staffing, is coping with routine violations by retail pharmacies that then fail to provide records to inspectors seeking to verify complaints, state Board of Pharmacy minutes show.\n\nProfessional associations, meanwhile, have earned their members’ scorn for hosting workshops on resiliency rather than advocating for better working conditions. Many pharmacists told USA TODAY they feel like no one stands up for them.\n\nThat, too, is starting to change. In the wake of the CVS walkouts last month, the new head of the American Pharmacists Association, the industry’s largest professional organization, flew to Kansas City to meet with the organizers and committed to more aggressive leadership on these issues.\n\n“The APhA has been focused on longer-term fixes, and what we’ve heard loud and clear is we need to focus on the acute problems,” said Michael Hogue, the association’s chief executive officer and executive vice president. “That’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid for comment.\n\nRepresentatives of CVS and Walgreens generally acknowledged the challenges their pharmacists have faced in recent years but denied allegations of dangerous working conditions. They said goal-based metrics on measurable objectives such as quick prescription turnarounds, short telephone hold times and vaccination volumes are standard within the industry and meant to assess quality rather than penalize staff.\n\nCVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart all emphasized their commitments to patient safety and described their various efforts to continually reduce error rates.\n\n“Patient safety is our highest priority,” Amy Thibault, CVS Pharmacy’s lead director of external communications, told USA TODAY. “Our more than 30,000 CVS pharmacists approach this responsibility with seriousness and dedication and we work hard to earn the trust of our pharmacy patients.”\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Walmart also said they have invested in new technologies to streamline services, increased wages to better recruit and retain staff, and rolled out new initiatives to support their teams and reduce their workloads.\n\nThe major chains now provide half-hour lunch breaks for staff. Many also recently announced reduced pharmacy hours at locations nationwide. Walmart spokesman Tyler Thomason said reduced operating hours promote a “better work/life balance.”\n\nBut pharmacists told USA TODAY their workloads remain the same and that they’re pressured to work through lunch and stay late to finish everything. At locations where hours were cut, many pharmacists said, they’ve seen their salaries decrease accordingly.\n\n“I’ve given the company thousands and thousands of dollars in free labor,” said a CVS pharmacist who was on Haidar’s team during the pandemic-era conference calls. “Our bosses can log into the computer any time and tell how far behind we are. They will send group texts and say, ‘I see you’re trending behind. What are your plans to finish it tonight?’ Very intimidating comments. You fear for your job all the time.”\n\nHaidar, who now leads a different team, told USA TODAY the recordings must have been altered and that he never threatened staff with discipline for falling short of vaccination goals. He also said they are not an accurate depiction of his leadership. When asked if he would like to listen to the recordings, Haidar declined.\n\nMichael DeAngelis, CVS’ executive director of corporate communications, said it is not the company’s “policy or practice to penalize pharmacy teams regarding the number of vaccinations they administer” and that it “is committed to compensating our colleagues appropriately for the hours they work.”\n\nDeAngelis also said CVS recently reduced its pharmacy metrics by 50%, but he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWalgreens announced last year the complete elimination of performance-based metrics, the only major chain to have taken such a step. But interviews with pharmacists and documents provided to USA TODAY show the company continues to push staff to hit unrealistic goals.\n\nOne Walgreens pharmacist said she was reprimanded earlier this month for taking too long to verify prescriptions, even though her extra diligence had caught several serious mistakes.\n\nAccording to notes from her coaching session, shared with USA TODAY, she should take less than 30 seconds to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of every prescription, in addition to checking for potential problems like drug allergies or interactions.\n\n“I pray every day that I don’t miss something or cause a patient harm,” said the Tennessee-based pharmacist, who estimates she handles several hundred prescriptions daily. “I feel guilty knowing that I would want someone to double check the math on a prescription of antibiotics for my child, but I don’t have time to do that for their child.”\n\nMedication errors: A pharmacist's worst nightmare\n\nMedication errors are a pharmacist’s worst nightmare. Many told USA TODAY they lie awake at night wondering if, in their haste, they made a mistake that might hurt or kill someone.\n\nIn May 2021, that someone was Brenden Fisher.\n\nThe Sarasota, Florida, child overdosed on a newly prescribed anti-seizure medication after the CVS pharmacy near his home dispensed the drug with the wrong instructions on the label.\n\nBy the third dose, Brenden was lethargic, dazed and struggling to breathe. His parents, Paris Bean and Jason Fisher, rushed their then-2-year-old to the hospital, thinking he was dying.\n\nHospital staff didn’t know what was wrong with him, Bean recalled, until a nurse asked if he was taking his 1.2 ml of levetiracetam twice daily.\n\nWhen Bean told her the instructions said to give him 7.5 ml, “you could almost hear her jaw drop,” Bean recalled. “She said, ‘Did you give that to him?’ And I said, ‘Yes. Is that why we’re here?’ She said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised.’”\n\nBrenden still suffers from a full-body tic he first developed during the incident, his parents said. Dozens of times a day, he will suddenly stop whatever he is doing, clasp his hands together, clench his jaw and tense every muscle in his body while staring off into space. Each episode lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds.\n\nHis parents haven’t been able to definitively link the tic to the overdose, but they said they have no other explanation for it.\n\nAnti-seizure medications like levetiracetam depress the central nervous system, Hussar said. Because nerves tell muscles when to contract and relax, he said, there could be a connection between the overdose and Brenden’s involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nBean said she blames CVS for the mistake but also herself: “I’m the one who physically administered it ... I could have killed him.”\n\nCVS declined to comment on the error.\n\nBean and her husband filed a lawsuit against CVS in February that was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. But they said they did not file a complaint with the Florida Board of Pharmacy.\n\nThat means it’s one of countless errors for which there’s no official tally or public record.\n\nDespite a widespread industry belief that medication errors are on the rise as a result of unsafe working conditions, there is no reliable or comprehensive public data to prove it.\n\nNo federal agency requires pharmacists to report medication errors, and few state boards of pharmacy mandate it. Many pharmacies and pharmacy chains track errors internally but do not share the numbers with the public. CVS and Walgreens both declined to share their data with USA TODAY.\n\n“There really is no way of knowing how many errors are actually out there,” said Larry Selkow, a retired California pharmacist who recently served on the American Public Health Association’s task force on pharmacy medication safety issues.\n\nThe group estimated U.S. pharmacies annually make 54 million dispensing errors, of which 2.3 million are potentially harmful. It recommended the establishment of a national pharmacy reporting system to collect data on errors and their underlying causes. Having such information, Selkow said, would allow pharmacies to adopt practices to prevent future mistakes.\n\nNumerous pharmacists told USA TODAY that errors are not consistently reported – even internally. Small mistakes and those caught early are routinely hidden.\n\n“Some pharmacists don’t report it especially if they’ve already had, like, five errors that year,\" said Shane Jerominski, a California pharmacist who worked for both Walgreens and CVS. \"For every error that gets found out, there will be an error that never gets caught.\"\n\nEven when they do report potentially fatal errors, some pharmacists said, no one from their companies investigates how they occurred or makes changes to prevent them from repeating.\n\nA former CVS pharmacy manager at a short-staffed, high-volume store in Georgia said he was horrified when one of his patients who was prescribed Bisoprolol for high blood pressure accidentally received a sleeping aid called Belsomra and got sick after she started taking it.\n\nThe pharmacist, who now works for Walmart, said he had hoped the error would be a wake-up call for higher-ups who might finally give his store adequate staffing. It didn’t work out that way.\n\n“They had me do that little report, but my manager, nobody ever followed up,” he said. “They were like, ‘OK, cool, see if she would like a gift card, and we’ll handle it from here.’ And that was it. It’s like they could care less. Like it didn’t even happen.”\n\nCVS did not comment on the incident, but Thibault said that the company’s first priority when it learns of any error is the patient’s safety. She said it then takes steps to correct the error and learn from it. Walgreens said in a statement that it’s mandatory for employees to report errors under the company’s “Continuous Quality Improvement Program.”\n\n“We take any prescription error very seriously and have a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the rare chance of human error,” said Marty Maloney, Walgreens’ senior manager of media relations.\n\nPharmacists are personally liable for medication errors and risk fines, discipline and loss of license if investigated and found responsible by their state board. Many told USA TODAY they get little or no support from their company when mistakes happen, even if the conditions imposed by those companies contributed to the error.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Pharmacy in September fined and suspended the licenses of two CVS pharmacists who accidentally gave a pregnant woman the abortion drug misoprostol instead of the fertility treatment she was prescribed. The mistake, which was first reported by 8NewsNow in Las Vegas, ended the woman’s pregnancy.\n\nThe Nevada board also fined CVS $10,000 over the objections of company attorney William Stilling who argued CVS itself did nothing wrong.\n\n“The only allegation” against CVS, Stilling said, “is that they had these pharmacists.”\n\nPharmacy benefit managers played role in the current crisis\n\nRetail pharmacy wasn’t always this bleak.\n\nTwenty years ago the industry was thriving. CVS and Walgreens were opening new locations at a rapid clip. New pharmacy schools popped up to meet the needs of a profession in high demand. Meanwhile, Americans’ appetite for prescription drugs was soaring.\n\nIndependent and chain pharmacies alike were earning relatively healthy profits from drug sales and could afford to hire and retain enough staff to keep their operations humming.\n\nA constellation of factors contributed to the industry’s downturn. They include rising drug costs, changing consumer habits and the emergence of online pharmacies.\n\nBut none looms larger than the outsized influence of pharmacy benefit managers. These third-party administrators of health insurers’ prescription drug programs have eroded the profits of retail pharmacies to the point where they now lose money on many sales.\n\n“In today’s world, 7 out of 10 medicines dispensed by a pharmacy are dispensed at a loss,” Hogue said, referring to the non-generic drugs that represent pharmacies’ largest expense.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, commonly referred to as PBMs, act as a middleman between the insurers, the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies. They negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, determine which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and set reimbursement rates for pharmacies that buy and sell the drugs.\n\nAs the power of PBMs rose over the years, they demanded bigger rebates from drug manufacturers and pocketed increasingly bigger shares of those savings instead of passing them along. They also lowered pharmacy reimbursement rates and tacked on hefty fees known as Direct and Indirect Remuneration.\n\nThe three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, owned by Cigna; CVS Caremark, owned by CVS Health; and OptumRx, owned by the same company as UnitedHealthcare – control a majority of the market.\n\nWhile PBMs’ collective profits skyrocketed over the past decade, their tactics plunged retail pharmacies into financial distress and left them scrambling for alternative sources of revenue, like vaccinations, to stay afloat.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry last year into PBM practices, which have already been the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nIndependent pharmacies have been hit especially hard. Not only are their reimbursement rates lower than those of chains, but their patients have been steered away by PBMs that insist they use a preferred chain pharmacy instead.\n\nCharles Thompson, a pharmacist and independent owner of Grove Park Pharmacy in Orangeburg, South Carolina, said he has lost countless customers who were told by their PBMs to use CVS and Walgreens instead. Between that and the lower reimbursements, he said, Grove Park had to diversify to stay open. It now offers an in-store medical clinic, hospice services and medical equipment rentals.\n\n“If I had to rely only on filling prescriptions,” Thompson said. “I would be out of business.”\n\nOther independent pharmacies simply closed. The United States has lost more than 3,500 mom-and-pop pharmacies in the past decade, according to data from the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies.\n\n“The independents have been the canaries in the coal mine,” said B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association.\n\nNow the chains are following suit. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid all recently announced the closure of hundreds of pharmacies as they face slumping revenues and the fallout from multiple lawsuits for their alleged roles in the nation’s opioid crisis. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\n\n“It’s all coming home to roost,” Hoey said of the PBMs’ unchecked power and their practice of steering patients away from the independents and into the chains. “It has overloaded the system, and also that corporate mentally of just, ‘we’re going to work the workers to death,’ I think that’s coming home to roost, too.”\n\nPharmacists bleeding, crying, working alone\n\nLike the metaphorical frog boiling in the pot, Wendy Lear said she didn’t realize how bad her job at CVS had gotten until there were so few staff left that she was forced to work alone, even when she had no business being behind the pharmacy counter.\n\nLear’s stint with CVS started in 2009 when the chain bought the independent pharmacy where she worked in Lexington, Kentucky. The transition was dramatic but initially tolerable, Lear said, because CVS retained enough pharmacists and technicians to meet the patients’ needs.\n\nBut that changed over the years as CVS whittled away its staff while heaping more work upon the few who remained.\n\nOne time, Lear recalled, she went to work while miscarrying her first child because her boss couldn’t find anyone to cover her overnight shift and begged her to go in. Bleeding, cramping and emotionally distraught, Lear said, she fielded phone calls and filled prescriptions until she had to lie down on the floor.\n\nAnother time when she was sick with norovirus and vomiting in a trash can behind the pharmacy counter, Lear said, she was asked to keep working until her boss could find someone to replace her. Lear toughed it out for two hours before texting her boss for an update.\n\n“Any word???” she wrote. “I can’t stay here. I am so sick. I am going to have to close.”\n\nHer boss texted back, instructing Lear to have the store manager take care of patients in her absence.\n\n“That’s illegal,” Lear told USA TODAY of her boss’ request. “You have to have a pharmacist on premises to sell prescriptions. She was so frustrated I had to go home, and, it’s like, you have to have contingencies for when people fall ill during their shift.”\n\nEventually, Lear said, the demands of the job became too intense and the risk of errors too great – especially during solo shifts – that she quit CVS in 2021 and found a new job at an independent pharmacy, Remington Drug Co., in northern Virginia.\n\n“Answering phone calls, taking prescriptions at drop off, entering those prescriptions, verifying once, filling those prescriptions, verifying twice, running the register, giving vaccinations, making metric-monitored phone calls, all fell on one person,” she said of her job at CVS. “In a double-check system, who’s checking me? This is when patient safety is most compromised.”\n\nDeAngelis told USA TODAY it is not CVS’ policy or practice to require staff to work when they are ill.\n\nBut retail pharmacists from CVS and other chains across the country shared similar stories of corporate pressure and severe burnout:\n\n“All day long stuff’s blowing up and management is yelling at us because we can’t answer the phones fast enough and we’re not giving enough immunizations,” said a current Walgreens pharmacist in Arizona. “I’ve seen pharmacists cry back in the pharmacy because it’s so busy.”\n\n“This situation has slowly worsened, but the big turning point was when we started giving COVID shots,” said a current Walmart pharmacist in Iowa. “One day it was just me there, and I did 77 COVID shots.”\n\n“There was not a single week where I didn’t work 80 hours, but I was only paid 42,” said a former CVS pharmacist from Virginia. “We were behind on prescriptions the entire year. I was begging, ‘please can we get more hours?’ Instead, corporate would suggest we do these overnighters to get caught up.”\n\nThousands of retail pharmacists left the industry during the first two years of the pandemic, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported a 6% drop in employment numbers between 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlthough those numbers have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the latest data shows, overall interest in the profession has nosedived, raising questions about the future of pharmacy.\n\nApplications to U.S. pharmacy schools plummeted nearly 70% from their peak in the fall of 2009 to the fall of 2021, according to the most recent data published by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Those schools, which graduated nearly 15,000 students a year at their peak, are expected to produce just 11,000 new pharmacists annually by 2025, Hogue said.\n\nStuart Beatty, dean of Ohio Northern University’s Raabe College of Pharmacy, said his school is facing the same enrollment slump despite efforts to recruit students and reassure them of a bright future.\n\nIf he and his academic peers can’t reverse the tide, he said, the nation soon could face a severe pharmacist shortage.\n\n“It makes sense. Why would you go into a doctoral degree when all this is happening?” said Janan Sarwar, a Louisville-based pharmacist, publisher and career coach. “They want to help patients. They don’t want to enter a profession that oppresses their ability to help and do good in the world.”\n\nMistakes like this are why pharmacists say they're leaving\n\nShelby Richards blames chronic pharmacy understaffing for the medication error that cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Memphis Walgreens she frequented was always “busy, low staffed, lines out the door,” Richards said, including the day in March 2021 when she retrieved a newly prescribed anti-anxiety medication to treat panic attacks after a car wreck.\n\nInside the bottle were two sizes of round, white pills. Richards said she assumed they were different doses of the same drug because her doctor had mentioned wanting to start her on 5 mg of Buspar before increasing it to 10 mg.\n\nSo she started taking the smaller of the two pills, not realizing it was a different drug altogether – a calcium channel blocker called amlodipine to treat high blood pressure.\n\nWithin days, Richards said, she began to feel nauseous, light-headed and her legs were swelling – all common side effects of amlodipine. Uninsured, she racked up $15,000 in bills from three hospital visits as doctors tried in vain to determine the cause, records show.\n\nIt wasn’t until her boyfriend took a closer look at her medication and noticed the different-sized pills that she had an answer.\n\n“I told her it … should always be a separate bottle,” said her now-husband Taylor Richards, who researched the two pills online and learned the one she had been taking was the highest dose of amlodipine available.\n\nThe couple called Walgreens to report the error and said they were dismissed without an apology. They tried to sue but missed the state statute of limitations, so they filed a complaint with the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, which they provided to USA TODAY.\n\n“It seems like their staff is working like slaves,” Taylor Richards said. “There are usually two people back there, and it’s probably one of the busiest pharmacies around. I imagine they’re requiring them to fill so many prescriptions that it will continue to cause these types of errors.”\n\nWalgreens declined to comment on the error.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, said it’s a prime example of how working conditions put patients at risk and why so many of them are quitting the profession altogether.\n\nIt’s also why dozens of pharmacists recently walked out recently in protest. Another walkout is planned for Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Pharmacists are calling it Pharmageddon.\n\n“The primary reason is our concern for public safety,” said Corey Schneider, one of the CVS pharmacists who participated in the Kansas City walkout. “It’s also about basic decency. Pharmacists shouldn’t have to cry at work or go home worried that they made a mistake.”\n\nA few, like Tanoe, have funneled their frustration into advocacy. The former Walgreens pharmacist launched a public campaign in 2021 around the hashtag #PizzaIsNotWorking to highlight the dangerous working conditions that gestures such as free pizza from corporate won’t fix.\n\nSince then she has connected with thousands of retail pharmacy workers through her Facebook page, LinkedIn account and the online pharmacist advocacy community, RPhAlly, of which she is the vice president. She also helped organizers of the recent CVS and Walgreens walkouts share their messages and recruit participants and supporters.\n\nTanoe said it’s time the state pharmacy boards, professional organizations and corporate owners take these concerns seriously. If not, she said, the nation will see fewer pharmacies, fewer pharmacists and more incidents of patient harm.\n\n“For so long we have been told our patients come first – no matter what you do, your patient comes first,” Tanoe said. “Now, we are saying, no. We come first. We hold our patients’ lives in our hands. If we’re not well, they’re not well.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

But take a closer look. See the word “medicated” and the small white box at the bottom that says 600 milligrams of THC?\n\nThose three letters stand for tetrahydrocannabinol, the part of the marijuana plant that makes people high.\n\nEating even a small fraction of that bag would “overwhelm a child,” said Danielle Ompad, associate professor of epidemiology at NYU School of Global Public Health and senior author of a new study investigating copycat packaging in cannabis sales. The study was published Tuesday in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.\n\nAnother candy package Ompad examined was nearly identical to the popular candy Gushers. The label says the bag contains 500 milligrams of THC, while a look-alike bag of Doritos contained 600 milligrams. The resemblanceto the brand-name products is uncanny, she said.\n\n“The Nerd Rope knockoffs I have personally seen looked just like the licensed product,” Ompad said. “The (knockoff) Doritos were shaped just like the real thing and had a crunch as well.”\n\nEating 500 to 600 milligrams of THC would be a huge dose, even for an adult. “If I ate that whole package, I would be miserable. People who are using edibles recreationally aren’t typically eating more than 10 milligrams,” Ompad said.\n\nA child could easily mistake these copycat bags of edibles for the real candy and chips. Manufacturers are suing to get knockoffs to stop. Ompad et al. Drug Alc Depend 2022\n\nA thorough examination finds no manufacturer listed on the copycat packaging, she said. However, empty bags mimicking dozens of major brands of snacks and candy can be purchased onlinein bulk, she said, making it easy for small businesses to join the marketplace.\n\n“The reputable business people in cannabis do not engage in this kind of conduct,” said Henry Wykowski, legal council for the National Cannabis Industry Association. “There are other people that are still operating in the illicit market and they aren’t following the rules.”\n\n“We would like to assist in stopping this. It’s not good for anybody,” he added.\n\n“Many cannabis edibles companies are overstepping on marketing in an egregious way, putting consumers at risk and infringing on the trademarks of well-known and trusted confectionery brands,”saidChristopher Gindlesperger, the senior vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, in an email.\n\nThe association has established a set of guidelines for states considering deregulation of cannabis.\n\n“We’re focused on making sure that the appropriate guidelines and policies are set for distinguishing cannabis-containing edibles from traditional confectionery,” Gindlesperger added.\n\nManufacturers of various major candy and chip brands such as Mars Wrigley, Hershey Company, Mondelez Canada and Ferrara Candy Company have undertaken legal actions against a few companies that are selling knockoffs.\n\n“We are deeply disturbed to see our trademarked brands being used illegally to sell THC-infused products, and even more so to hear of children ingesting these products and becoming ill,” said a Mars spokesperson in an email.\n\n“We encourage consumers to reach out to their local authorities with any tips on these illegal products,” the spokesperson said.\n\nA growing problem\n\nWhile anyone might mistake a copycat candy or chip with the real thing, young children are especially vulnerable, Ompad said, as they may be easily drawn to the brightly colored bags often decorated with familiar cartoon characters.\n\nIf a child ingests ediblesthey can become “very sick. They may have problems walking or sitting up or may have a hard time breathing,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA study published in the journal Pediatrics examined calls to regional poison control centers from 2017 to 2019 and found there were 4,172 cannabis exposure cases in the US among children up to 9 years old. Nearly half (46%) of those calls involved cannabis edibles.\n\nMore than 70% of calls to US poison control centers related to marijuana edibles in 2020 “involved children under the age of 5,” according to New York Attorney General Letitia James, who issued a consumer alert inOctober 2021.\n\n“In the first half of 2021 alone, the American Association of Poison Control Centers has reported that poison control hotlines have received an estimated 2,622 calls for services related to young children ingesting illegal cannabis products,” the alert said.\n\nNews reports from around the US put those numbers into stark relief.\n\nA 3-year-old was admitted to a New Jersey ICU in December 2020 after eating “cannabis candy which looked identical to a Nerds Rope,” according to Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. A month later, a preteen was hospitalized in New Jersey after eating a large amount of marijuana-laced candy packaged “almost identically” to Sour Skittles.\n\nTwo children under 5 were hospitalized in Oklahoma in March 2021 after eating edibles from bags that looked just like Ruffles, Doritos and Fritos, according to Mark Woodward, public information officerfor the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. And the same month a Florida sheriff’s office posted a warning on Facebook with an image of dozens of knockoff edibles.\n\nNew Jersey has approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, which will soon go into effect, but Oklahoma and Florida have not.\n\nIf a younger child is exposed at home, it could mean adults were careless about leaving edibles lying around, Wykowski said.\n\n“I could sell you a responsibly packaged product that doesn’t look anything like candy,” he said. “But if you leave it out and it looks like a brownie, and your kid walks by and thinks, ‘Oh, I’m a little hungry. Dad left the brownies out,’ and then eats it, whose fault is that?”\n\nIt’s also possible teenagers could be obtaining edibles by faking identification or asking older friends to purchasethem, just as they do with alcohol, Ompad said.\n\nUntil the Wild West of cannabis marketing is tamed through regulation, the responsibility falls on parents to protect their children, experts say. Keep all marijuana products out of the reach of children in childproof containers, the CDC recommends. Better yet, lock them up, Ompad said.\n\n“I am not a person who thinks that cannabis should be illegal or that edibles should not be available,” she said. “We just need to do a better job of keeping them away from children and making it clear that they’re edibles and what the adult dose is to get the effect that you want.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/04/cdc-secret-lab-incidents-select-agents/95972126/", "title": "CDC keeps secret its mishaps with deadly germs", "text": "Alison Young\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has faced congressional hearings and secret government sanctions over its sloppy lab safety practices, is keeping secret large swaths of information about dozens of recent incidents involving some of the world’s most dangerous bacteria and viruses.\n\nCDC scientists apparently lost a box of deadly and highly-regulated influenza specimens and experienced multiple potential exposures involving viruses and bacteria, according to heavily-redacted laboratory incident reports obtained by USA TODAY. Several reports involve failures of safety equipment. In one, a scientist wearing full-body spacesuit-like gear to protect against lethal, often untreatable viruses like Ebola, had their purified air hose suddenly disconnect — “again” — in one the world’s most advanced biosafety level 4 labs.\n\nAfter taking nearly two years to release laboratory incident reports requested by USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act, the CDC blacked out many details including the types of viruses and bacteria involved in the mishaps and often the entire descriptions of what happened. In several cases, clues about the seriousness of incidents is revealed because CDC staff failed to consistently black out the same words repeated throughout a string of emails.\n\nThe CDC would not answer USA TODAY’s questions about specific incidents, which occurred at the agency’s laboratory facilities in Atlanta and Fort Collins, Colo., during 2013 through early 2015.\n\n“None of the incidents described in these documents resulted in reported illness among CDC staff or the public,” the CDC said in a brief emailed statement. Where incidents involved “inventory discrepancies,” the agency said generally the problems were addressed without posing a risk to anybody. The CDC said incident reports cover a time period before the Atlanta-based agency created a new lab-safety office in the wake of three high-profile incidents during 2014 with anthrax, Ebola and a deadly strain of bird flu.\n\nUSA TODAY’s “Biolabs in Your Backyard” investigation has revealed hundreds of safety incidents at public and private research facilities nationwide and highlighted how many university, government and private labs have fought to keep records secret about incidents and regulatory sanctions. The USA TODAY investigation also exposed that more than 100 labs working with potential bioterror pathogens have faced secret federal sanctions for safety violations, yet regulators allowed them to keep experimenting while failing inspections, sometimes for years.\n\nUSA TODAY also revealed details about the operations and safety records of more than 200 high-containment labs across the nation, facilities whose identities have eluded even the Government Accountability Office.\n\nIn an effort to determine the extent of the CDC’s lab-safety problems, USA TODAY filed a request on Jan. 6, 2015 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking copies of lab incident reports for the previous two years .\n\nBut the 503 pages of records the CDC released in many cases look like Swiss cheese when an incident involves any pathogen that is on a federal list of potential bioterror pathogens, called “select agents.” They include pathogens such as those that cause anthrax, Ebola, plague or certain avian or reconstructed flu virus strains.\n\nThe CDC cites a 2002 bioterrorism law to justify its redactions. That law allows withholding from the public certain records filed with regulators or information containing specific “safeguard and security measures.”\n\nHowever, in many cases, the CDC blacked-out information from lab incident reports that the agency often promotes when touting its capabilities and accomplishments on its website or in scientific journals, such as the fact that the CDC operates biosafety level 4 labs, the highest safety level, or that it studies specific organisms like the Ebola virus.\n\nThe CDC said it stands by its redactions.\n\nThe effort to keep details secret comes despite a 2015 White House memo to federal agencies calling for greater transparency in releasing information about research and incidents involving select agent pathogens. White House experts noted that withholding information often \"has negligible security value\" and that transparency can help improve public trust.\n\nThe CDC completely withheld 36 pages of lab incident records. In several other reports, the CDC redacted every word about what happened. In an August 2014 email with a subject line of “Lab Incident,” CDC blacked out the name and title of the writer. The author started the note: \"When I came in this morning.” Then the agency has blacked out about 10 lines of text, citing the bioterrorism law. The agency, however, did disclose the writer’s final sentence: “Please let me know if you have any questions.”\n\nThe CDC also redacted every word in a lab accident report from December 2013 that apparently involved a dangerous strain of influenza virus. Several CDC staff copied on the email are people who were involved in the agency’s controversial work in 2005 using reverse genetics to reconstruct the 1918 flu pandemic virus, which had killed as many as 50 million people worldwide. The only types of flu designated as select agents, and potentially covered by the bioterrorism law are specimens of the 1918 influenza virus and certain deadly strains of avian influenza. The CDC did not answer USA TODAY’s questions about what pathogen was involved or whether anyone was treated for potential exposure.\n\nSome records contain more clues than others about what went wrong.\n\n“The air hose connector on my suit came off while I was working in [redacted] again,” a CDC scientist wrote in a May 2013 email to other agency staff, who other records show have a history of being part of the agency’s Viral Special Pathogens Branch, which works with deadly viruses like Ebola. The scientist wrote that a colleague helped them “get out safely, reattaching my hose as best he could … I live to work another day!” The CDC sought to conceal that the incident occurred in a biosafety level 4 lab, blacking out a checkbox from the top of the form that corresponds to a BSL-4 lab on the agency’s main Atlanta campus. But it failed to redact the same information in some other reports. The form says the incident occurred while the scientist was working with mice infected with a virus, but the CDC blacked out the name of the virus. The CDC sent out a mass email to about 40 lab workers the same day reminding them to make sure that their protective suits are in working order and to “be sure to pay attention to your breathing air hose” and ensure that connections are tight, the records show.\n\nIn a February 2015 string of emails that involves what employment records show are multiple members of CDC’s influenza division, the agency cited the bioterrorism law in blacking out the entire subject line. In one email, the first word in the short subject line remained. It says: “Missing” and is followed by a short redaction that is likely the name of a pathogen. The emails discuss whether a report will need to be filed with federal select agent lab regulators and says: “I will need a detailed summary of the search for this box from everyone involved in the search.” The only types of influenza viruses that would require reporting to select agent regulators are deadly strains of avian influenza and specimens of the resurrected 1918 flu virus. The CDC wouldn’t answer any of USA TODAY’s questions about what was in the missing box of pathogens or whether it was ever found.\n\nThe missing box may not be the only influenza specimens the CDC couldn’t account for. In another email string from January 2015, the subject line says: “Report Additional Inventory Discrepancies — Flu Division.” However in one of the emails, the CDC blacked out the words “Inventory Discrepancies” by citing the bioterrorism law.\n\nThere was a “possible biological exposure” at a CDC lab in Fort Collins, Colo., in May 2013, according to a printout from the agency’s Medgate tracking system. However the CDC blacked out all words contained in the “Long Description (What Happened)” and “Five Why Analysis” fields, citing the bioterrorism law. According to limited information released on the form, the primary source of the injury was “Insects arachnids (spiders, ticks, scorpions etc.)” and the secondary source was “Select Agent.” The field for findings says only: “The only re-training that might be necessary is to remind staff to transport tubes vertically.” The CDC wouldn’t answer questions about what happened in the incident or what pathogen was involved.\n\nIn August 2014, a CDC lab worker suffered a “potential finger puncture from a glass capillary containing” a type of select agent pathogen that has been blacked out by the CDC. “I could not find a hole in my glove. I immediately washed my hands,” the printout from an electronic reporting system says. The full description of what happened in the incident was not viewable in the electronic form when the CDC printed the page it released. Elsewhere on the form, however, limited information provides intriguing clues. One part of the form discloses: “To evaluate if vial contained vaccinia. To evaluate the condition of Vaccinia. To understand how stable” — and the rest is redacted citing the bioterrorism law. The phrase indicates the scientist was evaluating the stability of a pathogen specimen over time. Vaccinia is a type of virus used in vaccines that protect against the smallpox virus, which killed three out of every 10 people it infected before being eradicated. While vaccinia is not a select agent, the smallpox virus is. In July 2014, a few weeks before this lab incident, long-forgotten vials of vaccinia and smallpox viruses dating back to 1946-1964 were discovered in a cold-storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and some of the vials were sent to CDC for evaluation. The CDC would not answer USA TODAY’s questions about whether the specimens in lab incident came from the discovery of forgotten vials at the NIH in July 2014 or whether the redacted pathogen name was the smallpox virus.\n\nIn addition to being a lab operator, the CDC co-runs the Federal Select Agent Program that inspects and regulates government, university, military and private labs that works with these regulated viruses, bacteria and toxins. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is CDC’s partner in the regulatory program.\n\nAfter winning a Freedom of Information Act appeal last year, USA TODAY revealed that the CDC is among a small group of biolab operators nationwide that have the worst regulatory histories in the country, receiving repeated sanctions under secretive federal regulations. The CDC had previously cited the 2002 bioterrorism law to keep secret the names of government, public and private labs — including its own — that have been suspended or that have faced enforcement actions for violating safety and security regulations in their work with potential bioterror pathogens.\n\nIn CDC’s recent document release, when incidents involved pathogens not on the select agent list, more details were sometimes available.\n\nIn April 2014, a mangled box filled with biological samples — at least one of them broken — arrived without any labels that it contained infectious materials by regular United Parcel Service delivery to the desk of a CDC worker, rather than to a laboratory, according to a 40-page email string about the incident.\n\nThe box, from the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health, had been shipped in a re-used box without appropriate packing materials and arrived with a “gaping hole” in one corner, according to the CDC emails. Inside the box were specimens of bacteria that cause potentially life-threatening Typhoid fever.\n\n“I’ve learned that there are indeed some tubes of Salmonella Typhi in this box, not sure if any are broken (don’t really want us to get our hands in the box we already know is contaminated and has broken glass in it to find out),” wrote Jean Whichard, team leader of the CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Team, in an email to other CDC staff investigating the risks posed by the shipment.\n\nIn the end, the CDC determined that only one vial broke and it contained Salmonella Newport bacteria, which has been associated with food-borne illness outbreaks. At least two CDC workers who handled the package underwent occupational health evaluations. In a later email, Whichard wrote “luckily no tubes flew out of the breach in the box during shipment, and I just gingerly lifted each tube out with forceps to confirm that none of the Typhi tubes broke.”\n\nOfficials at the North Carolina lab said they were unable to provide comment because of the recent holidays.\n\nTo read the records released by the CDC in response to USA TODAY's January 2015 Freedom of Information Act request, go to: CDC incident reports.

In addition to child-resistant caps, vape juice containers must dramatically limit how much can spill out of an open bottle. A vial can contain enough poison to kill four toddlers.\n\nBut nine months later – and nearly four years after a federal law called for flow restrictors – dangerous and illegal bottles remain on shelves across the country, a USA TODAY investigation has found.\n\nIn Detroit, a reporter purchased a pink bottle of berry-flavored vape juice violating the safety standards. In Liverpool in upstate New York, “Bad Drip” liquid nicotine was sold in a bottle without a flow restrictor. A bottle in Appleton, Wisconsin, was sealed with nothing more than wax.\n\nReporters had little trouble finding and buying vaping products in illegal bottles from Florida to Pennsylvania, California to South Carolina.\n\nThe extent of the problem across some 11,500 vape stores nationally remains unknown. Not even the federal agency enforcing the regulation can say how widely flow restrictors are being used.\n\nSince May, the CPSC has conducted at least 50 inspections of vape stores and sent more than 30 “notice of violation” letters advising manufacturers to stop selling products without safety protections.\n\nBut the agency has not publicly recalled any liquid nicotine bottles and lagging enforcement may be emboldening illegal product dumping.\n\nSandbar Vapor Lounge owner David Bivens, who had illegal bottles on his shelves in Vero Beach, Florida, said that in five years in the business he had never heard about the flow restrictor rule. He would have removed products without the safety feature, he added, if authorities had told him to.\n\n“I always follow the rules,” he said.\n\nIn Appleton, Wisconsin, Fox Valley Vapor store owner Brad Busse said he has seen manufacturers discounting bottles without flow restrictors. He thinks consumers may find the products “flooding the market.”\n\nCPSC commissioner Peter Feldman also observed bargain pricing on bottles of liquid nicotine appearing to lack flow restrictors at a vape store in northern Virginia, within 10 miles of the agency’s headquarters.\n\n“I’m concerned that the agency’s own actions have contributed to a spike in sales of noncompliant containers,” he wrote in a recent email to CPSC staff, blaming the “slow-walking enforcement.”\n\nThe agency is now concerned, too. It warned retailers on Friday that steeply discounting unsafe bottles shows “they know that they are engaged in selling illegal products.”\n\nThe failure of this simple fix to a vaping hazard is a cautionary tale amid today’s calls for stricter policing of e-cigarettes prompted by a rising epidemic of youth vaping and a new health threat: a deadly outbreak of vape-related respiratory illness that has sickened more than 2,000 people.\n\nAs regulation lagged, a new generation of tobacco products grew into a multibillion dollar industry whose consequences are still poorly understood. Government public health reviews of e-cigarettes are not required until next year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has sent mixed signals in an increasingly political fight over stronger regulations of vaping products. A public health push to ban certain flavored products drew protests from vapors who vote.\n\nProtecting children from poisoning, by contrast, was not nearly as complicated. Yet it took almost two years – and the death of a child – for Congress to pass a law requiring the bottles of liquid nicotine to include child-resistant caps, meeting safety standards applied to other household hazards.\n\nIt took an additional three years for regulators to clarify that the law also required the flow restrictors.\n\nIt has taken regulators nearly one more year to highlight the flow restrictor rule for retailers in Friday's open letter explaining the requirement. It was released after USA TODAY asked the agency about the illegal products that reporters purchased with ease all over the country.\n\nMeanwhile, emergency rooms saw an estimated 4,200 injuries in young children for liquid nicotine ingestion from 2015 to 2018, according to safety commission figures. From January to September of this year, the American Association of Poison Control Centers’ call logs include nearly 3,000 cases involving exposure to vaping products. More than half were for children 5 and younger.\n\n“I really hope that we learn from our past mistakes, so that we can better protect kids from dying,” said Kyran Quinlan, an American Academy of Pediatrics leader on injury violence and poison prevention. “The industry exploded and was moving very fast. The regulation of it was in slow motion.”\n\nRegulation in slow motion even after death\n\nIn 2014, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sounded alarms about rising calls to poison centers over young children exposed to liquid nicotine and e-cigarettes.\n\nQuinlan and other pediatricians warned the government that it was only a matter of time before a child died.\n\nLater that year, just before Christmas, their fears were realized when 1-year-old Eli Hotaling got into an open liquid nicotine bottle in an upstate New York home. He began to convulse and vomit blood, with his eyes rolling to the back of his head, according to a police report. When the ambulance pulled away, his skin was purple.\n\nBroad regulation of e-cigarettes as a tobacco product fell to the Food and Drug Administration, which had not yet finalized plans for doing so. The CPSC enforced safety packaging standards for hazardous household chemicals and drugs under rules set out by a 1970 poison prevention law.\n\nCongress came up with a seemingly straightforward fix: The bipartisan Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, signed into law in early 2016, required liquid nicotine bottles to meet child-protective packaging standards that were already established, such as caps and flow restrictors. The CPSC would implement it.\n\nPrefilled liquid nicotine pods that are sealed and contain less poison accessible to children, like those used by Juul e-cigarettes, were exempt.\n\nBut the CPSC did not fully enforce the law.\n\nLast February, three years after the law passed, “as much as 100% of liquid nicotine containers do not comply fully,” a newly appointed CPSC commissioner revealed in a Twitter post, citing the flow restrictor requirement.\n\nFeldman, a Republican, had helped write the law as a U.S. Senate staff member. His tweet called on CPSC to issue an “immediate stop sale order.”\n\nInstead, the agency sent out a letter promising it would soon give the industry guidance about meeting the flow restrictor requirement, acknowledging its previous silence on the measure.\n\nFeldman and another commissioner issued a statement criticizing the delay as unnecessary.\n\nIn March, CPSC put out complicated guidelines on testing bottles with flow restrictors to make sure they can spill no more than 2 milliliters of liquid at a time.\n\nDocuments obtained by USA TODAY show the CPSC’s then-acting chairwoman, Ann Marie Buerkle, proposed in July that enforcement be pushed off by an additional six months. Other commissioners rejected that idea.\n\n“When lettuce is killing people, or giving people diarrhea, we recall all the lettuce,” said Jonathan Klein, a pediatrician at the University of Illinois at Chicago long involved in the American Academy of Pediatrics’ youth tobacco protection efforts. “There are some issues with these products that ought to be addressed now. And that was true five years ago.”\n\nIllegal, dangerous bottles still on shelves\n\nThe CPSC has not announced a recall of any liquid nicotine product, a common way the agency protects consumers from other dangerous products. For poison prevention packaging violations alone, the agency has recalled more than a dozen products this year, from essential oils to craft glue.\n\nOne liquid nicotine brand with known problems was still being sold across the country in glass bottles without flow restriction. Reporters found “Naked 100” liquid nicotine in illegal bottles in California, Florida, New Jersey, Michigan and South Carolina in flavors such as “really berry” and “green lemon.”\n\nThe products were still readily available even though manufacturer USA Vape Lab’s website said it had voluntarily recalled four dozen products in July because they lacked flow restrictors. The company declined to comment further, citing a confidential agreement with CPSC over a “mutually agreed upon recall plan.”\n\nThe agency declined to comment on its handling of the product, saying in a statement “we do not discuss specific enforcement actions.”\n\nRecalling liquid nicotine products presents “safety and logistical issues” for consumers, the CPSC said, citing the shipping and disposal of hazardous materials.\n\nAlthough corporate penalties are rare, some manufacturers have received “notice of violation” letters from the CPSC telling them to stop sales and inform retailers – or risk large fines and even prison time, according to a copy obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThis is an important step, but it falls short of making the public aware of the problem, said Rachel Weintraub, the Consumer Federation of America’s legislative director. A recall would help to remove the bottles already in households with young children.\n\n“I am not seeing the rigorous compliance efforts that are necessary to protect consumers, especially children, from the dire hazard posed by liquid nicotine,” she said.\n\nWeintraub reviewed photographs of the open bottles purchased by USA TODAY across the country and confirmed they appeared to violate the flow restrictor requirement.\n\nThe CPSC said in a statement that it has prioritized the law’s “most effective safety provision,” resulting in an “overwhelming majority” of liquid nicotine containers now being packaged with caps that children cannot easily open.\n\nWith this year’s push for flow restrictors, it added that “the marketplace appears now to be moving towards increased compliance.”\n\nMany vape store retailers have noticed a shift to plastic containers with updated “unicorn” tube dispensers, saying they now make up most of their stock. These newer products appear to feature the required spill protection.\n\nLiquid nicotine manufacturer Bad Drip Labs in Rochester, New York, said that it has been months since it has shipped out the dangerous bottle style that a USA TODAY Network reporter purchased.\n\n“You can’t just turn on a light-switch and all of sudden your entire process is switched,” said Ken Gregory, one of the owners, adding that his company had tried to remove older products from some store shelves.\n\nIndustry rejects vaping 'hysteria'\n\nVaping enthusiasts think the political backlash against the industry has been overblown.\n\nRegulating manufacturers might not have saved the upstate New York toddler, because he was poisoned by a liquid nicotine solution that had been mixed and bottled at home.\n\nSimilarly, today’s calls for a flavor ban and to raise vaping’s age limit might not have prevented the latest outbreak of respiratory illnesses. Health investigators now think a key concern is an additive, vitamin E acetate, sometimes mixed into THC-containing vape products sold on the streets.\n\n“There is a level of hysteria around vaping that is not necessarily tied to the actual data,” said industry lawyer Boaz Green, whose firm Keller and Heckman wrote to CPSC on behalf of trade groups and manufacturers, disputing that the law explicitly required flow restrictors.\n\nOf the household hazards regulated by CPSC, the letter noted, only furniture polish also requires flow restrictors. More children were poisoned by bleach in 2017 than by liquid nicotine.\n\nTo pediatricians, however, liquid nicotine is a unique hazard, harmful through skin contact as well as ingestion. Bleach is like a mosquito bite – common but rarely serious – while liquid nicotine can be deadly with just a sip, said Quinlan, the pediatric injury expert.\n\nIn southwest Florida, Vape King owner Laura Kaman sells only products that she believes meet all the safety standards, including flow restriction.\n\nShe gained firsthand knowledge of the dangers: Her dachshund, Taco, once chewed on a low-nicotine bottle. Luckily, Taco was not harmed.\n\n“Accidents can happen,” Kaman said.\n\nThat’s the worry of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. This fall, he and the Republican chair of the Senate subcommittee overseeing the CPSC wrote a joint letter demanding that regulators urgently remove liquid nicotine bottles without flow restrictors from stores.\n\nAlmost two months later, and after USA TODAY asked about the senators’ letter, the agency sent its response last week. Acting CPSC chairman, Robert Adler, said its market surveillance has found that while liquid nicotine products do have child-resistant caps, “a significant number failed to include flow restrictors.” It noted the agency was making the issue a priority.\n\n“This lapse of enforcement is severe and serious and has left countless children at risk,” Blumenthal said earlier this fall, calling the poisoning regulations a case study in how an unenforced regulation is nothing more than an ineffective “dead letter.”\n\n“It makes a mockery of the law,” he said.\n\nLetitia Stein is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team, focusing primarily on health and medicine.

Hawaii topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country while Mississippi led the country with both the weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n“What this project does, is show what we’ve been saying for years: Gun laws save lives,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. “We think this is going to be a really important tool for lawmakers, reporters and advocates that have been looking for the kind of visual tool that can make that case clearly.”\n\nThe findings of the study have come into sharp focus following a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials told CNN that the gunman legally purchased two assault rifles for his 18th birthday.\n\nTexas has steadily loosened restrictions on gun ownership over the past several years. Last September, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. Texas is ranked 34 out of 50 states in Everytown’s gun law strength ranking.\n\nTo compile its list, the group used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at each state’s rate of gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates with 50 policies that they say are scientifically proven to be effective in preventing gun violence, Suplina said.\n\nThe research team then weighed the list of gun safety policies based on their efficacy, ranked each state on its implementation of those policies and compared that score with the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said.\n\nThe CDC’s data includes homicides, accidental killings and suicides committed by guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000 people in the United States were killed with a firearm in 2020 – more than half died by suicide.\n\nThe analysis, first reported by CNN, put California at the top of the list for gun law strength – a composite score of 84.5 out of 100, with a low rate of 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 residents, and below the national average of 13.6. Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country with the second strongest gun law score. It also has the lowest rate of gun ownership, with firearms in 9% of households, the data shows.\n\nFew gun control laws passed as 2022 sessions wrap\n\nAs state legislatures wrap up their2022 legislative sessions, lawmakers will consider a breadth of bills that either loosen or expand gun protections across various states.\n\n“I have seen firsthand in California that the work we have done to strengthen gun laws has been both life-saving and effective,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Gun laws work, and we need them across the board to ensure that felons, domestic abusers, and those with mental health issues can’t simply go to the next state over to circumvent the very laws meant to keep guns out of their hands.”\n\nCNN reached out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) to comment on the research before it was first published in January, but it declined to do so before seeing the data.\n\nMississippi has the weakest gun laws with a score of 3 out of 100 and has a rate of 28.6 gun deaths per 100,000 residents – the highest of all states, the research shows.\n\nMassachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 policies and has the second-lowest rate of gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of the gun safety policies and the fourth highest rate of gun deaths in the US. Louisiana and Wyoming are among the top five states with the highest gun deaths and the weakest gun safety laws.\n\n“Lawmakers in the states at the bottom can’t pretend to be ignorant about the importance of gun laws after looking at this report,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six educators.\n\nMother and activist DeAndra Dycus said the gun violence problem in Indianapolis is “tearing our community apart.”\n\nNearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, DeAndre “Dre” Knox, was shot in the back left side of his head at a birthday party in Indianapolis when shots were fired during a confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, now 21, survived after being on life support for several days, Dycus said, and he currently lives in a facility with non-verbal quadriplegic paralysis.\n\n“As a mother, when I look at him, I see everything that was taken away,” Dycus said. “My son was a dreamer. He was a scholar. He was on this road to being something great.”\n\n“But on the flip side, I see this little boy who has made such an impact, not just on our city but our country, as it pertains to what it looks like to survive,” she said. “Dre has embodied that.”\n\nMembers of Moms Demand Action protest in Texas on Thursday, June 17, 2021, in Austin, Texas, after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill allowing Texans age 21 or older to carry handguns without a permit. Ana Ramirez/AP/FILE\n\nSecure storage laws deemed essential to gun safety\n\nEverytown designated a list of five foundational laws that have proven to be the most effective in lowering gun violence rates. These include requirements for a background check and/or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws; and the enactment of ‘extreme risk’ laws that temporarily remove a person’s access to firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others, according to Everytown.\n\nLast year, several conservative states – including Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming – passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to address gun violence following several high-profile mass shootings. But Congress has shown little to no movement on passing any meaningful federal gun reforms.\n\nA memorial outside of Oxford High School on December 3, 2021, in Michigan. Four students were killed on November 30, when student Ethan Crumbley allegedly opened fire. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn Texas, the controversial “constitutional carry” legislation went into effect in September that allows most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that by removing the licensing requirement they are removing an “artificial barrier” to residents’ right to bear arms under the Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to “the protection of themselves or their families” in public. But law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult for police to quell violence.\n\n“As we’ve seen gun extremism continue to rise in this country, we’ve also seen people who open carry start out at marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials’ homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th at the US Capitol,” Watts said.\n\nAccording to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school in December that killed four students is a “textbook example” of why laws that require the secure storage of firearms are essential to gun safety.\n\nThe alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and wounding several others on November 30. His parents were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan’s alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting could have been prevented.\n\nOnly 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure storage requirement, Watts said.\n\nLast year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others, according to Watts.\n\nDuring this year’s legislative session, Watts said the organization would work with lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California, Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure storage.\n\nEverytown’s research shows that 21 of the country’s states have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they can safely walk away from the situation.\n\nA Chicago police officer investigates a fatal shooting in the Hyde Park neighborhood in November 2021. John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nDespite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina says.\n\nAccording to Suplina, this could explain why such a high number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes, including murder.\n\nGun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of the country’s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nWhile experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI’s 2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019. The agency reported that the number of homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year jump the agency has recorded. There is no federal database of gun sales, but other independent surveys have found that gun sales have soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Priya Krishnakumar", "Emma Tucker", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}]}

And a select few Boorito buyers can test their taste buds with super-hot hot sauce.\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 31, Chipotle restaurants nationwide will offer $6 entrées – burritos, tacos, bowls and salads may typically cost about $10 to $12 – to members of its Chipotle Rewards loyalty program, starting at 3 p.m. local time until closing. And closing time will be extended at some locations in 53 college towns, where Chipotle will stay open until midnight.\n\nAlso at those locations, the first 100 digital orders placed between 10 p.m. local time and midnight will get a free, exclusive bottle of Tabasco Brand Scorpion Sauce – the Scorpion pepper ranks just behind the Carolina Reaper pepper, which had been the world's hottest until just being dethroned by Pepper X.\n\nHalloween:Are banks, post offices open?

That evolved into Halloween night deals of discounted entrées (burritos, bowls or salads) for costumed customers.\n\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic put an end to that. The fast food chain in 2020 did a giveaway on TikTok, Twitter and Instagram, then in 2021 had a giveaway within the Roblox online platform.\n\nLast year, Chipotle brought back the in-person costume tradition but higher prices cut into participation, according to news outlets such as Today.com and Insider citing employee reports.\n\nSo this move to no costumes and later hours in some college town locations could be seen as an avenue to kickstart turnout. But Chipotle says the new approach is mainly catered to Generation Z's dining preferences. Chipotle says its research has found more consumer interest in later hours, particularly among those aged 18-36.\n\n\"Boorito has become a mainstay for Chipotle. This year, our digital offer makes it even easier for fans to fuel their Halloween celebrations with real food,\" said Chris Brandt, Chipotle's chief brand officer, in a statement.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

But here's the trick: treat yourself to a good deal when you find one.\n\nMost of us are looking forward to celebrating Halloween this year, with nearly three-fourths (73%) of people expected to join in – the highest participation recorded in the National Retail Federation's annual survey. Halloween spending is expected to surpass $12 billion, according to the NFR survey, conducted Sept. 1-6 with 8,084 consumers about their shopping plans.\n\nEven though inflation was expected to have a scary effect on the country's Halloween spending bill, this goes beyond an inflationary boost. “We’ve really seen an increase in the holiday’s popularity, and that is what’s driving spending this year,” Katherine Cullen, NRF's vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.\n\nHalloween 2023:Spooky season deals for those on a budget\n\nBrands have boosted their social media activity ahead of Halloween \"to promote a new or in-market product offering,\" Eileen Kwok, social marketing specialist for social media management company Hootsuite, shared.\n\nAnd some of those involve deals, with one of the most successful – and, unfortunately, expired – promotions from Marvel and Party City giving kids 20% off superhero costumes, according to Hootsuite's analysis of social media data from X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThat deal ended Oct. 20, but some other deals are also scaring up engagement on social media, the company found. Burger King created a scary 60-second film called \"The Call,\" to scare up excitement about the chain's Halloween-themed limited time items, the Ghost Pepper Whopper and Ghost Pepper Chicken Fries. As a result, the #GhostPepperWhopper hashtag became popular on TikTok for reviews of the sandwich, Kwok said.\n\nJack in the Box also posted a horror short called \"Feeding Time,\" with an Easter egg that unlocks free Monster Tacos on the Jack app.\n\nBooze free frights:How to make Witches Brew Punch and other Halloween mocktails\n\nBurger King: More Halloween deals\n\nThe fast-food chain has launched a Trick or Heat game with its app giving you the chance to win a daily treat and members of the Royal Perks loyalty program can order special meals through Oct. 31:\n\nTrick or Heat Bundle ($13): Ghost Pepper whopper, small fries, small drink, 4-piece ghost pepper chicken fries, and a Hershey Sundae Pie.\n\nSpooky Special ($13) Whopper, small fries, small drink, 4-piece regular chicken fries, and a Hershey Sundae Pie\n\nBurger King is also offering limited edition \"Trick or Heat\" buckets for $1 at locations in four cities: Atlanta, Charlotte, N.C., Las Vegas, and Nashville, Tenn.\n\nMcDonald's:Fast-food chain brings back its Boo Buckets for Halloween\n\nChipotle's Halloween Boorito deal\n\nIt's easier than ever to take advantage of Chipotle's annual Halloween promotion because there's no costume required as in some past celebrations at the fast-casual chain.\n\nStarting at 3 p.m. local time on Tuesday, Oct. 31, members of its Chipotle Rewards loyalty program can get $6 entrées – the burritos, tacos, bowls and salads typically cost about $10 to $12 – on the Chipotle app or Chipotle.com and use the promo code BOORITO (limit one per transaction).

How to get $6 entrees on Halloween", "text": "Chipotle has a way to treat yourself on Halloween: its annual Boorito discount deal – no costume required. And a select few Boorito buyers can test their taste buds with super-hot hot sauce.\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 31, Chipotle restaurants nationwide will offer $6 entrées – burritos, tacos, bowls and salads may typically cost about $10 to $12 – to members of its Chipotle Rewards loyalty program, starting at 3 p.m. local time until closing.

That evolved into Halloween night deals of discounted entrées (burritos, bowls or salads) for costumed customers.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic put an end to that. The fast food chain in 2020 did a giveaway on TikTok, Twitter and Instagram, then in 2021 had a giveaway within the Roblox online platform.\n\nLast year, Chipotle brought back the in-person costume tradition but higher prices cut into participation, according to news outlets such as Today.com and Insider citing employee reports.\n\nThe move to no costumes and later hours in some college town locations could be seen as an avenue to kick start turnout, but Chipotle says the new approach is mainly catered to Generation Z's dining preferences. The company says its research has found more consumer interest in later hours, particularly among those aged 18-36.\n\n\"Boorito has become a mainstay for Chipotle. This year, our digital offer makes it even easier for fans to fuel their Halloween celebrations with real food,\" said Chris Brandt, Chipotle's chief brand officer, in a statement.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/10/30/halloween-freebies-and-specials/801038001/", "title": "Halloween 2017: Where to get freebies, spooky specials Tuesday", "text": "Trick-or-treaters can get a lot more than free candy this Halloween.\n\nWearing a costume Tuesday also can mean free or cheap meals and goodies for you and your kids.\n\nIn some cases, a costume isn't required to score special treats.\n\nHere are the best Halloween deals:\n\nFree for all\n\nBurgerFi: Anyone who visits a participating location wearing a costume Tuesday gets a free small custard.

With carving pumpkins, eating copious amounts of candy and putting on your hottest, or silliest, costume there’s something for everyone.\n\nAnd if you’re a fast-food lover, there's even more good news this fall.\n\nMcDonalds is bringing back Boo Buckets in October. For those unfamiliar, the Boo Bucket was originally released in 1986 by the chain and was sold sporadically through 2016. The decorated plastic buckets made their big comeback in 2022 and seem to be going strong as they're coming back for another year.\n\nThe buckets were originally an alternative to the plastic cardboard boxes that McDonald’s typically uses for their Happy Meals and were intended to be saved and used as a trick-or-treating pail. Nowadays, they are a nostalgic icon for many.\n\nWhether you want one to help you get into the Halloween spirit or just to reminisce about your childhood, here’s how to secure a Boo Bucket this year.\n\nIs McDonald’s doing Halloween buckets 2023?\n\nYes, starting around lunchtime on Oct. 17 McDonald’s will sell Boo Buckets for the 2023 Halloween season.\n\nHow do you get the McDonald’s Halloween box?\n\nYou can get a Boo Bucket by placing a Happy Meal order either in the restaurant or through the app. There are three different options to choose from for entrees including Chicken McNuggets, a hamburger or cheeseburger with a side of fries or apple slices and a drink.\n\nWhat colors are McDonald's Halloween buckets in 2023?\n\nLast year, the three buckets came in orange, green and white. The orange bucket was designed as a spooky jack-o’-lantern named McPunk’n, the green bucket was a witch called McGoblin and the white McBoo was a scared ghost.\n\nThis year McDonald's is changing things up a bit. The green bucket will now be a monster, the orange a skeleton and the white a mummy. They are also unveiling a purple bucket — which is making its first return since the original one in 1986. The purple bucket will be vampire-themed.\n\nThe McRib:McRib sandwich is returning to some menus. Will it be at Arizona McDonald's? What we know\n\nHow much does a McDonald's Boo Bucket cost?\n\nThere is no additional cost for the buckets as the typical toy that comes with a Happy Meal is being replaced with the bucket.\n\nPrices vary by McDonald’s locations but Happy Meals can typically range from $4 to $7 so the Boo Bucket is expected to be a similar price. There will also be a sticker activity included in the paperboard lid of the bucket.\n\nWhere can I get a Boo Bucket?\n\nBoo Buckets are available at local McDonald’s while supplies last or until Oct. 31.\n\nHow long is McDonald’s selling Boo Buckets?\n\nMcDonald’s is selling the Boo Buckets from Oct. 18 to Oct. 31 or while supplies last.\n\nToys 'R' Us returns:Is Toys 'R' Us coming back to Arizona?

On this October afternoon, I was traveling a route I had not in some time, along River Road in Berlin.\n\nHousing developments, and of course the Solomon Pond Mall, have sprung up since October 1995, when I drove this way almost every night, in gathering darkness, to the place to which I was now returning.\n\nI had to double back, because at first I passed it.\n\nBut once I found it, I recognized it: a solitary, rambling, red barn, sitting on the tract of land once known as Tyler Farm. So quiet now. From the roadway, it seemed far from those raucous midway games, monsters in bright theatrical makeup, and hayride tractors rumbling along a dirt path, with stops in front of campy, gory skits, punctuated by riders' screams. Waiting for them at the end, emerging from the mist, would be a raggedy youth, laughing, roaring and swinging a chainsaw.\n\nIt all happened here, at the original American horror theme park, Spooky World, located here from its start in 1991 to 1998 before moving on to Foxborough's Gillette Stadium and ultimately to New Hampshire, where it operates as Nightmare New England.\n\nBut it was in Berlin that owner and friend David Bertolino first took a chance on a run-down farm, transforming it into what came to be known as a haunted attraction. Over the years, it drew the stellar likes of Alice Cooper, Linda Blair and Tiny Tim, but also many local and regional residents, some simply looking for extra income, and some for a foothold in the entertainment business.\n\nOne of those employees was me. Those who survived their encounter with the chainsaw lad made a frenzied beeline from those tractor rides for the Snickers bars and tiny boxes of Count Chocula, the cackling crew greeting them included me, and my fellow witches. But more about that later. There are many tales to tell.\n\nAnd to tell them, I knew just who to ask: other Spooky World alumni, who regularly share memories, photos and laughs in a social media group.\n\nWith a new documentary, \"Spooktacular!\" about Spooky World's peculiar pop culture journey, the timing could not be better. So, join us around the crackling fire of our imagination, and travel with us back to a special moment at a special place, where Halloween never ends.\n\nLove at first fright\n\nYou might call Ryan Travis a Renassiance man of haunted attractions. \"In the haunted world, I am known as Choppy, and this is my 25th year in the haunt industry,\" Travis said. \"I started in Berlin, Mass., last year they were open, and became the lead actor on the hayride in Foxborough.\"\n\nOver the years, Travis took on many guises. \"I played the Dark One, Lord of the Realm. After the hayride closed, I was a killer klown for a year and then became a walkaround character. I cosplayed Choptop from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2.' \"\n\nThe cult-movie franchise took its story cue from a real-life tragic figure: the recluse Ed Gein, a convicted murderer, grave robber and crafter of home furnishings using human remains.\n\nTravis met his morbid match at Spooky World's Litchfield, New Hampshire, site, with a haunter named Holly.\n\nIt was true romance, Spooky World style: \"Our story is, she was a thing in the bookcase, and I was a cannibal with a metal plate in his head, and it was love at first sight.\"\n\n\"I met my wife while working for Spooky World, and this (year) was our 17th wedding anniversary.\" The couple, who now live in Peabody, run a murder mystery company, Shady Bastards Entertainment, with three Halloween-themed shows scheduled in Salem in October.\n\nVoices in the night\n\nIt's important to note that the 1990s saw something of a sea change in horror. From \"Frankenstein\" author Mary Shelley, and even earlier, women have pioneered the genre. But in film, they were sometimes little more than fiend bait, with observers noting how so often, women and people of color would succumb before the white male hero vanquished the villain.\n\nAt Spooky World, women held many roles behind the scenes as well as out in front, including as the narrators on the hayrides. Donna Allen, formerly Porzuc, said, \"I worked as a narrator on the hayrides from opening night in 1990 until midseason 1998. I also worked a bit when they were in Foxborough.\"\n\nAllen added, \"As a resident of Berlin, I drove by the property daily and watched the barn go from a broken-down structure to a newly renovated barn. The first signs called it 'The Berlin Funny Farm.' The next sign said, 'Berlin Fun Farm.' Daily, I wondered what it was going to be. Eventually the sign read, 'Spooky World.'\"\n\nOne day, a \"help wanted\" sign appeared. \"I needed some extra money, and I went to the open house, with the expectation to apply for work in a concessions capacity, but the line was very long.\"\n\nAllen said, \"I spied a table with two men standing next to it, no one was in line and it said, 'narrator.' My professional job was working as a technical recruiter, which required me to talk to people all the time.\" With that, \"I approached the two men and asked what the job would entail. They handed me a book and said, 'Read a few paragraphs out loud.' So, I did. They looked at each other, then at me, and said, 'You're hired!' One of the men was David Bertolino.\"\n\nBertolino included her in the preopening meetings, to help write the scripts for the hayride skits.\n\n\"I will never forget the first weekend,\" Allen recalled. \"The Risi family had rented some of their cornfield to create a parking lot. I think there was enough room for a couple hundred cars. As I was rounding the corner from the murdering barber set, up the hill to the haunted cemetery, I got a good view of the road that led from Route 290 to the Spooky World parking lot, and it reminded me of the scene from 'Field of Dreams.' If you build it, they will come. There was one long line of headlights headed our way. The farmer was immediately contacted to request more land for parking.\"\n\nMore:Journey into Mystery: Ronny Le Blanc of 'Expedition Bigfoot' seeks Bay State's monsters\n\nMore:In the depths of a Milford man cave lurks 'New England Legends' podcast\n\nMore:Creepy Creators: Of Grave Concern offers works of wax, wood, witchery\n\n'The most fun job'\n\nIn nine seasons, Allen saw a lot. \"We had some young men who were designated as The Goon Squad. They would travel around the parts of the property between haunts and jump out at guests.\" Allen said, \"I saw one, wearing a black cape, jump onto the front edge of the hay wagon. His cape was caught under the tractor's tire and he was pulled off.\" After this mishap, Allen said, \"The Goon Squad was reeled in.\"\n\nThen came the werewolf. \"He would jump onto the wagon, and the narrator would shoot him with a noisy cap gun. In the cold, damp October air, our guns often wouldn't fire. Almost every time my gun didn't fire, a guest would say to me, 'Do you want to borrow mine?' \" For safety, the werewolf bit was removed.\n\n\"At the end of each season, we would have a cast party. I wrote a poem to read, trying to mention as many of the people with whom I worked as I could.\" Allen recalled special moments: chatting with celebrity guests, such as the late Tiny Tim. Of the late actor who played Leatherface in the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Allen said, \"Gunnar Hansen came out for drinks after work a few times.\"\n\nWorking as a Spooky World narrator \"was not the best-paying job I ever had, but it was the most fun. Every single night was different and almost every trip around the park was different. We had a lot of celebrities who were brought around back to be loaded onto the wagon. Players from the Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox and Bruins.\"\n\nThe 'head' of the table\n\nRichard Pastore worked at Spooky World during the Berlin location's second and third season, in 1992 and 1993, and remembers working with Tom Savini, famed film director, prosthetic makeup artist, actor, and stunt performer, best known for his work on horror and action films.\n\nSavini, an executive producer of the \"Spooktacular!\" documentary, was deeply involved in the design of the Spooky World hayride and some haunted house features. Pastore said, \"Tom Savini placed me after an 'audition' in his first haunted house, the first park expansion after the hayride.\"\n\nPastore enlisted the help of a co-worker from a different job for a peculiar prank. \"Best story was my workmates came one Friday night, right from work. As they went in line for the hayride, I snuck one co-worker away and secretly got her into makeup and into my usual spot in the haunted house.\" Pastore continued, \"When my other workmates finally arrived in the house an hour later, they were surprised to see ... a disembodied head, taunting them on top of a bloody table. They nearly fell over laughing.\"\n\nThe co-worker would receive a paycheck for her hours at Spooky World. Pastore said, \"Very fun memory for all of us.\"\n\nHe came, he sawed, he moved our couch\n\nIf you took the hayride in 1992 or 1993, the chainsaw-brandishing maniac who might have hailed you at the end was most likely Jeff Docherty, who says he got many of his character hints from the man who knew the part best: Gunnar Hansen, who portrayed \"Leatherface\" in the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"\n\nBut the person adding to the visual effect was Jeff's mom, Linda Docherty, whose many Spooky World tasks included ringing up sales in the haunted barn, but who often operated the fog machine and lights that ran as Jeff seemingly formed in the nocturnal vapors.\n\n\"I was on the last stop, as 'Leatherface,' \" Jeff said. \"It was pretty neat, because the chainsaw we used was a real chainsaw. We just didn't have a chain on it. The hayride would come along after three or four minutes. Mom would be there, layering it up with fog. The narrators would be telling people what is going on.\"\n\nWhat riders viewed was what appeared to be an outdoor shower stall, and a young woman inside, wearing a body suit and going through the motions of washing up, in a scene plucked almost directly from \"Psycho,\" also inspired by Ed Gein. \"When they came to the last stop, they would warn, 'Don't look, there is a girl taking a shower!'\"\n\nFrom a hiding spot nearby, Jeff said, \"When they would pull up in front, I'd fire up the chainsaw and kick open the door, so you would see the fog swirling away from the door. I would notice the girl in the shower. They'd say, 'Look out, look out!' I'd hit the chainsaw, and she'd go down, like I was chainsawing her.\"\n\nA flipped switch would activate a spray of special-effects blood, which Jeff said was the same kind used in many films. \"Blood would spatter against Plexiglass. My attention would turn to the hay wagon. I'd gun it around their feet.\"\n\nJeff observed, \"It's not real, but you would think it was at the time.\"\n\n'One of the best things we've done'\n\nOriginally from Wellesley, the Dochertys moved to Prince Edward Island, Canada, in the 1970s. \"Mom and I moved back to Massachusetts for three years and lived in Hudson, which was nice and close to Spooky World,\" Jeff said. \"Mom noticed an ad in the paper. We didn't know what it was at the time, but it sounded interesting. We both love Halloween, so (we said), 'Let's take a drive down for that meeting and hear about it.' \"\n\nJeff said, \"It was one of the best things we've done, it was amazing.\" Mom Linda said, \"It was great fun. We met a lot of great people. We met the stars. We met the guy who did the chainsaw in the movie. We met Linda Blair, Kane Hodder (the actor best known for playing Jason Voorhees in four 'Friday the 13th' films.)\"\n\nWhen they moved to a different apartment, Linda said, \"Some of these actors were helping us move.\" In a surreal moment of human kindness, Linda said, \"We got Leatherface carrying our couch up the stairs.\"\n\nHansen, the horror actor with a great heart, died in 2015. Linda recalled, \"He was super nice. You'd never think that was the same person. He was a sweet man. We would go out after Friday night for Chinese food. He was just so nice, he came along with us.\"\n\nJeff said Hansen shared pro tips, including how to swing the chainsaw for full menacing effect. \"It was really neat to learn how to do the chainsaw thing from the person who played it.\"\n\nOf many of the high-profile guests such as Hansen, Linda said, \"It wasn't like they were big stars. They were happy to come and have fun and hang out with us.\"\n\nThe scorpion's lair\n\nI first went to Spooky World with some friends in October 1994. In truth, it mystified us. The wetlands lurking a little ways beyond seemed scarier. But it seemed a way to combine my many performance interests, storytelling, dance, improv acting and singing, and of course, horror. So, the following year, I applied and became part of a gaggle of witches.\n\nOur responsibilities included interacting with patrons, doling out candy and those tiny boxes of Count Chocula, both of which we were allowed to eat in unlimited amounts. It was a financially challenging time, so these treats provided a welcome repast.\n\nThe weather grew progressively chillier over the course of the month. The crowds got larger, and everything got busier. Spooky World was becoming a big hit and for some a place of pilgrimage to meet actors from their favorite movies. Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett sang \"Monster Mash,\" unleashing a flood of memories of childhood Saturday mornings watching \"Creature Double Feature\" on Boston's Channel 56.\n\nBut what stands out to me the most is teamwork of the staff. When hordes of candy seekers threatened to overwhelm us, there were those like the zombie maintenance man, who would jump in, passing out candy and yelling, \"Here it is, kids! Come on, let's sugar up!\"\n\nI quickly realized I was in my element. I liked what I was doing. The patrons were not mere spectators. We witches and zombies, along with the werewolves and ghouls, were there to make them feel special, a part of this unique experience.\n\nOne night, an exotic animal handler approached me and held up a scorpion. \"Put out your hand,\" he said.\n\nThere is a place in my heart for all creatures, scorpions included. All the same, I stepped back. But even as I did, I knew I would regret refusing, so I said, \"All right.\" A friend snapped a photo that remains one of my favorites, of me, in my witch costume, with the scorpion in my hand.\n\nIt was an emperor scorpion, which doesn't pose a particular risk to humans.\n\nBut holding the scorpion exemplified something important: Fortune favors the brave. I have taken this with me in my journalism career and every facet of life.\n\nThere are no guarantees, ever, but there is always something to reach for, like the Scorpius constellation, gleaming in the night sky.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}]}

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer. He is a registered sex offender in Wyoming.\n\nHenry E.

On another occasion, Tucci unbuttoned his pants and the victim's pants. Tucci pulled them both down and made skin to skin contact. Tucci normalized the conduct by tickling the victim in front of the victim's parents.\n\nWhen questioned, Tucci stated that the incidents occurred \"exactly as the victim reported.\" Tucci said it was \"just touching\" and clarified he had not engaged in \"sodomy.\"\n\nSimilar events took place in other parishes years later.\n\nIn March 2002, Tucci retired.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel. Yarrosh continued in residence at the motel until August 8, 2005, at which time he was incarcerated in Schuylkill County Prison in Pottsville.

On December 6, 2005, Yarrosh was released from prison as a convicted and registered sex offender. The Diocese granted him residence at St. Francis Villa in Orwigsburg. The Diocese's own designation of Yarrosh noted he was a \"moderate to high risk to again use pornography and/or consort with prostitutes.\"\n\nIn November 2006, it was discovered that Father Yarrosh had taken trips to New York City with a seven-year-old child. Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville. He reported that the abuse began in the 1970's while he was in sixth grade. In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting. At this point Johnson began to severely beat the victim with a big leather belt and told the victim that, if he reported the abuse to the police, he would beat him even worse.\n\nMichael S.

The victim told his father that he ha been in Lawrence's room for a tutoring session. At the end of the session, the talk between Lawrence and the victim turned to sex.

This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

Jerge in early 1989. That year, he was sent for psychological therapy. In the fall of 1989, he was released and signed an aftercare contract that restricted his contact with young boys. He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney. A letter stated Trautman advised Jerge to consider both legal and canonical counsel. According to the letter, Trautman called the District Attorney of Erie County to tell him of the situation and assure him of their compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nStephen E.

When he said he did not have the proper clothes, Kondzielski suggested that they lift weights naked. They then proceeded to lift weights together while they were naked. When he told his parents about the naked weight lifting incident, they were shocked and told him to stay away from Kondzielski.\n\nWhen confronted with this allegations, Kondzielski claimed he did not remember the incident, but did not deny it because it could have happened.\n\nGerard Krebs\n\nWhere he served:\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Secondary Education Venango Christian, High School, Oil City, PA\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Weekend Assistant, St. Stephen's, Oil City, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Parochial Vicar, Our Lady Queen of the Americas, Conneaut Lake, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Resident, St. Stephen's Rectory, Oil City, PA\n\n9/8/1970 - 12/6/1978: Parochial Vicar, Erie, St. John the Baptist\n\n12/6/1978 - 1/27/1983: Pastor, Holy Cross Church, Brandy Camp, PA\n\n1/27/1983 - 6/30/1990: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n3/1/1990 - 5/4/1990: Health Leave, Guest House, Rochester, MN\n\n6/30/1990 - 1/6/1992: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 12/31/2003: Director of RCIA, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 2/4/1994: Resident, Blessed Sacrament, Erie, PA\n\n2/4/1994 - 3/27/2004: Resident, St. Joseph/Bread of Life, Erie, PA\n\n4/10/1996 - 10/1/1996: Chaplain, Soldiers & Sailors Home\n\n11/17/1996 - 5/8/1997: Weekend Assistant, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n11/22/1996 - 12/31/2003: Director of Activities/Coming Millennium, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/1/04 - 5/25/2005: Retired, Priest Retirement Residence, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: Three known victims came forward indicating that they were sexually abused by Father Gerard Krebs.\n\nOne victim alleged that Krebs led him through \"a series of sexual rituals to both prove my faith and the fact that I was not a homosexual.\n\nThe grand jury found no documentation indicating that law enforcement was ever notified about any of Krebs interactions with his victims.\n\nJerry (John) Kucan\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1952-1954: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1954-1961: St. Joseph's, Bethlehem, PA\n\n1961-1972: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1972-1973: Our Lady of Peace Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1973-1977: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1977-1978: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1978-1979: Beaver Falls Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1979-1982: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1982-1985: St. Jerome' s, Chicago, IL\n\n1985-1986: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1986-1988: St. Anthony's, Chicago, IL\n\n1988-1994: St. Augustine' s, West Allis, WI\n\n1994-1995: Sacred Heart, Chicago, IL\n\n1995-2005: St. Anthony's Friary, Chicago, IL\n\nSummary: In February of 2005, a 29 year old man wrote a letter to the Diocese of Erie in which he stated that he had attended St. Anthony's School in Sharon, Pennsylvania and that in\n\n1974 he began serving midnight mass. Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Tracy has a reputation for using data to reduce crime.\n\nTracy will make $160,000, a salary bump requested by the mayor and approved by City Council\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki named Robert J. Tracy, an out of town law enforcement executive who specializes in using data to reduce crime, as Wilmington's police chief.\n\nTracy was recently chief of crime control strategies for the city of Chicago, a position he held for five years.\n\nWhile there, he implemented crime reduction techniques that resulted in the lowest murder rate the city had seen in 50 years, according to a news release from the city of Wilmington.\n\nTracy's strategies, policies, and restructuring resulted in a 30 percent reduction in overall crime during a four-year period and the lowest overall crime rate since 1972, according to Wilmington's announcement.\n\nPurzycki chose Tracy from a field of 35 candidates during a nationwide search for a new head of the 319-member department.\n\n\"We chose the chief in large measure because of his demonstrable technical and leadership skills, his reputation for fairness and building trust in the community and his unmatched background in advanced policing strategies,\" Purzycki said.\n\nSince leaving the Chicago department early last year, Tracy has been the senior vice president of United Security Services, Inc., a Chicago-based consulting company. He worked for the New York City Police Department for 23 years, ending his tenure in 2006 as the director of the firearms suppression division.\n\nTracy said he is proud of his work in Chicago and New York and believes he can curb Wilmington's crime.\n\n\"I will work tirelessly to bring safety to our neighborhoods,\" he said. \"I will work to give you a police department that is responsive to your needs, accountable and accessible.\"\n\nThe announcement comes a day before the walkout ceremony of Police Chief Bobby L. Cummings, who has held the position since May 2014. Cummings, who was appointed by former Mayor Dennis P. Williams, served 32 years in the department. Purzycki said while he has the \"highest regard\" for Cummings, persistent and increasing crime \"holds our city back from its economic potential and shapes our citizen’s confidence in the future.\"\n\n\"We have one chance to get this right and we owe it to our citizens to get the most qualified individual available to lead our department,\" he said.\n\nPurzycki said he was impressed with Tracy's data-driven approach and his mentality of prevention, which includes meeting with individuals who are considered likely to commit crimes and offering assistance to alter their behaviors. Tracy's goal, the mayor said, has been to measure success by crime reduction rather than number of arrests.\n\nOn Tracy's watch, the Chicago Police Department was infused with technology including a \"Two Degrees of Association\" strategy that identified hundreds of city residents who were most likely to be victims or perpetrators of gun violence, the Chicago Tribune reported last year.\n\nThat prevention method mirrors efforts Wilmington officials have been developing for youth, identifying at-risk individuals and targeting them with services, said City Council President Hanifa Shabazz.\n\n\"He'll be able to add to what we're doing here,\" Shabazz said.\n\nTracy oversaw an analysis of high-crime \"impact zones,\" the Tribune reported. Hundreds of officers were then assigned to those areas to further prevent incidents.\n\nBesides his most recent consulting job, Tracy has years of private sector experience, according to his resume. He was vice president of Summit Security Services in Uniondale, Long Island, from 2008-2011, and vice president of global crisis management for Citigroup from 2006-2008.\n\nHe holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from The State University of New York and a Masters of Public Administration degree from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, according to his résumé.\n\nPurzycki said Tracy came highly recommended by leaders in the criminal justice field, including New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill.\n\nDuring his first few months in office, Purzycki deferred questions about his administration's public safety strategies, saying that he would place his trust in his chosen police chief. The mayor will soon be expected to address his game plan, including whether he will re-institute a designated community policing unit, which was one of his campaign promises.\n\nTracy said on Wednesday that he prefers a department-wide community policing philosophy. That method, instituted under Cummings, expects all officers to engage with community members -- but residents have expressed that doesn't happen often enough. Tracy said he will look at the program's implementation.\n\n\"Everybody should be community policing officers,\" he said. \"It's about treating people with respect and dignity.\"\n\nThe Rev. Pastor Sandra Ben, who attended the announcement, said she is happy to hear Tracy's community policing plans.\n\n\"If we don't get that back, it's all the same,\" she said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tracy promised Wilmington police officers the \"best training, equipment and supervision to do your job.\"\n\n\"I will foster an environment that is supportive, inclusive and meaningful,\" he said.\n\nThe new chief faces many challenges. Wilmington, a city that has earned a national reputation for gun violence in recent years, has seen crime spike this year. Fifty-eight people have been shot, 14 fatally, since the beginning of the year, according to data collected by The News Journal.\n\nThe violence has quickened its pace over previous years. There have been over twice as many homicides this year than there were in the first three months of 2014, the year Wilmington was named \"Murdertown USA\" by Newsweek magazine.\n\nSTORY: Volunteers pull junk from Christina River\n\nSTORY: Wilmington City Council censures Samuel Guy\n\nThe mayor asked City Council last month to raise the position's salary limit from $117,073 to $160,000. The administration said as it was, the salary limit was an obstacle to securing a highly qualified candidate. Five members voted against the measure, expressing discomfort with approving a raise for someone who hadn't been identified.\n\nThe measure passed, and Tracy will make $160,000, the city said. But it will be a pay cut for Tracy, who was making $194,256 in his Chicago job, the Tribune said.\n\nTracy was the only candidate who did not choose to bring his own deputy, Purzycki said, because he \"felt confident that the talent exists within this department to fill any assistant roles.\"\n\nTracy, who starts on Friday, said he plans to live in Wilmington with his wife, Brenda, and his five children, one girl and four boys ages nine through 19. In the coming weeks, he said he will visit every neighborhood to introduce himself to community members.\n\nAs a show of respect, Tracy said he will canvass the streets in a suit instead of a uniform until he receives his certification as a sworn law enforcement officer in the state of Delaware.\n\n\"I hope to put that uniform on soon.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/07/30/this-ms-journalist-saw-what-was-coming-for-biden-more-than-a-year-ago/74557609007/", "title": "This MS journalist saw what was coming for Biden more than a year ...", "text": "Mac Gordon\n\nSpecial to the Mississippi Clarion Ledger\n\nOne of Mississippi’s most widely known and respected native journalists, a guy more familiar with President Joe Biden than most reporters anywhere, wrote on July 17 he wished Biden wouldn’t seek reelection.\n\nIt wasn’t something that had just dawned on Curtis Wilkie, who in 1971 had covered Biden at that most basic governmental level when the future president was a 28-year-old county official in Delaware.\n\nA conversation Wilkie had with friends more than a year ago convinced them that Biden should not run for reelection.\n\n“This is not a new concern of mine, produced by the president’s poor performance at last month’s debate. I reached this conclusion during a long conversation in March 2023 with two old friends who had closer political connections to Biden than my own,” Wilkie wrote in the online publication Mississippi Today. “I felt his age and halting public appearances would make him vulnerable in 2024, increasing the possibility of Donald Trump’s return.\n\n“My friends sadly agreed. The man we remembered for his wit, admirable empathy and high energy was slipping.”\n\nBiden announced two days later he wouldn’t seek reelection.\n\nWilkie was born in the Mississippi Delta and moved with his mother to Summit and later to Corinth where he graduated from high school. He earned his degree at Ole Miss, then embarked on a distinguished reporting career that included a decade in Washington.\n\nBiden was in Congress while Wilkie was covering the White House for the Boston Globe. Later, Wilkie was the newspaper’s correspondent in the Middle East. He established the Globe’s southern bureau in New Orleans in 1993, retiring in 2001. Wilkie, who has written six books, was a member of the faculty at Ole Miss from 2007-2020.\n\nLike Biden, Wilkie has ailments that plague him daily, although they certainly haven’t diminished his ability to decipher political situations and to write eloquently about them.\n\nAnd while Biden is old, Wilkie is even older — by two years. So it was from that whole perspective Wilkie recently wrote of his desire for Biden to decide not to seek a second term.\n\nIn the article Wilkie told of Biden’s tragic loss of his first wife, Neilia, and their daughter in an automobile accident in late 1972. At a dinner just days before, Neilia had told Wilkie that she had written a college thesis on Mississippi’s Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner.\n\nWrote Wilkie: “I’ve always felt that one’s eyes can be a measure of intelligence. When they’re bright, they usually reflect active interest; when they’re dull, there’s less in the brain behind them. The last conversation I had with Biden took place in Oxford in 2007. (Biden) spoke at Square Books to promote an autobiography. To establish affinity with his audience, he mentioned that his late wife had admired Faulkner. Afterward, we talked and I recalled my own interview with Neilia 35 years earlier when she told of her fondness for the novelist. Biden’s eyes glistened with tears.”\n\nWilkie also recalled running into Biden at a Democratic National Convention in 2000, with the then-senator telling him about going to the famous “Grove” before attending an Ole Miss football game.\n\n“Wilkie, I went to the best (expletive deleted) … party I’ve ever been to in my life at your alma mater … The Grove, man.”\n\nIn his essay, Wilkie knew how to portray Biden’s situation.\n\n“I try to be philosophical. We have been fortunate to have lived this long, but we are paying for our longevity. Most of the decisions that confront me in retirement are inconsequential. But a president faces crises every day.”\n\n— Mac Gordon, a native of McComb, is a retired newspaperman.

Army officials say it was a joint decision made by interested parties. Al.com reports that the Redstone Scientific Information Center closed its doors Sept. 30. The center was established in 1962 by a charter between the Army and NASA. It was overseen by a board of directors made up of senior leaders and scientists at Redstone’s various missile organizations. Dr. Wernher von Braun and Maj. Gen. Francis “Frank” McMorrow agreed to build the original facility, which held information about rocketry and space science used to advance United States rocket programs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man says he rescued his family’s dog from an attack by river otters in a small lake inside a local park. Alaska Public Media reports Kenny Brewer waded waist-deep into Taku Lake and suffered a bite on his hand while pulling the dog away from the river otters that converged on the pet. The 27-year-old Anchorage dietitian says he and his wife were walking the husky-mix, which was bitten by a group of otters that dragged the dog underwater temporarily. Brewer says a veterinarian cleaned the dog’s cuts, sliced away damaged tissue and stitched a drain tube into its leg. Wildlife biologists say they were not aware of previous attacks by river otters in Anchorage. One biologist says the animals likely perceived the dog as a threat.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Two retirement communities in the city are the launching pad for a program to see how virtual reality technology helps senior citizens with cognition, dementia, loneliness and other issues. The Arizona Daily Star reports Watermark Retirement Communities wants to eventually make the technology available at dozens of facilities nationwide. With a cordless headset system called Oculus Quest, elderly residents have been able to ride a roller coaster, visit the Egyptian pyramids and visit places they used to live. Watermark also wants to allow residents across its communities to be able to meet up virtually. Grayson Barnes, a 20-year-old Rochester Institute of Technology student, spent two years developing the Engage VR program for Watermark. He says most research suggests dementia patients are more like themselves after experiencing virtual reality.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge says he’s running for a seat on the state’s Supreme Court, setting up another potentially expensive and heated race in a state that has drawn heavy involvement from outside conservative groups. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Morgan “Chip” Welch on Monday announced he was running for the seat currently held by Justice Jo Hart in next year’s election. Hart, who has served on the court since 2013, has not said whether she’s seeking reelection next year. Arkansas’ nonpartisan Supreme Court races in recent years have drawn the focus of outside conservative groups that have spent millions on TV ads and attack mailers. A state justice won reelection last year after two conservative groups spent nearly $2.5 million trying to unseat her.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products starting in 2023. Legislation signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom makes California the first state to enact such a ban. It doesn’t apply to used fur products or fur used for religious or tribal purposes. And it excludes the sale of leather; cowhides; deer, sheep and goat skin; and anything preserved through taxidermy. There’s a fine of up to $1,000 for multiple violations. Democratic Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, the bill’s author, says there are “sustainable and humane” substitutes for fur. Opponents of the legislation have said it could create a black market and be a slippery slope to bans on other products.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A report by the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative says the state’s 54 highest summits continue to see an increasing number of people seeking to climb the fourteeners, or those at least 14,000 feet high. The Gazette reports that an analysis by the nonprofit initiative estimates 353,000 people were attracted to the peaks during 2018’s hiking season, up 5.7% from the 2017 count. That’s almost 100,000 more than the first report from four years ago. Colorado Fourteeners executive director Lloyd Athearn says the heightened numbers come with his organization increasing its monitoring capabilities on the mountains. According to the report, Mounts Bierstadt, Elbert, Lincoln, Bross, Democrat and Sherman as well as Quandary, Grays, Torreys and Longs peaks all see more people. And for the first time, Quandary Peak was the busiest fourteener. Bierstadt previously held the rank.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new state report shows the state’s utilities are “well aware of the increasing dangers” of cyberattacks and appear to have successfully thwarted recent threats they encountered. Four utilities participated in the third annual cybersecurity review of Connecticut’s electricity, natural gas and public water utilities. The list includes Eversource, Connecticut Water, Aquarion Water Co. and Avangrid. The report says the utilities conducted “extensive new work” over the past year to boost their cybersecurity resilience, including vetting the hiring of all employees and vendors. Phishing, spear phishing, threats to cloud information storage and insider threats are cited as some of the most worrisome threats facing the state’s utilities. The report highlights a need for better information sharing between the federal Department of Homeland Security and the state utilities concerning cyber compromises.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: ChristianaCare researchers say they have created a new computer program that will allow scientists to see the impact gene editing has on tumor cells, an idea they hope to patent. It wasn’t invented by a hospital doctor or a researcher, though they did help. The idea came from Rohan Kanchana, a junior at Newark Charter School who interned there last winter. The 16-year-old is too young to do technical lab work at ChristianaCare’s cancer center, but he could code. The new computer program revolves around a technology called CRISPR, the genetic version of spell-check on a Word document. If a person has an incorrect word – or, in this case, a gene – the technology will identify and correct it, says Eric Kmiec, director of the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare’s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Plans are in the works to add potentially thousands more dockless scooters to D.C. streets, WUSA-TV reports. As of now, 6,210 dockless scooters are permitted in the district. For 2020, the District Department of Transportation is considering a proposal that would boost the number to 10,000. The comment period to add more scooters goes until the end of October. After that, DDOT officials say they will evaluate the responses and determine the next steps. The proposal also includes the addition of dockless bikes, allowing for up to 10,000 in the district. The vehicles wouldn’t be designated to one area but spread out across all eight wards.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Gatorland has built new homes for some of its most distinctive-looking residents, thus creating an exhibit for a rare albino gator and two even-more-rare leucistic gators, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The White Gator Swamp will be the site of a baby gator boom, officials hope. Those very light-skinned residents are now being encouraged to make offspring. “It’s the largest breeding facility for white alligators anywhere in the world,” says Mark McHugh, Gatorland’s CEO. The white gators were introduced to their new digs Oct. 4. Leucistic gator Trezos hesitated to enter the waters, while his brother, Feros Zombi, dived off the side of a ramp after raw-chicken inspiration. Albino alligator Pearl did a reptilian sort of strut before making a splash. Albino gators have no pigment at all, while leucistics have some coloring in their skins. All three have separate waters and potential mates to explore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Marine salvage experts seeking to remove an overturned cargo ship close to the state’s seacoast say they will haul it away in pieces because it cannot be safely righted and refloated intact. Their Unified Command said in a statement Saturday that the hull of the 656-foot Golden Ray would be dismantled, along with the ship’s other components and cargo, and taken away in what it described as a “complex situation.” The Golden Ray overturned Sept. 8 near the Port of Brunswick. Rescuers drilled into the hull’s steel plates and rescued four crewmen trapped in the bowels of the ship for more than a day in scorching heat and darkness. The Coast Guard has said it would take “weeks, if not months,” to remove the ship, which overturned while heading to sea.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As Rep. Tulsi Gabbard travels throughout Iowa and New Hampshire trying to kickstart her Democratic presidential bid, she is facing a serious challenge back home in Hawaii for her U.S. House seat. State Sen. Kai Kahele, a fellow Democrat, is picking up endorsements and criticizing Gabbard for not paying enough attention to constituents in Hawaii while she campaigns for president thousands of miles away. The 45-year-old Native Hawaiian is a combat veteran and pilot for the Hawaii Air National Guard. He flies passenger jets for Hawaiian Airlines and is a member of the pilots union, a helpful attribute in union-friendly Hawaii. Gabbard hasn’t indicated whether she will run for reelection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Authorities have released plans to stop devastating wildfires in southwestern Idaho, southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada with one option creating 1,500 miles of fuel breaks up to 400 feet wide along existing roads. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Friday released a draft environmental impact statement for the Tri-State Fuel Breaks Project and is taking public comments through the end of November. The BLM says creating fuel breaks by clearing vegetation will help firefighters stop wildfires and protect key habitat for sage grouse and other wildlife on land also used by ranchers and outdoor enthusiasts. The BLM says options include fewer miles of fuel breaks all the way down to no fuel breaks at all. The region in recent decades has seen repeated giant rangeland wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarengo: A French religious order has reached a preliminary agreement with a northern Illinois county that would allow nuns to build a winery, brewery, gift shop and coed boarding school there. The consent decree between McHenry County and Fraternite Notre Dame Inc. could end nearly four years of litigation and local opposition to the order expanding its operation in Marengo. The order sued the county in 2015, alleging that by blocking the expansion, the county was violating the U.S. Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Chicago Tribune reports that U.S. Magistrate Judge Iain Johnston is scheduled to decide this month whether to approve the agreement. McHenry County State Attorney Patrick Kenneally and county board Chairman Jack Franks declined to comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Butler University has raised more than half of the $250million it needs for a campaign to invest in science education, increase enrollment beyond resident undergraduates and boost community outreach. The private university has pooled $171 million from more than 27,000 donors during its largest fundraising campaign, which runs through May. The university plans to add a $100 million science facility. But university President James Danko says the campaign will also help fund efforts to encourage working professionals to enroll. Melissa Beckwith, vice president of strategy and innovation, says the university could partner with local companies to provide education for employees who aren’t enrolled as undergraduates. The university will also try to offer Indianapolis public school students dual degree credits.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Backers of a skateboard park under construction downtown say they have reached their $6.3 million funding goal. The Lauridsen Skatepark will be the nation’s largest when completed in spring 2020. The 88,000-square-foot skate park is being built on 5 acres of land between Second Avenue and the Des Moines River. Recent gifts by the Lauridsen Family Foundation and the state’s Enhance Iowa fund enabled organizers to reach their fundraising goal. Nix and Virginia Lauridsen have donated a total of $1.6 million to the project. Besides the skate areas, the park will include viewing platforms, handicap accessible walkways, shade structures and landscaping. Organizers expect about 40,000 skaters a year will use the park. They note skateboarding will be an Olympic sport in 2020.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City T-Bones are officially locked out of their stadium. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, changed the locks and padlocked the gates to the stadium Monday because the team has failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid debts. The government issued an eviction notice in August after the T-Bones accumulated more than $760,000 in back rent and utility payments. The team was given a one-month reprieve in September after making a $50,000 payment. The Kansas City Star reports team owners have said they are working to sell the team, but no deal has been reached. The T-Bones played in an independent league and have no Major League Baseball affiliation.\n\nKentucky\n\nWinchester: Daniel Boone National Forest officials say multiple fires have burned hundreds of acres there, with almost all the fires caused by people. WTVQ-TV in Lexington reports three crews from Puerto Rico have volunteered to restore what they can in the forest. Officials want to clean up damage from fires before dry weather returns. The volunteers are working 16 hours a day performing such tasks as reseeding, preventing erosion, and knocking down trees that could fall and hurt someone. Volunteer Roberto Martinez told the station people from the U.S. went to Puerto Rico to help when Hurricane Maria struck there, and now it’s his chance to return the favor. Daniel Boone representatives say it could be a few more weeks before parts of the forest open to the public.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The National World War II Museum’s $25 million education and outreach building will open Thursday. After an opening ceremony, it will break ground for its final exhibit hall and hold an open house at the new building, called the Hall of Democracy. It features a research library, classrooms, an auditorium, the Institute for the Study of War and Democracy, and the WWII Media and Education Center. There’s also a special exhibit gallery. The opening exhibition is about the capture, extradition and trial of Adolf Eichmann, who played a major part in the Nazi mass executions of Jews. The new building is the museum’s sixth, including three exhibit pavilions, a theater and a restoration building. Its 239-room hotel and conference center is expected to open in late fall.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A scientist with an environmental group says she has found what she believes is the first recorded appearance of a potentially damaging species of crab in Maine waters. Marissa McMahan of the Massachusetts-based group Manomet says she located the smooth mud crab earlier this month on a research trip. The crabs, which are typically found south of Cape Cod, can pose problems for aquaculture businesses because they prey on young oysters. The single specimen is still alive, as McMahan collected it. Other outside species of crabs already pose a threat to Maine’s ecosystem. Acadia National Park officials said earlier this fall that a molted shell of an Asian shore crab was found along the shore. It was among the first confirmed reports of the species in the area.\n\nMaryland\n\nAdamstown: A rural fire chief says an “elusive” 3-foot-long alligator has finally been caught. WJLA-TV reports the gator was caught Saturday in a retention pond on a private property in Adamstown after animal control officers and others spent hours Thursday and Friday trying to capture it. The station reports officers ended up placing a live animal cage trap with bait on the muddy shoreline after initial efforts using a fishing line failed. Carroll Manor Volunteer Fire Chief Mike Smallwood says he found the “crafty and smart” reptile inside the metal cage about 6:30 a.m. Saturday. Maryland residents are not allowed to own exotic animals, including alligators. The station reports Frederick County Animal Control says the alligator was likely abandoned by its owner due to its size.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two state lawmakers want to make it easier for communities to purchase dormant railroad tracks to convert into recreational trails. The MetroWest Daily News reports state Sen. Jamie Eldridge and state Rep. Carmine Gentile, both Democrats, jointly filed legislation that, if approved, would allow cities and towns to use Community Preservation Act money to purchase railroad lands to transform into trails for walking, running and bicycling. Community Preservation Act money can be used to preserve open space and historic sites, create affordable housing and develop outdoor recreational facilities. But the state Department of Revenue has ruled it cannot be used to buy federal rail banks and rights of way. Eldridge, of Acton, says rail trails improve public health by providing safe opportunities for exercise and boost economic development.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A church that served as a popular venue for national civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, is getting a grant for needed renovations. The National Park Service has awarded the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office $500,000 for King Solomon Baptist Church. Work includes rehabilitating the roof and preparing construction drawings. The church built in 1917 for a white congregation was bought in 1955 by an African American congregation. King spoke twice at King Solomon, and Malcolm X gave his “Message to the Grassroots” speech there in 1963. King Solomon’s pastor, the Rev. Charles Williams II, says the goal “is to continue the church’s tradition of empowerment, education and research.” The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: More than 100 mannequins in blaze orange sweatshirts were set up along Minnesota Highway 23 in the city Saturday. The display, organized by Pathways 4 Youth, represented the number of youth experiencing homelessness on any given night in Central Minnesota. “A lot of people in the community just don’t know,” says Tim Wensman, board chair and president of Pathways 4 Youth. The event kicked off the organization’s “Now That You Know” campaign, which aims to raise awareness on youth homelessness, as well as highlight how people can support the organization’s efforts. Pathways 4 Youth is a resource center for youth ages 16 to 24 who are experiencing homelessness. The center helps them finish their education, find secure employment and gain stable housing. It also connects youth with a place to shower, food and hygiene products, and a warm evening meal.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: The city promises there will be sunshine Oct. 26, even if it’s a cloudy day. That’s the day Meridian will honor the late David Ruffin, one of the lead singers of the Motown group The Temptations. He sang the hit “My Girl,” which included that sunny lyric. The Meridian Star reports the city will add signs ceremonially naming four blocks of a downtown street “David Ruffin Boulevard.” Born in nearby rural Whynot, Ruffin claimed Meridian as home. Mississippi’s Arts + Entertainment Experience will also place Ruffin’s star on its walk of fame, while Jackson State University’s marching band, the “Sonic Boom of the South,” will lead a parade. LaMont Robinson, head of the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame and Ruffin’s son-in-law, presented the idea to the city.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The CEO of Dow Inc. has donated $6 million to a new University of Missouri health institute focused on personalized medicine. The university says the gift from Jim Fitterling is one of the first from an individual donor for the NextGen Precision Health Institute. The $220.8 million center is expected to open in October 2021. The state has contributed $10 million so far, with other funding coming from a combination of private and corporate support. Fitterling said in a statement that as a cancer survivor, he is “keenly interested in advancing research that helps patients and their families enjoy better outcomes and better qualities of life.” He began working at Dow just two weeks after graduating from the University of Missouri’s College of Engineering in 1983.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: State forest experts have proposed a timber harvest and prescribed-burns project to reduce the risk of wildfires in the Lolo National Forest. The Missoulian reports the proposed treatments were designed to contribute to the overall forest health and fuel-reduction objectives and make the forest more resilient to drought, wildfire, insects and disease. Forest experts say the project would cover about 36 square miles in Missoula and Mineral counties and include harvesting timber for mills, tree thinning and prescribed fires. Experts say some existing roads are expected to be decommissioned for work. Experts say they are seeking additional public input on the proposal at a meeting Wednesday. Submitted comments would be accepted by mail, electronically and hand-delivered for the next 30 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: People who want to help preserve monarch butterflies can obtain free milkweed seed pods through the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. The pods, seeding instructions and monarch educational information will be available while supplies last at Game and Parks’ Northeast District Office in Norfolk. Milkweed is the host plant for the monarch. Monarchs lay eggs only on milkweed, and it’s the only plant monarch caterpillars will eat. Scientists say the monarch population has drastically declined over the past 20 years. Contact Jamie Bachmann at 402-370-3374 or Jamie.bachmann@nebraska.gov for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: Nye County has decided to abandon a controversial proposal that would have further limited the hours when legal prostitutes were allowed to leave licensed brothels. The southern Nevada county had proposed an ordinance that would have barred brothel workers from leaving for more than six hours during a 10-day period. Brothel owners, local prosecutors and others supporting the proposal said they were concerned prostitutes would have unprotected sex when they left brothels. The Las Vegas Sun reports Nye County decided to drop the plan after receiving criticism from sex workers and advocates who said it violated their rights. Sex workers and advocates say they also want the county to repeal an existing rule requiring prostitutes to be retested for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV any time they leave for more than 24 hours at a time.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Shakers have long been known for the simple design of their furniture and household objects, but a new exhibit at the Currier Museum of Art explores their cutting-edge skills in brand management. The Manchester museum is featuring a new exhibit called The Shakers and the Modern World, drawn from both its own collection and the holdings of Canterbury Shaker Village. Andrew Spahr, the museum’s director of collections, says the Shakers at one time caused anxiety with attempts to convert outsiders to their religion, but then they developed a branding strategy to counter negative public opinion and were quick to embrace printed media and photography to promote a more positive view. The exhibit will be accompanied by public and educational programs developed with Canterbury Shaker Village, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear hunt is underway this week. The first three days of the hunt beginning Monday are for hunters armed with bows and arrows. Archers and muzzleloading rifle hunters can participate on Thursday and Friday. The hunt is restricted to five zones. Gov. Phil Murphy has again prohibited hunting on state lands. The bear hunt for firearms only is set to begin Dec. 9. Hunters killed 225 bears in 2018, the lowest amount since 2003.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Police data shows 42 Native Americans have been reported missing in the city so far this year, after 36 in 2018. Dawn Begay, the city’s Native American affairs coordinator, says the figures represent open missing persons cases in Albuquerque. Figures from U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey show the metro area is home to roughly 50,000 Native Americans. Of the 36 missing in 2018, 15 were women. Begay shared the numbers Friday at an event held to highlight the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women in New Mexico’s largest city. An Urban Indian Health Institute study last year listed Albuquerque among cities with the highest number of missing Native American women. Authors of the report had counted 37 missing and homicide cases total for Native American women and girls.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state Department of Environmental Conservation is selling patches to support maintenance work on outdoor recreation facilities. The latest design of the New York State Trail Supporter Patch resembles the round yellow disks marking connector trails on state lands. The previous design was red, like markers used by DEC on east-west directional trails. The patch is available for $5 at sporting license outlets or online at the state’s fishing and hunting license portal. The patch was introduced in 2007 to help raise funds to maintain trails across the state. Sales have raised more than $41,000 to date. Projects supported by patch sales include a boardwalk in Texas Hollow State Forest, foot bridges on the Northville Placid Trail, maintenance of Otter Creek Horse Trails and lean-tos in the High Peaks Wilderness.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper aims to create a state-funded program to help residents in four counties recover from Hurricane Dorian after the federal government declined a request for assistance targeting them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency last week told Cooper there wasn’t enough damage from last month’s storm to individuals and households in Carteret, Dare, Hyde and New Hanover counties to warrant a federal declaration. So Cooper wrote Friday to the U.S. Small Business Administration requesting another kind of declaration for low-interest loans in the four counties and those surrounding them. If it’s approved, Cooper’s office said he would create a grant program to supplement the loans for individuals and businesses.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota auditor says the Commerce Department broke state law on bidding contracts for the state’s new “Be Legendary” logo. State Auditor Joshua Gallion released the audit Monday. The logo sparked criticism earlier this year when the contract for it was awarded to a Minnesota firm headed by a woman who once worked for Gov. Doug Burgum’s old Fargo software business. The company was awarded the $9,500 job without competition because it came in below the $10,000 threshold required for additional bids. Gallion says the audit of the agency found another contract related to the logo, bringing its total cost to more than $87,000. The Commerce Department says it did nothing wrong.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A local air base is facing the increasingly common dilemma of an aging workforce. The Dayton Daily News reports about half of the 30,000 people working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are nearing the end of their careers. Air Force Gen. Arnold Bunch Jr. says filling those jobs and taking care of employees is “critical.” More than a third of employees at the Air Force Research Laboratory are eligible to retire. This could be challenging because nearly 70% of the lab’s workforce has at least a master’s degree. According to a U.S. census estimate from 2017, only 10% of Ohioans 25 and older hold an advanced college degree. The president of the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education says the Air Force should focus on attracting and recruiting nontraditional candidates.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A Republican state senator who unsuccessfully tried to criminalize abortion has announced plans to challenge GOP U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin next year. Sen. Joseph Silk, from Broken Bow, says he’ll try to unseat Mullin, who has served four terms representing eastern Oklahoma in the U.S. House. In a statement, Silk says he chose to enter the 2020 Republican primary for the 2nd Congressional District because he was frustrated with what he called the “very liberal” leadership in the Oklahoma Legislature. Republicans hold overwhelming majorities in both the Oklahoma House and Senate. Mullin’s chief of staff, Mike Stopp, says Mullin intends to run for another term, but he declined to comment on Silk’s candidacy.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The frustrated owner of North Portland’s never-used Wapato Jail has announced he will bulldoze the facility unless someone comes up with funding to convert the facility into a homeless shelter in the next two weeks. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Jordan Schnitzer, president of Harsch Investment Properties, said Thursday that he planned to sign a demolition contract by the month’s end. Assuming no last-minute stakeholder steps in, Schnitzer said his company will break ground on a new warehouse there by spring. Schnitzer said he was “sickened” that a year-and-a half-long quest to convert the 150,000-square-foot jail into a shelter would end with the facility reduced to rubble. But city leaders, along with local nonprofits, had been reticent to place people lacking shelter in adapted jail cells 11 miles away from Portland’s downtown core.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDoylestown: Some of Bucks County’s covered bridges will be getting a makeover due to a $2.5 million refurbishment project, to include all seven county-owned spans. At one point there were more than 50 covered bridges in Bucks County, but now only a dozen remain. Those still standing were built between 1832 and 1874, when horse-drawn buggies were the main means of transportation. Ten bridges still carry cars and trucks as well as the occasional walker and cyclist. The other two are in parks. While mostly made of wood, many of the spans are held up by steel structures that need to be stripped and repainted. County operations director Kevin Spencer says other work includes fireproofing interior and exterior wood surfaces, replacing cedar facing and siding boards, and other maintenance.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A statue of Christopher Columbus was vandalized Monday, on the U.S. holiday named for him. The statue in Providence was splashed from head to toe with red paint, and a sign reading “Stop celebrating genocide” was leaned against the pedestal. The word “genocide” was written in orange paint on the rear of the pedestal. The statue has been the target of vandals on Columbus Day in the past. The New World explorer has become a polarizing figure. Native American advocates have pressed states to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day over concerns that Columbus spurred centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas. Police are investigating, and a spokeswoman for Mayor Jorge Elorza said the statue would be cleaned.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is adding a new area code. The latest set of digits will augment the Palmetto State’s oldest area code – 803. In the region stretching from Aiken to Rock Hill with Columbia at its center, new numbers beginning with 839 will be available in the Midlands starting May 26, 2020. The Post and Courier reports historically, the 803 area code was the only one in the state after World War II ended. In 1995, 864 came to the Upstate. The coastal 843 area code was created in the late 1990s. Ahead of the new number’s availability, millions of landline callers are asked to practice dialing the area code before every local number. Calls dialed without area codes will stop going through April 25, 2020.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Krystal Trull’s daughter went months without autism treatments after the family lost insurance coverage. Trull lost access to the therapy that first gave 4-year-old Nikole the gift of speech. She worried if Nikole would be able to recover. Months after petitioning state leaders to require insurers to cover an intensive form of autism treatments called Applied Behavior Analysis, Trull commended a decision announced Friday that Sioux Falls-based insurers would again cover the therapy for some families. Sanford Health and Avera Health will begin offering coverage in 2020 after a loophole in state law caused South Dakota families such as the Trulls to lose insurance coverage this year. Gov. Kristi Noem, Sanford and Avera announced the coverage in a joint statement Friday.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A woman whose father was executed for murder 13 years ago asked a judge Monday to order the testing of DNA evidence in the case. The hearing in Memphis focused largely on whether April Alley can legally bring a petition for DNA testing on behalf of her father’s estate. Sedley Alley was convicted of the 1985 murder of 19-year-old Marine Lance Cpl. Suzanne Collins in Millington. She had been out jogging when she was kidnapped, beaten, raped and mutilated. Alley confessed to the crime but later said the confession was coerced. He was executed by lethal injection in 2006. April Alley’s attorneys include Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck, who told the court they filed the petition for DNA testing after law enforcement officers in St. Louis contacted him about a possible alternative suspect in Collins’ murder.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: The Mayborn Museum moves the outside inside to teach kids some basic lessons on the natural world in its new Backyard Ecology Hall. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the hall, a $1.2 million revamping of the museum’s first-floor children’s space, consists of four large exhibit rooms and a spacious common area for live demonstrations – and families needing a place to sit and rest. The rooms blend interactive activities, live reptiles, insects and specimens from some of the Mayborn’s collections to shape lessons with connections to local ecosystems. The exhibits, created specifically for the Mayborn, aim at students from fourth- to eighth-grade levels but contain material for younger children, older students and adults, assistant exhibits director Rebecca Nall says.\n\nUtah\n\nClearfield: Two firefighters are receiving praise after they found a creative way to keep a young girl calm at the scene of a car accident. North Davis Fire District Fire Chief Mark Becraft said the firefighters let a young girl paint their nails after she and her mother were in a car accident Saturday in the northern Utah city of Clearfield. Chief Allen Hadley and Captain Kevin Lloyd checked on the crying, screaming girl while medics evaluated her mother. Nobody was seriously injured. They asked her about the nail polish she was holding and offered to have their nails painted. Both men have young daughters. Becraft said the girl was instantly soothed. Hadley and Lloyd left the scene with purple manicures.\n\nVermont\n\nWallingford: A group of outdoor lovers is working to raise the profile of the White Rocks National Recreation Area in the Green Mountain National Forest, and they’re looking for some help. The Rutland Herald reports Nate Rand, of Wallingford, says he and a friend have talked about forming the White Rocks Outdoor Collaborative, and they’ve been using a social media group to gather potential members and coordinate their efforts. Rand says about 100 people have joined a Facebook page, but the idea is still in the formative phase. Rand says many people are familiar with the White Rocks hiking trails, but comparatively few are aware that the White Rocks National Recreation Area offers opportunities to hike, snowshoe and cross-country ski.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A federal appeals court has put a hold on two permits needed for construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday issued a stay of permits from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service while it reviews a lawsuit filed by environmental groups in August. The Sierra Club said in a statement that the suspension effectively means construction must stop on the 300-mile natural gas project. The lawsuit alleges that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s approval of the project failed to adequately protect endangered species along the pipeline’s path. Also on Friday, the company building the pipeline agreed to pay more than $2 million and submit to enhanced monitoring to settle a lawsuit brought by Virginia officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSpanaway: A food bank that serves roughly 1,100 people in Pierce County has been damaged in a fire. Spanaway Food Bank director Harold Smith says families in need of food showed up throughout the day Friday and were directed to other food banks for help. Smith says the food bank’s freezers and refrigerators were lost, and the food might not be salvageable. The fire was reported about 6 a.m., and Central Pierce Fire & Rescue spokesman Darrin Shaw says the structure was heavily involved when crews arrived. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. Smith says the facility, which has operated for four decades, hands out about 15,000 pounds of food every month.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Department of Education data says more than half of the state’s teachers missed more than 10 days of school last year. WSAZ-TV reports 52.75% of teachers missed more than 10 days, according to its research of data from the education department. The prior year’s number was 52.46%. The year before that it was 51.44%, and in 2016 it was 50.83%. State Superintendent Steve Paine says teachers have a hard, stressful job, but some are missing too much school. The percentage of teachers who missed more than 20 days was nearly 11%. The omnibus education bill that passed a few months ago included a $500 attendance bonus for teachers who miss fewer than four days. Paine said the state needs to determine if that has an effect.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city’s natural history museum is hoping its new live spiders exhibit can educate visitors instead of scaring them away. The Milwaukee Public Museum is hosting the Spiders Alive! exhibit through January. It features 17 species of live arachnids from around that world, including tarantulas, black widows, brown recluses and wolf spiders. It also includes some relatives of spiders, including scorpions. The exhibit’s on-site curator, Jon Bertolas, says he guarantees that visitors will leave with a greater appreciation of spiders. Visitor Sandra Romanshek says she decided to check out the exhibit because spiders are important for the environment, even though she thinks they are creepy crawlers.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State lawmakers have advanced legislation that would help expand a network of highway crossings for wildlife. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a legislative committee unanimously approved three bills Friday creating a special wildlife conservation account to help fund additional crossings, signage and game fences in sensitive wildlife habitats. Lawmakers say the committee is expected to sponsor the bills in the 2020 session. Officials say the fund could increase federal dollars appropriated under an infrastructure bill containing $250 million for wildlife crossings at key migration chokepoints. Lawmakers say migration corridors were a means of preserving wildlife and striking a balance between energy development and conservation interests.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/13/bigfoot-convention-conjuring-house-gopher-tortoises-news-around-states/50831255/", "title": "Bigfoot convention, 'Conjuring' house: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: An inmate said prison staff poked him with needles for over an hour as they tried to find a vein during an aborted lethal injection last month. At one point, they left him hanging vertically on a gurney before state officials made the decision to call off the execution. Attorneys for 57-year-old Alan Eugene Miller wrote about his experience during Alabama’s Sept. 22 execution attempt in a court filing made last week. Miller’s attorneys are trying to block the state from attempting a second lethal injection. Two men in scrubs used needles to repeatedly probe Miller’s arms, legs, feet and hands, at one point using a cellphone flashlight to help their search for a vein, according to the Oct. 6 court filing. The attorneys called Miller the “only living execution survivor in the United States” and said Alabama subjected Miller “to precisely the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain that the Eighth Amendment was intended to prohibit.” Alabama has asked the state Supreme Court to set a new execution date for Miller, saying the execution was canceled only because of a time issue as the state faced a midnight deadline to get the lethal injection underway. “What then, in Defendants’ view, is a constitutional amount of time to spend stabbing someone with needles in an attempt to kill them?” his attorneys wrote.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State officials have canceled the fall Bristol Bay red king crab harvest and, for the first time, have also scrapped the winter harvest of smaller snow crab. The move is a double whammy to a fleet from Alaska, Washington and Oregon chasing Bering Sea crab in harvests that in 2016 grossed $280 million, The Seattle Times reports. The closures reflect conservation concerns about both crab species following bleak summer populations surveys. The decisions to shut down the snow crab and fall king crab harvests came after days of discussions by Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologists and senior agency officials who faced crabbers’ pleas for at least small fisheries. “I am struggling for words. This is so unbelievable that this is happening,” said Jamie Goen, executive director of the Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers, adding that some crabbers will go out of business. “Management of Bering Sea snow crab must now focus on conservation and rebuilding given the conditions of the stock,” the department said in a statement. Snow crab populations declined after a 2019 Bering Sea warming that scrambled the broader marine ecosystem. Last year’s snow crab harvest was the smallest in over 40 years. The causes of the population collapse are still being researched but likely include increased predation and stresses from warmer water.\n\nArizona\n\nWilliams: ’Tis the season for permits for cutting down potential Christmas trees in Arizona. The Kaibab National Forest will make Christmas tree permits available online starting Thursday. The permits for ranger districts in north-central Arizona will only be obtainable via Recreation.gov. No permits will be given in person. The actual chopping down of trees will not be allowed until Nov. 1. Each permit holder can cut a maximum of five trees at $15 per tree. The permits apply to specific tree species no more than 10 feet tall. The permits expire Dec. 31. More specific instructions on which types of trees and a map of where people can cut down trees are available on the website.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A free Riverfront Amphitheater weekly series of concerts featuring regional and local musicians will return for three more years thanks to the work of a nonprofit group promoting music and dancing. Fort Smith’s 64.6 Downtown has landed a grant to carry on the shows through 2025, said executive director Talicia Richardson. The Mortimer & Mimi Levitt Foundation that supports nonprofits nationwide with music in public spaces announced this week that 64.6 Downtown has been awarded a multiyear Levitt AMP Grant Award of $90,000 in matching funds to present a free outdoor music series at the Riverfront Amphitheater in 2023, 2024 and 2025. “I’m very excited to make this even bigger and better with even more community engagement,” Richardson said. The Levitt AMP summer 2022 series ran from May 12 to July 14 and brought live music weekly to the downtown entertainment district. The indie rock band Dawson Hollow drew a crowd of about 300 people June 9 to the Riverfront Amphitheater, Richardson said. In 2021 the shows included ran between May 13 and July 15. The series features live music every Thursday for ten weeks.“We actually noticed that people were coming out when we were still in pandemic protocol,” Richardson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Art Laboe, the pioneering radio DJ who read heartfelt song dedications to generations of loyal listeners and was credited with helping end segregation in Southern California during an eight-decade broadcast career, has died. He was 97. Laboe died Friday night at home in Palm Springs after catching pneumonia, said Joanna Morones, a spokesperson for Laboe’s production company, Dart Entertainment. His final show was produced last week and broadcast Sunday night. Laboe is credited with helping end segregation in Southern California by organizing live DJ shows at drive-in eateries that attracted white, Black and Latino listeners who danced to rock ’n’ roll – and shocked an older generation still listening to Frank Sinatra and Big Band music. The DJ is also credited with coining the phrase “oldies but goodies.” In 1957, he started Original Sound Record Inc., and in 1958 he released the compilation album “Oldies But Goodies: Vol. 1,” which stayed on the Billboard’s Top 100 chart for 183 weeks. He later developed a strong following among Mexican Americans for hosting the syndicated “The Art Laboe Connection Show.” His radio shows gave the families of incarcerated loved ones, in particular, a platform to speak to their relatives by dedicating songs and sending messages and updates. California and Arizona inmates would send in their own dedications and ask Laboe for updates from family.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former National Security Agency employee accused of trying to sell classified information to Russia will remain behind bars while he is prosecuted, a magistrate judge ruled Tuesday. Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, is facing a possible life sentence for allegedly giving the information to an undercover FBI agent whom prosecutors say he believed was a person working for the Russian Federation. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer during a hearing in Denver federal court before a hearing to determine if he should be released from jail. Dalke was arrested Sept. 28 after authorities say he arrived at Denver’s downtown train station with a laptop and used a secure connection set up by investigators to transfer some classified documents. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews said the stiff penalty Dalke could face makes him a flight risk along with the sympathies he has allegedly expressed for Russia. Crews also said he was not sure that Dalke, accused of sharing the documents after promising not to disclose information he obtained while working at the NSA, would honor any conditions he could impose that would allow Dalke to live with his wife and grandmother in Colorado Springs while the case proceeds. He was also concerned about authentic-looking but counterfeit badges for government agencies, including the NSA, allegedly found during a search of Dalke’s home.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay $965 million to people who suffered from his false claim that the Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax, a jury decided Wednesday. The verdict is the second big judgment against the Infowars host over his relentless promotion of the lie that the 2012 elementary school massacre never happened and that the grieving families seen in news coverage were actors hired as part of a plot to take away people’s guns. It came in a lawsuit filed by the relatives of five children and three educators killed in the mass shooting, plus an FBI agent who was among the first responders to the scene. A Texas jury in August awarded nearly $50 million to the parents of another slain child. Robbie Parker, who lost his 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, said outside the Connecticut court that he was proud that “what we were able to accomplish was just to simply tell the truth.” “And it shouldn’t be this hard, and it shouldn’t be this scary,” he said, his voice breaking. Jones wasn’t at court but reacted on his Infowars show. As courtroom video showed the plaintiffs’ names being read out along with the jury awards to each, Jones said that he himself had never mentioned their names. “All made up. Hilarious,” he said. “So this is what a show trial looks like. I mean, this is the left completely out of control.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Nonprofits operating in the predominantly Black city have racial gaps in leadership, especially when it comes to reflecting the communities they serve. The finding is one of many from the Delaware Alliance for Nonprofit Advancement’s 2022 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, which aimed to explore racial disparities in the makeup of Delaware nonprofit boards. The study, which was released last week and included responses from more than 100 nonprofit leaders, analyzes the diversity characteristics in senior leadership at Delaware nonprofits, such as age, gender and even whether board members live in the communities in which their organization operates. The survey, conducted at the beginning of 2022, asked respondents if they believe their boards are “reflective” of their communities; how Delaware’s leadership diversity compares with national data; and what diversity, equity and inclusion steps nonprofits can take to improve diversity efforts. In a statement, DANA President and CEO Sheila Bravo said her nonprofit “often” receives requests on how to address board diversity. In a city with 55% of residents who are Black, only 37% of this city’s nonprofits have board directors who are Black and 26% of executive directors who identify as Black.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s attorney general is calling for a complete overhaul of the D.C. Housing Authority amid serious allegations of collusion and corruption, WUSA-TV reports. A scathing federal audit by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development revealed systemic failures in the local agency after a WUSA-TV investigation exposed filthy and unsafe conditions months ago. Much of the district’s public housing sits on very desirable properties for developers in gentrified areas of the city. Greenleaf, for example, is slated for redevelopment following DCHA’s new build-in-place model. Attorney General Karl Racine said the housing agency is far more concerned about redevelopment than maintaining clean and safe public housing. “They are the city’s largest slumlord,” Racine said. His officer sued the agency twice, in one case alleging disabled residents have been waiting years to be moved to accessible units. “The failures are inhumane and require immediate action,” Racine said. The federal audit found an agency so mismanaged tenant files were not updated, waiting lists were locked, and some sat untouched for a decade. And those living inside public housing are left to raise families in apartments overrun by bugs, mice, mold and rats.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Gopher tortoises – burrowers whose extensive homes shelter many other animals – are generally doing well and need federal protection only in the small area where they were declared threatened 35 years ago, the government said Tuesday. Thanks to extensive conservation work and recently discovered populations, the reptile is no longer a candidate for protection in the bulk of its range: Florida, south Georgia, most of coastal Alabama and a sliver of South Carolina, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. An environmental group that sued for protection across the entire range called the decision indefensible. “It ignores devastating urban sprawl that’s decimated the tortoise’s habitat and will continue to drive the species ever closer to extinction,” said Elise Bennett, Florida director and an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. The National Alliance of Forest Owners, on the other hand, called the agency’s action a great decision that recognizes the success of voluntary conservation programs. Bennett said Tuesday that the decision was made even though the federal agency expects populations to decline range-wide over the next 80 years. “State programs, particularly in Florida – the heart of their range – are just not working,” she said Friday, as the deadline approached. “Florida is largely just moving them out of areas under development and into smaller and smaller habitat. And fragmentation is a problem already.” The federal statement said Florida has 50 long-term relocation sites covering more than 120 square miles of gopher tortoise habitat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nVienna: A mayor helped a mother and three children escape from a sport utility vehicle that was stalled on railroad tracks with a train fast approaching. Vienna Mayor Eddie Daniels was on his way to work Saturday morning when he saw the SUV in the dangerous position. “I couldn’t let those babies sit there and get slaughtered by a train,” Daniels told WALB-TV. He helped the mom out first, then saw three children in the back seat: a 6-year-old, a 3-year-old and a 1-year old. He said he got the two younger children out and was helping the 6-year-old when the train hit the vehicle. Daniels said he remembers being caught between the train and the SUV but still managed to get the last child out. The smashed vehicle landed a few feet from where it was hit. Daniels has a broken ankle and eight stitches on his head. He said he’s thankful the family is alive. The second-term mayor also said he would have never imagined this happening in the south central Georgia city of 4,000 residents. “I’m out here just doing God’s work. That’s what we’re supposed to do,” Daniels said. “And they told me I was a hero. I said I don’t feel like a hero, just feel like I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, what the people elected me to do.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKula: State officials are soliciting public input on a planned Maui forest reserve, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources acquired more than 3,000 acres near the dormant Haleakala volcano just over two years ago that is a nesting site for endangered seabirds. The land is commonly known as Kamehamenui.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Nearly 50 longtime Idaho Republicans, including a former governor and dozens of other past and current officeholders, on Tuesday endorsed the Democratic candidate for attorney general in November’s election. Republicans attended a news conference at the Statehouse with Boise attorney Tom Arkoosh, who has said he has no political ambitions other than to run the office fairly. “Tom Arkoosh is the first candidate on the Democratic ticket I have supported in my 66 years of work with the Republican Party,” said Republican state Sen. Patti Anne Lodge, the powerful chairwoman of the Senate’s State Affairs Committee who is retiring this year. The three other current officeholders endorsing Arkoosh are also leaving office this year, either through retirement or primary losses. But the list of supporters includes many well-known Republicans. Arkoosh said he would like the endorsements to start a wider conversation about what voters want in the deeply conservative state that hasn’t sent a Democrat to the attorney general’s office since 1991. “When that conversation happens, we will move away from extremism,” he said. “We will become Idahoans altogether again.” Arkoosh announced his candidacy in July after former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador defeated five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the GOP primary in May. Arkoosh and the Republicans supporting him say Labrador will turn the office into a partisan base to further his own political ambitions.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police have a suspect in custody after officers discovered human remains inside a freezer at a boarding house while investigating a report of a missing person, police said Tuesday. The home’s owner, a 55-year-old woman, is believed to be the victim, said Brendan Deenihan, the Chicago Police Department’s chief of detectives. Her remains were found Monday. Deenihan told reporters that a suspect who lived in the boarding house on Chicago’s Northwest Side was taken into custody Monday. He said the suspect, whose name was not released, has declined to speak to detectives about the slaying, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. A resident of the boarding house who had filed a missing-person report for the building’s owner told officers Monday that another building tenant had recently called a tow truck and carried a heavy bag out to the vehicle when it arrived, Deenihan said. “We learned that this individual dumped a large plastic bag in a garbage can at Foster Beach,” Deenihan said, adding that detectives found bloody towels in that garbage can along the lakefront. Detectives returned to the boarding house and discovered human remains in a freezer about 7 p.m., then obtained a search warrant so they could recover the evidence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Voters were allowed to begin casting early, in-person ballots Wednesday for the Nov. 8 election in which Democrats are looking for a backlash against the Republican-backed state abortion ban approved over the summer. Republicans in the tightest races are largely avoiding the abortion issue while emphasizing economic topics as they seek to extend their dominance over statewide offices and the General Assembly. Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young is seeking reelection by following a front-runner strategy of mostly ignoring Democratic challenger Thomas McDermott ahead of their only televised debate scheduled for Sunday. Democrats, meanwhile, are targeting the Indiana secretary of state’s race, in which former Mike Pence aide Diego Morales won the Republican nomination despite twice leaving jobs in that office after being written up for poor job performance. Indiana Democrats are trying to pick up enough legislative seats to break the Republican supermajorities that have left Democrats largely powerless against conservative proposals such as the abortion ban that’s been blocked by a court order. Democrats need to gain five seats in the 100-member House needed to break the two-thirds supermajority that allows Republicans to act even if no Democrats are present.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A former Iowa official now running for state auditor was wrongly fired in retaliation for reporting illegal conduct at the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division, a Polk County jury found Friday. Todd Halbur began working as comptroller for the division in 2015 and sued after he was terminated in July 2018, alleging whistleblower retaliation on the part of the beverages division and its director, Stephen Larson. The case went to trial in October, and on Friday, his attorneys said, the jury ruled in Halbur’s favor and awarded him $487,500 for lost wages and $512,500 for emotional distress – a total of $1 million. Halbur, a small-business owner and licensed Realtor, is running as a Republican to unseat Auditor Rob Sand, the Democratic incumbent. The auditor acts as the taxpayers’ watchdog by auditing the financial operations of Iowa’s state and local governments. Attorney Stuart Higgins, representing Halbur, said the decision vindicated his client’s belief that he’d been punished for doing the right thing. “We are pleased that jurors recognized what Todd Halbur knew all along: that he stood up to make sure the law was followed and was fired by Administrator Larson in retaliation,” Higgins said. “All the credit goes to Todd for his tenacity and courage in pursuing this case.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s Republican attorney general told a racial justice commission two years ago that racial bias “obviously” exists in law enforcement, but he said Tuesday that he wasn’t saying systemic racism exists and stood by campaign attacks on the state’s Democratic governor for using that phrase. Attorney General Derek Schmidt and fellow Republicans are portraying Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly as anti-police as Schmidt tries to unseat Kelly in the Nov. 8 election. George Floyd’s death in 2020 led Kelly to form a Commission on Racial Justice and Equity to examine policing, declaring as she did so that “systemic racism within law enforcement must end.” Schmidt has argued that saying systemic racism exists is calling law enforcement officers racist. His own comments that racial bias “obviously” exists in policing came during a Zoom meeting of the governor’s commission in October 2020. He told reporters Tuesday that when “a rare bad apple” commits misconduct, “there are mechanisms in place to deal with those individual problems.” “They are two different things,” Schmidt said. “I certainly don’t argue that there is systemic racism in law enforcement, and I think the governor’s decision to appoint an entire separate commission to focus on that problem was ill-advised.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A former police officer blamed for instigating a conflict that led to the fatal shooting of a Black barbecue restaurant owner during the Breonna Taylor protests has pleaded guilty to using excessive force. Katie R. Crews, 29, pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to a misdemeanor. She was indicted in March on a felony excessive force charge that carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Crews, who is white, was fired by Louisville police earlier this year for escalating a conflict the night of restaurateur David McAtee’s death and for a separate incident in which she taunted protesters on social media. McAtee’s death furthered the anger of protesters who had began massing in Louisville’s downtown streets in 2020 over the death of Taylor, a Black EMT killed by police who knocked down her door while executing a drug search warrant. Under the terms of the agreement, Crews, of Jeffersonville, Indiana, can no longer work in law enforcement. She will be sentenced in federal court in January. The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. Steve Romines, a lawyer for McAtee’s family, said they are “glad that there has been an acknowledgment of the gross misconduct of (Louisville police) the night of David’s death.” Crews wasn’t “a lone wolf who decided to go rogue,” Romines said in an email Wednesday, arguing that authorities were sent to Louisville’s west end by commanding officers to “violate policies and harass people.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two anglers whose boat sank over the weekend in the Gulf of Mexico say they clung to an improvised float and fought off sharks with their bare hands while the third swam what felt like miles to search for help. The swimmer, Phong Le, managed to find a cellphone signal and sent a Google map of his location just before his battery died, he told ABC News on Tuesday. The three men had been in the water since about 10 a.m. Saturday – the sharks showed up Sunday morning, Luan Nguyen said. One bit the front of his life vest. “And I think that’s where I caught … these injuries on my hand,” he told the broadcaster, which identified the third boater as Son Nguyen. “I took my two thumbs and jabbed him in the eyes, and he took off,” Luan Nguyen said. Even as the two men were pulled from the water, they were being circled and harassed by four blacktip sharks measuring about 4 to 6 feet long, said Andrew Stone, a seaman in the Coast Guard boat crew that rescued the exhausted pair. “They were too tired to even be panicking,” he told the Associated Press in an interview alongside other Coast Guard members and officials. All three boaters were back home Tuesday, the Coast Guard said. “These peoples’ will to survive and their lifejackets is what saved their lives,” said Lt. Katy Caraway, a helicopter co-pilot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The owner of a former chemical plant that dumped mercury into the Penobscot River must pay at least $187 million to remove the contamination in a resolution to a decades­long legal battle. A federal judge on Tuesday approved the settlement calling for Mallinckrodt U.S. LLC to pay for remediation of mercury released by the now-defunct HoltraChem plant in Orrington. The plant discharged 6 to 12 metric tons of mercury from 1967 until the early 1970s, according to a previous court-ordered study. Environmental groups have long pushed for the remediation of the river. “It’s long past time for Mallinckrodt to make it right, and this ruling will go a long way toward restoring the Penobscot, so people can go back to fishing, eating lobster, and enjoying this river,” Jesse Graham, co-director of Maine People’s Alliance, said in a statement. The plant operated until 2000 and was located about 135 miles north of Portland, just south of Bangor. Maine People’s Alliance and Natural Resources Defense Council also filed a complaint about the mercury pollution in 2000. The company’s financial obligations under the settlement will not exceed $267 million, court papers said.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: A transgender teacher who said she was harassed by students, parents and colleagues has settled a lawsuit with a school district with an agreement that includes policy changes and training. Attorneys for Jennifer Eller said the settlement reached late last month with the Prince George’s County Board of Education also included monetary compensation. The lawsuit was filed in 2018 in U.S. District Court. “I’m relieved to see this case finally come to a resolution and satisfied to see that our case led to the adoption of these policy changes and training protocols to improve the school environment for everyone, including LGBTQ+ students and teachers,” Eller said in a statement. “This settlement vindicates my pleas for help and sensitivity training on LGBTQ+ issues for students and staff. Every student and every teacher should feel safe, welcomed, and respected in a school environment.” Eller said she was told to present as male and be referred to by male pronouns, and she was also threatened, according to a news release. After Eller filed formal complaints, she said administrators took away her Advanced Placement English class, and she was brought to a disciplinary hearing that resulted in no discipline.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 91-year-old civil rights activist and education advocate was stabbed multiple times while walking her dog in a local park, authorities said. Jean McGuire, the first Black woman to serve on the Boston School Committee, was stabbed in Franklin Park about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said Wednesday after visiting McGuire at the hospital. McGuire’s stabbing, as well as the recent fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy in the city, is unacceptable, said Hayden, whose family has been close to McGuire’s for years. “I’m certainly outraged, and I think we have to be at the point where we have an entire community that is equally as outraged and will not stand for this sort of random violence any further,” he said. The good news is that McGuire is “as spunky and as vibrant as ever and is going to be just fine, praise the Lord,” he said. McGuire’s sister, Jeriline Brady McGinnis, told multiple news outlets that her sister has been walking dogs in the park for decades. “What did he want? Dog walkers don’t carry money. We carry poop bags and ID. That’s all he’s going to get,” she told WFXT-TV. McGuire was unconscious when officers found her. She was taken to a hospital with injuries that aren’t considered life-threatening, police said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Over 150,000 Michigan voters have cast absentee ballots a month before the Nov. 8 election that will decide the state’s governor, secretary of state, attorney general and whether access to abortion will be a constitutional right. A total of 1.6 million people have requested absentee ballots so far, surpassing the 1.16 million who chose the option in the 2018 midterm election. The numbers indicate that 2022 could be the most votes ever cast in the state for a gubernatorial election, secretary of state spokesman Jake Rollow said Tuesday. A record-breaking 3.3 million people in Michigan voted absentee in the 2020 presidential election at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Rollow said he expects the state “would end up with about 2.25 million absentee ballots submitted if things were to play out along similar trend lines” to the 2020 election. The secretary of state will continue to release absentee numbers weekly in the lead-up to the election. A 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment that allowed for no-excuse absentee voting, along with the pandemic, has led voters in the state to increasingly vote absentee rather than at the polls on Election Day.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWaite Park: A woman is accused of a threatening to kill a Somali family while invading their St. Cloud-area home on two occasions, court documents say. Alyssa Holmberg, 33, of Ogilvie, is charged with bias-motivated assault and three other counts in connection with the Saturday disturbance at a Waite Park apartment building. Holmberg yelled racist remarks about Somali people, including those on the police force, according to the criminal complaint. A girl in the family who called 911 said Holmberg said she hated Somalis and screamed that was going to kill her and her family. Holmberg threw an object at the girl and left briefly before returning. Authorities said police arrived to see Holmberg chasing a man. The man told police he was walking on the sidewalk near the apartment building when Holmberg shouted, “Somali, move!” She allegedly threw a bottle of salsa and hit him in the back. Officers eventually caught Holmberg and started to handcuff her. She said she was irate about Somalis being on the police force and kicked one officer and called her vulgar names. Holmberg is charged with assaulting an officer. Holmberg made her first court appearance Tuesday morning. Her bail was set at $50,000 without conditions or $5,000 with conditions. It was not clear if she had an attorney.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre says he is being treated unfairly in news coverage of a Mississippi welfare scandal, including about payments he received to help fund a pet project of his – a volleyball arena at the university he attended and where his daughter was playing the sport. “I have been unjustly smeared in the media,” Favre said in a statement to Fox News Digital, which was published Tuesday. “I have done nothing wrong, and it is past time to set the record straight. No one ever told me, and I did not know, that funds designated for welfare recipients were going to the University or me,” Favre wrote. “I tried to help my alma mater USM, a public Mississippi state university, raise funds for a wellness center. My goal was and always will be to improve the athletic facilities at my university.” It is one of the few public statements Favre has made about Mississippi’s largest-ever public corruption case involving the misspending of tens of millions of dollars in welfare money that was intended to help some of the poorest people in one of the poorest states in the U.S. Favre is not facing criminal charges. He is among more than three dozen people or companies being sued by the Mississippi Department of Human Services.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Although the creature was absent, a group of 75 enthusiasts attended the first Ozark Mountain Bigfoot Conference at the Christian County Elks Lodge on Saturday. Event coordinator Mary Ann Ziebell said she was going to be happy if 50 people showed up, so her hopes were exceeded. She’s already planning for next year’s conference, slated for October 2023. When she realized there may not have been a sasquatch conference previously in Missouri, Ziebell jumped at the chance to set one up. She contacted members from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, Ozark Mountain Sasquatch, a cryptolinguist and others to speak at the all-day conference Oct. 8. “It falls one of two places: People either believe, or they think we’ve lost our freaking minds – there’s really no in between,” Ziebell said in an interview minutes before the conference began. “Now, with some people, it wouldn’t matter if you dragged a body in here; they’re not gonna believe it.” Ziebell said she first encountered sasquatches only recently. She was on an expedition with her husband in 2019 when she saw one illuminated by the full moon. Southwest Missouri is a “hotbed” for sightings, she said. “You can go 30 minutes outside of Springfield and find all kinds of things,” Ziebell said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: An environmental group filed a lawsuit Tuesday against U.S. Forest Service officials that alleges they polluted waterways during their campaigns against wildfires by inadvertently dropping large volumes of chemical flame retardant into streams. Government data released earlier this year found aircraft operated or contracted by the Forest Service dropped more than 760,000 gallons of fire retardant directly onto streams and other waterways between 2012 and 2019. The main ingredients in fire retardant are inorganic fertilizers and salts that can be harmful to some fish, frogs, crustaceans and other aquatic species. The lawsuit alleges the continued use of retardant from aircraft violates the Clean Water Act. It requests a judge to declare the pollution illegal and was filed in U.S. District Court in Montana by Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. “It’s simply too toxic at the levels used fighting fires,” said Andy Stahl, the Eugene, Oregon-based group’s executive director. Forest Service officials in recent years have sought to avoid polluting streams during their fights against wildfires by imposing buffer zones around waterways where drops are restricted. Under a 2011 government decision, fire retardant may only be applied in designated “avoidance areas” where human life or public safety is threatened.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: An incarcerated woman’s death from cervical cancer is the fault of the state prison system, an inspector general’s report has found. According to the Omaha World-Herald, inmate Niccole Wetherell died at age 40, a year and a half after a Pap smear revealed the cancer. The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ lack of attention to preventive care flies in the face of a 2015 law that required electronic tracking of inmate health records.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A defense lawyer raised mental health questions Tuesday about a man accused of killing two people and wounding six in a stabbing rampage last week on a Las Vegas Strip sidewalk. The suspect, Yoni Christian Barrios, stood in shackles during his brief arraignment and spoke only to say he understood he was being charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. He was not immediately asked to enter a plea. Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Harmony Letizia set a Jan. 12 hearing to determine if Barrios will face trial in state court on charges that could have him confronting a possible death penalty, and she ordered him to remain jailed without bail. A grand jury could indict Barrios before that time. “We’re doing an evaluation regarding competency based on the nature of everything we know so far,” deputy public defender Scott Coffee said outside court after the hearing. “Obviously there are mental health concerns.” Authorities say Barrios, 32, asked sidewalk showgirls to pose with him for a photo before wielding a large chef’s knife to fatally stab Maris DiGiovanni, 30, and Brent Allan Hallett, 46, on Oct. 6 outside the Wynn Las Vegas resort.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKingston: With home heating costs on the rise, dozens of local artists have teamed up to auction off some of their original artwork to raise money to help veterans in need this winter. A “Fuel for Vets” benefit auction will be held Sunday at the Kingston Community Library. A brunch is planned from 10:30 a.m. to 12 p.m., followed by a live art auction from noon to 2 p.m. Nearly 40 pieces of artwork donated by artists from the Seacoast and beyond will be up for grabs. “There are going to be people making choices between food and heat this winter, and it certainly shouldn’t be veterans,” said Hampstead artist Dannielle Genovese, who came up with the idea for the auction while going through some of her own artwork that was taking up space in her home. Genovese wanted to find a way to donate her pieces and have them auctioned off. She reached out to other local artists and found a lot of support for the idea, including from members of the Seacoast Artist Association. The Kingston Community Library quickly joined the effort and agreed to help organize and host the event. “The money is going to local people in need,” library Director Melissa Mannon said. “This is the role a library can play in the community. We value books, but we also value art and creativity.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOceanport: Streaming giant Netflix says it is the top bid in the race for Fort Monmouth’s Mega Parcel, the largest property ever put up for sale at the former U.S. Army base, though details remain unclear. Spokespeople for the company said Wednesday that its bid was the “preferred choice” for the 293-acre parcel out of four possible bidders. Officials at Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority, the state agency in charge of the fort’s redevelopment, did not immediately confirm Netflix was chosen, but its executive director said the highest bidder had been contacted. Kara Kopach, FMERA’s executive director, said the process may take several months, and “no recommendation has been made to date.” A spokesperson for Netflix said the company’s proposal is for a “state-of-the-art production complex” at Fort Monmouth, which once served as fort for the Signal Corps, before being closed by the Army in 2011, a casualty of base realignment. “If our plans are approved, we hope to build a facility that will create significant economic impact and job growth for New Jersey, a state loaded with creative talent and technical expertise,” Netflix’s spokespeople said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A New Mexico State University study has found that teacher vacancies in the state have dropped significantly over the past year. NMSU released a report Monday from its Southwest Outreach Academic Research Evaluation & Policy Center showing that the numbers of empty positions are closer to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Researchers looked at the number of job openings in every school district in New Mexico and data provided by colleges and universities. They found 690 teacher vacancies compared to 1,048 last year, a 34% decline. Rachel Boren, the center’s director, said the findings don’t diminish the fact that there is still an urgent need for teachers and other support staff. The void is especially felt with teaching special education and elementary education. By subject, the biggest needs are in math, science and English language arts. The study also counted 1,886 students enrolled in an education preparation program during the 2021-22 academic year. That is an increase compared to 1,596 students enrolled the year prior. The report found 1,027 students finished a program this year. Officials at NMSU’s own teacher education program say having secure, collaborative partnerships helps with ensuring prospective teachers obtain their license.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: One of the state’s most popular attractions has reopened to the public. The National Park Service began allowing visitors to go up into the Statue of Liberty’s crown Tuesday, more than 21/ 2 years after it closed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Other parts of the statue including the observation deck had reopened previously. Due to the popularity of the crown, visitors are required to make reservations in advance, and a limited number of tickets are available each day. As of Tuesday evening, the first available tickets were for early November. Situated in New York Harbor overlooking New York and New Jersey, the statue routinely drew more than 4 million visitors in the several years leading up to the pandemic. About 1.5 million visited in 2021, according to the Department of the Interior. The park service warns visitors with physical limitations that the climb to the crown is 162 steps up a double-helix spiral staircase and can be strenuous.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBurlington: A severed finger left behind at the scene of an attempted home invasion last week led investigators to a suspect in the case, police said. Burlington officers responded to a report of an attempted home invasion Thursday morning after a resident who had started a vehicle in the driveway encountered an armed man who tried to force his way into the house, police said in a news release. Police said the two struggled, and the man’s gun went off, grazing the resident’s chest, before the resident was able to shut the door on his hand. The resident was not seriously injured. Crime scene investigators found a finger, believed to have been severed when the resident forced the door shut, inside the suspect’s glove, which fell off during the struggle, police said. Investigators used fingerprints to identify a suspect, Burlington police spokesperson Emily-Lynn Adkins said. The city lies about 50 miles northwest of Raleigh. Vernon Wilson, 67, of Hillsborough, was arrested Monday on charges that include first-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury and possession of a firearm by a prohibited felon. Wilson was held on a $250,000 secure bond, police said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state Supreme Court has ordered a lower court judge to reconsider his decision to prevent the state’s abortion ban from taking effect pending the outcome of a clinic’s legal challenge. The North Dakota Supreme Court late Tuesday ordered Judge Bruce Romanick to weigh the clinic’s chances of succeeding in reconsidering whether his decision to temporarily halt enforcement of the ban was correct. The Red River Women’s Clinic, the state’s only abortion clinic, argues that the state’s constitution grants the right to abortion. Romanick last month denied a request to lift his stay of a law banning abortion while the clinic’s challenge is pending. The judge wrote that he was not ruling on the probability of the clinic winning the lawsuit but rather that more time was needed to make a proper judgment. It was the second time the judge blocked the so-called trigger law, which had been set to take effect at the end of August. North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley certified a July 28 closing date a few days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But Romanick rejected that date based on a technical issue involving the timing of the ban, after which Wrigley argued that the judge hadn’t sufficiently considered whether the clinic’s lawsuit would succeed.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron: The eight police officers who fired dozens of rounds at Jayland Walker, a 25-year-old Black man, following a car and foot chase have returned to duty. Akron Police Chief Steve Mylett said the officers were back at work Monday to alleviate a staffing shortage he described as a “crisis” to WEWS-TV on Tuesday. The officers had been on paid administrative leave following the June 27 fatal shooting. The officers will not be in uniform or work patrol duties, Mylett said. They have been reassigned to administrative duties, he said. “We recognize that this decision will cause concern for the Walker family and the community, and we are sensitive to those concerns,” Mylett said. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is currently investigating the circumstances surrounding Walker’s death. A preliminary autopsy showed Walker was shot at least 40 times. Two officers initially tried to stop Walker’s car for minor equipment violations. Walker refused to stop, and seconds into the pursuit, a shot was fired from his car, police said. The officers chased the car onto a freeway and back onto city streets. A short time later, Walker stopped and bailed from the car. Ignoring officers’ commands, he ran into an adjacent parking lot, where he was killed in a hail of police gunfire, police bodycam video shows.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Pardon and Parole Board on Wednesday rejected a request to recommend clemency for a death row inmate who killed his girlfriend’s 3-year-old son in 1993. The board turned down the request to recommend to Gov. Kevin Stitt that Richard Stephen Fairchild be spared for the beating death of Adam Broomhall in Del City. Fairchild, 62, is set to be executed Nov. 17. Defense attorney Emma Rolls argued that Fairchild was abused as a child, suffers from mental illness and is remorseful for his actions. “As Richard Fairchild’s brain has deteriorated, he has descended into psychosis,” Rolls said in a statement. “Mr. Fairchild is now suffering from the effects of major mental illness, namely schizoaffective disorder, leaving him tortured with continued delusions,” Rolls said. “Yet despite having lost touch with reality, Richard remains remorseful for his crime and continues to have an unblemished prison record.” Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor said in a statement that the board made the correct decision. “Fairchild, brutally tortured (the child) to death on Nov. 13, 1995, for wetting the bed,” O’Connor said. “Fairchild … beat, burned, and threw Adam into the side of a table, silencing his cries forever.”\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon has announced a new initiative to support Indigenous students that will cover all tuition costs and offer them additional resources. The Home Flight Scholars Program is available immediately to currently enrolled eligible undergraduate students, an estimated 150 to 175 self-identified American Indian and Alaska Native Oregon residents. The program also will establish a new academic adviser position and offer professional development aimed at Indigenous students. Native American students have the highest college dropout rate of any other race or ethnicity due to financial hardships, academic difficulties and the lack of cultural connectedness, according to Kirby Brown, associate professor and director of the new Native American and Indigenous Studies Program. Brown said the majority of Native students who leave drop out their first year, and 90% of those drop out in the first term. The Home Flight Scholars Program is focused on changing this trend. “We’re very, very cognizant of who is on campus and why we are supporting them through their education because it makes the difference in the future,” said Jason Younker, assistant vice president and adviser to the president on sovereignty and government to government relations. Younker is also chief of the Coquille Indian Tribe. “They are our future stewards, they will come back to the tribes, and they will be UO allies; they will be our future leaders,” he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A federal jury has awarded a former Allegheny County jailer close to $1 million in his lawsuit alleging he was fired in retaliation for reporting racist comments and texts from a supervisor. The decision came Friday, about five years after Jeffrey Kengerski filed the lawsuit against the county and the jail warden in 2017. He was fired in 2015 for what his attorneys said were false allegations of misconduct by subordinates. An attorney for the county maintained Tuesday that Kengerski was fired for proper cause and said the county will likely appeal. Kengerski said he was telling co-workers that he and his wife planned to take their grand-niece into their care full time when his supervisor referred to the biracial girl as a “little monkey” after asking if she was Black. Kengerski said the supervisor also then sent him multiple texts that included stereotyped images of Black and Asian people that often included captions comparing them to Black and Asian jail employees. The supervisor left the jail in 2015, according to the lawsuit. But before she left, Kengerski alleged that she reassigned him to the night shift as retaliation after he filed a complaint. Kengerski alleged other jail employees harassed him by making racist calls to his work number, physically threatened him and falsely accused him of misconduct.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: The so-called Conjuring House will host a “Halloween Spooktacular” Oct.28 to 31, featuring two watch parties showing the 2013 movie “The Conjuring,” with guest Andrea Perron, one of the five sisters in the family who inspired the movie. The weekend will also include six-hour ghost hunts, from 10 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday to 4 a.m. the following days. Also, tours will be offered: the house’s regular hourlong daytime tours and special “spooky” after-dark tours lasting an hour and a half. The ghost hunts are $130 per person Friday and Saturday and $150 Sunday, which will have a smaller limit of 10 people to offer a “more intimate” experience, according to owner Jacqueline Nuñez.The movie screenings with Perron are $125 a person and run from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tours start at $20 for children 7 to 12 and $25 for those 13 and older.

Noting that nothing illegal was found in the search, Shaw University President Paulette Dillard said she was outraged by the treatment, which also included questioning that she likened to an interrogation. The traffic stop was carried out by deputies and law enforcement officers in Spartanburg County on Oct. 5 as 18 students from her Raleigh, North Carolina, school were traveling to a conference in Atlanta, Dillard said. She wrote in a statement Monday that she has asked the school’s general counsel to consider options for legal recourse. Dillard called the situation “reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s – armed police, interrogating innocent Black students, conducting searches without probable cause, and blood-thirsty dogs” and the deputies’ actions “unfair and unjust.” The officers told the people aboard the bus that they stopped it because the vehicle was swerving and issued the driver a warning ticket for improper lane use, according to Dillard’s statement. Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Lt. Kevin Bobo, an agency spokesperson, said deputies need more information from the school to fully investigate the school’s complaint.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Wednesday that she would not call a special legislative session to have lawmakers consider repealing the state’s tax on groceries ahead of the November election, despite calls to do so from a handful of Republican lawmakers as well as her Democratic challenger. The governor, speaking at a news event at a Sioux Falls grocery store, acknowledged her campaign proposal does not currently have the votes necessary for passage in the state Senate. She will have to win over lawmakers when they are scheduled to reconvene in January. Repeal of the state tax on groceries, which would cost the state about $100 million in annual revenue, has become a central issue in her reelection bid against her Democratic opponent, state Rep. Jamie Smith. Noem publicly opposed the repeal in March this year but changed course last month to promise that she would convince the Legislature to cut the tax if reelected. Smith supported the repeal several times during his six years in the state House. “I don’t want to put us in a situation where this bill fails,” Noem said. The governor said she would work to convince senators that she has expanded South Dakota’s economy to a point that state government would not miss the $100 million in revenue.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Grammy-winning singer and composer Anita Kerr, whose vocal group the Anita Kerr Singers provided the lush backdrop to the Nashville Sound, has died. She was 94. Her daughter, Kelley Kerr, confirmed to The New York Times that her mother died in Geneva on Monday. Kerr worked alongside hit producers Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley to create the popular countrypolitan sound of country music in the 1950s and ’60s that relied on strings and choral singers for an orchestral sound. She and her singers provided backup to songs by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Ernest Tubb, Jim Reeves, Red Foley, Roy Orbison and many more. Alongside the Jordanaires, the Anita Kerr Singers were prolific in recording sessions and provided the essential sound to so many hit recordings. “Anita Kerr helped Nashville achieve world-class stature as a music center through her roles as a gifted arranger, producer and leader of the lush vocal quartet the Anita Kerr Singers,” Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a statement. “Her voice and her creativity expanded the artistic and commercial possibilities for country music.” Born in Memphis, Kerr moved to Nashville with her husband, a DJ, and started a vocal quartet that was featured on WSM radio.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A now-former police officer was charged Tuesday with two counts of aggravated assault by a peace officer for shooting and gravely wounding a teen eating a hamburger in his car in a McDonald’s parking lot. The teen had begun driving away when the officer opened fire. James Brennand, 25, was charged in the Oct. 2 shooting of Erik Cantu, 17, according to a police statement. He turned himself in to police Tuesday night and remained in custody, said Police Chief William McManus. Cantu is still unconscious and on life support, his family said Tuesday. “There is no improvement in his condition,” the family said in a statement delivered by their lawyer, Brian Powers. “The last two days have been difficult, and we expect more difficulty ahead, but we remain hopeful.” Brennand, a rookie officer, reported the vehicle Cantu was sitting in had evaded him the night before during an attempted traffic stop. Brennand said he suspected the vehicle was stolen. In body camera footage released by police, Brennand opens the car door and tells Cantu to get out. The car drives backward with the door open, and the officer fires multiple times into the vehicle. He continues to shoot as the car drives away. Investigators quickly determined that the use of deadly force was unwarranted, and Brennand was fired.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Three children who were sexually abused by their father are accusing a state legislator and a prominent Salt Lake City law firm of conspiring with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to cover up the abuse, allowing it to go on for years. In a court filing in Cochise County, Arizona, made public Wednesday, the children of the late Paul Adams asked a judge for permission to add Republican Utah Rep. Merrill F. Nelson and law firm Kirton McConkie as defendants in their lawsuit against the church, widely known as the Mormon church. The suit accuses the church of failing to notify police or child welfare officials that Adams was abusing his older daughter. In 2010, Adams confessed to his bishop, John Herrod, that he had sexually abused his daughter, according to legal records. Herrod reported the abuse to a church “abuse help line” and was advised not to report it to police or child welfare officials. The abuse was kept secret, and Adams continued raping his older daughter and her younger sister for several years. Adams was later charged by federal officials with posting videos of the abuse on the internet. Herrod’s decision not to report came after speaking with Nelson, according to church records included as evidence in the case. Nelson was a shareholder at Kirton McConkie, which has more than 160 attorneys, according to its website. Nelson was one of several lawyers at the firm who routinely fielded calls made by bishops to the help line.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: A fired deputy sheriff who is the only candidate on the November ballot to become sheriff is continuing to insist he did nothing wrong when he was recorded on surveillance video kicking a handcuffed and shackled prisoner. John Grismore won the nomination of both Franklin County’s Republican and Democratic parties to have his name on the November ballot, but after the video became public in August, he was suspended and then fired. Now his bid to become sheriff has lost the support of both parties, which have thrown their support to a write-in candidate. Grismore said the kicks were needed to protect himself and two other deputies from the prisoner who had been spitting at them. “We were horrified by the video of John Grismore brutalizing a handcuffed detainee,” Franklin County Democratic chair Zach Sheffler said in an email. “Grismore has since been fired, condemned by both parties, and remains under criminal investigation. He cannot continue to credibly campaign for this office.” A state police criminal investigation continues and once completed will be referred to the county prosecutor for possible charges. Meanwhile, the current sheriff, who called the case “egregious,” referred the case to the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council, which could revoke Grismore’s certification as a law enforcement officer.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democratic U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria and GOP challenger Jen Kiggans tangled over federal spending, the economy and abortion restrictions during a combative debate Wednesday, as the two Navy veterans sought to present themselves as the best equipped to represent Virginia’s military-heavy 2nd Congressional District. Kiggans, a state senator, nurse practitioner and former Navy helicopter pilot, is trying to block Luria, a retired naval commander, from a third term representing the highly competitive district that could help determine party control of the U.S. House in next month’s midterm elections. In sometimes-fiery exchanges, the candidates offered vastly different perspectives on the state of America’s economy and the other’s record during the approximately hour-and-a-half debate hosted by the Hampton Roads Chamber at an oceanfront hotel. Luria called Kiggans “an election denier” who is “not fit to serve” because she has repeatedly refused to say plainly that President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. Kiggans has answered questions on the topic – including during an interview with the Associated Press – by simply acknowledging Biden resides in the White House; she declined to answer questions about the 2020 election in a brief exchange with reporters after the debate.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city will end its COVID-19 emergency proclamation at the end of October. Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement Tuesday that Seattle will lift its remaining COVID-19 emergency order to align with Gov. Jay Inslee’s decision to end the statewide state of emergency on Oct. 31. Inslee issued the state of emergency Feb. 29, 2020, after cases started increasing, and a death in Washington state was the first reported COVID-19 death in the nation. “While the impacts of the pandemic continue to be felt by our neighbors and communities, it is thanks to our city’s strong response – including our high vaccination rate and strong health care system – that we can continue moving toward recovery and revitalization,” Harrell said in the statement. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of public health experts and science leaders to support the safety and well-being of our communities.” Policies linked to the emergency order including premium pay for food delivery and network gig workers will end Nov. 1. Harrel lifted mask and other COVID-19 precautions in city buildings earlier this year. The City’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for employees and others will remain in effect.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: Thrill-seekers from around the world are heading to southern West Virginia for a bridge-jumping event that was called off the past two years due to the coronavirus pandemic. Saturday’s Bridge Day festival in Fayetteville is the one day each year that it’s legal to jump off the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge. Hundreds of BASE jumpers make the leap by parachuting off the bridge. BASE stands for the places from which jumpers usually leap: buildings, antennae, spans and earth. As many as 100,000 people are expected to walk across the bridge. Rappellers also will make their way down on a fixed rope from a catwalk under the bridge. Also available is a 700-foot-long zipline from the catwalk to a road below. The 3,030-foot-long bridge opened to traffic in October 1977. The festival is held on the third Saturday of October every year. Last year’s festival was canceled after a group representing parachutists said they wouldn’t jump off the nation’s third-highest bridge due to worries about sufficient emergency health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The event also was canceled in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court on Monday put on hold a lower court’s ruling from last week prohibiting voters from canceling their original absentee ballot and casting a new one, blocking at least temporarily the order sought by a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. The appeals court granted the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s request for a temporary stay while the court decided whether to hear the appeal on the practice known as ballot spoiling. The appeals court gave both sides until noon Wednesday to submit arguments. The legal fight comes as Wisconsin voters are returning absentee ballots for the Nov. 8 election. To date, just short of 110,000 absentee ballots have been returned, just over a quarter of the nearly 401,000 that were requested, according to the elections commission. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are both on the ballot in tight races. The order from the appeals court came as the elections commission was in closed session of an emergency meeting Monday called in part to react to the court ruling. The order from Waukesha County Circuit Judge Brad Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, required the elections commission to inform municipal clerks and local election officials by 7 p.m. Monday that its guidance on ballot spoiling issued Aug. 1 had been withdrawn.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s top elections official is asking county clerks to remove drop boxes for absentee ballots in next month’s election, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Karl Allred, Wyoming’s interim secretary of state, sent a letter Friday – three weeks after he stepped into the role – asking the clerks to consider the move in the future if not for the Nov. 8 vote. Allred cited “concern” with the ballot boxes. “I’m mindful of the fact that there have been no issues reported with the use of the drop boxes in Wyoming, but that does not alleviate the potential for abuse or destruction of ballots through use of fire or other means,” he wrote, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/14/malcolm-country-benefit-show-rising-tide-news-around-states/50734257/", "title": "Malcolm X, country benefit show: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state told a federal judge that it could soon be ready to use a new, untried execution method called nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/03/ballet-for-seniors-dr-fauci-boblehead-patrots-plane-ferries-95-masks-news-from-around-our-50-states/2938509001/", "title": "Ballet for seniors, Dr. Fauci bobblehead, Patriots' plane ferries N95 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/12/11/holiday-travel-check-covid-19-travel-restrictions-by-state/3878341001/", "title": "COVID travel restrictions by state: Holiday travel quarantine, tests", "text": "In response to a record number of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths, some states have reimposed stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions ahead of the winter holidays.\n\nMany Americans are considering whether to proceed with their Christmas, New Year's or other holiday trips as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging them not to travel and to get tested before and after if they do.\n\n\"Cases are rising.

Kay Ivey on Thursday and praised her for issuing a statewide mask mandate. Birx said she believes the order, which is set to expire Oct. 2, should be extended. “Within two weeks of the mask mandate, you can see the dramatic decline in cases here in Alabama,” Birx said. She said it is important for people to maintain their mitigation efforts in the fall. As Birx urged the extension of the mask order, a new lawsuit was filed challenging it. Former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore on Thursday announced a new federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the mask mandate and past state health orders that closed businesses or directed people to stay home. The lawsuit was filed by Moore’s Foundation for Moral Law on behalf of seven plaintiffs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Alaska Native corporations are not eligible to receive a share of the $8 billion in federal coronavirus relief funding set aside for tribes, a federal appeals court panel ruled Friday in overturning a lower-court decision. The three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit found an Alaska Native corporation cannot qualify as an Indian tribe under the federal Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act unless it has been “recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.” None have been recognized as such, according to the ruling. The decision parses the language from the 1975 law and delves into what it says have been shifting positions on the “political status” of Alaska Natives by the federal government since the Alaska Purchase of 1867.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: More than 120 Northern Arizona University students living in on-campus apartments had less than two weeks to move so the university could use their rooms to quarantine students exposed to COVID-19. Following the notice, some students said they were confused and frustrated when they learned they had to move a month after settling into the semester and felt the university did not take their welfare into consideration or plan ahead adequately. “Our well-being was not put into perspective nor was it heard out. We are now being forced out of our settled work environments and homes. Our compensation? $300 cash and an apology with moving boxes and people to help move us,” said an online petition created in response. University spokesperson Kimberly Ott said in an email that Campus Heights will be used as quarantine space and that students who received an email make up 2% of students currently living on campus.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of reported coronavirus cases in the state has topped 80,000 after the addition Saturday of 809 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, the Arkansas Department of Health reported. Those new cases brought the state’s total caseload since tracking of the pandemic began in March to 80,755, including 2,495 probable cases. Active cases rose by 165 to 7,414. There were also 19 COVID-19 deaths reported Saturday, bringing the state’s death toll to 1,285. Arkansas ranks third in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. A White House task force last week applauded the state’s mitigation efforts but said stronger compliance was needed. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said with the latest figures the test had exceeded its goal of 200,000 tests for the month, and the state was working to increase its testing capacity.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state has begun to see concerning upticks in coronavirus data after a sustained period of decline, the state’s top health official said Friday, urging people to renew efforts to prevent spread. The increases include the rate of cases per capita, hospital emergency department visits for COVID-19, and new hospitalizations for confirmed or suspected cases, California Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Mark Ghaly said. The trends appear to be attributable to gatherings and activities around the Labor Day holiday, Ghaly said. Other factors could include the recent reopening of businesses and massive wildfires that forced evacuations and millions to change their routines because of unhealthy air. Ghaly also said California will conduct its own independent review of potential COVID-19 vaccines, signaling its distrust of the Trump administration’s accelerated initiative.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Two Colorado State University residence halls were placed under quarantine Thursday night after high levels of COVID-19 were detected in their wastewater. Students living in Braiden and Summit halls were notified of the mandatory quarantine and the need to undergo mandatory testing for COVID-19 in messages from CSU President Joyce McConnell and the university’s pandemic response team. Residents were told they cannot leave the dorm or visit floors other than their own for any reason other than to pick up meals at a tent set up outside each dorm and for mobile COVID-19 testing outside the two buildings Saturday. CSU will make medical care available to students who are sick and develop symptoms, McConnell said. A CSU team has been working with city and state officials to monitor wastewater at various locations on campus and elsewhere in the city and region as an early indicator of potential outbreaks of the coronavirus.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Quinnipiac University has sent home or suspended more than 20 students in recent days for violating visitor and other policies, both on and off campus, that are aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, according to a top school official. Tom Ellett, the school’s chief experience officer, said in an email sent Thursday to students that 11 undergraduates have been sent home for four weeks, and a dozen off-campus students were suspended. He said they’ve been accused of violating the school’s no-visitor policy for residence halls, having non-Quinnipiac University guests on campus and/or exceeding capacity limits on indoor gatherings. As of Friday, there has been only one positive case of COVID-19 at the school. More than 11,500 tests have been conducted since Aug. 5. The university’s COVID-19 dashboard says the school is currently at low risk level for infection.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state has seen its 630th COVID-19-related death. The Delaware State News reports a Kent County man, 65, passed away. He had a known underlying health condition and was not a resident of a long-term health care facility. The Delaware Division of Public Health reported that the state’s total of virus cases is 19,947. That includes 57 people who are hospitalized. The state’s seven-day rolling average of percentage of positive tests decreased 2 percentage points to 6.6%. It was more than 7% for most of the previous week. For reference, the World Health Organization recommends a seven-day rolling average of 5% for the percent positive rate. The state has also reported 44 additional recoveries from the virus, bringing that total to 10,487.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a pilot that will allow a limited number of venues to host live entertainment during Phase 2 of D.C.’s reopening amid the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. The pilot creates an opportunity to resume live entertainment in a controlled environment that can be scaled up or down and from which district officials can learn for future guidance. According to officials, any participating venues are required to submit and execute detailed plans for operating under COVID-19 safety guidelines and will be monitored closely by the district. The pilot will go through 11:59 p.m. Oct. 30. In addition to the pilot, limited to six venues, the district is inviting operators of outdoor entertainment venues who have already submitted plans to the DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency through its waiver process to review the criteria for live entertainment and resubmit their plans.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis lifted all restrictions on restaurants and other businesses in the state Friday and banned local fines against people who refuse to wear masks as he seeks to reopen Florida’s economy despite the spread of the coronavirus. The Republican governor’s order unleashed fresh debate in the politically divided state, where pandemic responses have become intertwined with the upcoming presidential election. DeSantis, a major ally of President Donald Trump, acknowledged that the pandemic is far from over but said the threat has eased and the time has come to reopen for business after six months of “people twisting in the wind.” The governor’s announcement allows restaurants across the state to immediately reopen at full capacity and prevents cities and counties from ordering them to close or operate at less than half-capacity, unless they can justify a closure for economic or health reasons. “We’re not closing anything going forward,” DeSantis said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A Georgia woman is one of several property owners suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the CDC’s Sept. 1 moratorium on evictions. The case, filed earlier this month in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that the CDC order improperly denies landlords access to normal court processes. The federal agency, backed by President Donald Trump’s administration, says evictions would likely increase the spread of the COVID-19 respiratory illness. The lawsuit says Sonya Jones owns a rental property in Jesup in southeast Georgia. Among other plaintiffs are landlords from Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as the National Apartment Association, a landlord group. Jones tells WABE-FM she owns a chicken farm that produces eggs and has been buying rental homes over the past 22 years to provide a retirement income.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A state-owned health care organization will take over a veterans care home where 26 residents have died of the coronavirus. The arrangement announced Friday will see Hawaii Health Systems Corporation take over as the operators of Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home in Hilo. The previous operator, Utah-based Avalon Health Care, will relinquish all control over the facility. Avalon experienced additional outbreaks in June and August at its Hale Nani Rehabilitation and Nursing Center facility on Oahu, where 42 residents and 40 workers tested positive for the coronavirus. Five residents died of the disease. The veterans home has had a history of falling short on health standards. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave the home a health inspection rating of one star out of five.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: Three people have been arrested after a church held a maskless psalm singing event in a city hall parking lot in violation of the town’s mask order. Christ Church pastor and event organizer Ben Zornes said Wednesday’s event was intended at criticizing what he called “largely groundless” laws like the mask order issued by the Moscow City Council in an effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. “We wanted to make a statement we’re ready to head back to normal,” Zornes told the Moscow-Pullman Daily News. Five people were issued citations for violating the city’s mask and social distancing order, and two of them were also arrested on suspicion of resisting or obstructing an officer, said Moscow Police Chief James Fry. Most of those who attended the singing event didn’t wear masks or social distance, ignoring colorful circles that city workers had painted in the parking lot to indicate where people could stand to maintain social distance.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White has extended expiration dates for driver’s licenses another three months. White announced this week that expired licenses need to be renewed by Feb. 1, 2021. The previous extension was until Nov. 1. White extended the deadline to prevent the need for visiting a driver’s license facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those 75 and older need only ensure to renew driver’s licenses by their birthday in 2021. The extension for renewing driver’s license plate stickers remains Nov. 1. They can be renewed online. White continues to encourage motorists to conduct business on the secretary of state’s website to the extent possible. Other business that can be conducted online includes obtaining a duplicate driver’s license or ID card, obtaining a driving record abstract or renewing a standard driver’s license through the Safe Driver renewal program.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State health leaders say the wearing of face masks will be as important as ever to stem the coronavirus spread, even as most of the statewide restrictions imposed by the governor were lifted as of Saturday. The new executive order from Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb continues the mask mandate that has angered some conservatives around the state who maintain they won’t support his reelection over it. Holcomb’s order removes the 75% capacity limit for restaurants and the 50% limit that bars, movie theaters and other entertainment venues faced. But they must continue maintaining at least 6 feet between unrelated patrons, which could diminish capacity in many of those businesses. Limits on crowd sizes for social gatherings and meetings are being removed, but those who organize events with more than 500 people must submit a safety plan to health officials. The executive order dubs the regulations as the “new normal during a global pandemic.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state reported a jump of 1,086 new coronavirus cases Friday, the second consecutive day of new cases exceeding 1,000. Four more people died, pushing the state’s death toll from the virus to 1,303. Gov. Kim Reynolds on Friday signed a new emergency proclamation that continues bar closures in Johnson and Story counties, where the University of Iowa and Iowa State University are located, for at least another week. Data from state health and education departments indicate the virus is circulating in schools and nursing homes. East Sac County Superintendent Jeff Kruse said in a note posted on the district’s website that more than 80 students are in quarantine, and 15 more students and staff are awaiting test results. State health data shows 6,917 children under age 17 in Iowa have tested positive for the virus, an increase of more than 800 in a week. It also shows 3,372 educators testing positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state reported Friday that it had more than 1,300 newly confirmed coronavirus cases over two days, and most of the biggest spikes over the past two weeks occurred in rural counties in the central and western parts of the state. The state Department of Health and Environment said Kansas has had 56,592 confirmed and probable coronavirus cases, an increase of 1,366, or 2.5%, from Wednesday. The state saw an added average of 615 confirmed cases a day during the seven days ending Friday, a figure second only to the average of 622 for the seven days ending Wednesday. The health department also reported an additional 11 virus-related deaths over two days to bring the pandemic total to 632. The biggest spikes for the two weeks ending Friday were in Cheyenne and Pawnee counties. Cheryl Hoberecht, Pawnee County’s health officer, said most of its positive cases came from an outbreak at the Larned Correctional Mental Health Facility.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state saw a high daily total of new coronavirus cases for a second consecutive Saturday, with 973 new cases announced. Gov. Andy Beshear reported 1,002 cases last Saturday in one of the highest daily totals yet. The commonwealth has now seen 66,036 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The new cases Saturday included 132 in children under 19, including 18 kids under age 6. Beshear also announced five more deaths caused by the virus, bringing Kentucky’s total count to 1,154. “That’s five additional families who are suffering during this time,” Beshear said in a press release. Kentucky was on pace to have the single highest week of positive cases, the governor said. “We simply have to do better,” he said. “Please wear a mask. Sadly, sometimes I’m seeing less of these out there than more. This will save lives.” The rate for positive tests over the past seven days was 4.42% as of Saturday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will start borrowing money from the federal government in early October to keep paying benefits to jobless workers, as Louisiana’s once-healthy unemployment trust fund is nearly empty because of the coronavirus outbreak, labor department officials said Friday. Lawmakers meeting in a special session that starts next week are scrambling for financing options to refill the fund that topped $1 billion before the pandemic, rather than relying on federal loans long term. The fund balance Friday hovered around $49 million, and the fund is expected to run dry the week of Oct. 5. Senate President Page Cortez and House Speaker Clay Schexnayder refused Friday to officially acknowledge the near-bankruptcy of the trust fund in a state forecasting meeting. That formal recognition would, in 2021, trigger increased taxes for business that pay into the fund and a drop in jobless benefits for unemployed workers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state Department of Education has downgraded another county’s schools from green to yellow because of an outbreak of the coronavirus. Oxford County joined York County with yellow rankings Friday. The rest of Maine’s counties have a “green” ranking indicating low coronavirus risk. Oxford County is dealing with an outbreak associated with a paper mill, and York County is still dealing with an outbreak in Sanford. Education and health officials said they’re also closely monitoring Androscoggin County, as well. “These changes are made out of an abundance of caution and for the consideration of school administrative units in their decisions to deliver instruction,” the administration said. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported an additional 20 cases of coronavirus Friday, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases to 5,235 cases in Maine since the pandemic started.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State health surveyors who’ve been visiting nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic are not required to be tested for the virus. The Baltimore Sun reports the lack of such a requirement concerns some in that industry. “We have long advocated for the state to require the testing of health care inspectors, the same way they require testing of those who provide the health care,” said Joseph DeMattos Jr., president of the Health Facilities Association of Maryland, which represents some of the centers. “They are going to multiple centers at the same time we are telling operators to discourage employees from working at more than one center.” Charles Gischlar, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health, confirmed that the surveyors are not tested by the state. But he said the surveyors “are screened upon entry to the office,” he said. The department would not disclose whether any surveyors had self-reported positive tests.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Inmates at all state prisons are being allowed in-person visitors again. The state Department of Correction in a statement Thursday said in-person visits would resume Monday at all its facilities. Visits were suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, although some minimum-security and pre-release centers started allowing visitors in July. Starting Monday, visits must be scheduled in advance, and prisoners will be limited to one visit per week, up to two people at a time. Visitors will undergo a health screening, and visitors and inmates will be required to wear face coverings. Barriers will be placed between visitors and inmates, and no physical contact will be permitted. The agency said it has had just four inmate COVID-19 cases at its facilities since July 1, all of whom contracted the virus before incarceration. The new rules do not affect attorneys visting clients.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Friday that movie theaters and other venues can reopen in two weeks after nearly seven months of closure during the coronavirus pandemic, and she relaxed a cap so more people can attend funerals and other indoor events. The governor also issued an order requiring students in kindergarten through fifth grade – not just those in sixth grade and up – to wear masks in classrooms outside northern Michigan beginning Oct. 5. She mandated that public and private schools publish information about confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases. Masks continue to be required in school hallways, in common areas and on buses. Indoor cinemas, performance venues, arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor climbing facilities and trampoline parks – which have been operating in less-populated northern counties since June – can reopen statewide starting Oct. 9 with occupancy requirements to allow social distancing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials have stopped a COVID-19 testing study after multiple reports that state and federal public health workers were greeted by racial and ethnic slurs as they went door-to-door. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pulled federal surveyors out of Minnesota last week after they experienced verbal abuse and intimidation. In Eitzen, along the Iowa border, one survey team was boxed in by two cars and threatened by three men, one with a gun. “The team felt the intent was clearly to intimidate and scare them,” said Stephanie Yendell, who supervised Minnesota’s role in the survey. The survey teams were going to 180 neighborhoods this month to offer free testing for COVID-19 and for antibodies and to try to understand how the virus was spreading, particularly among people with no known symptoms. Yendell said teams that included people of color reported more incidents than teams with only white people.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The University of Mississippi Medical Center is offering free COVID-19 testing for college and university students, staff and faculty at locations around the state. According to a University of Mississippi Medical Center release, testing will be available on scheduled days at the Mississippi Department of Health’s county locations throughout Mississippi. The drive-thru location at the West Street Farmer’s Market in Jackson will offer testing Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. In addition to that group, workers from licensed child care centers, K-12 teachers, and staff and administrators at public or private schools may come for testing regardless of whether they are presenting symptoms of COVID-19 or have come into contact with an infected person. Appointments are required to be tested. Any other resident can be tested but must complete a questionnaire to determine if they have symptoms.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri has disciplined an additional 20 current or former students with suspensions, probation or other sanctions for what it called “egregious violations” of policies meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 on campus. All the violations were for hosting gatherings of more than 20 people in violation of the Boone County public health order, the university said Friday in a news release. Five students were suspended for the rest of the academic year, 14 were placed on probation for two consecutive semesters and given additional sanctions, and one former student will not be able to enroll until the violations are addressed. The school earlier this month expelled or suspended five students for violations of safety policies amid coronavirus pandemic. Bill Stackman, vice chancellor for Student Affairs, said the university is “extremely pleased” that the vast majority of students are complying with policies.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council on Thursday authorized a mandatory 14-day shutdown of its reservation, beginning Sunday at midnight. The announcement came the same day the Blackfeet Nation reported 83 active COVID-19 cases on its reservation. As of Friday morning, the tribe reported 90 cases on the reservation. The tribe said public health officials recommended a two-week shutdown due to a high infection rate. Law enforcement will cite and fine people who do not comply, according to a news release. “This is a critical point in our time. (COVID-19) is not going to go away. ... The vaccine isn’t here, and we are heading into flu season,” Tribal Chair Tim Davis said in a Facebook live video last Monday, when he urged tribal members to stay home, practice social distancing and wash their hands.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: State public health officials have confirmed 453 new cases of the coronavirus but no new deaths, according to the latest available data. The total number of known cases has reached 42,731 as of Thursday evening, according to the state’s online tracking portal. Of those cases, 462 people have died since the pandemic began. Nearly 438,000 people have been tested so far. Despite the increase, the number of available hospital beds has remained stable. State officials say 33% of Nebraska’s hospital beds, 27% of its intensive care unit beds and 80% of its ventilators are still available for coronavirus patients if needed.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Friday that he will be modifying the current restrictions on group gatherings and youth sports this week in response to changing coronavirus trends. Sisolak’s administration did not provide any details on what those changes will be but said the governor will hold a press conference to publicize the modifications. “Under the governor’s direction, state officials with expertise in public health and oversight have been working over the past weeks with his office to review current Statewide Standards and develop updates that will allow Nevada to continue lifting restrictions in a safe and responsible manner,” spokeswoman Meghin Delaney said in a press release. “This has included outreach to businesses, industry groups, faith leaders and more.” Under Sisolak’s current directive, gatherings of 50 or more people are prohibited. Youth sports are allowed to practice outside, but tournaments and games are prohibited.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Nursing homes in the state will be in charge of testing their staff for the coronavirus starting next month. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services has been operating a surveillance testing program in long-term care facilities but in mid-October will start transitioning that to individual facilities, Commissioner Lori Shibinette said. The state is recommending facilities test all staff during the same week once a month and then every other week test 10% of staff chosen at random. The state will reimburse them at $100 per test, she said. Having the nursing homes run their own programs will allow the state to start similar surveillance programs elsewhere, including in assisted living communities and correctional facilities, Shibinette said. As many as 20 New Hampshire nursing homes once were dealing with coronavirus outbreaks at the same time, but now there is only one facility with an outbreak.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic: The city firefighters union filed a lawsuit against the city and state over their handling of the pandemic, saying scores of firefighters have been exposed to the coronavirus. The Press of Atlantic City reports lawyers for Local 198 allege in a complaint in Atlantic County Superior Court that the “ineffective approach” of government officials to containing the virus’s spread has jeopardized the health and safety of firefighters, their families and the public. The suit says the number of city firefighters exposed to the coronavirus has ballooned to about 65. The union is calling for those exposed to be placed on paid leave and to self-quarantine for 14 days and for stations to be disinfected between shifts. On Friday, the union posted an “urgent” warning on Facebook to “residents, businesses and visitors” that firefighters directly exposed to the virus would be responding to their calls for service.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The number of tips law enforcement has received about adults making online sexual solicitations toward children has doubled since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the state, an expert on human trafficking told a legislative committee Thursday. “We’ve seen a huge increase (in tips) over the past couple of years and specifically during the pandemic when schools began sending children home,” Anthony Maez, a special agent for the state Attorney General’s Office, told members of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee. He said the amount of cyber tips to his agency has doubled from 100 to 200 per month “because more children have access to (computer) devices. That’s definitely a concern for us because those children are being enticed.” Rep. Tara Lujan, D-Santa Fe, said after the hearing that Maez’s comments serve as a “red flag for schools to get involved and get some training.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Expanded outdoor dining for New York City restaurants will be extended year-round and made permanent, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The program allowing restaurants to seat customers on sidewalks and parking spaces has been seen as a lifeline for cash-strapped businesses trying to survive through the pandemic. More than 10,000 restaurants are taking part in the program. “I want us to really take this model and make it part of the life of New York City for years and generations to come,” de Blasio said on WNYC public radio. With cooler weather coming, the city will allow electrical heaters on sidewalks and streets as well as propane and natural gas heaters on sidewalks. Restaurants also will be able to use partially or fully enclosed tents. Occupancy will be limited to 25% in full tent enclosures, mirroring rules for indoor dining.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The coronavirus pandemic continues to cause economic hardship for some of the state’s universities. The Raleigh News & Observer reports N.C. State has announced new employee furloughs and salary cuts. And administrators at the University of North Carolina warned of similar actions as revenues drop. Leaders at N.C State said temporary furloughs and salary cuts are the result of a “sharp reduction in revenue” this fall in areas that include university housing, campus dining facilities and transportation. The school in Raleigh shifted to online learning and closed dorms this fall. So far this semester, revenue is down $75.4 million, a 61% drop for affected departments. UNC is facing potential revenue losses of $300 million this fiscal year. It has been trying to save money by limiting new hires and restricting spending on events and travel. There also have been some furloughs and salary reductions.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Dr. Paul Mariani resigned as the top state health officer Friday, one day after Gov. Doug Burgum reversed himself and rescinded a new order that would have enforced quarantines for close contacts of coronavirus patients. The announcement from Burgum’s office included a comment from Mariani that the way the new order was dropped made it impossible for him to continue as interim state health officer. He became the third person to resign the position since May. The upheaval comes as North Dakota battles one of the nation’s highest per-capita rates of spread of the COVID-19 virus. The Republican governor had described Mariani’s expanded order Wednesday as bringing the state in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in a statement late Thursday announcing the order was rescinded, Burgum said the state needs a “light touch” from government in managing the virus.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state has surpassed 150,000 cases of COVID-19 during the pandemic. The Ohio Department of Health reported 1,115 new cases of coronavirus in the state Saturday, bringing the total number of cases to 150,009. There were six deaths, increasing the state’s coronavirus death toll to 4,740. Hospitalizations increased by 58, bringing the total number of hospitalizations to 15,185. Another four patients admitted to intensive care units were reported Saturday. There have been 3,247 Ohioans total in the ICU.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city’s public school district announced Friday it is returning to distance learning for at least two weeks and canceling indoor athletics amid a continued rise in coronavirus cases. In an email to parents, district officials say they made the decision after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased from 15.8 per 100,000 population the week before last to 26.2 cases last week. All athletics and extracurricular events and practices will be canceled until further notice beginning Monday. Oklahoma currently ranks fifth in the nation for the number of new cases per capita in the past 14 days, according to data from Johns Hopkins. The number of deaths in Oklahoma from the illness caused by the new coronavirus topped 1,000, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Saturday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon Health Authority reported 457 new confirmed COVID-19 cases Friday – the state’s largest daily total since the start of the pandemic. Officials attributed the rise in cases to Labor Day gatherings, the return of college students to campus and the interruption of testing during recent wildfires in Oregon. “Today we find ourselves at another crossroads,” Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen said. “After weeks of steady decline in COVID-19, cases have begun rising.” For six weeks, Oregon’s COVID-19 cases and rate of transmission were heading down. However, Allen said the most recent data provided by the Oregon Health Authority shows that the percentage of positive tests has increased from 5.6% to 6.2% and hospitalizations increased by 28%, revealing “how fragile our progress against the virus is.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A day before a rally in Middletown, Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday accused President Donald Trump of blatantly disregarding social distancing and mask requirements during his frequent campaign rallies in the battleground state, calling it dangerous and disappointing. Wolf, a Democrat, criticized Trump in a strongly worded statement and asked the Republican president to ensure Saturday’s rally would abide by guidance designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus. While Wolf’s mask order still stands, a federal judge – a Trump appointee – recently ruled that Wolf’s pandemic restrictions, including size limits on gatherings of people, are unconstitutional. Those limitations had been 250 people outdoors and 25 people indoors. Wolf is appealing it, and the state attorney general’s office filed paperwork Friday with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia asking it to put the district judge’s ruling on hold.\n\nRhode Island\n\nKingston: The University of Rhode Island has joined a growing number of U.S. colleges canceling spring break to reduce travel and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. University officials announced the measure Friday evening, a week after the Faculty Senate approved the change, according to The Providence Journal. It was also supported by university President David Dooley. Classes will continue from March 22 to 28, the period originally set aside as spring break, and the semester will end April 27, a week earlier than initially planned. In a statement announcing the change, officials cited “uncertainty” created by the virus “and the need to prepare for the likely persistence of existing outbreaks and potential for a new wave of infections.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: For the second time in a week, state health officials said a lab failed to report thousands of COVID-19 tests over several months. Urgent care clinic chain Doctors Care reported the results of more than 7,000 COVID-19 tests from July through last week. About 400 of them were positive, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said in a news release Friday. The delay in testing both prevents the agency from tracing any contacts that a person testing positive had and prevents DHEC from getting an accurate picture of the spread of a virus on a particular day, the agency said. The health agency reminded labs they are required to report COVID-19 test results to the state within 24 hours or face punishment if they repeatedly delay. South Carolina continues to rank in the top 10 in the nation in new COVID-19 cases adjusted by population, and a monthlong decline in new cases stopped in late August.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The coronavirus is infecting more women in the state’s prison system in Pierre, despite efforts to control an outbreak, with the Department of Corrections reporting Friday that mass testing had detected 51 additional women with the virus. The infections have spread into two housing units at the main women’s prison after a nearby minimum-security prison called the Pierre Community Work Center saw 102 cases last week. The Department of Corrections had tried to contain the outbreak to that prison by moving women with the virus there, but the latest report from the prison system showed four prison units with active cases. In total, 172 inmates in Pierre have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, 93 of whom have recovered, according to the Department of Corrections.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A week after Gov. Bill Lee wrote to the mayor criticizing his management of federal coronavirus relief funding, Tennessee’s House speaker is now seeking to take the city’s leader to task, prompting Democrats to call the effort a “witch hunt.” House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, on Thursday wrote to the state comptroller of the treasury, Justin Wilson, asking that his office conduct a “thorough review” of how Nashville has spent federal COVID-19 relief money. In the letter, Sexton noted how Mayor John Cooper, despite receiving $121 million in direct federal funding to help with pandemic-related expenses, recently asked Lee for $82 million from the state’s share of federal aid. The letter was also signed by other members of House Republican leadership.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State health officials reported 3,283 new cases Saturday of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, along with 121 new deaths from the illness. The newly reported cases raised the total number of cases since tracking of the virus started in March to 733,438, with an estimated 68,373 cases now active and 3,209 of those requiring hospitalization, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported. However, the true number of cases is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Meanwhile, the Texas death toll for the outbreak rose to 15,485.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: An outbreak at a homeless shelter has resulted in 72 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, officials reported. The rapid increase in cases at the Gail Miller Resource Center in Salt Lake City coincides with a rise in cases in the state as a whole. Utah reported 1,404 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Thursday, up from 306 new confirmed cases Sept. 8. There are currently 93 confirmed cases in Salt Lake City-area homeless shelters, officials said. Homeless people are thought to be more vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus than the general population because those who live in encampments typically have limited access to hygienic services and find themselves in cramped rooms packed with dozens of others, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A system to provide child care to the state’s children during the COVID-19 pandemic so parents can return to work on days their children aren’t in school is continuing to expand, officials said Friday. Speaking at Gov. Phil Scott’s regular virus briefing Friday, Holly Morehouse of the organization Vermont Afterschool says that in just over four weeks, they have established 35 hubs in 87 locations serving more than 5,000 children from almost 110 towns and more than 130 schools. The system was designed by officials at after-school programs, parks and recreation departments, child care centers, and others working with state officials. “We knew that after months of being out of school, children needed access to programming opportunities to play and learn with others in safe, caring spaces,” Morehouse said. “We also knew that parents and family members needed to be able to return to work.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam announced Friday that he and his wife have both tested positive for the coronavirus, though he said he is showing no symptoms. He’s among four governors around the country who have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, but one of the others turned out to be a false positive. Northam and his wife, who has mild symptoms, plan to isolate for the next 10 days, and the governor will fulfill his duties while working remotely, according to a statement from his office. The Democrat, the country’s only governor who is also a doctor, has previously been criticized by some Republican lawmakers who say his restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus are too stringent. Northam said in a statement that his test result shows the virus is “very real and very contagious.”\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: Kitsap Public Health officials are investigating a handful of new COVID-19 cases among CHI Franciscan employees, including two staff members at St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, though health officials say they are not linked to an earlier outbreak at the hospital. CHI Franciscan officials reported Wednesday that two employees at the Franciscan Medical Group cardiothoracic clinic in Bremerton tested positive for COVID-19, along with two cases among staff at St. Michael hospital, formerly known as Harrison Medical Center. The employees at the cardiothoracic clinic were infected after “interacting with a patient” who entered the facility for testing before a procedure and was found to be positive for the virus, CHI Franciscan said in a public statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston won’t accept Gov. Jim Justice’s offer to allow private and religious schools to reopen in “orange” counties – based on their rating on the state’s color-coded COVID-19 map – if students and staff get tested for the new coronavirus. Diocese spokesman Tom Bishop gave several reasons for the decision, including an opposition to forcing students and staff to take coronavirus tests, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Bishop said five schools are not allowed to have in-person instruction because their counties are orange on Justice’s color-coded school reopening map. Justice provided the exemption to private and religious schools Wednesday, only if they agree to pre-test students and staff. Public schools in orange counties are not being offered the same choice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state on Saturday hit a record for coronavirus cases reported in a single day as health officials said 2,817 more people have tested positive for the virus. The state has seen some of the nation’s fastest coronavirus spread over the past two weeks. The rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 950, an increase of nearly 97%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. In that time, the state has reported the nation’s third-highest number of new cases per capita, with about 423 per 100,000 people. In another troubling trend, the positivity rate for coronavirus testing has also been among the country’s highest. That’s an indicator that many more people have infections than tests are revealing. The seven-day positivity rate is currently over 17%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Saturday’s positivity rate for testing was even higher at 22%.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state is planning on adding seating capacity at restaurants after current coronavirus restrictions expire Sept. 30, Gov. Mark Gordon said. The announcement came one day after the state reported its highest number of new confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began with a record 137 on Wednesday, the state Department of Health said. The number of new cases again grew by more than 100 on Thursday. “One place we are not seeing large numbers of cases emerge is from restaurants, so we are looking at expanding the seating capacity of restaurants,” Gordon said. “We want to ensure those businesses can adjust to the coming fall and winter, when outdoor dining will be more difficult.” State Public Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said the state was also planning on easing restrictions on visitations to long-term care facilities, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/30/obamas-break-ground-missing-zebras-planet-word-bathrooms-news-around-states/119000794/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBrighton: Police have recovered a horse-drawn carriage that was stolen from a church parking lot near Birmingham ahead of a funeral. The carriage and the trailer it was on were found Monday behind a home about 20 miles from the church in Brighton where it was taken, al.com reported. Brighton Police Chief Larry Woods told the news site multiple people are in custody in connection with the theft. The owner of the carriage, Frank Tate, said it was valued at more than $15,000. His company, Magic Tours, provides carriages for funerals, downtown Birmingham tours and other special occasions. Tate told al.com he left the carriage in the parking lot of St. Mark AME Church to pick up horses. He planned to use it later on Saturday to take a family to a funeral, but when he returned about 9 a.m., it was gone. He said the carriage would be hard to hide. “It’s a distinctive carriage,’’ Tate said. “Nobody else around here has carriages.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. prosecutors have charged three men with leaving a special viewing platform and getting too close to bears in Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve. The U.S. attorney’s office filed charges last week in the August 2018 incident. Spokesperson Lisa Houghton said the office doesn’t discuss the timing of cases. “Every case is unique, and it takes varying amounts of time to bring forth criminal charges,” she said by email. The remote park on the northern Alaska Peninsula protects some of the highest densities of bears in the world and requires visitors to abide by special rules. Mature male brown bears at Katmai can weigh up to 900 pounds, the park said. The charges alleged the men entered a closed area of the park by leaving an authorized viewing area and wading into the Brooks River when bears were feeding on salmon in the nearby falls. The U.S. attorney’s office said two of the men are from Alaska and one is from New Mexico. An online court records system did not show attorneys for the men who could comment on their behalf.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed former television broadcaster Kari Lake in the Republican race for governor. Trump retains a strong following among many Republicans and his endorsement catapults the former news anchor into clear front-runner status in the crowded GOP primary field. Lake is a political newcomer who left her job in March and launched her bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 2022 in June. She had been widely seen as a possible candidate and has criticized a media landscape that she contends needs more balance.Trump announced his endorsement via email because he remains banned from Twitter and other social media sites following the Jan. 6 incidents at the U.S. Capitol. He said Lake is strong on crime, the border and supports gun rights. He also took a shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who is term-limited. Using the expression for “Republican in name only,” Trump said “she will do a far better job than RINO Governor Doug Ducey.” Ducey certified President Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona over Trump last year despite pressure from the former president to overturn the election results.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he allowed the state’s public health emergency for the coronavirus pandemic to end, saying he didn’t need any additional powers to respond to it. Hutchinson told reporters he didn’t seek an extension from the Legislature for the emergency, which expired Monday. But Hutchinson cautioned that the state is still feeling the effects of COVID-19, which the Health Department on Tuesday said had claimed another 21 lives in the state. “I need to emphasize that we are still in a pandemic. We still have 20 plus people dying every day because of COVID,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news conference. “Just because the technical emergency was not extended does not mean we’re not still in a very serious situation with the pandemic and the actions we need to take.” Arkansas lifted most of its virus restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate, and ended its emergency declaration last spring. But Hutchinson in July reinstated the emergency as the state saw a surge in cases due to the delta variant of the virus. The Health Department said the state’s death toll from COVID-19 now totals 7,651. The state reported its cases rose by 800 to 493,920 total since the pandemic began.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State Treasurer Fiona Ma repeatedly shared hotel rooms with employees, a practice she said saved money but that business experts contend crosses an ethical line and can lead to lawsuits like one Ma now faces, the Sacramento Bee reported Tuesday. Judith Blackwell, the former head of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, sued Ma in July, alleging sexual harassment, racial discrimination and wrongful termination. Ma said the allegations are without merit. Records obtained by the Bee show Ma shared a hotel room with her chief of staff, Genevieve Jopanda, 13 times over two years. She also stayed with four other aides at a three-bedroom property on a trip. There’s no policy in the state’s human resources manual on whether managers and staff can share hotel rooms. Ma said her work as state treasurer frequently requires her and aides to travel across the state and that the hotel rooms were shared to save money.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverthorne: The residents of several hundred homes have been evacuated or warned to be ready to leave because of a wildfire burning in Colorado’s north-central mountains. Evacuations were first ordered Monday night near Silverthorne shortly after the fire was reported on U.S. Forest Service land. The Ptarmigan Fire was burning on about 60 acres around midday Tuesday, after growing about 40 acres overnight, an amount which surprised officials, Dillon District Ranger Adam Bianchi said, the Summit Daily News reported. Air tankers and a helicopter were initially used to try to slow the fire’s growth and prevent it from moving downhill toward residential areas because it was considered too dangerous to send in firefighters on the ground. Officials have some hope that forecasted cooler weather in the mountains, where it has been dropping below freezing at night, and possible rain and snow in the coming days will also help.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate voted Tuesday to extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency powers for the sixth time during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite pushback from Republican lawmakers who argued the state is no longer in crisis. “It all needs to end,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “No one can deny that there’s no public health emergency and that individual, local and legislative powers must be restored.” Yet Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said state legislators have a “much stronger reason” to extend the public health and civil preparedness emergencies than back in July, the last time Lamont’s powers were extended until Sept. 30. He noted how the state’s COVID positivity rate and number of hospitalizations have increased since then because of the delta variant. The resolution to extend the governor’s powers until Feb. 15 passed 18-15 on Tuesday with two Democrats joining the Republicans in opposition. Three senators were absent. The vote came day after the House of Representatives voted 80-60 in favor of extending Lamont’s renewed declaration of public health and civil preparedness emergencies until early February, when the General Assembly’s regular legislative session is scheduled to open. Democrats control both chambers.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: All teachers and school staff in Delaware will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. The requirement announced by Carney, the Division of Public Health and Department of Education will be formally issued by emergency regulation and takes effect Nov. 1. The requirement also applies to contractors and volunteers who work in K-12 public and private schools. The top priority has been to get all students back in school this fall and the mandate will help minimize disruptions, Carney said in a statement. “There’s no better way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and keep all Delaware children in their classrooms, than to get vaccinated,” Carney said. “These vaccines are safe and extremely protective against COVID-19 infection and serious illness. I encourage all Delawareans to get your shot and help us finally put an end to this pandemic.” The Delaware State Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, supports the decision and urges members to get vaccinated, according to a statement from President Stephanie Ingram. The union’s goal is to keep educators and students in school while protecting their health, Ingram said. Since some have concerns about the vaccine, weekly testing is a “reasonable alternative,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The city’s new Planet Word museum is being lauded for its lavatories, WUSA-TV reported. Cintas, the cleaning product and services company, selected 10 places across the country for the cleanest, most innovative commodes, and Planet Word is among the finalists. “Planet Word is flush with bathroom humor,” said founder Ann Friedman, reading a slogan from one of the walls. She has a bit of a potty mouth. “Here’s our take on Shakespeare. ‘Farting is such sweet sorrow,’” she said, opening a stall and revealing the slogan painted behind a porcelain throne.The toilets on the second floor of the downtown museum are ripe with ribald literary references. “To pee or not to pee, that is the question,” is emblazoned in another stall. Then there’s “If at first you don’t succeed, flush, flush again.” and “I stink, therefore I am.” The museum has five floors, with restrooms on each, each with its own theme. “Here we have euphemisms for No. 1 and No. 2,” she said on the main floor. They include: “Take a whiz”...and others maybe we shouldn’t mention. Even Friedman’s a little embarrassed by some of the bathroom humor. Although when she was looking for donors, the phrase, “Take the Browns to the Super Bowl,” may have helped her close the deal with a guy from Ohio.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A group of South Florida businessmen sued the federal government Monday in hopes of overturning a gambling agreement Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed with the Seminole Tribe. The suit filed against the Department of the Interior in federal court in Washington claims the agreement illegally expands gambling in Florida. Among the plaintiffs are developer Armando Codina and car dealer Norman Braman. The department approved the deal in August. It allows the Seminole Tribe to operate sports betting and add roulette and craps to its seven Florida casinos, with the state potentially receiving $20 billion over the next 30 years. But the lawsuit claimed that the state constitution requires voters approve an expansion of gambling. The state Legislature approved the deal in May. It is the second suit filed challenging the gambling compact.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Logistics company Radial Inc. plans to hire 4,000 entry-level workers outside Atlanta this year ahead of the busy holiday season, the company announced Tuesday. The new employees will work out of two Atlanta-area fulfillment centers – one in Locust Grove and one in Buford – to process online orders from various different brands, Radial said in a news release. The company then plans to promote more than one-third of the seasonal employees to full-time positions, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. According to the statement, research conducted by Radial shows that 65% of shoppers plan to spend either increased or similar amounts of money on online purchases this year compared to 2020. The site director of the Locust Grove fulfillment center, Eric Narvaez, did not disclose how much the positions would be paid but said the pay would be similar to that of other large companies like Home Depot and Amazon, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. regulators on Tuesday banned swimming with Hawaii’s spinner dolphins to protect the nocturnal animals from people seeking close encounters with the playful species. Swimming with dolphins is a popular tourist activity in Hawaii. Several companies offer tours that take swimmers to areas frequented by dolphins with the aim of giving them an opportunity to get in the water with the animals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule under the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits swimming with or getting within 50 yards of a spinner dolphin that is within 2 nautical miles of the shore of the main Hawaiian Islands. The rule applies to boats, canoes, stand-up paddleboards, drones or other objects. NOAA also is proposing a regulation that would prohibit entering certain areas between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. in parts of the Big Island and Maui that are considered essential daytime habitats for spinner dolphins. Spinner dolphins hunt in offshore waters at night. During the day, they use areas close to shore that have optimal environmental conditions to socialize, nurture their young, hide from predators and rest in preparation for nightly hunting. Hawaii’s spinner dolphins get their name from their habit of leaping in the air and spinning around. Some scientists say such behavior is not always playfulness and can instead be an attempt to alert others to danger.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Schools should set up confidential tip lines that can be used by students and others to report concerning behavior as a way to prevent school shootings, a report reviewing an eastern Idaho school shooting said. That’s one of 29 recommendations in the report released Monday by the Idaho State Board of Education following a school shooting at Rigby Middle School in May. Authorities said a sixth grade girl injured two other students and a custodian after pulling a handgun from her backpack and firing multiple rounds inside and outside the school. She was ultimately disarmed by a teacher. The report said students saw behavioral changes in the accused attacker, but that didn’t come to light until after the shooting. The report, made by the School Safety and Security Program, noted that the behavior change was not apparent to school staff because the girl was in her first year at Rigby Middle School after moving up from elementary school. The same school had another incident last week when authorities said a 13-year-old girl brought a gun to school, but was disarmed by a school resource officer in the bathroom, and no one was injured. Immediately after that incident, Jefferson School District Superintendent Chad Martin banned backpacks at two middle schools and two high schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After five years of legal fights, gentrification concerns and a federal review, Barack and Michelle Obama dug shovels into the ground Tuesday during a celebratory groundbreaking on the Obama Presidential Center. Construction on the center along Lake Michigan, near the Obama family home and where the former president started his political career on Chicago’s South Side, officially began last month. Standing near an excavator and other heavy equipment, Obama described how the city’s South Side shaped him, first as a community organizer, then as a husband, father and elected official. He said the center was one way of giving back and he hoped it would bring an economic boost to the area and inspire a future generation of leaders. “We want this center to be more than a static museum or a source of archival research. It won’t just be a collection of campaign memorabilia or Michelle’s ballgowns, although I know everybody will come see those,” he joked. “It won’t just be an exercise in nostalgia or looking backwards. We want to look forward.” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and several city aldermen were among the few people allowed at the event, which was streamed online to limit crowds amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The presidential center will sit on 19 acres of the 540-acre of Jackson Park, named for the nation’s seventh president, Andrew Jackson.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: A historical marker has been dedicated in western Indiana in remembrance of a Black man lynched about 120 years ago by a white mob. George Ward’s descendants, Terre Haute residents and Mayor Duke Bennett were among those at Sunday’s ceremony in Fairbanks Park, the (Terre Haute) Tribune-Star reported. George Ward was arrested in 1901 in the slaying of a white teacher, Ida Finkelstein. The mob took him from the Vigo County Jail and struck him in the head with a sledgehammer, said Terry Ward, adding that the attackers grabbed his great-grandfather along a bridge and bystanders pelted him with sticks. “Imagine the pain and the fear and no one comes to your aid,” Terry Ward told those at the dedication. George Ward then was hanged from a former wagon bridge. His body later was cut down and burned. “George Ward was denied due process for a crime for which he was accused,” Terry Ward said. “He was killed by a mob that acted as judge, jury and executioner.” The dedication was part of the national Community Remembrance Project, which recognizes lynching victims.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The longtime president of the Des Moines police officers’ union sent explicit photos to four female colleagues but retired before he could face discipline and wasn’t criminally charged, the city confirmed late Tuesday. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, four Des Moines Police Department employees alleged that they were sent unsolicited photos by Des Moines Police Bargaining Unit Association President Stew Barnes in 2019 and 2020, including many of himself naked. The department let Barnes, 61, retire in August 2020 with full benefits despite “overwhelming evidence” of his harassment of co-workers and employees of a tanning salon and a credit union, the lawsuit claimed. Department leaders recognized him at a retirement banquet in October 2020. Iowa law allows the state pension system to deny retirement benefits to members who are not “in good standing,” including those who face pending disciplinary proceedings for misconduct. The lawsuit argued that Barnes should have been disqualified from benefits and faced a criminal investigation, alleging he was using police resources “to find and stalk women” and that his victims were ready to cooperate. A statement through the city manager’s office defended the department and the city’s handling of the internal investigation but did not explain the lack of a criminal investigation. Barnes confirmed to have sent the inappropriate photos and resigned his job before the inquiry concluded, the statement said. Police Chief Dana Wingert later determined the misconduct occurred and that it would have been a fireable offense.\n\nKansas\n\nSanta Fe:John Freeman Colt, a convicted sex offender who escaped June 30 from Larned State Hospital, was captured Monday night in Wayne County, Utah. Colt’s arrest came after residents recognized him from a wanted poster they saw on TV and contacted the U.S. Marshals Service and the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office, the marshals service said in a news release Tuesday. “As sheriff’s deputies were staging in a parking lot near the target house, they saw Colt roll by on his blue motorcycle and gave chase,” the marshals service said. “Colt eventually decided to give up.” Colt was being held Tuesday in Utah awaiting his return to Kansas, according to the news release.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State police said new regional driver testing branches have been created in Madisonville and Owensboro. The Madisonville office serves Caldwell, Crittenden, Hopkins, McLean, Muhlenberg and Webster counties, and the Owensboro site is for residents of Daviess, Hancock, and Ohio counties. Gov. Andy Beshear said the regional testing locations offer more efficient services. Driver testing was offered starting Monday in both locations. Appointments can be made online and are available Monday through Friday at the state police website. Appointments are required for a permit, driver’s license or commercial driver’s license test. Officials are working to open the remaining regional offices statewide by June 30.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Five people were injured in an explosion at a chemical plant, news outlets reported. The explosion at the Westlake petrochemical plant near Lake Charles was reported late Monday night, Louisiana State Police spokesman Derek Senegal said. He said five workers were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not immediately known. A fire at the site is now out, and the cause of the blast is under investigation. KPLC-TV reported that the unit where the explosion occurred is used in the production of ethylene and was undergoing maintenance at the time.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The owner of four hydroelectric dams on the Kennebec River sued two Maine agencies alleging they improperly cooperated on fish passage regulations that impact the future of the dams and fish populations. The lawsuit filed in Kennebec Superior Court is the latest brought by Brookfield Renewable Power, a subsidiary of a large Canadian company that owns many of the dams in the state, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lawsuit contended the Department of Marine Resources improperly helped the Department of Environmental Protection draft fish passage policies, claiming that the cooperation between state agencies violates a 1993 settlement between the dams’ then-owners, environmental groups and state and federal bodies. The company argued under that settlement, disputes about fish passage standards related to the dams must be resolved through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which licenses dams. The Shawmut dam is under review for FERC relicensing and must get water quality approval from Maine as part of that process.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: Five zebras that escaped from a farm nearly a month ago are still on the loose. They got away Aug. 31 from a private farm near Upper Marlboro, about 20 miles southeast of the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reported. Prince George’s County animal control officials told the newspaper the caretakers have been trying to lure the animals into a fenced feeding area ever since. Zebras have to be corralled to be captured, not chased. Three of the animals have been traveling together while the other two have been in a pair, officials said. Residents have been sharing stories of zebra sightings on social media. Joshua DuBois, who worked for the White House during the Obama administration, tweeted Sept. 19 that he and his wife dressed up their three children in zebra-print outfits to go “zebra hunting.” He shared a video and photos of when they found the animals. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton – who represents Washington in Congress – joked in a Sept. 10 statement that despite her general support for freedom and her recent opposition to fences, referring to the fences around the U.S. Capitol, she was not responsible for setting the zebras free.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMelrose: A home seriously damaged by fire has been listed on the market with an asking price of $399,000. WBZ-TV reported Monday that the listing for the home in Melrose, a suburb of Boston, is evidence of how hot the housing market is. In August, industry groups listed the median sale price of single-family homes in the state to be between $535,000 and $552,000. The online listing for the burned three-bedroom, 1,857-square foot home starts with a call out to contractors, and continues: “House is in need of a complete renovation or potential tear down and rebuild. Buyer to do due diligence. House being sold as is.” The house suffered an intense fire in August that blew out the front windows, which are now boarded up. The Boston Globe reported that firefighters had to tear out parts of the walls and ceiling of the home to extinguish the blaze.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A young Detroit-area man who snapped a photo of a gang chart while cleaning an FBI office and posted it on social media was sentenced Tuesday to probation. Publicizing the chart could have caused a “bloodbath,” said U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. Parker said it was a serious case, but she turned down the government’s request that Anthony Cassani be locked up for three months. “I don’t think you need to be incarcerated to understand the gravity of what you’ve done here,” the judge said. In 2020, Cassani, 22, was cleaning an FBI office to reduce the risk of COVID-19 when he saw a chart of Detroit gang members. He admits taking a picture of the chart with his phone and posting it on Snapchat. It could have gone “horribly wrong” if “search warrants were executed and the targets of the search warrant were prepared for the agents to come in,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eaton Brown said. “We’re thankful that’s not what happened.” Cassani pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. He apologized and acknowledged the potential harm.\n\nMinnesota\n\nChaska: Tensions at a suburban Twin Cities school board meeting over a new mask mandate escalated to a physical scuffle. The Eastern Carver County Schools said Monday all students would need to wear a mask through at least the middle of next month because of a rise in coronavirus cases. At a meeting Monday night in Chaska, speakers lined up to talk about their support or opposition to the mandate. A couple of men got physical over what appeared to be a disagreement about someone taking a photo. Several other men intervened to separate the two and police were summoned, video from WCCO-TV showed. Some parents said the mask mandate is causing bullying concerns on both sides of the issue. Many parents said they want some sort of protocol about what they should do if their child is exposed, and if there is a required quarantine period.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: Three Mississippi cities and Birmingham, Alabama have been awarded grants to improve their train stations ahead of the planned return of Amtrak service to the Gulf Coast. Bay St. Louis, Gulfport and Pascagoula received a little more than $700,000 total, and another $250,000 went to Birmingham, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported. The newspaper said the grants were announced Monday by the Southern Rail Commission. The money will fund improvements to amenities such as lighting, sidewalks and parking areas. The grants require an equivalent matching contribution from local officials. Amtrak said it hopes to resume operating between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama in January. The region has been without passenger service since Hurricane Katrina badly damaged tracks and equipment in 2005. Before that, passenger trains ran between the cities three times a week. The start of service is still pending a decision by the federal Surface Transportation Board on Amtrak’s right of access to freight lines.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A southwest Missouri prosecutor said he has charged five employees of a private Christian boarding school with abusing students – far fewer than the number of charges recommended by state investigators. The five employees of the Agape Boarding School near Stockton were charged with a total of 13 third-degree felony assault counts, Cedar County Prosecuting Attorney Ty Gaither said. The charges came after the Missouri State Highway Patrol investigated allegations of abuse at the school. Based on that investigation, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt recommended prosecuting 22 employees with 65 counts on behalf of 36 victims, including felonies for abuse of a child and tampering with a victim, and misdemeanors for endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report child abuse. After Gaither said last week that he planned to charge far fewer employees than recommended, Schmitt asked Gov. Mike Parson to remove his office from the investigation because he didn’t believe Gaither intended to “seek justice” for all the victims. Gaither said this office believed “these to be the appropriate charges under the fact of the investigation,” The Kansas City Star reported. Although Gaither asked for the attorney general’s assistance in the case, Missouri law gives county prosecutors sole authority in deciding what charges are filed.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal authorities are investigating a small plane crash that killed a couple and critically injured their son in southern Montana on Sunday, authorities said. Robby and Pam Stephens died at the crash south of Billings and son Riley was taken to a hospital with critical injuries, officials said. Responders arrived to find the plane on fire in a wooded area near the Blain Airstrip, Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said. According to preliminary information, the Beech 35S plane crashed at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday, National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Keith Holloway said. The investigation will include looking at any air traffic communications, radar data, weather reports and a review of the plane’s maintenance records and medical and flight history of the pilot, Holloway said. A typical NTSB investigation can take between one and two years to complete, he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nMaywood: A woman was arrested over the weekend in southwestern Nebraska after being accused of pulling a gun after a store clerk refused to sell her beer, authorities said. The incident happened shortly before noon Saturday, when a business in the village of Maywood called the Frontier County Sheriff’s Office to report that a woman who appeared to be high on drugs pulled a gun when she wasn’t allowed to buy beer, KRVN reported. Deputies and the Nebraska State Patrol later stopped a vehicle on Highway 23 in which the woman was believed to be riding. Officers arrested Dixie Kaiser, 39, of Wellfleet, on suspicion of making terroristic threats. Kaiser was being held in the Seward County Jail on $15,000 bond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe is launching the largest capital improvement project in the history of the resort with a $7.5 million expansion that includes a new high-speed chairlift and trail additions to help skier traffic patterns. Resort officials said the expansion including the new chairlift in the Lakeview mountain zone near the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe is expected to be completed ahead of the 2022-23 winter season. Mike Pierce, the resort’s marketing director, said strong ridership combined with COVID-19 related lift restrictions made it necessary to increase Lakeview’s lift capacity last season. The old lift has been accessing a part of the mountain with views of the alpine lake for 41 years. Improvements already under way include a $1 million investment in snowmaking infrastructure, and slope grading to reduce obstacles and allow opening of terrain with as little as a foot of packed snow, Pierce said. A 60-year-old domestic water system serving the main lodge base area also is being replaced.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging a decision by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s administration to end unemployment benefits under the federal CARES Act early, saying the claims are based on flawed interpretations of state law. The pandemic-related benefits were scheduled to run out on Sept. 6. The lawsuit filed in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua against the state of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Employment Security and its commissioner asked a judge to reinstate the benefits dating to June 19, when they were ended. In her ruling, Judge Jacalyn Colburn wrote “the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims because neither of the statutes on which they rely require the defendants to act.” New Hampshire was among the first to expand eligibility for unemployment benefits when the pandemic first struck. Thousands of people were collecting unemployment benefits, including $300 per week supplemental payments either from the state or a federal program created during the pandemic. The state decided to end the extra payments early because the unemployment rate had dropped and given the abundance of available jobs, Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: A man who apparently tried to break into a restaurant in a southern New Jersey strip mall died after he got trapped in an exhaust fan on the roof of the building, authorities said. The body was found shortly before 10 a.m. Monday at the restaurant in Galloway Township. It’s not known how or when the man became trapped, police said, and officials are still working to determine his identity. Authorities have not said how the body was discovered or who found it. A similar robbery had occurred at the business a few weeks ago, and authorities are trying to determine if the episodes are connected.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The family of a passenger on a hot air balloon that crashed and killed five people in Albuquerque in June is suing the estate of the deceased pilot and the companies that operated the commercial balloon. The estate of Martin Martinez, 62, filed a lawsuit in state district court last week against Hot Air Balloonatics LLC, Sventato LLC, and the estate of the pilot, Nicholas Meleski. The suit accuses Meleski, who had drugs in his system, of piloting the balloon in a reckless manner. Martinez’s family is seeking unspecified monetary, punitive and other damages. A Federal Aviation Administration report showed that Meleski, 62, had marijuana and cocaine in his blood and urine. The National Transportation Safety Board hasn’t ruled on the cause of the crash. According to the lawsuit, Meleski was an employee of Hot Air Balloonatics and one of the organizers of Sventato, which owned the balloon that crashed June 26. The balloon struck a power line and the basket toppled about 100 feet onto a busy street. Hot Air Balloonatics declined to comment on the lawsuit. Also killed in the crash were Martinez’s wife, Mary, 59; Georgia O’Keeffe Elementary School assistant principal Susan Montoya, 65; and her husband, John, 61. Co-workers had chipped in to purchase the balloon ride for Susan Montoya as a going-away gift because she planned to transfer to another school.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of the Catholic bishop of Brooklyn, Nicholas DiMarzio, weeks after a Vatican investigation cleared him of sexual abuse allegations, and appointed a native New Yorker to replace him. DiMarzio is 77, two years beyond the usual retirement age for bishops. Francis accepted his resignation and appointed Bishop Robert Brennan of Columbus, Ohio, to take over in Brooklyn, the Vatican said. On Sept. 1, the New York church announced that the Vatican had closed its case against DiMarzio after an investigation concluded that the allegations against DiMarzio didn’t have “the semblance of truth.” Two men had separately claimed DiMarzio abused them a half-century ago, when he was a priest in New Jersey. DiMarzio denied the allegations. The accusers’ attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, has said the men will press forward with civil cases against DiMarzio. In a tweet Wednesday, DiMarzio welcomed Brennan to Brooklyn and said he had “great confidence in his ability to lead” the diocese. Brennan, 59, was educated at St. John’s University in Queens, ordained in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and made an auxiliary bishop there before being sent to lead the Columbus diocese in 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCarolina Beach: The town’s council terminated the contract of Reef Parking because of defective parking meters and the need for new ideas. Reef Parking manages 1,200 parking spaces in Carolina Beach, including spots in 20 surface lots and 165 metered on-street spaces. Parking fees account for more than $1.9 million of the town’s $16.5 million general fund revenue for fiscal year 2022. This summer, the town fielded complaints about inoperable parking meters, Mayor LeAnn Pierce said. Pierce said she received more complaints about meters not working than about the town’s parking rates. The town will be accepting requests for proposals, which will include reviewing past proposals submitted by other parking companies, Pierce said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The developer of an oil refinery planned near Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota has a new contract with a company that will buy and market all diesel and gasoline produced at the facility. Developer Meridian Energy Group said its 10-year contract with Musket Corp. covers 360 million gallons of diesel and 280 million gallons of gasoline produced annually. The fuels make up 90% of the volume of refined products at the plant. Meridian first proposed the refinery just 3 miles from the park in 2016, with the goal of having it operating by next year. Meridian says the Billings County project has faced delays from the pandemic and litigation from environmental groups, and the company has struggled to secure financing. Environmentalists objected to the permitting process and have concerns about the refinery’s proximity to the national park, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The company announced last November that it had entered into an agreement with Utah-based Kiva Energy, which will purchase propane and butane from the refinery.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Ohio’s utility commission said it has asked an independent auditor to examine whether FirstEnergy Corp. used customer money to pay for naming rights at the stadium where the Cleveland Browns play. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio announcement follows a request on Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers. They want FirstEnergy’s name removed because of its involvement in secretly funding a $60 million bribery scheme to win legislative approval in 2019 for a $1 billion bailout for two nuclear plants operated by a wholly owned FirstEnergy subsidiary. Akron-based FirstEnergy in 2013 agreed to pay $102 million over 17 years for naming rights to the stadium that was called Cleveland Browns Stadium when it opened in 1999, cleveland.com reported. FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the corporation pays for the naming rights deal and not customers of its three Ohio electric companies.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Cherokee Nation and three opioid distributors reached a $75 million settlement to resolve opioid-related claims against the companies. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe announced the settlement, the largest in Cherokee Nation history, with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation. The settlement will be paid out over 61/ 2 years. The tribe sued the three companies, along with several pharmacy companies, in 2017, alleging they contributed to “an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse” within the tribe and have not done enough to prevent tribal members from acquiring illegally prescribed opioid painkillers. The three companies said in a joint statement that the settlement is a step toward “a broader settlement with all federally recognized Native American tribes across the country.” The Cherokee Nation’s claims against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS are pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:After more than a year of renovations – and a much-anticipated reopening delayed by rising COVID-19 cases — the Salem Public Library is set to open Friday with limited in-person services. Residents can visit the library for Express Service, which includes browsing, pickup of holds and limited public computer use. The services will be available 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday. Curbside services will continue by appointment, and the outdoor book return is available 24 hours a day. The library closed its downtown location in February 2020 to undergo $18.6 million bond-funded seismic retrofits and cosmetic renovations. It relocated its collection to a temporary location on Broadway Road NE, but the location was only open a few weeks before the pandemic hit Oregon and closed libraries and indoor services. There will be a number of rules in place, including masks being worn over the mouth and nose at all times inside the library and a maximum of 200 visitors in the building at one time.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Allegheny County government employees will be required to submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination by Dec. 1 or face termination under a policy announced Wednesday by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. About 5,000 employees are subject to the new mandate, of whom more than 75% are already vaccinated. The rest will need to get the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines on or before Dec. 1 to be considered in compliance, officials said. Government workers who remain unvaccinated and who do not obtain an exemption will face termination beginning Dec. 2, the county said. County officials cited the rise of the highly contagious delta variant, which has led to increased COVID-19 caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths, and the need to protect workers and the public.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation has awarded another $450,000 in grants to several more nonprofits that are helping state residents cope with and recover from the pandemic. Centro de Innovacion Mujer Latina, Rhode Island Rescue Ministries and The Samaritans of Rhode Island are among the organizations that benefited from the latest round of grants. Centro received $30,000 to provide community mental health services and other assistance to the Spanish-speaking community. Rescue Ministries received $20,000 to purchase cold storage and nonperishable food containers for its homeless shelter, food pantry and soup kitchen. Samaritans received $20,000 to improve the responsiveness of its digital suicide prevention services. The foundation has now awarded more than $21 million in pandemic relief since March 2020.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A federal judge suspended South Carolina from enforcing a rule that banned school districts from requiring masks for students. Parents of disabled children, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the state saying the ban discriminated against medically vulnerable students by keeping them out of public schools as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The mask ban has been forcefully backed by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster and GOP lawmakers who said parents should decide whether students wear masks, not school officials. U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis compared the General Assembly preventing mask requirements to telling schools they can no longer install wheelchair ramps. McMaster’s spokesman, Brian Symmes, said the ruling isn’t the last word in the case. “The governor strongly disagrees with the court’s decision and will defend a parent’s right to decide what’s best for their children up to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary,” Symmes said in a statement,\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBlack Hawk: More than 150 homeowners in a development outside Rapid City are suing Meade County over risks to their properties after a sinkhole exposed an abandoned gypsum mine. The federal complaint filed Monday by Hideaway Hills residents in Black Hawk seeks damages to be determined by a jury and other relief “allowed by law or equity.” The sinkhole forced about 40 residents from 15 homes in April 2020. Geotechnical studies showed there could be water flowing through the abandoned mine and toward Interstate 90 and there is the potential for future sinkholes, the Rapid City Journal reported. The complaint alleged several violations of the state Constitution. It said the decision to approve the subdivision by the county Planning Commission and the Meade County Commission put homeowners at risk. Developers allegedly informed the county in 2001 of an underground gypsum mine and discussed taking steps to determine if it was safe to build on. The commission approved the subdivision proposal in 2003. Katelyn Cook, an attorney for the county, said her legal team does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin:A house in downtown Franklin that belonged to the grandparents of country comedy legend Minnie Pearl, who performed at the Grand Ole Opry for more than 50 years, is for sale for $2.75 million. The home on West Main Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It belonged to Ophelia and William House,the grandparents of Sarah Colley Cannon, better known by her stage name of Minnie Pearl. The Queen Anne-style home was built in 1873 and sits in Franklin’s historic downtown district. Many of the original furnishings and fixtures remain, including mantels for the six fireplaces. The distinctive home has glass doorknobs and intricately designed door handles. The nearly 6,000 square foot residence sits on a little more than an acre, and has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. Outdoor space includes a wraparound front porch, sunroom, back porch and patio. Hardwood floors are throughout the home.\n\nTexas\n\nHuntsville: Rick Rhoades, 57, was executed Tuesday night for fatally stabbing two Houston-area brothers during a robbery in their home more than 30 years ago. Rhoades was executed by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the September 1991 killings of Charles Allen, 31, and Bradley Allen, 33. The brothers were killed less than a day after Rhoades had been released on parole after serving a sentence for burglary. Rhoades, strapped to the death chamber gurney, turned his head and looked briefly at relatives of his victims as they walked to a window in a witness area a few feet from him. Asked by the warden to make a final statement, he declined. He was pronounced dead at 6:29 p.m. CDT, 17 minutes after the lethal injection began. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to delay Rhoades’ execution over claims his constitutional right to due process was being violated because he was being prevented from pursuing allegations that some potential jurors at his trial might have been dismissed for racially discriminatory reasons. Rhoades was the third inmate put to death this year in Texas and the sixth in the U.S. Four more executions are scheduled for later this year in Texas, the nation’s busiest capital punishment state.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: The police chief in the tourist town where officers stopped Gabby Petito and her boyfriend weeks before her death has taken a leave of absence. Moab Police Chief Bret Edge requested a leave of absence that began Monday, city spokesperson Lisa Church said. It is unknown if his request is related to criticism the department has faced over the past week after Petito’s body was discovered in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Petito and her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night but no charges were filed and no serious injuries were reported. Last week, the city of Moab said it would conduct a formal investigation into the police department’s handling of the dispute. Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Laundrie visited parks in the West. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A food box program with its roots in the early days of the pandemic is ending after distributing tens of thousands of meals to people across Vermont. In June, the Full Plates Vermont program run by the Vermont Foodbank took over the Farmers to Families Food Box program that was begun by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The original USDA program was designed to feed people left hungry by the pandemic and give those in the food industry, notably farmers, a place to sell their products. The food bank, working with private, state and other partners, coordinated food distribution events where people’s vehicles were loaded with boxes of food containing poultry, fruit, vegetables and dairy items. The Rutland Herald reported that after the original program ended in May, the Vermont Foodbank continued with its version of the program, which has distributed 40,000 meals since June. Sayles said after the program ends Thursday, people who benefited from it can check with the Foodbank to learn where they can get help.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin clashed Tuesday night over vaccinations, tax policy, education and their respective records in the second and final debate in Virginia’s closely watched gubernatorial election. The event quickly got off to a combative start and neither candidate let up over the course of the hour, with each accusing the other of lying to voters. Five weeks from Election Day and with early voting already underway, recent polls suggested a tight race between McAuliffe, who is seeking a second term after his first ended in 2018, and Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer. Democrats made huge gains in Virginia while President Donald Trump was in office, taking full control of state government, but Republicans are more energized and optimistic about their chances this fall than they have been in years. The contest, one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races this year, is also drawing national attention as a possible indicator of voter sentiment heading into next year’s midterms.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: A woman has filed a lawsuit against King County Metro claiming a bus driver ran over her leg while she was laying on a sidewalk and then drove away. Jessica Chapel’s injuries were so severe that doctors had to amputate one of her legs, her attorneys said. The bus driver, who is no longer with King County Metro, is facing hit-and-run charges, KOMO-TV reported. Chapel was homeless in March and decided to lay down on the sidewalk to take a nap, her attorneys said. The bus pulled out of the South Renton Park & Ride lot and turned right, cutting the corner short. The rear tire of the bus ran on top of the curb and drove over Chapel’s leg, her attorneys said. “The injuries were gruesome,” said attorney Kirk Bernard. According to the complaint filed Tuesday, the King County bus driver initially stopped to check on Chapel before returning to the bus and pushing the response button to get help from law enforcement. The lawsuit alleged that the driver left Chapel on the road side and canceled the help that was supposed to be on the way. A passerby called for help.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A new program launched by West Virginia’s Supreme Court that uses technology to promote safety and access in cases involving sexual assault and domestic violence is expanding to Ohio County, officials said. The new system allows victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to file petitions for protective orders without going to a courthouse. Ohio County is the second community to pilot the program, which was introduced last month in Cabell County as a way to address safety concerns. The only option before the program was for victims to appear in person at the courthouse. “This new system will provide an option to victims to help keep them safe from the people they allege assaulted them. We also are ensuring every person’s constitutional rights are protected,” Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau:The city could soon be home to up to 85 refugees, including some of the thousands of evacuees who fled the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Ethiopian Community Development Council announced Wednesday that it is preparing for the first 10 individuals to be resettled into the central Wisconsin city by December, and that another 75 could be received from January through September of 2022. The organization said among those resettled in the community could be Afghans, through the Afghan Placement and Assistance program. The organization received authorization for the resettlement from the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, but no costs have yet been completed for the effort. Before the refugees can be resettled, the organization is working to hire a director for its Multicultural Community Center and raise funds to hire other local staff members, according to a release. As soon as staff members are in place, the group will work with local partners to prepare for the first arrivals.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Widespread news coverage of Gabby Petito helped searchers in an unrelated case find a man’s body not far away, officials said. A team with a search dog looked for four hours Tuesday before finding the body of a man matching the description of Robert ‘Bob’ Lowery, according to a Teton County Search & Rescue statement. Lowery, 46, of Houston, went missing Aug. 20. The man’s body was found on a steep, wooded slope in the area of Teton Pass in western Wyoming. How the man died wasn’t immediately known. Authorities notified Lowery’s family while awaiting confirmation the body was his. News coverage of Petito, 22, who went missing on a cross-country road trip and whose body was found near Grand Teton National Park on Sept. 19, sometimes mentioned Lowery’s disappearance. That prompted at least two people to call authorities with information about Lowery, searchers said Tuesday. Lowery was wearing a black baseball cap with a gold letter “P” and spotted in hotel camera images carrying a black duffel bag with the Nike logo. Searchers in the area of a popular canyon trail said they found a bag matching that description with the body, far off the trail. The bag contained a tent and sleeping bag, Lowery’s sister, Leigh, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. The Teton Pass-area canyon where the man’s body was found is about 45 miles from where Petito was found. Petito’s parents reported her missing Sept. 11 after she didn’t respond to calls and texts while she and boyfriend Brian Laundrie visited national parks in the West.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/30"}]}

And to to help christen the still-unnamed stage, he had a party a month ago that included performances by the countrified Sin City Band, jazz five-piece Kombu Combo, hurdy gurdy-playing Michele McCann Band and another of Zito's bands, Railroad Pete, which includes Montana Wildaxe's Tony Cappella.\n\nHe dubbed the show Chickenstock because there's an old chicken coop located close to the stage, near where his guests mingled and danced until midnight. The event was potluck and the green room was literally green – a patch of the lawn to the side of the stage.\n\nZito, 58, is now on a path to follow in the footsteps of the state's other house concert spots like the Cooldog Concert Series in Kenton, which has been going strong for 11 years, and the Terrapin Woods House Concerts in Newark, which started up in 2011.\n\nNone of the house concert locations in Delaware put on the shows to make a profit. It's a labor of love and the proceeds go back to the artists.\n\nBob Andrews knows all about house shows. The Illinois-based artist manager and co-founder of Undertow Music is not surprised that the number of spots hosting house concerts has been slowly growing in Delaware.\n\nUndertow has helmed an expanding number of house concert tours for its national artists in the past five years – a total of 1,100 – and has become a national leader in the house concert bookings.\n\nSinger/songwriters like Eef Barzelay (Clem Snide), Richard Buckner, Anders Parker, Damien Jurado, John Vanderslice and Will Johnson (Centro-Matic) have all done living room shows with Undertow, along with Philadelphia-based indie rockers Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.\n\nDavid Bazan, the leader of indie rock band Pedro the Lion, has run with the concept, doing about 600 house shows since 2009 in up to 350 different towns across the country, Andrews says.\n\nThe reasons are simple: The shows are better and the artists make more money.\n\nAs an added bonus, merchandise sales are even higher at house shows with fans drawn in by the intimate experience, Andrews says. And with bands not making much money off record sales these days, more bands are on the road, making getting dates at venues more difficult to snag with an influx of acts on the road, he adds.\n\n\"When David began doing it, people realized it wasn't a consolation prize,\" Andrews says. \"He did it because it's better than playing venues. He gets to keep all the ticket money, there's 50 or 60 people who want to be there and there's no talkers or bars to compete with.\"\n\nFor Zito, the metamorphosis from backyard to music venue now gives him and other musical acts that might not fit into the bar band scene a tranquil place to perform for ears that want to listen. In addition to an annual jam-themed Chickenstock each summer, Zito plans to host a singer/songwriter series, along with blues and bluegrass shows.\n\nZito hasn't hammered out an exact plan for how musical-lovers can get tickets for his shows, but he's leaning toward giving the performing bands an allotment of passes that will get their fans entry with a donation.\n\n\"I want to make sure everyone gets paid,\" Zito says. \"Musicians are lower than a dishwasher on the pay scale, usually. I know how hard they work.\"\n\nThe annual Delaware Division of the Arts prizes range from $10,000 to $3,000. Only one $10,000 Masters Fellow prize is awarded each year and Wilmington photographer Carson Zullinger is the 2014 recipient. Zito, the only musician to receive the award this year, will join the other fellows at a ceremony Sept. 20 at the Biggs Museum of American Art in Dover and he will perform a pair of his songs.\n\nZito says he has had no complaints from his neighbors, who are invited to all shows. In fact, he says one neighbor trimmed his backyard bushes and built a fire pit so he could enjoy the music from his own property. Another stopped by for Chickenstock and by the end, he was so drawn to the setting that he asked Zito if he could get married in Zito's backyard with Zito's act as the wedding band.\n\nWhile Zito focuses on booking local artists, Paul Gumerman's Cooldog Concert Series pulls in traveling acts from across the country, along with some international performers. Since Kent County doesn't have the size or scope of New Castle County's original music scene, Gumerman decided to import the music himself.\n\n\"There's really no place in this area to see the kind of music I bring in,\" he says, mentioning the Delmarva Folk Fest in Clayton as a rare explosion of original music in the area each year. \"We're kind of out in the sticks.\"\n\nHis Celtic shows are the biggest sellers and he hosts everything from folk and rock to blues and singer/songwriters. He estimates about two-third of his crowd come from Delaware with the rest coming from bordering states. There's usually a $15-$20 suggested donation at the door.\n\nGumerman, who recently formed his own band called Key of Red, has held nearly 120 concerts in his Kenton home since 2003, which has both a permanent indoor and outdoor stage.\n\nMusic fans bring food for a potluck dinner and oftentimes the musicians stay the night at no charge.\n\nLodging for musicians is also part of the deal at Margaret Brown's Glasgow home when traveling musicians play the Terrapin Woods House Concerts.\n\nThe 55-year-old self-described \"old Deadhead\" started her series three years ago and has hosted about 20 shows. Unlike Gumerman's high-tech set-up, Brown's house concerts are a bit more old school. She doesn't even have a website to promote the shows, which cost $10-$20 in suggested donations.\n\n\"It's word-of-mouth. It's a true house concert. I don't have a sound system, even,\" she says. \"This is not commercial. This is a private house. I tell people you're strangers when you come to my home and we are friends by the time you leave.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n-- For updates on Butch Zito's backyard stage, go to his Facebook or ReverbNation pages.\n\n-- Cooldog House Concert Series will host its next concert Aug. 10 at 4 p.m. with California-based Celtic rock group Tempest.

As fans long for a state marker for that Delaware connection, he is honored each July in \"The Annual Peoples' Festival 4 Peace Tribute to Bob Marley,\" founded by family friends.\n\nUsually, the third genre raised is rock 'n' roll in Newark.\n\nWhen Bruce Springsteen played The Stone Balloon. And George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers rocked The State Theatre and other hometown venues.\n\nNeither marker nor festival honors that musical heyday.\n\nIn that time, all manner of rock bands, free-thinkers and newly minted Vietnam veterans were everywhere in the pot-smoky college town and its hinterlands.\n\nOver the summer, however, the entire 1970s' Newark heritage had a most-fitting tribute.\n\nThat was one sunny September Saturday's celebration of a new book and old band.\n\nThe band was Snakegrinder and the Shredded Field Mice.\n\nAnd the book, named from a song by that band, is \"There's a House in the Land [Where A Band Can Take A Stand].\" Subtitled \"A Tale of the 1970s,\" it is a remarkably written bit of time-travel by award-winning journalist Shaun D. Mullen, a veteran of The News Journal.\n\nA signing party reunited Snakegrinder for the first time in decadesat The Blue Crab in Suburban Plaza, Newark. David Bennett visited by Skype from The Philipines as Hangnail Philips aka Craig Smith sat in for him on keyboard.\n\nGeorge Wolkind and other band members said only Mullen could have caused \"such a happening.\"\n\nSnakegrinder was born as the house band of the book's setting – a commune-like farm where Mullen lived about a decade just over the line in Pennsylvania, a local legend for its fluid cast of characters, parties and goats.\n\nPlans for the signing concert attracted so many reservations from survivors of the time, a second show/signing was added. The twice-packed total, said to have topped 500, drew with uncounted musicians and luminaries of the era, including Stone Balloon owner Bill Stevenson.\n\nNewarkers of the era – especially rock fans, aging Deer Park townies and all who went to the farm – likely will find Mullen's thinly fictionalized memoir an engaging, funny and sometimes heartwrenching revisit to that time, inseparable from its place and musical score.\n\nWhile Newark rock 'n' roll likely never will generate an annual celebration or historical marker – or the acclaim of Wilmington's Clifford Brown jazz or the Marley Connection – Mullen's book and its launch party were the next best thing.\n\nDo you have a Delaware Backstory?

It’s a project she and her guitarist and husband Kenny Windle created that touches on themes of injustice, heartbreak and hope. The record was produced by Derek Chafin.The song “Addie” was inspired by the singer's heartache after she lost an infant patient nearly 30 years ago, while working as a pediatric nurse for a medical daycare in Delaware.\n\n“I have cared for many children who have passed away, unfortunately. And he just touched me in a different way. Or he was the straw that broke the camel's back after losing a number of different kids,” Emery, 54, explained.\n\nThe song “Addie” is a fictitious name for the young patient’s grandmother. The music sounds a little like a marriage of rock and non-contemporary gospel, while Emery flexes her strong vocals on the tune. In the song, Emery asks Addie to tell her grandson — if she managed to find him in the afterlife — that she tried everything she could to save him.\n\n“The music allows me a place to sort of … I don't want to say deal with the emotions, but it gives me a place to manage the feelings, some of which don't have words,” Emery observed.\n\nThe self-titled track, \"If Love Were Enough,\" offers a laidback, hypotonic melody under Emery’s sassy, lounge-style vocals. As the song progresses, she turns up the pressure and morphs from casual singing into intense crooning, once again demonstrating her mighty chops.\n\nThe song features the chorus, “Love ain’t enough to keep the devil from knockin,’” which repeats a few times and ends with, “But I’ll be damned. Ain’t gonna give up on love.”\n\nThe title of the tune is a phrase that’s lived in the back of Emery’s mind for ages, she said. The singer explained she was inspired by a young terminally ill patient she cared for who was surrounded by a loving family, yet that love didn’t keep the child alive.\n\n“If love were enough, maybe he wouldn't have to die. Maybe he would be OK. Maybe he could be healed,\" she said.\n\nThe music video for the song includes a social justice theme and features a wide range of people from different walks of life. It includes a biker with a George Floyd tribute on his vest, a gay couple sharing an intimate moment, and a young woman in a wheelchair armed with boxing gloves, among other subjects.\n\nCerebral palsy patient blessed her\n\nEmery's best friend Lisa Carnley, of Middletown, is in love with the new EP. It moves her in a special way because her son, Cory, was Emery’s patient around the same time she was caring for the infant that inspired “Addie.”\n\nCory has special needs and was under Emery’s care when he was about age 2. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has suffered seizures his whole life, according to his mom.\n\n“His neurologist explained to me, he just doesn't have a very good brain. It's not one area of the brain that the seizures are coming from, it's kind of all over,” Carnley said.\n\nWhen Carnley met Emery, it was at a traumatic time in her life. Her son wasn’t expected to live long and she didn’t know how to navigate through the healthcare system.\n\nBut Emery, who was just a stranger to her at the time, had her back.\n\n“She helped get doctors to listen to me,” Carnley recalled.\n\nEmery said Carnley has since become her No. 1 fan. “She’s at 99.9% percent of the gigs.”\n\nEventually, Carnley learned from another nurse that Emery was a singer. She came out to one of the artist's shows and was dazzled. “I saw her singing one time and was hooked. I just couldn't believe that voice came out of that little tiny body.\"\n\nTo this day, the singer still cares for Cory, who defied the odds and is now 27 years old. He's wheelchair bound, but he's got a strong will to live, his mama said.\n\n“She's done so much for me just this past year, because I've had some vacations planned and she has come and stayed at my house and been his nurse while I was away,” Carnley said. “She's pretty incredible.”\n\nThanks to Emery's musical life, GEB's latest drummer, Tim Elliot, is now in a serious relationship with Carnley after the pair got acquainted at one of the band's shows.\n\n\"They met and it's all our fault,\" the singer said.\n\nAn ugly Volkswagen and an enviable gig\n\nFrom 1989 to 2008, Emery worked primarily as a nurse. She’s since transitioned to a management role. When she’s off the clock, she kicks into singer mode.\n\nHer husband Windle, 70, is semi-retired and works part-time restoring exotic vintage cars.\n\nThe couple has been married since 2012. But they first met around 1995 when they were both still married to other people.\n\nThe pair met when Windle came to Emery’s house to audition for her old cover band, the Condors. As Windle pulled up to her Newark home, the one they live in today, she was about to leave to run an errand.\n\nWindle didn't make a great first impression.\n\n“There is the most hideously colored green car in front of me. And I thought, ‘I hope to God that car is not coming to my house.’ Sure enough, it did. And it was Kenny.”\n\nWindle didn’t join the band. But it had nothing to do with his beloved Volkswagen Golf.\n\nA year later, the two randomly ran into each other at the supermarket. They discussed the idea of playing original music together in the band Red House.\n\nTheir partnership in that band went well and lasted a few years. One of their highlights was playing Warm Daddys in Philly, a venue that wasn’t any easy gig to land for local bands.\n\n“That was a big deal back then,” Windle recalled. “But they loved us because we sold it out every time we played.”\n\n'Rock ‘n Roll Honeymoon'\n\nWhen Red House dissolved, Windle and Emery played in a few other projects together. They struck gold with their group Gretchen Emery & Dirty Boots, which lasted from about 2009 to 2014.\n\nThey earned a spot in the prestigious International Blues Challenge in Memphis in January 2013, competing against bands from all over the world.\n\nTheir run with Dirty Boots inspired their popular song “Rock ‘n Roll Honeymoon.” The tune was a nod to the fact that their competition in Memphis was basically the couple's wedding trip, after they tied the knot Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 and Emery went back to work that Monday.\n\n“There's nothing we really enjoy more than playing music,” Emery said. “So we went down for the competition. That was kind of our honeymoon.”\n\nIn 2017, Emery and Windle began a new project and called it The Gretchen Emery Band. They ditched the “Dirty Boots” part because some people thought they were a country group. GEB has been going strong ever since.\n\nFrom Christianity to 'the occult'\n\nEmery was raised by teachers in a Christian home with a white picket fence in Dover.\n\nWindle grew up poor in an extremely violent neighborhood in North Philly where books on Aleister Crowley, an occultist, magician and mountaineer, were read in his home. \"My dad was deep into the occult,\" he recalled. The guitarist, who said he's not a religious man, lost his mom at a young age. His dad was a writer who retired as a publicist from Temple University.\n\nA lot of Haitian immigrants lived in his neighborhood and they brought with them their religious traditions. “We had a voodoo witch that would go around and bless the block once or twice a month,\" Windle remembered.\n\nThe Philly native bounced in and out of the foster care system until he eventually landed back home with his dad.\n\nWindle was a violent youth who was once sentenced to 23 months in a juvenile detention facility, he said, charged with being involved in the destruction of railroad property during burglaries.\n\n“When he was doing his time, I was an infant,'' his wife joked. \"I was just busting out [of the womb] and he was getting locked up.''\n\nWhen Emery first met Windle, he was a more refined version of himself. And he was sober.\n\nThe frontwoman learned over the years that he was a genuine guy with a good heart, despite having grown up in a hellish environment. Her best friend Carnley has known Windle for ages and said he lights up around her wheelchair-bound son.\n\n\"Kenny loves Cory to death,\" she exclaimed.\n\nEmery initially turned Windle down for a date once they were both divorced from their previous partners, because they had built a strong friendship that she didn't want to risk losing.\n\nBut her reluctance didn't last. \"It turned out that we did not mess it up,\" Emery said.\n\nThese days, she and her husband are focused on making more music and playing gigs. Emery looks forward to what the next chapter of her musical life will bring.\n\nShe's been on a wild ride, both figuratively and literally.\n\nThat's because fate led her to sit in the driver's seat of her husband's ugly green Volkswagen Golf, the car she swore she wouldn't get caught dead in.\n\n“My car was in the shop,\" she explained. \"So I ended up driving that very car ⁠— eating my words.\"\n\nThe Gretchen Emery Band will play an acoustic set at Zollies (414 Delaware St., New Castle) from 7-10 p.m., Saturday.

With a tasty beverage and real, live music in the air.\n\nThat was the scene on Wilmington's Riverfront Friday evening as hundreds gathered for the state's first-ever large-scale car concert – a live performance of some of The Beatles' greatest hits.\n\n\"This man hasn't stepped out of the house in four months, but he came out here for The Beatles,\" said Sonali Pandit, pointing to her husband, Mohan, as he swayed to a rendition of the legendary British Pop group's \"Yellow Submarine.\"\n\nWith the coronavirus pandemic halting large public gatherings – especially events like concerts, where people traditionally pack into crowded venue – this is what the new normal looks like for now.\n\nAround 200 cars packed into a lot outside Frawley Stadium, spread in distanced rows with one or two parking spaces in between vehicles and all facing a stage where a local band jammed to The Beatles greatest hits.\n\nSome sat listening to the performance on the radio in the cool of their air conditioned cars. Others sat on sunroofs, tailgates or in folding chairs outside their vehicles.\n\n\"I feel normal, well, as normal as it can get right now,\" said Maria Sawczak of New Castle.\n\nShe took in the concert in a red Mustang convertible with her girlfriends. They had made an evening out of it with dinner on the Riverfront nearby, something rare these days.\n\n\"It is just a joy,\" she said. \"I feel it is something approaching normalcy.\"\n\nSome swayed and danced in public for the first time in what they said felt like ages. Some gathered in small groups, but mostly people stayed apart.\n\n\"We liked the idea it was going to be safe,\" said Nette Stejskal of Pike Creek.\n\nThe 500 to 600 people that paid $25 a head to attend were treated to more than an hour of music by The Rock Orchestra, a Delaware-based band that plays tributes to different groups.\n\n\"The fact that I was playing to cars was the oddest thing,\" said Joe Trainor, the group's music director.\n\nInstead of the crowd singing along and holding their lighters or phones aloft, those attending interacted with the musicians with a series of hi-beam flashes and horn honks.\n\nWith some people outside their cars, Trainor said the band was still able to hear the applause and interact face-to-face with the crowd. Like most musicians, it was the first time Trainor had performed in months. The emotion of that hit him, he said.\n\n\"To sit at that piano and play music with my friends, I just miss those people and I miss playing,\" he said. \"It was a special night.\"\n\nIt is the first of what could be several such events hosted by the Grand Opera House, a Wilmington arts nonprofit that runs the namesake opera house on Market Street and other venues downtown.\n\nDelaware is rocking again: Live music returns as stages begin to welcome customers back\n\n\"This is why we exist and we haven't been able to do it for a long time,\" said Mark Fields, executive director of the Grand Opera House.\n\nThe group also runs the Baby Grand venue and the Playhouse on Rodney Square downtown.\n\nFields said they've been working toward what they billed as \"The Grand's Concert by Car\" for about two months since it became clear the pandemic was not near an end.\n\nOtherwise, they've ramped up their social media presence, rebroadcast old concerts and interviews, and introduced new programming to reflect the times, but the pandemic has been a challenge for the organization, Fields said.\n\n\"It is incredibly frustrating for a performing arts organization to not be able to perform,\" he said in an interview ahead of the concert.\n\nRecent: New coronavirus cases continue to rise in Delaware, up 192 since Thursday\n\nThere was an awareness of that among the crowd. Some said they attended to get out of the house and help the organization along.\n\n\"This is supporting the area,\" said Chris Hesseck as he sat in a folding chair inside the bed of his pickup.\n\nLike most arts and entertainment venues, the Grand has been hit hard financially by the pandemic.\n\nTickets, merchandise, concessions and rental fees account for some 65% to 70% of the organization's $7 million annual budget, Fields said. The rest is derived from contributions, he said.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, they've had to cancel 60 of their own events and about 40 rental events, he said.\n\nDelaware is still in phase two of its reopening plan related to coronavirus. That means the Grand could technically operate at 60 percent capacity.\n\nBut with other social distancing requirements, that number limits attendance to about 350 people in Copeland Hall, the organization's 1,200-capacity venue inside the Grand Opera House.\n\n\"It's hard to do that economically,\" Fields said.\n\nHe said they hope to hold such concerts through the summer and potentially fall. Tickets for the next such concert, featuring a Pink Floyd tribute planned for July 17, will go on sale next week, he told the crowd at Friday's concert.\n\nBut even if the event becomes a fixture, it won't solve the money issue.\n\n\"It is a lot more expensive to put on a concert in a parking lot than it is one of our theaters,\" he said. \"This is not something we are doing to make money.\"\n\nRather, he said the organization seeks to fulfill its mission to entertain and stay on people's minds.\n\nCoronavirus: Taking a Delaware beach trip for the Fourth of July? Here's what you need to know\n\nGiven that packing people into rooms to take in live music will likely be one of the last pieces of normalcy to return, he said the organization's future is not entirely clear.\n\n\"Our fervent hope is people understand and appreciate the value of the Grand to the community economically, in terms of quality of life and artistic expression and make sure we are going to be alright in the long term,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Grand plans to survey those who came to improve on car concert setup.\n\nThose attending said there is room to grow the concept.\n\nSome, who were parked hundreds of yards from the stage, said the sound was fine, but wanted larger screens to see the band. The event also didn't feature refreshments for sale or restrooms, which Fields said is logistically difficult at this time.\n\n\"A bathroom would be good,\" said Juliana Forbes of Wilmington.\n\nShe watched the concert from the cab of her vehicle with Claude Forbes.\n\n\"It is different,\" Claude Forbes said. \"But it is what we need to do right now.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/culture/2019/05/20/rehoboth-bandstand-summer-2019-lineup-military-tribute-bands/3332647002/", "title": "Rehoboth bandstand summer 2019 lineup military tribute bands", "text": "From staff reports\n\nThe Rehoboth Beach Bandstand has announced it's summer concert series performers for 2019.\n\nAll performances are free.

Restaurants and bars are gearing up for summer, and many of them are already presenting copious amounts of live music.\n\nIn Ocean City, this is the first week of 2021 that Seacrets has been open and featured live entertainment each day — and that’s the way things are set to remain there.\n\nAt 5 p.m. Friday, May 14, the Jim Long Band will kick off the first of its weekly happy-hour shows at Seacrets. These weekend kickoffs will no doubt please many regulars. as Long and company have been the house band there in the summertime since the ’90’s. Another rock act that will kick off a weekly residency is Go, Go Gadget, which will play at 10 p.m. each Thursday beginning May 20.\n\nNational touring comedian Rich Vos will perform a pair of sold-out shows at Seacrets on Tuesday and Wednesday, May 18-19. Those who were lucky enough to purchase tickets by phone or online when they went on sale may pick them up at will-call before the show (with first come, first served seating); you must be checked in by 8:30 p.m. or your table will be forfeited.\n\nThe Bottle & Cork nightclub in Dewey Beach was the place to be this past Monday, when country superstar (and Milton native) Jimmy Allen played a last-minute popup show for a good cause. Tickets were $10 at the door, and the line stretched down to the bay on Bellvue Street to enter the solo acoustic performance.\n\nAll proceeds benefited the family of Delmar police Cpl. Keith Heacook, who was tragically killed in the line of duty last month. Plans are afoot for additional fundraising events to be announced.\n\nAllen had originally been scheduled to play a sold-out show with his full backing band at last weekend’s Springfest in Ocean City, but tickets were refunded as all of the national concerts under the big tent were canceled due to social-distancing concerns. However, dozens of local musicians played outside this year during the scaled-back event.\n\nA fundraiser for a different recipient is scheduled for noon to 6 p.m. Sunday, May 16, at Hudson Fields in Milton. Gather and Give for Gavin is an outdoor festival to raise monety to assist Cape Henlopen High School student Gavin Birl, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a snowboarding accident earlier this year.\n\nThe music lineup consists of The Funsters, Lower Case Blues, Love Seed Mama Jump, Trent & the Trainwreck, Hope For Success and an acoustic performance by Electric Velvet. There will also be a petting zoo, yoga, food trucks and more. Tickets are $10 for adults and teens, with children under 12 being admitted for free.\n\nAnother upcoming music fundraiser in Delaware is one we previewed in this column last week. The semi-annual Hope Is Best event has taken place at Rehoboth- and Wilmington-area locations through the years, and raises awareness about mental health and the role it plays in suicides.\n\nThis year the concert will take place Saturday, May 15, and feature virtual performances online, with many of the acts broadcasting from Wilmington’s Theatre Nemours. It will be streamed on Facebook via both the theater’s page and the Hope Is Best page, and donations will be accepted. The event honors local singer-songwriter Aric Pringle, who died in June 2011.\n\nThis year’s performers include Lyric Drive, Wheezing the Juice, Cliff Hillis, Tyler Greene, Gaper Delay, Ray Hunter from Desoto Rust and also The Acoustic Cameltones. All proceeds will benefit the Delaware chapter of NAMI (the National Alliance on Mental Illness).\n\nLooking ahead a week, Delaware will follow Maryland’s lead from earlier this spring, and revert back to 100-percent capacities beginning Friday, May 21. Tables will be spaced three feet apart, instead of six feet apart, yet dancing will still not be permitted.

The video has been viewed more than 885,000 times and Vice reported that they participated on the condition that only their first names be used.\n\nDelaware-based bluegrass/folk singer Patrick \"Paddy\" Corcoran, and Sean Giffing, a member of the Cecil County, Maryland-based punk band Plague Bubonika, both appear in the video with Heimbach.\n\n\"For those who are not Towson students, it seems hard to fathom that every single day black predators prey upon the majority white Towson University student body,\" the group wrote on its website. \"White Southern men have long been called to defend their communities when law enforcement and the state seem unwilling to protect our people.\"\n\nIn the video, they meet at a restaurant over beers and pretzel bites planning that night's patrol, running through a checklist, including making sure there are batteries in their flashlights. They are seen praying in a parking garage and then walk at night through campus, located in the suburbs of Baltimore.\n\nAt some point, they stop at the offices of the Black Student Union and ask people if they want to join the patrol. No one takes them up on the offer.\n\nHeimbach, while being interviewed in a room with a Confederate Flag hanging in the background and a \"The South will rise again\" bumper sticker on his laptop, says he always carries a pistol. Vice reports that the group \"allegedly now have 57 members.\"\n\nLater in the video, he stands on the outskirts of an equality rally on campus where then-Towson University president Maravene Loeschke speaks in support: \"A whole lot is going to be better because you're here today. ... I don't know that I have ever in my life been more proud.\"\n\nWhite nationalism is on the rise in the United States, in part due to the presidential election season and the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, says Keegan Hankes, a research analyst for Southern Poverty Law Center, a Alabama-based nonprofit legal advocacy organization specializing in civil rights.\n\n\"The tenor of Trump's presidential campaign has really lit a fire with these guys,\" Hankes says. \"In the last six months, I feel like they are all energized in a way that I have not previously seen.\"\n\nWhile Giffing does not comment during the 21-minute film, Corcoran, who has performed at Wilmington venues like World Cafe Live at the Queen, Kelly's Logan House, Oddity Bar and 1984, makes his views clear in the video.\n\n\"America as an idea is hardly existing anymore. The original idea is not what it's supposed to be now, what we're living in,\" Corcoran says. \"We're essentially heading toward a dissolution of the United States. But in a sense, that could be for the better because it may lead to a white ethno-state, which is ultimately what we want. We want a national, strong nation-state that's well-defended, but at peace with the world.\"\n\nWhen the Vice reporter asks him what the criteria of citizenship would be for this ethno-state, he answered, \"The criteria of citizenship would be based, I mean, I'm going to say it bluntly, it would be based on race. It would be based on white. Absolutely. One hundred percent.\"\n\nGayle Dillman, whose Gable Music Ventures has booked Corcoran at the Queen for its singer/songwriter night as recently as last year, says she did not know about his pro-white views.\n\n\"Any racist activity, as far as I'm concerned as a business owner, is unacceptable,\" she says. \"I would question going forward whether we would want to be associated with that.\"\n\nRepresentatives from World Cafe Live at the Queen, Kelly's Logan House, Oddity Bar and 1984 all said they did not know about Corcoran's views before hosting him and would not have him back.\n\nThe video gained attention locally when Steve Beighley, guitarist for the Newark punk band Worth, saw it and began to refuse to play shows that included Plague Bubonika or Giffing.\n\nSince then, several other bands have joined the boycott in solidarity.\n\n\"We have this great scene that we have worked so hard to make inclusive and fun,\" Beighley said. \"The whole DIY local music ethos is inclusion no matter what. If you like the music, come out.\"\n\nIn recent months, Plague Bubonika, which has also performed at Holly Oak's Bar XIII, Oddity Bar and 1984, has been kicked off of seven recent shows over the video, says Plague Bubonika singer Anthony Taylor.\n\nThe band went on an \"indefinite hiatus\" earlier this week because of the controversy, Taylor says.\n\nWhen contacted by The News Journal, Giffing gave a full-throated apology for appearing in the video, condemning the views held by those seen in the report. Giffing says he has never held those views and called his participation with Heimbach and the group a terrible mistake, adding, \"Mistake is an understatement.\"\n\nSTORY: Demonstrators to Markell - End racism in state government\n\nSTORY: Redskins name divides Conrad community\n\nEven though Vice reported that Giffing was a member of the White Student Union, he says that was never the case.\n\nGiffing says he regrets not taking a stand and refusing to participate. He also apologized for any hurt he caused, stopping at times while welling with emotion.\n\n\"That's not me. That's not the band. That's never been anything that we stood up for or want to be associated with. I have trouble putting it into words because it's a visceral thing. I feel like I'm going to throw up,\" he says. \"It's heavy. It's a real stain.\n\n\"I feel bad because I'm sure it affected many people negatively. I'm sure that patrol bothered people and I feel really bad about that. And then later to see Baltimore with such a problem with racism and the police department – I don't want to feel like I had anything to do with that.\"\n\nAs for Corcoran, who performs under the name Paddy Cardigan and Paddy Corcoran, he declined to comment when contacted.\n\n\"I don't have anything to say. I already know what this story is going,\" says Corcoran, who has also played with bands Paddy and the Brandywine Travelers and the Scrapple Creek Runners. \"It's going to be biased as hell. I'm not stupid. I've been through it before.\"\n\nSince the Vice report, Heimbach has since formed the Traditionalist Youth Network, which is listed as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nBoth have been tracking Heimbach since 2011.\n\nIn March, Heimbach resurfaced in the news when he pushed a female Black Lives Matter protester at a Donald Trump rally in Louisville, Kentucky. An April profile of Heimbach in The Washington Post followed the incident and carried the headline, \"This white nationalist who shoved a Trump protester may be the next David Duke.\"\n\nMarilyn Mayo, research fellow in the ADL's Center on Extremism, says there are different types of white supremacists, including \"intellectual racists,\" people who are educated and try to push their ideology through publications and other means. There are also the \"hardcore racists\" like neo-Nazis and skinheads who openly sport white supremacist tattoos.\n\n\"Matt Heimbach is someone who bridges the gap between those two groups,\" Mayo says. \"He is someone who tries to take an intellectual approach to white supremacy and is also trying to reach out to neo-Nazis and racist skinheads and build alliances with them.\"\n\nGiffing says he rode in a car to Towson University with two friends, one of whom was female, after hearing they were planning to patrol campus primarily because he was worried for their safety. He says he thought they would be \"trolling\" people on campus as a statement of free speech – not starring in a Vice video about the pro-white group.\n\n\"Even though I didn't agree with the stuff they were saying even prior to us going there, I thought it would be a bad friend move to just let them go down and not do anything to keep my friends safe in a situation that could be dangerous and harmful,\" he says. \"I wasn't there to be in it.\"\n\nWhile he knew a Vice reporter would be there, he says he was surprised by Vice's cameras and tried to stand next to the cameraman as much as possible to avoid being in the video. He is only seen in the video a few times and does not speak. \"I felt kind of blindsided,\" Giffing says.\n\nTaylor, Plague Bubonika's frontman, calls the video \"disgusting\" and the band has posted a statement on its Facebook page that reads in part, \"We never, ever, ever, ever, have been aligned with any of the views expressed in that video.\"\n\nAdds Taylor: \"We don't have any affiliation with any clan, clique, squad, group, club or union. We are Plague Bubonika and we stand for one thing: making music and having fun.\"\n\nWhile Beighley and Worth have repeatedly refused to play with Plague Bubonika, he said he would change his mind if Giffing disavowed involvement with the group and denounced their views.\n\n\"I'd be proud to share a stage with them if they say, 'Hey, it looks like we're associated with this, we don't stand for this,' and actually confront it and turn it into a positive,\" he says. \"That's what this is all about. People can change. You did a bad thing, you own up to it and make it a good message.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

{"question_id": "20240906_22", "search_time": "2024/09/06/23:01", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/us/firearm-recoveries-gun-violence/index.html", "title": "High number of firearm recoveries underscores America's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEarlier this month, two NYPD officers were killed while responding to a domestic disturbance call. According to authorities, the suspect used a Glock 45 that was stolen in Baltimore in 2017, prompting city and state officials to call for stronger measures against gun violence and gun trafficking across state lines. The tragedy highlighted a growing concern about the seeming flood of firearms across America.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in some of the country’s biggest cities seized or recovered near decade-high numbers of firearms in 2021, according to data provided to CNN. Many police departments also reported recovering high numbers of “ghost guns” — untracked and untraceable firearms that are often bought online and assembled at home.\n\n“We have to stop the flow of guns,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a press conference on January 24. “We are removing thousands of guns off our streets, and it appears as though for every gun we remove from the street, five are coming in. That is unacceptable.”\n\nIn New York, police made 4,497 gun arrests in 2021, up 3% from 2020 but a 26% rise from 2019. Adams said in the press conference that police had recovered more than 6,000 guns in the city last year.\n\nThe high volume of guns recovered comes as the country has seen a surge of gun violence since the onset of the pandemic. A CNN analysis showed that more than two-thirds of the country’s most populous cities recorded more homicides in 2021 than the previous year, with at least 10 setting all-time homicide records – with the majority committed with a firearm.\n\nCNN requested data on gun seizures and recoveries from police departments in over a dozen of America’s largest cities. Of the eight cities that responded with data through the end of 2021, all recorded more gun recoveries last year than in 2020, with several reaching highs not seen in at least a decade. Not all cities distinguished between guns recovered from crime scenes and those recovered from voluntary efforts, such as a gun buyback program, but the increases are indicative of growing numbers of firearms in America.\n\nIn Philadelphia, for example, police last yearrecovered 5,920 crime guns — a gun used or suspected of being used in a crime — the highest in at least a decade.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department (CPD) recovered more than 12,000 guns in 2021, up from 11,397 in 2020, including guns recovered through buyback programs and other voluntary means. Notably, last year’s total includes at least 706 assault weapons, which the CPD said was 62% higher than the number recovered in 2020.\n\nExperts say that increasing numbers of firearms and the difficulty tracking the true scope of both legally and illegally owned guns make it challenging to address gun violence effectively. Here’s what we know, and don’t know, about guns in the United States — and how better data could provide a key to understanding and reducing violent crime.\n\nGhost guns are on the rise\n\nLaw enforcement officials and gun violence prevention groups have sounded the alarm on the fast-growing threat of unregulated ghost guns. There is no background check required to purchase the parts needed to assemble a firearm at home, which can be done in less than an hour, and often at a low cost.\n\nData shows that these guns have been involved in shootings and found at crime scenes with increasing frequency. Several cities have reported sharp increases in the number of ghost guns recovered over time – and while they make up a relatively small percentage of the total number of guns recovered by law enforcement, that share is growing. Police in San Francisco seized 1,089 guns in 2021, about 20% of which were ghost guns. Just five years prior in 2016, ghost guns made up less than 1% of total gun seizures. Similar steep increases are apparent in other cities. Baltimore reported 352 ghost guns seized last year, with Washington, DC reporting more than 400 in 2021, up from 25 in 2018.\n\nRaj Vaswani, acting deputy chief of investigations for the San Francisco police, said the ghost guns officers have encountered are often more dangerous than typical firearms recovered by the department. The SFPD also reported that nearly half of the firearms recovered in homicide cases in 2020 were ghost guns.\n\n“The ghost guns that we do see are generally really high capacity,” he told CNN. “I’m talking about 100-round drums, really large capacity magazines.”\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) currently cannot trace most ghost guns because certain frames and receivers — two key components that make the firearm work — purchased online are not classified as firearms by the bureau.\n\nFollowing a 2021 directive from the Biden administration, however, the bureau proposed a rule in May that would allow the ATF to classify the building blocks that often make up ghost guns as firearms. This would require many dealers selling component parts to mark them with serial numbers, and the dealers would need to be federally licensed. When buying from these sellers, purchasers would need to pass a background check before buying a ghost gun.\n\nIt’s the first significant step federal lawmakers have put forth to combat the increase in ghost gun production – but the rule has yet to take effect. John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, called the rule “muscular” in its scope but stressed the need for speedy implementation.\n\n“Every day that goes by that it’s not [implemented], more people are killed. It’s a pretty simple equation. Delay equals death,” he said. Everytown for Gun Safety is a nonprofit that advocates for gun control.\n\nHigh demand for firearms\n\nIt’s impossible to get the full picture of how many guns have been purchased legally – let alone illegally – because of decades of successful lobbying for the privacy of gun owners. The FBI tracks pre-sale background checks, but there is no federal database of gun sales or ownership. Under the 2003 Tiahrt Amendment, the agency is required by law to destroy approved gun purchaser records within 24 hours after approval.\n\nWhile background checks do not directly translate to gun sales, the data can serve as a window into the country’s interest in gun purchases. The number of background checks jumped during the first few months of the pandemic and has been high ever since.\n\nBut it’s harder to draw a clear line between increased legal gun sales and guns recovered from crime scenes, said Adam Winkler, a professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in constitutional law and gun policy.\n\n“We shouldn’t necessarily expect a tight connection between the number of background checks and the number of guns that are found at crime scenes,” Winkler told CNN. “Many criminals do not buy their guns at gun stores.”\n\nGun advocacy groups and criminology experts have pointed to the uncertainty of the pandemic as a key driver for firearm sales. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade group, estimated that 40% of gun buyers in 2020 were first-time buyers.\n\n“It does seem like the pandemic has led to increasing desire for people to have firearms,” Winkler said. “The pandemic caused a major disruption in people’s lives. And when people’s lives are disrupted, they look for those things that can provide them security.”\n\nThomas Chittum, acting deputy director of the ATF, said the “vast majority” of legally purchased guns will never be used to commit a crime. But more guns in stores and in the home brings its own set of inherent risks.\n\nChittum says that part of the agency’s job includes outreach to gun stores to emphasize the importance of proper gun safety and storage in a climate of increased demand, especially among first-time buyers.\n\n“The more guns that are there and not really stored properly, the more that might be stolen. And we know that stolen firearms are a source of crime guns – a significant source,” he said.\n\nWinkler also cautioned against correlating firearms in the home with increased safety.\n\n“The gun lobby has for years been trying to persuade you that an important part of your security is having a firearm in your home, but the data doesn’t really support that idea,” he said. “The data shows that having a gun in your home actually makes you more at risk of being a victim of gun violence than it protects you.”\n\nAccelerating ‘time to crime’\n\nThe most comprehensive source that tracks crime guns is the ATF’s yearly Trace Data, which attempts to trace a gun to its original retail sale point. Because of restrictions in the Tiahrt Amendment, the ATF cannot publish detailed tracing data, and many gun purchase records are kept in paper format.\n\nThe aggregated data the ATF publishes, however, still provides insight into crime guns in the United States. One of the metrics it tracks is the “time to crime” – the time between when a gun is legally purchased to when it’s used to commit a crime. Its 2020 firearms trace report, published this January, found that the average time to crime dropped from eight years in 2019 to seven in 2020.\n\nAlarmingly, the percent of traces where the time to crime was under one year increased sharply over the past few years, from 16% in 2015 to 29% in 2020.\n\nThe ATF said in a statement to CNN that “firearms with a short Time-to-Crime have the most immediate investigative potential for law enforcement officials because they are likely to have changed hands less frequently from the time of the original purchase until recovery by law enforcement.”\n\nThe states with the highest time to crime on average were those with stricter gun laws, like California, Hawaii and New Jersey.\n\n“The most noteworthy thing is a lot more guns were recovered generally – and a lot more guns recovered that were recently sold,” said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy. The number of guns the ATF traced rose from about 217,000 in 2015 to just over 393,000 in 2020.\n\n“To me, I think it sort of reflects a very basic thing, which is more guns, more gun crime,” he said.\n\nLack of data\n\nThe data comes with large caveats. The ATF calculates time to crime based on the gun’s original point of purchase, which means transactions can be missed. For example: If someone sells a gun they legally purchased 10 years ago to a pawn shop, the pawn shop could resell the gun to someone who then uses it to commit a crime six months later. That gun’s time to crime would be recorded as 10 years rather than six months, as the pawn store would not be required to report the sale to the ATF.\n\nThe ATF noted to CNN that the time to crime metric has declined steadily over the past several years, and that while there was “no single factor” they could point to for the decrease, they mentioned the “the continual expansion” of their tracing system, as well as improved data collection to close gaps in missed transactions, as potential factors.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in many states are not required to submit recovered firearms to the ATF for tracing, though Chittum says the agency has “put a lot of effort into educating state and local agencies about the value of comprehensive tracing.”\n\nEven if recovered firearms are reported, not every gun can be traced. A report from the New York Attorney General’s office, which analyzed traced guns in the state from 2010 to 2015, described the process as “time consuming and prone to failure.” Of the 52,915 records the report analyzed, the ATF was “unable to obtain any state of origin for 12% of traces and a date of retail purchase for approximately 42% of traces.”\n\nData about gun trafficking – the term for when a gun is moved from a legal to illegal commerce stream – is also severely limited. The four most common forms of trafficking are gun thefts, straw sales, purchases on the unregulated secondary market and ghost guns.\n\nThe US government has not conducted a comprehensive study on sources of gun trafficking since 2000. Last April, the Biden administration directed the Justice Department to publish a new report that would be updated annually, but it has not yet been released.\n\nRising gun violence highlights need for action\n\nAs law enforcement officials grapple with a lack of comprehensive data and an increase in hard to trace firearms, gun homicides and assaults have risen steadily since 2020.\n\nIn its latest UCR report, the FBI stated that the number of homicides in 2020 increased almost 30% from 2019, the largest single-year increase the agency recorded since it began tracking these crimes in the 1960s. About 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019.\n\nAmid escalating gun violence, a Supreme Court decision this term could significantly upend decades of gun restrictions in major cities. In November, the court appeared ready to expand Second Amendment rights as justices expressed skepticism over an existing New York law that prohibits people from carrying concealed handguns in public. If the law is overturned in New York, gun advocacy groups and researchers argue that the ruling could have a ripple effect across the US.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Everytown for Gun Safety, one of those effects could be more firearm deaths. The study found a strong correlation between states that have looser gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths.\n\nWithout robust data collection on traced crime guns or gun ownership, and any lack of enacted rules about ghost guns, Everytown’s Feinblatt said law enforcement officers are limited in what they can do to effectively reduce gun violence.\n\n“When you can’t publish data about who are the bad apple sellers? That’s fighting with one hand behind your back. When you can’t publicize trace data and when the government isn’t finalizing the rule on ghost guns? That’s fighting with one hand behind your back,” he told CNN.\n\nVaswani with the San Francisco police stressed the impact that rising gun violence has on the families and communities, pointing to the shooting deaths of a toddler in Oakland last year and a 6-year-old in San Francisco in 2020, both killed by stray gunfire.\n\n“The byproduct of this is our neighborhoods, our kids, innocent people that get caught in gun violence that have nothing to do with it,” he said. “They’re just at the wrong place at the wrong time.”", "authors": ["Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/02/05/missouri-montana-distracted-driving-laws/11153311002/", "title": "Missouri, Montana are last states to implement distracted driving laws", "text": "Eric Berger\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nMax Herrick pulled over on the interstate near Harrisonville, Missouri, on a spring night in 2020 to offer antifreeze to a woman whose car had overheated.\n\nHe had lost a grandson to an overdose just hours before, but aiding stranded motorists was second nature to the 73-year-old retired school custodian, who remembered thousands of students’ names and regularly brought food pantry donations to a retirement community.\n\n“He always was there to help people,” said his son Bobby Herrick, who was in the car with him that night.\n\nJust moments later, a truck driver trying to text his wife a picture of the hand sanitizer he had purchased swerved onto the shoulder and plowed into the vehicles, according to court and crash records. While the truck driver was not injured and the woman and Bobby Herrick recovered from their injuries, Max Herrick became one of at least 382 people who died in Missouri crashes involving a distracted driver from 2017 through 2021, according to the Missouri Coalition for Roadway Safety.\n\nDespite such tragedies, Missouri is one of two states — the other is Montana — that do not prohibit all drivers from text messaging while operating vehicles. (Missouri has such a law for people 21 and under.)\n\nBefore this year, Missouri state lawmakers from both parties had proposed more than 80 bills since 2010 with varying levels of restrictions on cellphone use and driving. Similar legislation has been proposed in Montana, too. In both states, such bills have faltered, largely because Republican opponents say they don’t think the laws work and are just another infringement on people’s civil liberties.\n\nNevertheless, Missouri Republicans and Democrats introduced at least seven bills this session concerning hand-held phone use while driving — and road safety advocates think such legislation has a better chance of passing this year. Montana, meanwhile, has a bill seeking to block localities’ distracted driving laws.\n\n“I'm from the party that wants to minimize the amount of laws — and I agree — but you got to be smart about it,” said Jeff Porter, a Republican and former Missouri state representative who proposed legislation three times to limit hand-held cellphone use. “There are actually laws that are needed to try to provide awareness and save unnecessary deaths.”\n\nSupporters of hands-free driving laws concede that distracted driving restrictions are not a panacea for all traffic fatalities. And even if Missouri passes additional restrictions on cellphone use, small nuances in wording could influence whether such a law is effective.\n\nNationwide, about 3,000 people typically die in distracted driving crashes each year, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, though researchers suggest that’s an undercount. While hands-free options are now standard for new vehicles, the number of distracted driving deaths has stayed relatively steady. They represented at least 1 in 12 traffic fatalities in 2020.\n\nDistracted driving laws reduce fatalities — if, like the ones established in 24 states, they ban all hand-held cellphone use rather than banning only a specific activity such as texting, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association and a study published in 2021 in the journal Epidemiology. Banning texting alone does not make a difference, those researchers found.\n\nMore:Risky phone use while driving is soaring, and it's killing Americans, study finds\n\nOregon and Washington saw significant reductions in the rates of monthly rear-end crashes when they broadened their laws to prohibit “holding” a cellphone as compared with states that banned only texting, according to a study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Those two states also prohibited holding a phone when stopped temporarily — say, at a red light.\n\n“If you tell a driver that they are breaking the law just by holding the phone in their hand, a police officer who is trying to enforce that law doesn’t have to decide whether or not the driver is texting,” said Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute.\n\nBy contrast, California broadened its texting bans to prohibit “holding and using” a phone but did not specify whether that ban applied to a driver stopped temporarily. It did not see a significant reduction in rear-end crashes, which the researchers said are a more telling metric than the often-underreported crashes attributed to distracted driving.\n\nWhatever the cause, traffic fatalities have soared since the pandemic began. Among the 10 states with the highest rates of deaths from fatal motor vehicle crashes in 2020, according to the Insurance Institute, only one, Tennessee, had a ban on hand-held phone use for all drivers at the time. Among the 10 states with the lowest rates of such fatalities, all but Utah had a hand-held ban for all drivers.\n\nMontana ranked fifth-highest, and Missouri came in at No. 12.\n\nAdrienne Siddens lost her husband, Randall, who was working at a Columbia, Missouri, triathlon in 2019, because a woman using her cellphone to video chat was driving 18 mph over the speed limit and not paying attention to cars stopped at a red light. The driver swerved and entered a lane that was closed for the race, according to court records.\n\nThe woman hit two pedestrians, including Randall, who flew more than 127 feet. He spent most of the next six months on life support before dying.\n\n“I now have to raise our three beautiful babies alone,” Adrienne Siddens, who was pregnant with their third child when the crash occurred, testified in a March 2022 hearing on Porter’s bill. “With your help, passing this legislation and enforcing a hands-free policy, so many other families will not have to experience this grief.”\n\nRepublicans referred the legislation to the state House’s Downsizing State Government Committee. The bill died.\n\nState Rep. Tony Lovasco, a Republican who served on the committee, told KHN he’s concerned that either law enforcement could use a ban to stop people randomly or they would have difficulty enforcing it.\n\n“I’m very hesitant to adopt a prohibition on a particular kind of distraction, as opposed to simply enforcing the traffic laws and making sure that people aren't weaving in and out of lanes,” said Lovasco.\n\nIn Montana, Republicans such as state Sen. Jeremy Trebas not only don’t support a statewide ban, they want to overrule Missoula and the 14 other Montana cities, towns, and tribal governments that have enacted bans on hand-held cellphone use while driving.\n\n“These laws are going to make the roads more dangerous because people are just going to hide it and put the phone lower in their car instead of keeping their phone up and their eyes up,” said Trebas, who drafted legislation this year that would prevent local governments from enacting such ordinances. Trebas described his evidence to support that assertion as “mostly anecdotal.”\n\nJohn MacDonald, a former lobbyist for Missoula, opposed a similar bill by Trebas that failed in 2017. MacDonald ascribed resistance to a statewide ban to the same forces that made Montana the last state to establish a numerical speed limit; its limit was “reasonable and prudent” until 1999.\n\n“It's something ingrained in Montana that our vehicle is sort of an extension of our home, and the government should not be dictating to us how we can behave in that vehicle,” said MacDonald.\n\nA law like Trebas’ proposal already exists in Missouri: Even if a Missouri municipality establishes a ban on texting and driving, as the St. Louis suburb Kirkwood did in 2014, it’s not enforceable because the state says that its law supersedes local ordinances.\n\nAngela Nelson, AAA Missouri’s vice president of public affairs and government relations, said that her group’s past education on the perils of distracted driving has helped position new statewide proposals to pass this year. The group, part of a coalition that aims to curb distracted driving accidents, endorsed legislation from two Republicans that restricts holding an electronic communication device, as well as using one, while driving. Other Republican legislators introduced a measure to just expand the texting ban to all drivers, regardless of age. AAA has not taken a position on that one.\n\nLovasco, though, said it was too early to predict whether any will pass.\n\nSiddens, who has advocated for such bills since she lost her husband, remains optimistic that Missouri lawmakers will pass a tougher law after hearing about the tragedies for so many years. “At some point, they will do something about it,” she said. “They will have to.”\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

A previous version of the story overstated those figures.\n\nMore people have been killed walking the streets of Tennessee's largest cities in recent years, reflecting the national uptick in pedestrian fatalities.\n\nMemphis, which nearly doubled its number of deaths over six years, ranks among the top 25 large cities for its fatality rate from 2012 to 2016, according to a USA TODAY Network analysis of federal safety data. Nashville, number 70 on the list (out of 173 cities with populations greater than 100,000), saw a dramatic spike last year, but 2018 is looking better. Knoxville ranked 47th.\n\n“We just do not have a pedestrian culture here,\" said Stacy Dorris, a physician and pedestrian safety activist in Nashville. \"It was not designed very well as a walking community.”\n\nDeath on foot:Distracted driving, cell phones seen as factors\n\nPedestrian deaths:Nearly 6,000 pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2016\n\nStudies in Nashville and Memphis have pointed to problems such as crumbling concrete, missing sidewalks and long blocks without crosswalks.\n\nAbout 80 percent of Nashville's pedestrian deaths in recent years happened along state roadways, including the city's major pikes, said Nora Kern, the executive director of the nonprofit group Walk Bike Nashville. Old Hickory Boulevard is another hot spot, she said. The deadliest stretches are typically wide thoroughfares with multiple lanes in each direction, and long blocks.\n\nMore:Where are Nashville's most dangerous crosswalks?\n\nIn 2017, for instance, three people died on Old Hickory Boulevard, during a particularly bad year in Nashville.\n\nThe city saw 23 pedestrian fatalities last year, according to Metro Nashville Police Department statistics. The previous seven years saw an average of either 13 or 16 deaths per year, depending which statistics you examine — local police or National Highway Traffic Safety Administration figures. Federal data excludes crashes on private property and it includes a more narrow definition of a pedestrian.\n\nInteractive Map of Nashville Pedestrian Fatalities, Compiled by Walk Bike Nashville\n\nBased on Metro Nashville Police Department reports\n\nAdvocates and government agencies, both at the state and local levels, are leading construction projects aimed at improving safety. In Nashville, the city allocated $30 million for sidewalks in each of the last two fiscal years, but progress has lagged as the city spent more time planning than building. The pikes are especially problematic, Kern said, because of their width and lack of walking infrastructure.\n\n“To go back to add sidewalks is going to be very expensive,” she said.\n\nHer group championed a relatively affordable project at Nolensville Pike and Welshwood Drive. For $50,000, Kern said, the Tennessee Department of Transportation installed a \"pop-up crosswalk\" with warning lights and signage.

Why are they ...", "text": "Elaborate descansos line highways and streets across New Mexico, honoring lives lost. Here, where the pedestrian death rate has led the nation for six years in a row, families go far beyond a simple white cross. They add photos, tend colorful flowers, hang holiday decorations – and state lawmakers have made it a criminal offense to deface them.\n\nIn New Mexico’s remote northwest corner, these memorials stand watch over the multi-lane freeways that twist their way from the Navajo Nation and other tribal lands into the small city of Gallup. It’s exactly the type of disadvantaged place the Biden administration promised would benefit from a massive influx of federal money for safer streets. McKinley County is poor and home to Native communities often left out of such programs.\n\nBut two years into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s rollout, many places like Gallup have received little help even as millions go unused, a USA TODAY investigation found. In the $5 billion Safe Streets and Roads for All program, most of the money doled out so far has gone to more affluent counties with lower fatality rates.\n\nThat’s because the grants are structured to reward communities that already have the resources to pursue the funding: Detroit, for example, with an 18-member grant writing staff that’s raked in nearly $50 million to improve its streets. Or Montclair Township, N.J., a wealthy New York City suburb where citizens have demanded solutions from elected leaders. It got about $440,000.\n\nGallup, with no dedicated grant writer, where public meetings on transportation last year drew little interest, never even asked for the money.\n\nCrash records show they could certainly use it.\n\nScreaming train whistles punctuate life in Gallup, as milelong trains barrel along one of America’s busiest freight routes. The switchyard runs parallel to New Mexico’s primary east-west interstate, creating a half-mile-wide chasm for pedestrians between Gallup’s historic downtown and the newer stores and restaurants on the other side.\n\nRather than take a long walk around, some locals clamber over the tracks and dash across four lanes of 65-mph traffic. Stronger fences or a pedestrian bridge could have kept Jeremiah Begay, 23, from doing that in 2016. He was killed when two tractor-trailers struck him on the highway around sunset.\n\nYears of underfunding mean many city sidewalks are narrow and poorly maintained, if present at all. None existed along the unlit road just outside town where silversmith Roy Johnson died in 2022. Family members say he was walking near his home on a dark night when a Gallup police officer ran him over, but police reports say he was lying in the roadway when he was hit. The family’s wrongful death lawsuit is still pending.\n\nCenter lines and crosswalks have weathered away on many city streets. A simple coat of fresh paint or flashing lights might have prevented Navajo elder Benson Daniels’ death in 2021, when a van struck him in a faded crosswalk at a busy downtown intersection. His 26-year-old niece Brandy Grenier wishes someone in Gallup had sought help from the federal government so that no one else is hurt.\n\n“Now that I’m aware of this funding that’s available, I would definitely want McKinley County and the surrounding areas to take advantage of it,” she said.\n\nBut, they haven’t, and neither have hundreds of other counties with high fatality rates.\n\nTriumphant press releases have heralded multimillion-dollar grants scattered across the country, most to large cities with their share of dangerous streets. A USA TODAY investigation has found persistent barriers block the neediest communities from winning grants that could save lives:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation is supposed to ensure underserved communities have access to these grants, but the law that created the Safe Streets program never specified how. So, the agency has largely relied on outside organizations, newsletters and webinars.\n\nThe decisionmakers know the trouble spots since they’ve tracked traffic deaths nationwide for half a century. Despite this, agency staff initially told USA TODAY they had not reached out directly to hot spots to drum up interest for the federal funds. Five months after USA TODAY started asking for records of their outreach efforts, they said they have done that kind of targeted communication “in the past few weeks.”\n\nDepartment staff use three data points, including fatality rate, to grade applications but it’s unclear how much death played a role in decisions. A USA TODAY analysis shows nearly all of the money has landed in counties the department itself says have low fatality rates.\n\nThe Safe Streets program is just one of at least 20 new competitive grants that will divvy up billions of dollars in infrastructure funding over the next few years. Researchers have already pointed out the same few states routinely win this type of grant, and the Government Accountability Office testified before Congress last summer that rural, Tribal and other typically underserved communities often can’t compete.\n\nAs the third round of applications opens this week, the transportation department is expanding its outreach to places that need help with traffic safety, said Christopher Coes, assistant secretary for transportation policy, when presented with USA TODAY’s findings.\n\n“We have designed direct outreach,” Coes said. “Each year, we’re doing this data-driven and comprehensive review of where our impact is going really well and where are things that we need to do better.”\n\nSafe Streets Program Manager Paul Teicher said they have developed a list to target. He named Mobile, Ala., as one city they’ve encouraged to apply, along with Hartsville, S.C.\n\nCompetitive grants do have their place in rebuilding American infrastructure. Kristin Smith, who researches public finance with Montana-based nonprofit Headwaters Economics, said they can inspire innovative projects across the country.\n\n“But when it comes to funding that is meant to save people’s lives, that’s designed to meet people’s basic needs, a competitive grant, in my opinion, isn’t the right tool,” Smith said. “It’s regressive. You have to have resources to access it.”\n\nWhy hasn’t more Safe Streets money been awarded?\n\nTraffic deaths spiked in 2020, even with so many Americans staying home during COVID-19 lockdowns, following an upward trend that began over a decade ago. And that total leapt again in 2021, the latest available from government data, with crashes killing nearly 43,000 Americans that year and injuring roughly 2.6 million.\n\nOur investigation:Here's how USA TODAY analyzed federal Safe Streets for All grants accross the U.S.\n\nSolutions:Where traffic deaths are high, how can communities get the government's attention?\n\n“We face a national crisis of fatalities and serious injuries on our roadways, and these tragedies are preventable,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a press release launching the Safe Streets program, noting the grants “will help communities large and small take action to protect all Americans on our roads.”\n\nAfter that announcement, federal officials waited for the applications to roll in for one of the largest competitive grants in the infrastructure law. No one from the transportation department reached out directly to disadvantaged and rural places to tell them about the money.\n\nGallup, for example. Or rural Robeson County, N.C., where a mostly Native American and Black population struggles with one of the state’s worst fatality rates. Or Clayton County, Ga., just outside Atlanta, where the state has identified crash hotspots where crosswalks are hard to find, spaced a half-mile apart.\n\nSome places figured it out. The Safe Streets program has delivered funding to every state, with over 1,100 awards ranging from just a few thousand dollars for a remote Alaskan village to $51 million for New York City. For hundreds, it’s their first-ever federal grant, Coes said.\n\nThe bulk of the funding – about $1.2 billion – has been concentrated in 85 “implementation grants” – large, highly competitive awards to fix problems communities have already identified. New York City plans to use its grants to add bike lanes, elevate crosswalks and build other pedestrian safety measures along dangerous streets in Manhattan and Queens.\n\nOnly about one in five places that applied for these grants won, according to USA TODAY’s analysis. To be eligible, communities must have a safety plan that meets all the transportation department’s standards and write up to 12 pages making a compelling case for how the award would fix their safety problems.\n\n“It took five people of our seven-member team here in this department to complete that grant,” said Tomika Monterville, former transportation director for San Antonio, Texas, which won $4.4 million to build mid-block pedestrian crossings along a dangerous, multi-lane street.\n\n“You’ve got to have a good writer; you’ve got to have a keen understanding of all the programs that connect to tell the story of your community,” Monterville told attendees at a Safe Streets webinar hosted by a tech company last spring.\n\nThe rest of the Safe Streets money has been split into more than 1,000 smaller grants to help communities study crash hotspots and plan and test ways to address them. The department made applying for these smaller planning grants “as simple as possible” to attract underserved communities who have never gotten federal funding, said Cheryl Walker, associate administrator for safety at the Federal Highway Administration, at the same webinar.\n\nAnd grant recipients told USA TODAY it wasn’t the typical federal grant, with their pages of forms to complete.\n\n“The maximum narrative was 300 words, so it was like a paragraph. Or half a page, essentially,” said Stephanie Rossi, planning director for the Lowcountry Council of Governments, a partnership that earned nearly $300,000 to draft a safety plan for four of South Carolina’s southernmost counties, including the popular vacation destination Hilton Head Island.\n\nSouth Carolina had the fourth highest pedestrian fatality rate in the country for 2021, so Rossi said she was disappointed to see just a handful of other places in her state apply in the first round.\n\n“I'm not trying to ding my neighbor,” she said. “Maybe folks didn't realize the application process wasn't really that awful.”\n\nApplying for federal grants is typically more complex and time-consuming than state or local grants, and the news of how easy it is to get planning grants didn’t make it to many of the communities that might need them most.\n\nNow, two years into the program, the Department of Transportation has at least $230 million for planning grants sitting unused, simply because too few places applied.\n\n“Every complete, eligible application that came in received an award,” Walker said. “We want every entity out there, all the locals, to have these grants and these action plans in place.”\n\nThe agency knows where fatal crashes happen frequently. It’s compiled dozens of details on each crash for nearly 50 years, and last summer, department employees mapped out counties with high death rates. Only about a third of these counties have won any money. USA TODAY requested records showing how the department reached out to these places it labeled as “target areas.”\n\n“They did not engage in reach out to potential individual applicants,” wrote Victoria Schmitt in November. She's attorney adviser for the department’s Volpe Center, one of several offices that support the Safe Streets program.\n\nReaching out directly “might be overstepping what the federal government can do,” said Mariia Zimmerman, who leads technical assistance efforts within the transportation department. “If I called your mayor, and I didn't call another mayor, is that being unfair in calling one versus another?”\n\nBut after USA TODAY began asking last fall how the department has directly reached out to needy places with high death rates, they started to do just that. Teicher, the grant program’s manager, said his team has communicated with leaders of two southern cities “in the past few weeks.” They provided a list of 16 other places that have had recent contact with Teicher’s team.\n\nA separate agency team traveled to almost two dozen communities in the last year to encourage applications, spokesperson Sean Manning said, including the Navajo Nation, Arlington, Va., and Las Vegas.\n\nIt's a start, but USA TODAY found over 1,000 counties with above-average fatality rates that haven’t won any money.\n\nZimmerman said department employees are trying to raise awareness as best they can, but they also have limited time and staff. So, potential applicants must often seek out program details for themselves – whether by asking for help directly, watching the agency’s webinars or subscribing to emailed alerts.\n\nTens of thousands of local governments nationwide are eligible for funding, yet agency records show three webinars last spring each drew in about 1,000 people. Attendance trickled to just a few dozen as the webinar series continued. Over 19,000 people have signed up for the program’s mailing list.\n\nThe federal government also relies heavily on trade organizations like the National League of Cities to help get the word out, according to Coes, the assistant secretary for transportation policy.\n\n“Just because someone from Washington shows up and says, ‘Hey, I'm here to help.’ Not many people actually may trust that. And so, sometimes you have to engage trusted, valued partners,” Coes said. “We’re only halfway through this program, right? We’re recognizing that we’re going to have to marshal all of our resources. And so, for us, hopefully our data can help us fill the gaps and understand where we need to target our limited resources.”\n\nCoes pointed out the Safe Streets program is not the only money available for traffic safety projects, listing hundreds of billions of dollars in other grants. However, Safe Streets was specifically simplified and set up so even the smallest of towns could apply directly for federal money.\n\nPatty Holland, Gallup’s chief financial officer, said her city has several projects that would likely be eligible for Safe Streets funding, but the grant just wasn’t on their radar. Without a dedicated grant writer who can sift through thousands of options, she said they miss a lot of opportunities.\n\n“It’s very, very overwhelming what is available,” Holland said. \"We spend so much of our time pursuing all of those new (federal) requirements that change every year, we just don’t have the time to reach out and look for these. And even if they put us on the email list, we’re really not going to recognize a lot of it, because there’s just too much in our email.\"\n\nWho is winning federal Safe Streets money?\n\nWhen communities apply for Safe Streets funding, the transportation department asks for three data points: total roadway deaths, average fatality rate over the past five years and percent of the population considered “underserved.”\n\nIdeally, grants should end up in counties that score highly in all three. However, USA TODAY’s analysis found little correlation between a county’s total funding and those statistics. What most recipients of Safe Streets money do share is a larger population and a strong capacity to apply for grants.\n\nThey often have experienced government employees, colleges or universities and an engaged community with high voter turnout, stable incomes and health insurance, said Kristin Smith of Headwaters Economics. Her team developed a tool it calls a “capacity index” to help understand why some communities struggle to access federal funding.\n\nThe transportation department has announced about $1.7 billion overall in Safe Streets grants as of December, and 82% of that has gone to counties the index defines as “high capacity,” according to USA TODAY’s analysis. Meanwhile, low-capacity counties have received less than 2% of the money.\n\n“For the rural communities where I work (in Montana), they can barely keep up with day-to-day operations,” Smith said, describing a county without a single engineer, planner or grant writer on staff. “If you add in a federal grant with just one more task, it’s actually a big ask.”\n\nMany of the places least able to compete for grants are those most in need of this funding. The rural fatality rate is about two times higher than the urban rate, according to the 2022 National Roadway Safety Strategy, disproportionately impacting people who are Black and Native American.\n\nTransportation department officials point to data showing they’ve sent about half the grants to rural areas, which the agency defines as any urban area with fewer than 200,000 residents. That means even mid-sized cities like Amarillo, Texas, and Gainesville, Florida, would be lumped in with the tiny Montana county Smith described.\n\nHowever, that same data shows just one in five dollars has gone to rural places.\n\nMany of these rural grants have gone to affluent small towns, including dozens that reported few or no traffic deaths. They include places that serve as vacation gateways, such as Boulder, Colo. (which won $23 million); Missoula, Mont. ($9.3 million); Burlington, Vt. ($1.2 million); Nantucket, Mass. ($460,000) and Key West, Fla. ($400,000).\n\nJust one low-capacity rural county has managed to win an implementation grant: Modoc County, in the far northeast corner of California. The transportation department awarded nearly $13 million there to add bicycle lanes, crosswalks and speed controls around tribal areas.\n\nThat leaves hundreds of low- and medium-capacity counties without a cent of Safe Streets funding – even in places whose data would put them at the top of DOT’s scorecard – places like Gallup.\n\n“If this was a white community, there would be so much protection of the people. But we are disposable,” said Anna Rondon, who frequently drives her pickup truck the 30 miles between Gallup and her home on Navajo land.\n\nHer fiancé died and she escaped with crushed vertebrae when they crashed years ago on a narrow Navajo road. She said people around Gallup just don’t have the mental space to push for change.\n\n“Our people are living in shacks … if you ask any of the folks here, they’re just wanting to live. To survive,” Rondon said, noting how many families in her county go hungry. Food insecurity here is the worst in New Mexico, state data show, with more than one in five people lacking consistent access to food.\n\n“When you have a society like that, it’s hard to get people motivated.”\n\nWhy are so many dying in crashes near Gallup?\n\nThe average American county sees slightly more than one pedestrian killed per 100,000 residents each year, according to USA TODAY’s analysis of five years of federal data. For McKinley County, New Mexico, where Benson Daniels was hit in a crosswalk in downtown Gallup, it’s nearly 11 per 100,000.\n\nDaniels knew all the shortcuts through Gallup’s streets and alleys. He never owned a car in his 73 years, so he walked everywhere, even delivering copies of a local newspaper on foot after retiring from his job cooking at a café off historic Route 66.\n\nBut cataracts had started to blur his vision, so he’d been asking for more rides from his sister’s granddaughter. One of the last things Brandy Grenier remembers doing with the man she called Grandpa Benson was taking him for a haircut in late 2021.\n\n“And he was going on and on about how good he looks now, and that he was going to look good for the ladies at church. And that maybe now they'll sit next to him,” Grenier said, chuckling softly.\n\nA few days later, Grenier couldn’t help when Daniels asked her to run some errands on a cold December morning. She’d just tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n“If you could wait a couple of days, let me see if I can get someone to take you,” Grenier remembers telling him. “But, of course, he did not wait.”\n\nLater that afternoon, as Daniels slowly made his way across Aztec Avenue, an elderly driver didn’t see Daniels over the hood of his Chevy van until it was too late. Daniels was knocked to the faded crosswalk, smashing his head on the pavement. The Navajo elder suffered a traumatic brain injury and died in a hospital 10 days later.\n\nDaniels is just one of at least 40 pedestrians and more than 150 people overall killed in crashes across McKinley County in the last five years, according to DOT data. That list includes motorcyclist Janella Bryant, killed in 2020 as a drunken driver tore out of a liquor store parking lot, and Navy veteran Yvonne Jacobs, left to die on a dark bridge in 2019 when an intoxicated man drove away after hitting her. Multiple people were injured when a drunken man careened through a parade full of children performing traditional dances in 2022.\n\nMcKinley County checks the boxes for Safe Streets’ criteria of death count, death rate and an underserved population, yet its only funding so far covers tribal land an hour's drive from Gallup and its crash hotspots. It's getting a fraction of the $1.4-million planning grant the Navajo Nation is spreading across parts of several counties in Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nSeveral things explain McKinley’s high fatality rate: Some 21,000 people live in its county seat of Gallup, but it’s the only place with a 24-hour hospital or Walmart in a county larger than Connecticut. The population balloons on weekends when people from outlying areas rumble into town in heavy-duty trucks to stock up on supplies or eat at a chain restaurant. Hitchhiking is still common, with people leaning across the shoulder of highways at all hours to wave a dollar or two, hoping someone might give them a lift. And dozens of trains roar through town each day, mere feet from pedestrians walking along Route 66.\n\nState records show alcohol played a role in over half the county’s fatal crashes over the past decade. A local paper prominently features a “DWI Report,” noting that dozens of offenders have earned a second, third or even eighth charge for driving while intoxicated. But it’s not just the drivers.\n\n“Most of our pedestrian-related incidents are involving inebriated, intoxicated individuals that are crossing the street in an unsafe manner,” said McKinley County Sheriff James Maiorano III, describing what he called “a generalized civil disobedience.”\n\n“And it seems like it’s been a problem here forever,” he added.\n\nPolice reports say Yvonne Jacobs was intoxicated, walking home from a Gallup bar when a drunken man’s pickup truck slammed into her so hard it knocked her shoes off. Jacobs, a Gulf War veteran and single mother to a teenage son, died at the hospital less than an hour later.\n\nThe driver took a plea deal and never served time for Jacobs’ death, a common refrain among victims’ families seeking justice. Jacobs’ little sister, Cora Owens, took in her orphaned nephew and moved away, sickened every time she ran into the driver around their small town.\n\n“I’ve never felt the word ‘hate’ in my life until I lost my sister, and I seen that person sit across from me in a courtroom. I have never felt so much darkness in my heart,” Owens said. “I don’t know if my sister was drinking. Whether she was, whether she wasn’t, she didn't deserve to get hit either way.”\n\nRecent road safety audits from the state have proposed ways to prevent Gallup’s deaths, from installing iron fencing along the interstate for $450,000 to constructing a pedestrian walkway under the railroad for $10 million.\n\nA Safe Streets and Roads for All grant could fund these fixes or find other options. Pinellas County, Florida – home to vacation destinations like Clearwater and St. Pete Beach – won $2.5 million to cut deaths among drunken pedestrians and cyclists through education and enforcement campaigns, as well as more lights and physical barriers. Gallup, struggling with the same problem, didn’t even apply.\n\nWhat blocks small places like Gallup from winning grants?\n\nCompeting for grants takes resources small towns often just don’t have, said Evan Williams. He leads the six-member staff of the Northwest New Mexico Council of Governments, which helps McKinley County and two neighboring counties coordinate on transportation, economic development and environmental issues.\n\nWilliams’ staff points out grant opportunities to the tiny tribal communities around Gallup and helps review applications, but most of these places can’t keep grant writers on staff. It’s often the village clerk or manager who might squeeze a grant application between typing up local meeting notices or driving the school bus, Williams said, leaving them little time to decipher complex federal guidelines.\n\nAnd then there’s all the accounting paperwork to be done after winning a grant. That’s why Williams said they gravitate toward state dollars, which often require a smaller local investment and less-stringent reporting requirements.\n\n“If you barely have time to write the grant, you’re never going to have time to manage the grant,” Williams said. “They could use all the grants in the world, but they don't really have the capacity to manage them.”\n\nThe small city of Farmington, New Mexico, one county north of Gallup, is the only place in the state outside the capital of Albuquerque that’s applied for an implementation grant. It also struggles with above-average rates of alcohol-involved crashes and poverty, so traffic engineer Mark Hathcock tackled his first grant ever – by himself.\n\nHathcock requested $2.4 million to upgrade Farmington’s busy downtown intersections, but he said it was rejected because he didn’t supply enough data to justify the project.\n\n“I felt like I'd covered everything they had asked for, but it wasn't quite there. It was a huge learning curve,” he added.\n\nMost federal grants set aside a small amount to help less-experienced applicants like Hathcock navigate the process, and the transportation department uses that to fund initiatives aimed at rural and tribal applicants. But, to get more funding into the hands of places like Farmington and Gallup, experts say agencies should push beyond hourlong webinars and invest in teaching fundamental grant writing skills that could level the playing field for underserved communities.\n\nWithout advocates, who demands change from leaders?\n\nHundreds of miles south of Gallup, past dozens of roadside descansos and a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint, lies New Mexico’s second largest city, Las Cruces. There, in November, flickering candles cast shadows across photos of local pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists killed in what piano teacher Barbara Toth is calling the county’s “Deadliest Decade.”\n\nToth founded her advocacy group, Vulnerable Road Users New Mexico, after a teen driver in a pickup truck sent her husband Jim flying off his bicycle just blocks from their home in 2020. He survived, but the crash left him with debilitating spinal injuries.\n\nIt’s World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, and Toth circulates through 70 people gathered for a memorial vigil, leaning over to share her flame.\n\n“As we light the candles, we’re reminded that the victims we’re here to honor tonight were brothers. Fathers. Sons. Daughters,” she intones. “May who they are, and who they could have been, empower each and every one of us to make a difference.”\n\nLas Cruces has done well for itself in the race for Safe Streets funding. The surrounding county, Doña Ana County, earned $400,000 to study its roads and create safety plans in the program’s first year, and the city won an additional $400,000 planning award in December 2023.\n\nThe death rate in Dona Aña County is four times lower – about 10 deaths a year per 100,000 residents, compared to 42 in McKinley County – but Dona Aña has gotten far more funding.\n\nHeadwaters Economics’ capacity index shows Doña Ana has significantly higher capacity than McKinley, which leaves room for more community engagement. Las Cruces has passionate advocates like Toth who raise awareness and petition leaders for change on traffic safety. Gallup does not.\n\nEarlier this year, planning sessions for Gallup’s Master Transportation Plan lacked the impassioned speeches of Toth’s candlelight vigil. Several open houses and workshops sought public input last summer, but drew just eight people in all, according to the city’s website.\n\n“There’s just like this ho-hum shrug of the shoulders all the time, like, ‘Hey man, that’s Gallup. People just get hit, you know,’” said Scott Nydam, a former professional cyclist who founded Gallup’s Silver Stallion Bicycles and Coffee. He says it's the only bike shop serving the Navajo Nation, and his staff partners with local schools to get Navajo kids on mountain bikes.\n\nIn Las Cruces, Ashleigh Curry organizes walks to demonstrate road safety for elementary school students and their parents as the city’s Safe Routes to School coordinator. She and other local advocates pointed out that several cities across New Mexico already have road safety plans, often gathering dust on shelves.\n\nThose plans won’t save lives, they say, if they never advance into additional projects to fix dangerous streets.\n\n“If we truly, as a state and as a city, want to see a difference, we need to have a whole team of people who are working on this,” Curry said. “But we also need to follow the plans that we have.”\n\nOver the next three years, the transportation department will award the remaining $3.3 billion in Safe Streets funding. That means more opportunities for hard-hit communities to turn their plans into action.\n\nKristin Smith, the Headwaters Economics researcher, said she’s encouraged that more federal grants have been earmarking money for rural and tribal communities. She said doing so disrupts patterns built through years of systemic disinvestment, improving people’s lives.\n\nSafe Streets, though, has no such quotas – putting the have-nots at risk of falling further behind.\n\n“Not only are those places missing out on really critical funding to improve the safety of their residents, but they’re also missing out on economic development,” Smith said. “If we keep this cycle going and keep repeating these patterns, we just polarize the country even more.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/27/new-mexico-nm-alcohol-residents-drinking-themselves-to-death-high-rate/65379663007/", "title": "New Mexicans drinking themselves to death at extraordinary rate", "text": "Ted Alcorn\n\nNew Mexico In Depth\n\nAlcohol kills New Mexicans at a higher rate than anywhere else in the country — and no one can fully explain why.\n\nNew Mexicans die of alcohol-related causes at nearly three times the national average, higher by far than any other state. Alcohol is involved in more deaths than fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamines combined. In 2020, it killed more New Mexicans under 65 than COVID-19 did in the first year of the pandemic — all told, 1,878 people.\n\nThis outsized harm defies easy explanation. Alcohol kills people in New Mexico at higher rates than in states that are poorer, states where more people drink, and states where the drinkers drink more. “Our risk behaviors do not line up with our deaths,” said Michael Landen, New Mexico’s State Epidemiologist from 2012 to 2020.\n\nBut state leaders haven’t shown much interest in unraveling this mystery, or doing much about it. Last year the Legislature voted to make alcohol easier to buy.\n\nThis is the first of several articles that lay bare the damage alcohol does in New Mexico. The series draws on data gathered from a dozen national, state and local agencies and over 150 interviews, including police officers, clinicians, scientists, lawmakers, brewers, bartenders, liquor store owners, and people struggling in recovery.\n\nThe conclusion: Alcohol in New Mexico is an emergency hiding in plain sight — and we’ve failed to address the crisis, in part, because we’ve misunderstood it.\n\nWe’ve tackled intoxicated driving but overlooked alcohol’s broader harms, in particular its contribution to the state’s high rates of violence and trauma. We’ve assumed alcohol killed mostly Native people when, in fact, Anglos and Hispanics account for the vast majority of the state’s casualties. We’ve heaped blame on inveterate “drunks” when alcohol disorders actually afflict people with a spectrum of drinking behaviors.\n\nAnd we've given up on basic measures governing where and how alcohol is sold that can save lives. Those who profit from selling alcohol have advocated more effectively than people harmed by drinking it. And for decades the Legislature has killed efforts that scientists say can curb excessive alcohol use.\n\nAlcohol poses a thorny political problem because hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans enjoy drinking. It’s woven into everyday life, at weddings and barbecues and communions and sporting events, some of our happiest moments.\n\nAlcohol “transcends generations, centuries, cultures, geography,” said Rep. Antonio “Moe” Maestas, D-Albuquerque, a lawmaker deeply versed in the state’s liquor laws. “It's one of the most popular commodities — with the highest social cost.”\n\nAnd that social cost is growing. Over the last two decades, while death rates from heart disease and cancer in New Mexico declined, alcohol-induced deaths more than doubled. One in five deaths of working-age New Mexicans is now attributable to alcohol.\n\nAlthough the state’s escalating alcohol crisis is complex, it is not unsolvable. While this series doesn’t have all the answers, it raises the most important question for the state to answer collectively:\n\nHave we hit rock-bottom, and are we ready to make a change?\n\nAlcohol’s victims: scattered and shamed\n\nIn 2020, the most conspicuous alcohol-involved deaths were the more than 100 New Mexicans killed in crashes on public roadways, and the headline-grabbing victims of 100 drunken homicides. Behind closed doors, another 125 died by suicide with alcohol in their blood. Twenty-eight more drinkers died from falls, and a few more fell asleep outside and never woke up.\n\nBut most New Mexicans killed by alcohol died of chronic illnesses in a handful of emergency rooms and intensive care units.\n\nPerhaps no place receives more of these patients than the medical ICU at Albuquerque's University of New Mexico Hospital, the state’s largest. Of its 24 beds, recent medical director Dr. Erik Kraai estimated two to three typically hold someone who wouldn’t be there but for drink — specifically from ethanol, the organic compound common to beer, wine, and liquor.\n\nAlthough some people believe liquor is more harmful to health, there is no relevant chemical difference between these beverages other than their concentration of ethanol. A standard drink — 12 ounces of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor — is interchangeable. And as the number of drinks consumed rises, so do the harms.\n\nEthanol increases risk of certain cancers and injures the brain in ways not easily distinguished from Alzheimer’s, but the most profound impacts of heavy drinking are on the liver. It can inflame and scar the organ in a process that permanently alters its architecture, resulting in cirrhosis.\n\nAs liver function deteriorates, problems cascade. Nearby veins in the esophagus are put under pressure and may rupture and bleed. Toxins that a healthy liver would filter from the bloodstream accumulate, causing delirium and even coma.\n\nIn some patients, backed-up fluids flow wherever there is space to expand. In men this may include the scrotum, which can swell to the size of a basketball and become so cumbersome the patient must lie immobile, their legs elevated. Given medications with a laxative effect to help flush their system, too weak to get to the bathroom, these patients often rely on caregivers to clean them and their bedsheets several times a day.\n\nAlcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, and a constellation of illnesses attributed to alcohol abuse and dependence together killed 963 people in New Mexico in 2020 — a majority of the state’s 1,878 alcohol-related deaths — and drove the growth of its alcohol-related death rate. For example, alcoholic cirrhosis deaths increased four-fold between 1999 and 2020.\n\nKraai described these deaths as brutal, degrading, and unmercifully prolonged. But patients often lose their grip on their surroundings, he said. “I think it’s often more traumatic for the family.”\n\nThese deaths don’t make headlines or provoke legislative action in part because they’re little acknowledged beyond hospital walls.\n\nViral videos of ice-bucket challenges spread awareness about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS. Cancer survivors proudly run marathons to raise money for research. But people struggling with alcohol-related disease and their families are reluctant to draw attention to it.\n\n“Shame is one of the biggest obstacles,” said Angie Harbin, who struggled vainly to preserve her marriage to a man who couldn’t break his drinking habit. “Shame for the person that has failed yet again, shame for me that I couldn't fix it.”\n\nThe health system itself strains to count alcohol-related deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies deaths as “alcohol-induced” when the cause listed on the death certificate could only be due to drinking, such as alcoholic liver disease or acute alcohol poisoning. But that count is incomplete.\n\nIn many deaths, alcohol’s role is difficult to distinguish and doctors, coroners and medical examiners often fail to note it on the death certificate. To provide a more comprehensive measure, the CDC defines a broader set of deaths as “alcohol-attributable” or “alcohol-related,” which includes estimates of the share of deaths like cancer and strokes and falls and hypothermia that involve alcohol. By this measure in New Mexico, total deaths due to alcohol were double its number of “alcohol-induced” deaths.\n\nScattered across the health system, these deaths are rarely considered together by the public or policymakers, obscuring alcohol’s overall impact, one of several blind spots that affects New Mexico’s response to the crisis.\n\nBlind spots\n\nThis series will examine and debunk commonly held but mistaken notions about New Mexico’s relationship with alcohol.\n\nThe first concerns one of our greatest successes: reducing intoxicated driving.\n\nNo harm caused by alcohol has received more attention — and with reason: in the early 1990s the state’s rate of fatal DWI crashes was 70% higher than the nation’s. Then, a tragic Christmas Eve crash shocked New Mexicans and their leaders into taking action. The state summoned a whole-of-government response and made New Mexico’s roads safer. But today, DWI has overshadowed the state’s larger problem of alcohol-related deaths, 90% of which have nothing to do with traffic crashes, and a focus on drivers has hampered addressing those broader harms.\n\nIn contrast, the relationship between alcohol and violence is overlooked. New Mexico has among the highest rates of homicide, suicide, and child abuse and neglect in the country, and alcohol plays a bigger role than many public safety officials realize.\n\nOf people who die violently in New Mexico, 30% to 40% have alcohol in their blood, according to a New Mexico In Depth analysis of toxicology data — a finding one sheriff called “alarming.” Yet earlier this year when Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller publicly prioritized violent crime, neither connected that violence to alcohol.\n\nPerhaps the most pernicious myth about New Mexico’s alcohol problem is that it mostly affects Native people.\n\nNative Americans in New Mexico do die of alcohol-induced causes at four times the statewide rate, but Anglo and Hispanic people also have vastly elevated death rates compared to their peers elsewhere, and together account for 80% of residents killed by alcohol. If Native people are removed from the data, New Mexico still experiences a higher rate of alcohol-induced deaths than any other state.\n\nSome also falsely ascribe alcohol’s impact on Native people to a genetic predisposition or a cultural propensity for drinking without scientific evidence to back up that belief — and that deflects attention from the true underlying causes of alcohol misuse by Native people. In fact, a smaller share of Native people report consuming alcohol compared to other groups.\n\nMore relevant, experts say, is New Mexico's history of conquest in which governments stripped tribes of their land, barely funded their basic needs, ripped apart families through the boarding school system, and continue to threaten their languages and culture. “We're always still targeted,” said Janet Nez Denetdale, a professor of American studies at UNM and the first citizen of the Navajo Nation to earn a PhD in the field of history. “There's always still something of value to be taken.”\n\nThere’s another group that attracts an unwarranted share of the blame: inveterate drinkers. Dividing the population into drunks and responsible drinkers conveniently allows most everyone else off the hook but scientists no longer view addiction in this black-and-white way.\n\nAlcohol disorders emerge earlier and among far more people than generally believed, particularly in New Mexico. On surveys about substance use, one in four residents who had a drink in the previous month reports difficulty controlling their drinking despite adverse consequences on their lives, among the highest share of any state.\n\nMany would benefit from counseling during routine medical visits to simply reduce their drinking — yet primary care doctors rarely provide this basic service or FDA-approved medications to counter their cravings. More people in New Mexico need and are failing to receive treatment for dependence on alcohol — 73,000, according to the Legislative Finance Committee — than all other substances combined.\n\nHanging over all this is the misconception that the state can react to the consequences of alcohol only after the fact rather than preventing them through policies that change how people drink. There is strong evidence that certain measures can reduce the hazardousness of alcohol: maintaining limits on days and hours of sale, regulating the number of alcohol outlets, and, above all, increasing the price of alcohol by raising taxes. The Community Preventive Services Task Force, an independent government panel of scientific experts, has reviewed and endorsed all these policies.\n\nYet according to the New Mexico Department of Health, on the majority of these measures, the state “needs improvement” or is moving in the wrong direction.\n\nPaying the tab\n\nReversing the state’s surging alcohol-related death rate will require statewide action, but that first means ending the political paralysis that’s brought us to today.\n\nHow is it that the state with the highest rate of alcohol-related deaths in the country gives little attention to the problem?\n\n“It’s not like everybody is in agreement about this,” said State Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino, D-Albuquerque, a consistent champion for greater public intervention. “We have a serious opponent: there are a lot of people who make a great deal of money from alcohol.”\n\nNew Mexico keeps no authoritative account of alcohol sales but based on tax revenues, in 2021 the state’s alcohol distributors sold at least 48 million gallons of beer, cider, wine and liquor — enough to fill 72 Olympic swimming pools.\n\nJeff Erway, founder of La Cumbre Brewing Company, said his business had mostly rebounded from pandemic closures. \"Honestly, 2021 was a pretty good year for us,\" he said, \"and 2022 is looking okay.\"\n\nStill, despite being the third-largest craft brewer in the state, the 56,000 gallons of beer La Cumbre produced last year was a tiny contribution to the total. Small local breweries and wineries produced a fraction of beer and wine consumed in the state: in 2021 they accounted for 9% and 12% of sales by volume, respectively. Massive global conglomerates like InBev (which owns more than 400 brands of beer including Budweiser and Corona), Diageo (which owns scores of liquor brands), and Molson Coors produced the majority.\n\nBy a conservative estimate, 2021’s sales in New Mexico generated more than $1 billion in revenue, which flowed through 2,800 businesses licensed to sell alcohol: bars and restaurants and liquor stores as well as gas stations and supermarkets and even ski areas.\n\nThese interests routinely argue that any policy changes that limit their alcohol sales will hurt the state’s economy. A bold statement for an industry that accounts for just one of every 500 jobs in the state, according to a quarterly census from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which found brewers, wineries and liquor stores in New Mexico directly employed about 1,400 people.\n\nAlcohol trade associations argued their economic impact is much broader, estimating that the wine industry contributed more than $370 million to the state economy in 2020 and beer manufacture and distribution contributed $1.6 billion.\n\nBut that accounting leaves out damages caused by consuming alcohol. In 2010, the CDC estimated that drinking imposed $2.23 billion in costs on New Mexico ($2.9 billion in today’s dollars), a higher cost-per-drink than in any other state. That estimate includes years of productive labor that alcohol sapped from the state’s workforce, property destroyed in alcohol-involved crashes, healthcare expenses attributable to drinking, and salaries of cops and prosecutors handling alcohol-fueled crimes.\n\nSince that analysis, the state’s alcohol-induced death rate has more than doubled. If the price tag has grown in proportion, alcohol now costs the state more than $6 billion per year, dwarfing the economic impact of businesses that profit from alcohol. For comparison, booming oil and gas production yielded $5.3 billion for New Mexico’s state and local governments in 2021, according to that industry.\n\nPhilip Cook, a professor emeritus of economics at Duke University and one of the country’s foremost experts on alcohol policy, said New Mexican taxpayers who do not consume alcohol are paying the tab for those who do. “We're subsidizing people to drink by taking those costs and moving them from the drinker to the insurance companies … and to public agencies that have to pick up the pieces.”\n\nThe politics of change\n\nAt best, New Mexico’s leaders have tried and failed to address the problem. Most have ignored it and a few have abetted it.\n\nLanden, who worked to draw attention to alcohol-related deaths during his years in the health department, said governors of both political parties viewed preventive measures as “a nonstarter.” When he published scientific research about alcohol, he was pressured to soften his language, he said. “You would have to mince words about what were effective interventions.”\n\nMack Sewell, who served in four administrations as state epidemiologist from 1989 to 2012, said he recommended measures to reduce alcohol access on multiple occasions and each time they were squelched. “I don’t know how to say it in a delicate way: It was not popular.”\n\nJim Roeber, the health department’s alcohol epidemiologist from 2004 to 2013, credited the state for its effective work addressing DWI but said the growing number of alcohol-related deaths signaled that it’s time for a change in strategy. “Whatever we're doing, it's just not enough. We need more and a different type of focus.”\n\nIt’s unclear if politicians will take heed.\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has supported measures that increase access to alcohol.\n\nReforms to the state’s laws that she pressed for in 2021 made it easier for restaurants to acquire licenses to sell liquor. The final legislation also allowed existing license holders to deliver alcohol to consumers at home, and eliminated some of the remaining restrictions on sales on Sundays and Christmas Day, among other changes.\n\nIn a statement to New Mexico In Depth, the governor’s office defended the measure, saying it “included numerous safeguards” such as limits on the volume of alcohol dispensed and the locations where it could be delivered, and required the health department to study the law’s effects.\n\nMost important of all, the state's alcohol taxes —which public health scientists say should be proportional to the true social cost of alcohol—have fallen to their lowest real value in 30 years. A 2017 effort to increase them failed in the Legislature, and former health department staff said the governor hasn't shown interest in reviving them.\n\nBut blame for New Mexico’s inaction doesn’t rest with state leaders alone. Public interest organizations that seek to improve the state’s well-being either have focused on small slices of the larger problem or sat on the sidelines.\n\nA coalition of public health groups and citizens that emerged in 2017 to press for statewide changes in alcohol policy quickly fell apart. The local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving said it confines itself to making the roadways safer. “We don’t normally comment or become involved in alcohol issues, unless it relates to underaged consumption,” wrote regional executive director Lindsey Valdez. Alcohol poses such enveloping problems that no one sees them as their own.\n\nThe story is similar nationwide, where alcohol has contributed to more than one million deaths since 2000, part of a rising wave of “deaths of despair” that shrank U.S. life expectancy even before the COVID-19 pandemic. And no state has taken action sufficient to stem its harms.\n\nThe largest nationwide nonprofit organization devoted to the problem, the Alcohol Policy Alliance, has an annual budget of less than $50,000 and a single paid staff-member.\n\nNew Mexicans themselves are largely in the dark about the problem. “People just are not aware of just how much higher New Mexico's rates are than the national average,” Roeber said. And even after a full accounting of the devastation, change may not seem possible.\n\nWe tolerate tens of thousands of inebriated people — including lawmakers — taking to the roads each year. Delayed hospital care for seriously ill patients because beds and staff are occupied by patients there on account of alcohol. Billions of tax dollars spent reacting to harms rather than trying to prevent them.\n\nBut Landen says the past is no reason to become discouraged: A further increase in alcohol-related deaths is “not inevitable.” Just as alcohol’s harms have grown over the years, the state needs to make sustained efforts, addressing the problem systematically with state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nErway, the local brewer, is a proud member of what he described as “the oldest profession on earth,” but in his late 20s he spent five years teaching music at a school in the Navajo Nation. There, where several of his students were orphaned by alcohol, he got deeply exposed to the impacts of drinking.\n\n\"It is incredibly awkward to try to balance both your desire for people to enjoy your product — but to enjoy it in a way that is responsible to society and that is not detrimental to their health,” he said.\n\n“I do believe you can have both,” he said, adding, “It can’t be all or nothing.”\n\nThis reporting was made possible by support from the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism, the McCune Charitable Foundation, the Con Alma Health Foundation, and a fellowship from the Association of Health Care Journalists supported by The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nTed Alcorn is a writer raised in New Mexico whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic, and The Washington Post Magazine, among other publications.

JB Pritzker said at a news conference in August.\n\nBut opponents and advocates of the reform agree that, beyond simply ending cash bail, the law seeks to reduce the number of people incarcerated before a guilty verdict by limiting the circumstances in which a judge can order pretrial detention.\n\nRepublicans and state’s attorneys have continued to fight for changes to the law, up to a full repeal, arguing that while the intent may be to empower judges to detain more dangerous individuals, the bill as written is too limiting.\n\nA nonpartisan task force formed under the Supreme Court, meanwhile, is working to assist with implementation in the justice system ahead of Jan. 1 and has identified unclear or contradictory sections of the bill that lawmakers should reconsider before Jan. 1.\n\n“It is frustrating because many aspects of the statute are not clear,” retired Judge Robbin Stuckert, who chairs the Pretrial Implementation Task Force, said at a July town hall meeting. “They may be vague, gray areas. And again, we are charged by the Supreme Court to assist with implementation.”\n\nThe law’s sponsors in the General Assembly said they are working with the task force on legislation clarifying some of those matters – particularly when it comes to detainable offenses – for potential passage this fall.\n\nSAFE-T Act passed in 2021\n\nThe provision to end cash bail, known as the Pretrial Fairness Act, was included in the SAFE-T Act criminal justice reform passed in a January 2021 lame duck session. Short for Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today, the SAFE-T Act was a broad-ranging initiative backed by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus in the wake of a nationwide reckoning with racism in the criminal justice system following the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nIt was passed by the Senate just before 5 a.m. after an all-day session on Jan. 13, 2021, then cleared the House hours later. Pritzker signed it a month later.\n\nIt has been amended twice, addressing law enforcement concerns about use of force standards, clarifying some pretrial matters and changing language about police body cameras. But provisions regarding cash bail have not been amended since the bill’s 2021 passage.\n\nThe goal of the Pretrial Fairness Act was clear: to move away from the existing wealth-based system of pretrial detention in favor of one based on an offender’s level of risk of reoffending or fleeing prosecution.\n\nKeith Grant, a Lake County public defender and Pretrial Implementation Task Force member, said that citing and releasing people committing less serious offenses provides better outcomes, saves taxpayer money and frees officers to remain on the beat.\n\n“We find that when defendants are detained even for as little as, research shows, three days, they can become destabilized to the point of lacking all of the social netting resources that they would have otherwise had,” Grant said. “Keeping people in custody when they don't need to be actually creates a risk of harm to the community.”\n\nThe Loyola University of Chicago’s Center for Criminal Justice Research analyzed Illinois State Police data that showed that from 2020 to 2021, individuals jailed pretrial in Illinois spent an average of 34 days incarcerated.\n\nThe report predicted the numbers would decrease under the PFA for those committing lesser offenses while likely increasing for those held on more serious offenses because they can’t free themselves on bail.\n\nThe report further analyzed U.S. Department of Justice data which showed that in 2019, 50 percent of jail detainees in Illinois were Black compared to 15 percent of the population at large; 33 percent were white compared to 76 percent of the population; and 14 percent were Hispanic compared to 18 percent of the population. The racial disparity numbers were driven by Illinois’ three largest counties.\n\nOf those detained, 82 percent were being held on felony charges and 89 percent were being held pretrial.\n\nThe new law abolishes cash bail and provides for a presumption in favor of release for misdemeanors, traffic offenses and other petty offenses, provided a defendant is not deemed a risk to the community by the arresting officer.\n\nKane County Chief Judge Clint Hull, a task force member, said at a July town hall that the arresting officers will maintain similar discretion as they are afforded under current law.\n\n“Do they pose an obvious threat to the community or any person or are they a risk to… their own safety?” he said. “In both situations, if they are, the police – despite the fact that this isn't the most serious offense – (do) have the discretion to bring that person in to try to make sure that they can identify and address that issue.”\n\nIn most cases, individuals committing misdemeanors or petty offenses will receive a citation from law enforcement and a court date within 21 days.\n\nMore detailed pretrial hearings\n\nAfter the initial arrest, as under current law, judges will determine whether detention continues.\n\nUnder current law, bail hearings typically occur within 72 hours of arrest and last less than five minutes. Prosecutors detail the defendant’s charges and may recommend a bail amount. The judge then decides the conditions of their release, including how much money, if any, the defendant must post before their release from custody.\n\nUnder the PFA, the hearings will be more intensive. Defendants are given a right to legal representation and prosecutors can detail their reasons for continued detention.\n\n“One of the primary goals of the law is to make sure that we're having in-depth, detailed hearings when we're taking away someone's freedom,” said Sarah Staudt, an advocate with the Chicago Appleseed Center for Fair Courts, which worked with lawmakers on the bill.\n\nProsecutors wishing to keep an individual detained would petition the court for pretrial detention.\n\nUpon petition, the law requires an “immediate” detention hearing which could coincide with the defendant’s first appearance in court. If a continuance is requested and granted, the court would have 48 hours in serious felony cases to hold such a hearing.\n\nThe court would have the authority to detain an individual pending a continuance.\n\nFor pretrial detention to be ordered, the state must prove “by clear and convincing evidence” that the defendant committed the crime, poses a specific threat to a person or persons and that no other pretrial conditions can mitigate the defendant’s risk to that person or persons.\n\nIt’s a heightened standard that prosecutors have warned may be too difficult to meet within the short timeline, but advocates say is necessary to protect a constitutional presumption of innocence.\n\nFor lesser offenses, the court would have 24 hours to conduct the same procedure. The PFA makes no exception for holidays or weekends.\n\nLimits to detention\n\nState’s attorneys have been the most vocal critics of the law as written, arguing that it leaves too little leeway for judges to detain dangerous individuals in certain circumstances.\n\nAmong them is Republican DuPage County State’s Attorney Bob Berlin, who said he was not opposed to ending cash bail in principle.\n\n“I want to stress, this is very fixable,” Berlin said. “I'm not one of the people out there saying ‘Oh, repeal repeal, just get rid of it.’ We can fix this. And we can fix it before January 1.”\n\nJohn Curran – an implementation task force member, GOP state senator and former assistant Cook County state’s attorney – said he also didn’t oppose ending cash bail, but he saw several shortcomings with the system replacing it.\n\nHe, Berlin and other state’s attorneys have called on Illinois to emulate a system put in place in New Jersey in 2017, which eliminates cash bail but gives greater discretionary authority to judges to impose pretrial detention than does Illinois’ law.\n\n“The first big difference is New Jersey doesn't limit the number of offenses that are detainable,” Berlin said. “New Jersey allows judges to detain in any criminal offense, which would include misdemeanors. We believe that judges are in the best position to make decisions about who should be detained or not.”\n\nWhile the PFA does not create categories of offenses that are “non-detainable” under every circumstance, it does, as written, create circumstances in which a judge would have no statutory authority to detain a defendant that doesn’t have a prior record or present a risk of fleeing prosecution.\n\nAnother Loyola University study estimated that a judge would not have been able to detain the defendant in 56 percent of arrests that occurred statewide in 2020 and 2021 had the PFA been in place.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, according to the research, 193,387 people were admitted into jails statewide each year, with 90 percent held for some length pretrial. Due to varying lengths of pretrial detention, the report estimated there were between 13,827 to 15,994 people being held pretrial daily.\n\nOnce the PFA is implemented, between 44,000 and 70,000 individuals per year will be eligible for initial detention, the report estimated.\n\nAbout 70 percent of those would be in relation to domestic violence or violations of order of protections, according to the study, which is one reason the SAFE-T Act had support from anti-domestic violence groups.\n\n“If post-COVID trends continue,” the report reads, “that means somewhere between 89,000 and 115,000 individuals per year could not be initially detained under the PFA once the law goes into effect on January 1, 2023.”\n\nDetention standards\n\nCurran’s and Berlin’s concern lies in the language beginning on page 370 of the 764-page SAFE-T Act which lays out the specific circumstances in which a judge can order pretrial detention.\n\nThe language allows a judge to deny pretrial release if a defendant is a danger to an individual or the community and is accused of non-probational offenses such as first-degree murder, as well as aggravated arson, residential burglary, stalking, domestic battery, certain gun offenses and several specified sex offenses.\n\nWhile misdemeanors and other low-level offenses are generally non-detainable under the new law, all charges become detainable if the defendant is already on pretrial release, probation or parole.\n\nThe language also allows detention for individuals charged with a forcible felony “for which a sentence of imprisonment, without probation, periodic imprisonment or conditional discharge, is required by law upon conviction.”\n\nThe task force has noted that language specifically excludes offenses for which a defendant is eligible for probation. Berlin said that means, under the law as written, judges cannot order pretrial detention of an individual accused of second-degree murder, drug trafficking, arson, robbery, aggravated battery, threatening a public official and other probational offenses unless prosecutors prove they are a risk for “willful flight” from prosecution.\n\nThe willful flight standard, unlike the dangerousness provision, can be applied to anyone committing a crime greater than a Class 4 felony – which includes many property crimes and offenses such as aggravated DUI and driving on a revoked license – who is deemed by a judge as “planning or attempting to intentionally evade prosecution by concealing oneself.”\n\nBut because the law states that past non-appearances in court are “not evidence of future intent to avoid prosecution,” Berlin said it will be difficult to prove.\n\n“I mean, you’ve gotta show that they’ve got a ticket to get out of town,” Berlin said.\n\nAdvocates, however, say the differentiation between the willful flight and dangerousness standards was intentional, although further changes may be forthcoming.\n\n“If someone's going to cooperate with the prosecution in a nonviolent case, we don't want a situation where they're being detained,” Staudt said.\n\nSen. Robert Peters, a Democrat and Senate co-sponsor of the law, said he’s open to discussions about amending the bill’s willful flight standards and detainable offense language based on the Pretrial Implementation Task Force’s recommendations.\n\n“Anytime you take human life and you're saying I'm going to take away their freedom, that should be somewhat of a higher standard,” he said. “What I again will say is that I'm willing to have conversations about the practices of this.”\n\nRep. Justin Slaughter, a Chicago Democrat and the law’s House sponsor, said language regarding detainable offenses in the existing bill is “misleading” and “unclarified,” and his plan is to address it in follow-up legislation this fall.\n\n“We will have a system that prioritizes public safety, and we will have a system (in which)… there's no such thing as a non-detainable person,” Slaughter said when asked about the goal of follow-up legislation at a Thursday news conference.\n\nHe declined to go into specifics due to ongoing discussions.\n\nCurran, who said he’s been pushing for such changes since January 2021, noted another section of the bill states that “at each subsequent appearance” in court, a judge must find that continued detention of a defendant is necessary “to avoid the specific, real and present threat to any person or of willful flight from prosecution to continue detention of the defendant.”\n\nCurran said that will make it more difficult to detain an individual after their first appearance by leaving out a community safety standard that’s included elsewhere in the bill.\n\nThe task force identified the language as problematic, and advocates have said standardizing the language throughout the bill will be a goal of follow-up legislation.\n\nCapitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government that is distributed to more than 400 newspapers statewide.

These deaths also included motor vehicle crashes that happened as a result of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nAlcohol-related deaths made up 2.8% of all deaths in 2019 and 3% in 2020.\n\n“We’re not surprised. It’s unfortunate, but we sort of expected to see something like this,” Aaron White, lead author of the study and a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said.\n\n“It’s not uncommon for people to drink more when they’re under more duress, and obviously, the pandemic brought a lot of added stress to people’s lives. In addition to that, it reduced a lot of the normal outlets people have for coping with stress, [like] social support and access to gyms.”\n\nThe researchers also saw a 16.6% increase in deaths caused by any reason between 2019 and 2020, but the shift in alcohol-related deaths surpassed that in an “unprecedented leap,” White said.\n\nThe study analyzed death certificates provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics for people 16 and over between 2019 and 2020. The researchers identified all deaths in which alcohol was listed as an underlying cause.\n\nThe researchers also looked at the CDC’s provisional data for the first half of 2021. They found that January 2021 was the month with the highest number of alcohol-related deaths between January 2019 and June 2021.\n\nThe spike in alcohol-related deaths in the first year of the pandemic was seen across all age groups. The largest change in alcohol-related deaths was among 35- to 44-year-olds, with a nearly 40% increase.\n\nAlthough more men have alcohol-related deaths, the rate for women is accelerating.\n\n“These measures have been escalating faster for women. That’s one of the things that’s been very clear over the last 20 years,” White said.\n\nAs drug overdose deaths continue to hit record highs, according to the CDC, opioid overdose deaths that involved alcohol also increased about 41% during the first year of the pandemic. In fact, overdoses from alcohol, along with overdoses of other drugs in which alcohol was involved, are second to liver disease as the top underlying factors for alcohol-related deaths. Liver disease makes up a third of deaths involving alcohol, according to White.\n\nWhite also said that the increasing rate of deaths involving alcohol is a reflection of increasing alcohol consumption.\n\n“Nationwide, there was about a 3% increase in alcohol sales, which is the biggest increase … in 50 years,” he said.\n\nThe numbers reflected in the study are probably underestimates, though. White said alcohol is not always reflected in a death certificate, even if it is involved with the death. For example, death certificates “way underestimate” the role of alcohol in traffic fatalities.\n\n“Deaths involving alcohol reflect hidden tolls of the pandemic,” the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nConsidering these trends, White said it’s important for care providers to start thinking about what’s causing this uptick in the first place, to increase screening to and openly ask patients about their alcohol use.\n\n“We need to help people learn how to cope in healthy ways,” he said. “It’s not enough to prevent unhealthy behavior. We need to go that next step and promote healthy behavior.”\n\nAlthough the numbers are grim, White is somewhat optimistic: “I also see hope in this.

Alcohol and drugs can impair a person’s reaction time, thinking and physical ability to navigate the road.\n\nEvery day in the US, 29 people die in car crashes that involve an alcohol-impaired driver, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and it’s unclear how many more are killed in accidents involving drivers under the influence of drugs.\n\nHowever, the researchers of the new study sought to expand what’s known about road safety by looking beyond drivers. Their study, published this week by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, looked at information on passengers, bikers, electric scooter riders and pedestrians who were involved in accidents, as well as drivers.\n\nThe study found that a quarter of serious or fatal accidents involved someone who tested positive for some form of weed, and nearly a quarter more had alcohol in their system.\n\nAbout 11% of peopletested positive for some form of stimulant, like cocaine or methamphetamines, and 9% had opioids in their system.\n\nIn 32% of the fatalaccidents and 18% of the ones with serious injuries, there were two or more drugs in the system of someone involved. That’s in line with previous research that found that the combined use of substances such as cannabis and alcohol, for instance, leads to more severe injuries and more fatal driving accidents compared with either substance alone, particularly for younger drivers.\n\nThe researchers said it’s important to note that having a substance in someone’s system doesn’t necessarily mean they were impaired.\n\nThey looked at records from September 2019 through July 2021 from Level 1 trauma centers in Jacksonville, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Miami; Baltimore; Worcester, Massachusetts; Iowa City, Iowa; and Sacramento, California.\n\nThe findings are not necessarily generalizable to the nation as a whole, but Amy Berning, a research psychologist who worked on the report, said the researchers chose trauma centers that represented areas with a large patient pool from urban and rural areas.\n\n“We’ve had this concern over many years about people who are driving alcohol or drug positive,” Berning said. “We’ve seen it in other studies as well, that there’s percentages of people that we see driving and traveling other ways on the roadways as well, and it does indicate that we need to ensure that we are continuing our efforts in prevention and various countermeasures to address impaired driving.”\n\nIn February, a national survey found that more than 40% of people using alcohol or cannabis report driving under the influence.\n\nImpaired-driving crashes “are particularly tragic because they are 100% preventible. There’s no reason and no excuse to drive impaired by alcohol or other drugs. Driving while impaired, whether by alcohol or other drugs legal or illegal, is against the law in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,” said Ann Carlson, acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nImpaired driving is responsible for more than 10,000 deathsin the US every year, Carlson said. These numbers had been trending down for several years, said Alex Otte, national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, but they’ve been creeping back up during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe new study’s findings strike her as “insane.”\n\n“I think there is a message here in driving home to people that even if you aren’t the one making the wrong choice, thinking about the fact that you are on the road with people – potentially more than 50% of people – who are on something, whether it’s alcohol or other drugs, to realize the sheer magnitude of that number will not only demonstrate the reasons for the numbers of injuries and fatalities but also how it is such a problem,” Otte said. “The message that we all can be a part of the solution here is one that’s really important.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe said it’s important to make a plan, especially around the holidays, when so many people are celebrating.

The Mexican Defense Ministry leak previously made headlines for exposing military corruption and surveillance abuse, and now reveals the trace data on American-sold firearms recovered since 2018.\n\nDespite efforts to stem the flow, these American firearms are smuggled south as part of the cycle of Latin-American narcotics headed north. The violence in Central America fueled, in part, by guns also has contributed to the migration crisis at the U.S. border.\n\nAn avalanche of guns:Explore the visual investigation\n\nAs part of the leak, emails relaying U.S. government data between Mexican military leaders and PowerPoint presentations by Mexico’s attorney general show which American straw buyers were tied to the most weapons as of 2022.\n\nAmong them is Texan Craig Adlong. He pleaded guilty in 2020 for lying on firearm transaction forms, saying the guns were for his personal use. He purchased 95 semi-automatic rifles at Guns Unlimited in Katy, Texas, making seven visits over two months.\n\nSixty-six of those firearms were recovered in Mexico, according to the leak.\n\nReached by phone, Adlong told USA TODAY he was surprised he remained on Mexican officials' radar after serving a six-month prison sentence. He made a mistake, he said, that he has put behind him.\n\nAsked if he worries about acts of violence being committed with guns tied to his name, he said, “Absolutely. You’d have to be an animal not to.”\n\nOf the other six top purchasers, half are linked to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives scandal known as Fast and Furious.\n\nFrom 2006-2011 agents in Arizona stood down as straw purchasers illegally bought 2,000 guns at shops, intending to use the information to track trafficking patterns and arrest the kingpins. However, agents didn’t deliver the high-level arrests – and in the process, they lost track of hundreds of guns.\n\nOne of those guns was recovered at the Nogales, Arizona, crime scene where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in 2010 when his tactical unit attempted to arrest a band of robbery suspects.\n\nHundreds of Fast and Furious firearms have previously been traced to other shootings in Mexico. The new leak indicates hundreds more are still being found.\n\n“It’s appalling,” said Peter Forcelli, a retired ATF deputy assistant director who recently wrote a book critical of Fast and Furious. “This is a stain we all wear. We had a duty to stop the flow of guns and we’re failing.”\n\nForcelli said it’s no surprise that guns purchased more than a decade ago in Tucson, Arizona, continue to show up in gun battles in Michoacán, Mexico: “They’re not like apples or loaves of bread; guns will be around until they get recovered at a crime scene used by the cartels.”\n\nUSA TODAY utilized cloud computing infrastructure to securely analyze the data. Servers churned for several days to process the hacked material into a searchable format, and the entire project took several months to complete. The database of emails consists of more than 10 million records and spans six terabytes – which would roughly fill 8,000 physical filing cabinets if printed on paper.\n\nGun trace data is kept out of public view by a rider to a Congressional bill known as the “Tiahrt Amendment,” passed in 2003 to shield gun shops from scrutiny. Each year, the ATF provides a count of the guns recovered in Mexico that had been bought in the U.S., with no further details.\n\nThe leaked Mexican communications expose a dark reality behind those numbers: “It’s bodies on the streets,” said Alejandro Celorio, a legal adviser to Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who confirmed the leaked material used for this report was legitimate.\n\n“I respect that the U.S. government wants this shielded, but it’s frustrating that the information isn’t public,” said Celorio, who is leading his country’s lawsuit against American gun manufacturers and five Arizona gun shops. “I think the average American would be surprised that the fentanyl crisis is nurtured because of the number of firearms going to Mexico to empower the cartels.”\n\nAmerican gun shops are selling guns that end up in Mexico\n\nPartnering with American attorneys, Celorio is going after Barrett, Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. in a $10 billion suit that was revived by an appeals court in March.\n\nIn a separate suit, they have accused five Arizona gun shops – many of which also appear in the hacked data obtained by USA TODAY, of selling guns that crossed the border and were used in crimes.\n\nMexican officials are particularly concerned about Arizona and Texas big-box stores near the border such as Academy Sports + Outdoors and Cabela’s because of how often they sell multiple rifles in a single transaction. Those stores sold 727 and 215 respectively of the guns recovered in Mexico from 2020 to 2022.\n\nCorporate representatives for those companies did not respond to detailed questions from USA TODAY.\n\nThe documents call out Zeroed In Armory in Pearland, Texas, as the source of 75 recovered firearms. That shop was the center of a gun trafficking ring raided by the ATF in 2020.\n\nFederal agents said the Pearland shop did nearly $1 million in cash transactions in 2019 – an indicator of trafficking. It sold six Barrett .50 caliber rifles to an unemployed American that were later recovered in the Mexican home of a high-level cartel leader, according to court documents.\n\nThe shop is now closed and the owner, Khalid Abdulaziz, is serving a 10-year federal sentence.\n\nTrace data also points to Ammo AZ, a Phoenix shop, as having sold 46 firearms recovered at Mexican crime scenes. That shop is named in the Mexican government suit as having provided semi-automatic rifles to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel in Mexico. A spokeswoman Ammo AZ declined to answer questions, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nBroadly, gun shops and manufacturers claim they are insulated from many civil suits tied to criminal behavior with guns by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n\nFirearm trade associations like the National Shooting Sports Foundation contend that ATF’s own data shows corrupt dealers represent a tiny fraction of the nation’s 80,000 gun shops. Of the 9,700 cases ATF made for illegal trafficking from 2017 to 2021, just 136 were tied to gun dealers.\n\nIn Mexico, firearm purchases are much different than in the U.S. Civilians are only able to obtain a firearm legally from two stores in the entire nation and only after months of paperwork and registrations. That means a majority of gun crimes are committed with smuggled American firearms.\n\nThe leaked emails are largely bureaucratic intelligence sharing. But they reflect the violence fueled by those guns.\n\nOne example: weekly briefings about homicides tied to organized crime. In a single week in September 2020, staff at CENAPI – the attorney general’s crime analysis hub – traced 389 events and 455 victims. Most happened in the state of Guanajuato, now among the most violent regions in the country.\n\nThe classified emails also include photos of suspects, seized body armor, rows of rifles, garbage bags of marijuana and carloads of methamphetamine.\n\nAlamdar Hamdani, U.S. Attorney for the Texas Southern district in Houston, said he’s assigned 70 prosecutors to the district’s 400-mile stretch of border, which he called “the front line when it comes to dealing with the cartels.”\n\nHe rattled off the Sinaloa, CJNG, Del Norte and Gulf cartels as having an insatiable appetite for American guns and said that agents are constantly building cases with confidential informants, undercover buyers and stings.\n\n“The message is the same as counterterrorism: You should be reticent about taking that step, making a quick buck straw purchasing firearms for someone you don’t know,” Hamdani told USA TODAY.\n\nWho are the straw buyers tied to Mexico?\n\nThe hacked material identifies a series of straw purchasers who caught the attention of Mexican officials as behind a high volume of traces.\n\nThe top purchaser identified by Mexico in the documents is Uriel Patiño, who served a 70-month prison sentence after taking a plea deal in 2014. Patiño was notorious for being the top straw purchaser in the Fast and Furious debacle, purchasing 700 guns under ATF’s watch. CBS reported that two AK-style Romanian-made, U.S.-sold WASR-10 rifles purchased by Patiño ended up at a crime scene in Culiacán in 2013.\n\nTwo other purchasers, Sean Christopher Steward and Carlos Armando Celaya – both prosecuted in the Fast and Furious operation – also appear in the data.\n\nMexican state police in Tamaulipas cracked open four refrigerators imported from the U.S. on June 17, 2020. Inside, they discovered 54 firearms. American prosecutors said 33 of those were traced back to Michael Mummert of Texas, who was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nWhat types of weapons are recovered in Mexico?\n\nDetailed trace data in the leak provides the make, model, serial number and first point of sale for weapons recovered at crime scenes in Mexico.\n\nIt offers a window into the demand for cheaply made, American-sold arms.\n\nThe most traced American-made firearm in the 2018-2020 dataset is the semi-automatic Anderson Manufacturing AM-15, often viewed as a “budget” variant of the AR-15 chambered to shoot the popular 5.56 x 45mm ammunition.\n\nMexican officials recovered more than 500 of the weapons made in Kentucky and sold in shops in 16 U.S. states. The AR-style rifles have become a weapon of choice for American mass shooters recently in Buffalo, New York, Louisville, Kentucky, and Nashville, Tennessee – as well as in Uvalde, Texas, where an 18-year-old killed 19 elementary students and two teachers two years ago.\n\nPolice in Uvalde feared the rifle’s firepower, delaying their response to the shooting: “AR. He has a battle rifle,” one officer reportedly told another.\n\nThe second-most recovered firearm was the Colt Government pistol, with more than 480 recoveries. That model was the standard-issue U.S. military sidearm from 1911 to 1985.\n\nAnother popular gun is the AK-47 replica Century Arms RAS47 made in Vermont. In Mexican slang, they’re known as “cuernos de chivo,” goat’s horns, because of the curved magazines extending from the Soviet-era Kalashnikov knockoffs popularized in cartel culture.\n\nEqually popular in Mexico is the U.S.-imported WASR-10 version of the AK. That’s the Romanian-made rifle used by a shooter in Gilroy, California, in 2019 to kill three and wound 17. Those victims sued the Vermont importer alleging it is funneling “uniquely lethal” semiautomatic rifles to criminals.\n\nAmerican and Mexican security officials have issued public warnings about an ongoing arms race for high-quality, heavy weaponry. The leak backs that up, showing the recovery of 121 of the .50 caliber Barrett rifles – among the most powerful weapons civilians can purchase, which can penetrate armor plates more than a mile away.\n\nMike Weddel, the ATF special agent in charge of the Houston office, said drug trafficking organizations south of the border seem to have an unlimited supply of cash to pay top dollar for smuggled guns.\n\n“My understanding is typically a firearm like an AR that retails for $1,000 here, by the time it winds up in Mexico it has doubled or tripled in value,” Weddel said. “It’s a vicious cycle. We’re consumers of narcotics and there’s an ongoing war in Mexico over the routes of those narcotics and that’s enforced with the use of firearms.”\n\nWeddel said he’d like to see even more Mexican police agencies submitting trace requests to the ATF on guns they recover, to help pinpoint trafficking patterns.\n\nJon Lowy, president of the Global Action on Gun Violence group that is part of the suit against gun manufacturers and shops, said the release of the trace data should put pressure on the dealers to do more to stem the flow.\n\n“Gun dealers and the industry has known for decades that the criminal gun market is supplied by traffickers and straw purchasers through irresponsible dealers,” Lowy said. “The response was to seek special protection from civil liability and hide this information in the shadows. Responsible gun dealers don’t sell those guns and alert law enforcement when they see high-risk behavior.”\n\nContributing: Lou Barone, architect, Gannett technology operations; Steve Fisher, for USA TODAY in Mexico City.\n\nNick Penzenstadler is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

That’s the lowest number of new cases the university’s main campus has reported since the week prior to the start of the fall semester Aug. 17. The total reflects only self-reported positives and not the results of every test from the Auburn University Medical Clinic or at any other testing site. Auburn also reported a decrease in positivity rate during the second week of its voluntary testing program, from 6.4% of 621 tests to 1.8% of 329 tests. “It’s always a good thing to see the number of positive cases go down. You can’t see it behind my mask, but I’m happy,” AUMC director Dr. Fred Kam said in his weekly video update, while noting he also expects there could be another spike in the coming weeks because of the Labor Day weekend.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage School District has established a target date of Oct. 19 to bring some students back into school buildings temporarily closed because of the coronavirus. District Superintendent Deena Bishop said officials plan to make an announcement this week about when and how in-person schooling could begin, Alaska Public Media reports. The district will start with elementary and special education students, Bishop said. The ability to bring students back largely depends on the number of COVID-19 cases reported in the state’s largest city, which Bishop said adheres to the most recent guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control. The target number of daily new cases averaged over 14 days is 29 and below. Last week the city’s daily average was 41. Prior to a full reopening, students in third grade and below will be able to visit classrooms in small groups to be tutored by volunteer teachers to build reading skills.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona as a “last-ditch effort” will ask students to voluntarily shelter in place for the next two weeks, University President Robert Robbins said, citing a troubling uptick in coronavirus cases among students. “What changed? Students came back, and they started partying,” Robbins said during a briefing Monday. The school will urge students on campus and in certain nearby areas only to go out for essentials, medical appointments or classes that are conducted in person. The shelter-in-place recommendation will also apply to sorority and fraternity houses and some high-rise apartment buildings. Officials reported Friday that 176 students were quarantining in dorms, and 53 were quarantining elsewhere. The school has two designated quarantine dorms and may open a third. Since July 31, 770 students and four university employees have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday reported 399 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 10 more deaths from the illness caused by the virus. The Department of Health said 992 people have died from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, since the pandemic began. The Department of Health also reported that the number of active cases at the state’s public schools has grown to 574. And it reported 1,065 active cases at the state’s colleges and universities, with the vast majority at the University of Arkansas’ main campus in Fayetteville. There continued to be discrepancies, however, between the state’s figures and those announced by individual campuses. The state reported 735 active cases at UA, while the school on Monday said it has 334. Arkansas State University in Jonesboro reported 187 active cases, more than three times as many as the state’s tally.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Fitness centers have filed a lawsuit alleging Gov. Gavin Newsom’s measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus unfairly target the industry and demanding they be allowed to reopen more widely. The California Fitness Alliance, which represents nearly 300 businesses, filed the suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Scott Street, a lawyer for the group, said Tuesday. The suit accuses state and Los Angeles County officials of requiring gyms to close without providing evidence they contribute to virus outbreaks and at a time when staying healthy is critical for California’s residents. The prolonged closure is depriving millions of people the ability to exercise as temperatures soar and smoky air from wildfires blankets much of the state, said Francesca Schuler, a founding partner of the alliance.\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: A ski resort company announced job cuts for the first time in nearly 20 years as it anticipates decreased business because of the pandemic. Aspen Skiing Co. told employees 50 positions would be eliminated at its properties, which include the Snowmass and Aspen Mountain resorts, The Aspen Times reports. Vice President of Communications Jeff Hanle said the affected positions are across the company. President and CEO Mike Kaplan told employees in an email that many of the positions are already vacant or will lead to early retirements, but nine people were laid off. The company needs to “stay flexible given the ever shifting COVID landscape,” Kaplan wrote. Aspen Skiing Co. typically employs more than 3,000 full-time and seasonal employees at the height of winter. Kaplan said the company needs to spend more on operations to ensure safety during the pandemic despite bringing in less revenue because of fewer guests.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The governor said Monday that he does not want to see schools closing their buildings because of isolated coronavirus cases and urged districts offering only distance learning to consider revisiting their plans. A third of Connecticut students between kindergarten and eighth grade will soon be going to school full time, Gov. Ned Lamont said, expressing hope the number will top 50% within a few weeks. While many have hybrid plans offering a mix of in-person and distance learning, Lamont said very few including New Haven are offering only distance learning. “Come on, New Haven, I think you ought to take a look,” Lamont said. Also Monday, Lamont, a Democrat, announced fines that local officials can impose for violations of orders intended to fight the pandemic. People can be fined $100 for violating mask orders, $500 for organizing events that exceed size limits and $250 for attending events that exceed size limits.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Less than a week before the start of the school year, teachers in the Cape Henlopen Education Association issued a no-confidence vote against the district’s Board of Education and Superintendent Robert Fulton. The union said the district’s reopening plan and timeline do not take teacher concerns into enough consideration. The first day of school in Cape Henlopen is Wednesday. Teachers who have returned to buildings to prepare for the new year feel as if the hybrid-learning reopening plan is being followed inconsistently from building to building and say the district is behind schedule to welcome students Wednesday, union President Lacey Brown said. Some buildings lack signage to enforce social distancing. Teachers arrived at their classrooms in August to find cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer were not yet available. Others feel as if concerns about ventilation have not been taken into account.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian will reopen four more of its D.C. museums to the public starting Friday, WUSA-TV reports. The National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum will reopen with new COVID-19 prevention measures. The museums will have reduced days or hours of operation, and visitors will need to reserve free timed-entry passes to visit most locations, according to the Smithsonian. Museum cafes and retail shops will not be open. All on-site public tours and events are temporarily suspended. Some exhibits, galleries, interactives, theaters or indoor spaces may be closed or operating at limited capacity, officials said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Universal Studios will make two of its previously canceled Halloween Horror Nights haunted houses available to theme-park goers starting later this week. The theme park announced July 24 that it was canceling the popular extra-ticket Halloween event due to the coronavirus pandemic. Universal’s premier-level passholders who register for the event will have an opportunity to preview the houses called Revenge of the Tooth Fairy and Universal Monsters: The Bride of Frankenstein Lives on Friday afternoon, theme park officials announced. Regular theme park visitors will be able to view the houses Saturday and Sunday for no additional charge. Face coverings are required at Universal, but no costume masks will be allowed for the event. The park also announced it will offer trick-or-treating at Islands of Adventure for children ages 12 and younger this weekend. For this event, “family-friendly” Halloween costumes will be allowed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: A study conducted by the University of Georgia found that 82% of farmers in the state have seen their revenue decline due to the coronavirus pandemic. The findings released this month come from a May survey of more than 800 farmers in Georgia. The report said some farmers have seen their revenue decline by more than $8,000 a week, while others anticipate an annual loss of nearly $50,000. The livestock industry was hit especially hard as livestock sales barns across Georgia closed down due to the virus, Mark McCann, an official at the university, told The Valdosta Daily Times. About 70% of the respondents were not participating in any coronavirus relief programs. More than three-quarters of the farmers also said they didn’t believe these programs will provide necessary relief for their businesses. “I think there’s more emotional stress than they attribute,” McCann said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A new coronavirus command post set up at an events venue will help enhance public communication and education on the Big Island, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said. Kim said the post located at Aunty Sally Kaleohano’s Luau Hale in Hilo should help ensure people affected by the virus do not fall through bureaucratic cracks, West Hawaii Today reports. The center is expected to have staff from state and county agencies to coordinate public education, contact tracing, incoming visitor monitoring, quarantine and isolation facilities, hospitalization, and care facilities. The county added 15 quarantine trackers to keep tabs on an expected increase in travelers as Hawaii begins to loosen health restrictions to allow in more visitors and improve the economy. The group started working at the command post Thursday. The county trackers are separate from those hired by the state Department of Health for contact tracing.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state appears to have avoided a tough wildfire season so far with a combination of quick responses by state and federal firefighters and good luck with weather, Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday. The Republican governor said an early plan forced by the coronavirus pandemic to quickly attack all wildfires appears to have paid off. Avoiding large wildfires meant avoiding large accumulations of firefighters where the virus could spread. “The fact that we got on these fires early is one of the reasons we’re in such great shape,” Little said while presiding at the monthly meeting of the Idaho Land Board. Officials say wildfires that Idaho is responsible for fighting have burned about 6 square miles, only 18% of the 20-year average. The number of wildfires started is 217, which is 82% of the 20-year average. Of those 217 wildfires, 169 were started by humans and 48 by lightning.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials announced dozens of community organizations Monday that’ll help with the city’s effort to hire hundreds of contact tracers in the fight against COVID-19. Mayor Lori Lightfoot first announced the $56 million initiative in May, saying the positions would be filled in August. So far, roughly 100 people have been offered jobs in the effort, and city officials insisted Monday they were “right on track.” Chicago will work with 31 community groups to hire 500 others for contact tracing and supervising positions that’ll pay either $20 or $24 hourly. Federal grants will pay for the program. Lightfoot said the effort, noting the new jobs, marked a moment of optimism during the pandemic that’s killed 8,314 Illinoisans, including five reported Monday. “This is really about a moment of hope,” Lightfoot said at news conference. State health officials reported 1,373 new confirmed cases Monday with 262,744 overall.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana Chief Justice Loretta Rush has tested positive for a COVID-19 infection but has not yet developed severe symptoms, the state Supreme Court announced Monday. Rush, who is quarantined, learned about her infection Sunday and underwent the test after a family member tested positive for the coronavirus, the court said in a statement. Rush has been working remotely and hasn’t been to the Statehouse, where the Supreme Court justices have offices, since Sept. 1, the court said. Rush is under a doctor’s care but has not gone to a hospital for treatment, court spokeswoman Kathryn Dolan said. The 62-year-old Rush has been Indiana’s chief justice since 2014. She was a Tippecanoe County judge before being picked for the state Supreme Court in 2012. Offices for the Supreme Court remain open, the court said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: At least three universities in the state have canceled their spring breaks in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on campus. The University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa all announced changes to their academic calendars, canceling spring break, on Monday. Iowa and Northern Iowa are holding classes with fewer than 50 students in person, are requiring face masks on campus and have made testing available for their campus communities, among a number of other mitigation efforts put in place by university administrations. Iowa State has made the same efforts, but classroom sizes are limited to 50% capacity. But the coronavirus is still spreading at each of the three campuses. UI has recorded a total of 1,804 cases of the coronavirus. UNI has reported only 135 cases since classes began. Not including move-in testing, ISU has reported 900 student cases and 15 faculty or staff cases.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Area health officials are cracking down on face masks and bar curfews to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Sedgwick County health officer Dr. Garold Minns made compliance mandatory in a new emergency public health order that took effect Tuesday morning. The Wichita Eagle reports the order runs through Oct. 21. The health order has required face masks, an 11 p.m. curfew on bars and a 15-person limit on mass gatherings. But previous versions of the order said that while it was lawful, compliance was voluntary. The update removed wording that the order “cannot be enforced through criminal charges, fines, or civil penalties.” Minns signed the order Monday, as Kansas health officials reported 1,513 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 statewide over the weekend, for a total of 49,899 across the state. Kansas also had 23 new deaths, raising the total to 534 since the pandemic began.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Responding to calls for greater autonomy by school administrators, Gov. Andy Beshear unveiled new coronavirus guidelines Monday for reopening. The Democratic governor also announced 342 new cases and five additional deaths, though the number is expected to rise later in the week due to reporting delays. The Bluegrass State now has a total of 57,282 cases and over 1,000 deaths. According to an emergency declaration signed by the governor Monday, all public and private K-12 schools will be required to submit coronavirus data. The data will then be reflected in a districtwide dashboard available to the public, as well as a color-coded state-map. Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky’s public health commissioner, said the system will help school administrators determine the level of spread in their communities more easily.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Amid the ongoing uncertainty of COVID-19, State Fair of Louisiana General Manager Chris Giordano and the State Fair Board of Directors have decided to postpone the upcoming fair scheduled to run Oct.29-Nov.8. A smaller event will be held during those dates that will feature several of the highlights fairgoers enjoy, including the Junior Livestock Show and the National Brahman Cattle Show. The public will also be invited to a “Taste of the State Fair” food court that will feature a number of the unusual and iconic State Fair foods that people look forward to all year long. The new dates for the 114th State Fair of Louisiana are April 29-May 9, 2021. The 11-day run will feature all the food, rides, live music, free shows and attractions for which the fair is known.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal coronavirus relief money will pay for improvements to the passenger rail system that connects Maine to Boston. The $2.1 million is slated for the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority, which operates the Downeaster. The line runs from Boston to Brunswick daily and is running at limited capacity because of the coronavirus pandemic. The money will help the Downeaster make improvements that enhance safety, efficiency and reliability, said Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the House’s transportation appropriations subcommittee. She said the Downeaster is critical for Maine’s economic recovery from the pandemic because of its role “providing good jobs, supporting local vendors of goods and services, and strengthening our tourism industry.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Amazon said it plans to hire up to 4,400 employees for its facilities in the state as part of a major companywide expansion accelerated by booming sales during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baltimore Sun reports the new hires will add to the Seattle-based online retailer’s 17,500-person work force in Maryland. Amazon has more than two dozen delivery, fulfillment and sortation centers, as well as Whole Foods Market stores, in Maryland, including large facilities in Baltimore, Sparrows Point and Cecil County. The company wants to hire a total of 100,000 new full- and part-time workers across the United States and Canada to handle shipping, packaging and customer orders. That’s in addition to 33,000 new corporate positions Amazon announced last week. In July, Amazon reported a 43.4% increase in North American sales in the second quarter and 33.5% worldwide revenue growth.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officials are beginning to envision a post-COVID-19 public transit system – one that may include changes to services given a possible looming budget gap. The main problem is ridership, which plunged at the beginning of the pandemic as riders fled the MBTA system in fear of being exposed to the coronavirus. Since then, ridership has ticked up, but not dramatically. MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak credited some of that slight uptick to universities coming back into session that are located along the Green Line. But another, perhaps larger factor that continues to weigh down ridership is the reluctance of some of the state’s largest companies – particularly those in the greater Boston area – to require all their employees to return to their offices, instead letting them continue working from home. That means fewer public transit commuters, a trend that could continue into 2021.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Ingham County on Monday ordered a two-week quarantine for 23 fraternities and sororities and seven large rental houses near Michigan State University after a coronavirus outbreak that a local health official said was turning into a “crisis.” The mandatory quarantine means students or others living in the buildings cannot leave except for medical care or necessities that cannot be delivered. Ingham County Heath Officer Linda Vail acted two days after she urged all MSU students living locally to voluntarily self-quarantine for two weeks, citing at least 342 cases among people affiliated with the university during the previous 16 days. She said the outbreak was being fueled by a lack of cooperation and compliance from some students at the school, which is offering online-only instruction after encouraging students to stay home rather than in dorms. People who willfully violate the order could face six months in jail, a $200 fine or both.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Public health officials see some success in how the state has prepared for manageable spread of the virus, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Monday on a call with reporters. “But we really continue to be concerned about the degree of a virus that’s prevalent all over the state and the ease with which what’s a pretty controlled situation could escalate further,” Malcolm said. Minnesota Department of Health Infectious Disease Division Director Kris Ehresmann echoed those concerns. “The analogy we’ve used is we’re really walking on the edge of the cliff. And we’re grateful that we haven’t fallen off, but we have not moved away from the edge of the cliff, so the potential for going over the edge is still there,” she said. Officials and medical professionals are asking parents to keep children home when they’re sick or have been exposed to the coronavirus to keep schools open.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health reported 505 new cases of the coronavirus and 28 deaths Tuesday. The state totals now stand at 90,523 cases and 2,734 deaths. There were 138 outbreaks reported Tuesday at long-term care facilities. Health department statistics showed 5,693 Mississippians in long-term care have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, and 1,135 have died. Mississippians in the 60-to-69 age bracket make up the largest number of hospitalizations, with 1,234 as of Tuesday. Those in the 70-to-79 age bracket make up the largest number of deaths, with 733. By far, those in the 18-to-29 age group have the highest number of confirmed cases in the state, with 20,238. Twenty people in that age group have died of the virus. Eighty-six children under the age of 18 have been reported hospitalized due to the virus as of Tuesday, the latest information available. One death has been reported in the under-18 age group.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Protests against St. Louis County restrictions on high school sports continued Monday, when hundreds gathered outside the county government center to demand that limits be lifted. Protesters urged Democratic County Executive Sam Page to rethink his policy prohibiting some high school sports such as football and hockey to be played due to the coronavirus. Among them was Elizabeth Schweppe, 47, of Town and Country, whose 14-year-old son is a freshman at a private school sidelined from his favorite sport, hockey. “There is zero proof that kids are transmitting this at school,” Schweppe said. “If kids can go to Six Flags and ride a roller coaster, why can’t they be on the ice playing hockey?” Page last week lifted some restrictions on youth sports. The county now allows those with little or no direct contact to be played, including cross-country, tennis, golf and swimming. But there’s still a ban on high-contact sports.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Great Falls Public Schools district in conjunction with the Cascade City-County Health Department announced 14 active cases of COVID-19 among students and staff across the district Monday. The announcement came at a press conference about the sudden closure of Great Falls High School through Wednesday. GFH has 10 reported COVID-19 positive students and one positive support staff member, while Whittier Elementary, East Middle School and the Paris Gibson Education Center each have one confirmed positive case on their campuses. GFPS Superintendent Tom Moore said the temporary school closure is something students and parents who opted for in-person education should expect for the remainder of the year as long as there isn’t a vaccine available.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: A longtime doctor is one of the latest COVID-19 casualties in the state, with his death coming as officials confirmed more than 38,000 cases of the virus in Nebraska. Dr. Leland Lamberty died Saturday after weeks of fighting the virus, the North Platte Telegraph reports. Lamberty was hospitalized in late August with the virus and put on a ventilator about a week before his death. Lamberty, a physician at Great Plains Health hospital and Great Plains Family Medicine clinic in North Platte, was believed to have contracted the virus through community spread, hospital officials said. He always wore personal protective equipment while serving patients throughout the pandemic, hospital officials said. The seven-day average of daily new cases in Nebraska has risen to 329 in the past seven days from an average of nearly 282 per day the week prior, according to data from Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracking project.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State health officials said Monday that they expect to see an uptick in new coronavirus cases after President Donald Trump held political rallies in the state over the weekend. “We’re anticipating to see a growth in cases over the next few weeks, which is really unfortunate because right now we’re just beginning to experience – over the last couple of weeks – a decrease in positivity and cases statewide and a decrease in the burden on our hospital infrastructure,” Nevada COVID-19 response director Caleb Cage said. Thousands of mostly maskless supporters attended Trump campaign rallies in Minden on Saturday and Henderson on Sunday that were held in violation of state directives capping at 50 the number of people who can attend public gatherings. If the rallies contributed to the spread of the virus, it’ll take time for the uptick to be reflected in state data, Nevada Health Department deputy administrator Julia Peek said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: The city is the latest community in the state to approve a face mask ordinance. The City Council voted 7-2 Monday night to approve the measure, which went into effect immediately and lasts until Jan. 4, 2021. The masks are required inside public places and outdoors when social distancing of 6 feet between people who aren’t in the same household can’t be maintained. The penalty for not wearing a mask won’t exceed $25. Those exempt from the ordinance are people with medical and health-risk conditions; children age 6 and younger; and people eating or drinking at a business licensed in the city for that purpose. Some of the other communities that have passed a face mask ordinance include Exeter, Newmarket, Durham, Concord, Nashua, Keene, Lebanon and Plymouth.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gamblers in the Garden State set a nationwide record for the most money bet on sports in a single month, plunking down almost $668 million in August on events including resurgent baseball, basketball and hockey seasons that had been interrupted by the coronavirus outbreak, figures released Monday showed. That smashed the previous record of $614 million set in Nevada in November 2019. The extra money helped cushion the blow of months of losses incurred by New Jersey’s casinos and two racetracks that offer sports betting, helping them start to rebound financially. The state Division of Gaming Enforcement shows the casinos and tracks collectively won $326.3 million from gamblers in August. All told, the casinos and tracks saw their revenue decline by only 7.5% compared to August 2019, when they were going full-blast and there was no pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Mayor Ken Miyagishima caught flak from some city councilors Monday during a work session for suggesting the city temporarily decrease the minimum wage for tipped workers to help business owners ailing from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Restaurants are literally on life support,” Miyagishima said. But “low-wage workers are also on life support,” District 4 Councilor Johana Bencomo said. “I don’t want to take a living wage away from someone who’s living comfortably off that wage.” In Las Cruces, the minimum wage for tipped workers is, by ordinance, 40% of the city’s current minimum wage. On Jan. 1, that wage is set to rise from $4.10 to $4.20. Tips make up the rest of the employees’ pay, and it can lead some tipped workers to make more than the minimum wage. Statewide, the tipped wage will remain $2.35 an hour Jan. 1, according to city staff.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany:Let them eat candy. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that he has no plans to ban trick-or-treating this Halloween amid concerns nationwide about whether kids going door to door could create a safety hazard during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I would not ban trick or treaters going door to door. I don’t think that’s appropriate,” Cuomo told News12 on Long Island. “You have neighbors – if you want to go knock on your neighbor’s door, God bless you, and I can’t tell you not to.” Cuomo’s comments come after Los Angeles last week prohibited Halloween activities, such as trick-or-treating, but later revised its guidelines to say celebrations are permitted but not recommended. New York has tallied the most COVID-19 deaths in the nation but now has among the lowest infection rates, as mask-wearing, social distancing and business restrictions have limited the spread.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Mecklenburg County incorrectly told nearly 7,000 residents they had tested positive for the coronavirus due to what officials say was a technical glitch. The text messages were sent to more than 6,700 residents in the county Friday, The Charlotte Observer reports. More than 500 people also received a county email with the notice. The county told residents that morning that the messages were a “scam” and that their health department does not notify people of their COVID-19 test results through text message. A few hours later, the county said on Twitter that the messages had actually gone out due to a glitch “in the software system that has been addressed by the software provider.” County Manager Dena Diorio told county commissioners in an email Monday that the messages were sent through HealthSpace Data System, a company based in Canada, the newspaper reports.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An education campaign aimed at persuading North Dakotans to wear masks and practice social distancing still has not begun more than a month after $1.8 million in federal coronavirus aid was approved for the effort. The campaign had been set to start Monday, the same day North Dakota set a record for active COVID-19 cases statewide with 2,758. Nicole Peske, a state Health Department spokeswoman, said three of the 10 private firms that submitted bids for education effort had equal proposals under the state’s scoring system, which has delayed the effort for at least another week. “I don’t think anybody wants to move forward on this more than we do,” Peske said Tuesday. “We did have a rare three-way tie … every step of process is time-consuming, and there are time frames we legally have to follow.”\n\nOhio\n\nCuyahoga Falls: A private high school has warned its students who recently attended a large house party that they have two choices: acknowledge they were there and quarantine for two weeks, or risk expulsion. The president of Walsh Jesuit High School in Cuyahoga Falls said the party involving at least 100 students jeopardized the whole school community’s health and safety because of the risks of spreading the coronavirus. Photos and videos showed students not wearing masks and not social distancing, President Karl Ertle said. Adults were there, and the parents had contacted the school in advance to understand existing restrictions for student gatherings, but the event apparently got out of hand, Ertle said. College campuses around Ohio have reported more than 5,000 positive cases over the past several weeks. The vast majority of those involve students.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Several Democrats in the state House requested a legal opinion Monday on Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt’s decision to spend federal coronavirus relief funds to send students to private schools. Members of the House Democratic Education Policy Group requested a formal opinion from state Attorney General Mike Hunter. Stitt faced criticism in July when he announced his plan to spend $10 million from the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund to allow Oklahoma families to access $6,500 in funds for private-school tuition. State Rep. Andy Fugate said he believes there are questions about the legality of the governor’s decision. “We requested this opinion because it’s time to stop this ‘do as I say, not as I do’ approach to government funding,” Fugate, a Democrat from Del City, said in a statement, adding that the federal money isn’t “a slush fund for the governor to spend as he pleases.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: After six consecutive weeks of decline, the state’s positivity rate rose significantly last week. For the week of Sept. 6-12, Oregon had a 5.6% positivity rate, a significant increase over the previous week’s 4.3%. For in-person instruction in schools to commence, weekly test positivity for the state must stay below 5% for three consecutive weeks, according to Gov. Kate Brown’s criteria for reopening schools. The two previous weeks, Oregon had been below 5%. Last week saw the highest positivity rate in Oregon since the week of July 26-Aug. 1, when the state had a 6.1% positivity rate. Oregon’s cumulative positivity rate is 4.6%, lower than the national average of 8%. The number of tests administered in Oregon has dropped significantly since the peak of 41,497 the week of July 12-18 to 17,365 last week, though the number of tests is likely to rise as specimens are collected.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf vowed Tuesday that he wouldn’t heed the “irresponsible demands” of President Donald Trump and Republicans in the Legislature concerning the coronavirus response, hitting back hard after a federal judge appointed by Trump ruled many of Wolf’s pandemic shutdown orders were unconstitutional. In unusually sharp language, the Democratic governor accused Trump and Republicans who control the Legislature of promoting conspiracy theories and spreading misinformation about the virus and the status of the Pennsylvania economy, which he said is reopened despite the mitigation measures he has imposed. “I believe the vast majority of Pennsylvanians understand what we had to do in the beginning was necessary to buy the time to keep people safe before we got the capacity we needed to address this virus,” Wolf said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nScituate: A retired art teacher and sculptor has created a soaring tribute to health care workers, whom he considers the super heroes of the pandemic. George Grace, 67, sculpted two figures wearing medical scrubs, face masks and wearing red capes and hung them on a wire so they looked like they are flying through the trees in his yard. He also placed a sign near them to thank all essential employees. He told WJAR-TV that the response to his tribute has been wonderful.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Friday and is recovering in isolation with her family at home, officials said. Evette had a sore throat and headache Thursday and was tested for the virus. She has stayed at her family’s home near Greenville since noting the symptoms, said Brian Symmes, the spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster. “She is feeling better now,” Symmes said, adding that Evette plans to stay out of the public for two weeks. Evette’s positive test prompted McMaster and his wife to get COVID-19 tests, which both came back negative Sunday. It was the fifth negative test since the pandemic began for the governor and the third for his wife, Symmes said. Two members of Evette’s staff and some of her security detail are also isolating, Symmes said. Evette, 53, and the 73-year-old governor were last together Sept. 6 as they watched a NASCAR race at Darlington Speedway, Symmes said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of South Dakotans hospitalized after being infected with coronavirus jumped 21% between Monday and Tuesday, the state Department of Health reported Tuesday. The 133 people hospitalized Tuesday represented 6% of the state’s total hospital capacity and 8% of intensive care beds. It was the largest number of people hospitalized in the state with COVID-19, although it remained well below spring estimates that South Dakota would need as many as 5,000 hospital beds to handle the pandemic. The state reported 195 new positive infections Tuesday. Those were from 2,454 test results reported to the Department of Health, a daily positive rate of 7.86%. No additional deaths were reported to the 184 South Dakotans who have died with COVID-19 since March.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials said revenues for August came in $115.1 million higher than projections amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Tennessee Department Finance & Administration said last month’s revenues of $1.2 billion also topped the state’s August 2019 performance by $22 million. Finance Commissioner Butch Eley said the August sales tax receipts reflect consumer activity for July, which continued to outperform expectations, with federal stimulus money playing a big part. Eley said tax receipts from sellers of building materials, food, furniture and home appliances increased significantly compared to last August, while apparel stores, many small retailers, restaurants and bars continued to suffer losses amid decreased sales. August marked the first month on an accrual basis of a new fiscal year for Tennessee. The new budget year officially began in July.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: State health officials on Monday reported 2,595 new cases of the coronavirus and 21 additional deaths. The Texas Department of State Health Services said the total number of COVID-19 cases so far in the state is now 663,445, while the death toll is 14,211. The true number of cases in Texas is likely higher, though, because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Health officials estimate that about 68,000 cases in the state are active. There were about 3,300 people with COVID-19 hospitalized in Texas on Monday, health officials said. The number of hospitalizations has been decreasing since peaking July 22 at 10,893.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: College students in Utah County are driving a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, health officials said Monday. Utah reported 563 new cases Monday, bringing the weekly average to nearly 490 per day. That’s the highest it’s been since late July, state figures show. Nearly 4 in 10 new cases come from Utah County, and the majority are college-aged people, state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said in a news release. The county only accounts for 2 in 10 state residents. Utah County is home to Utah Valley University in Orem and Brigham Young University, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Provo. BYU students have received criticism for large off-campus gatherings. Dunn said college officials have implemented solid preventative measures for campus, but “they need help from their students to act responsibly while off campus.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The nation’s top infectious disease expert on Tuesday called Vermont’s ongoing efforts to control the coronavirus a model for the nation. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the state’s continued emphasis on wearing masks, avoiding crowds, keeping physical distance and other simple measures are things he has been trying for months to communicate across the country. “They work in states with small numbers, like in Vermont, and they work in states with big numbers, like New York and Texas and California,” Fauci said during a video appearance at the regular virus briefing held by Gov. Phil Scott. Statistics show Vermont continues to have the country’s lowest rate of positive tests for the virus that causes COVID-19 – 0.2%, according to state officials – and the lowest number of cases per capita, with a growth rate of the cases of about 1%.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: Two local entertainment businesses are teaming up with area children to create entertaining and educational digital content by kids for kids as many spend more time at home. Appomattox-based nonprofit Wolfbane Productions and Lend Me a Princess, a Lynchburg-based business providing character appearances portrayed by actors at birthday parties and other events in the area, are joining forces to make the most of an unconventional, pandemic-induced social situation. They hope to help children and their parents find some fun and relief as numerous traditional life events, such as camps, after-school programs and school itself, have been disrupted, while expanding their own professional horizons by focusing on creating digital content. “I personally don’t have kids, but I can’t imagine the stresses parents are feeling right now, having to become parents and teachers,” said Ken Arpino, executive director of Wolfbane Productions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: More than 2,000 people in the state have now died due to the coronavirus, according to the state Department of Health. As of Monday afternoon, KUOW reports there have been 2,006 recorded deaths from COVID-19 and 80,138 confirmed cases since the pandemic began early this year. The state’s death rate, the percentage of people who die after getting infected, remains at 2.5%. Washington has seen a much higher number of cases and deaths than neighboring states and is still coming down from its July peak in cases. Most of the confirmed COVID-19 cases have been among people ages 20-39 (49%) and ages 40-59 (29%). Deaths from the disease are far more prevalent in ages 80 and older (51%) and ages 60-79 (38%). About half of all deaths in the state are linked to a long-term care facility. Pacific Islanders, Hispanic people, Native Americans and Alaska Natives are dying from COVID-19 at the highest rates.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University’s president has apologized after a photo posted to social media showed him shopping in a convenience store without a mask on. Photos of President Gordon Gee that were posted to Twitter on Sunday appeared to show the college leader walking through aisles maskless. In one photo, he could be seen carrying a disposable mask in his hand. Gee apologized in a statement Sunday, calling it an “error in judgment.” “As president, I must hold myself to the highest of standards and set the very best example for our University,” Gee wrote in a tweet. “In this instance, I did not do that. As I have asked you to do the right things, so must you expect me to do the same.” Some West Virginia University students criticized Gee for violating Gov. Jim Justice’s executive order requiring masks be worn in indoor spaces, pointing out that students have been suspended for breaking similar health and safety rules.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison decided Monday to eliminate spring break next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The university’s Faculty Senate voted 140-7 to erase the nine-day break from the 2021 spring calendar. Officials said the move is designed to discourage students and staff from traveling long distances and bringing the virus that causes COVID-19 back to campus, officials said. “I realize the slog of of going through a full 15-week semester with no break would be challenging, but given the vagaries of the pandemic, particularly in cold weather when people are indoors and the like. … I’m enthusiastically supportive,” Provost John Karl Scholz said. The proposal has classes starting Jan. 25, a week later than currently scheduled. Classes would not be held on the first day of Passover, Good Friday or the day before Easter. Classes would end April 30.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The number of state residents killed by the coronavirus rose by four, while one of the state’s biggest school districts reported that an employee tested positive for the virus. The deaths of three people from Sheridan County and one from Natrona County brought Wyoming’s COVID-19 death toll to 46, the Wyoming Department of Health announced Monday. Three of the deaths occurred over the past couple of weeks, and one was in August, department spokeswoman Kim Deti said. The increase came as the school district in Cheyenne announced an employee at McCormick Junior High School tested positive for the coronavirus. It was the first known positive case among students or employees in the district since school began Aug. 31, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Short-term school closure and isolation of students and staff will be possible under a coronavirus response plan, district officials said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/16"}]}

Work and life hum from sunup to sundown\n\nIndyStar photographers spent 24 hours — from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m. — photographing daily life in Indianapolis inside the I-465 loop.\n\nFrom neighborhoods to nightlife and from politicians to police, our photographers painted a portrait of what keeps Indianapolis ticking every minute of every day.\n\nRead how each journalist described their day, and scroll to the bottom to see all 50 time-stamped photos.\n\nA start with purpose and direction\n\nI kicked off our day-in-the-life series just before 6 a.m. by people-watching at the Julia M. Carson Transit Center. Personalities ran the gamut: From a philosophical man with a dance to his step, to a young mom watching her sleeping daughter dream as she waited to go to school for the day. Some were waiting inside to travel or go to work for the day; some were just enjoying a momentary seat and warmth.\n\nThe morning had begun for many at the center, as everyone flowed together with their sense of daily purpose.\n\nThe morning continued as I found IUPUI’s ROTC cadets pushing themselves in exercise, commuters moving like lava on the streets, and people seeking caffeine at Coat Check Coffee.\n\nThe sunrise wasn't visible on this day, but the sun did provide light through the patterned cloud cover, giving Indy and the White River a blue palette with the clouds and the river gliding gently in unison.\n\nI ended my morning with songs about dinosaurs, frogs and Old MacDonald’s farm sung by a Riley music therapist. I watched the experience in a toddler’s eyes.\n\nThe start of our day-in-the-life day had purpose and direction. As the community began the morning all about “business,” the human spirit in all its diversity began to emerge.\n\nKelly Wilkinson\n\nMore from Kelly: 3 of the rarest dogs in the world live in Beech Grove — and they can sing!\n\nAn inspiration\n\nAs I weaved up and down the streets in some of Indianapolis’ most hidden neighborhoods, the cultural diversity I witnessed was inspiring.\n\nI spoke with and photographed diverse business owners, dedicated employees and kids learning and using their imaginations. At one point, I had to pull out my smartphone to communicate with a group of Latino children enjoying fall break.\n\nDiversity in a community can make it stronger, more accepting. It was truly inspiring to see the diversity inside the loop.\n\nMykal McEldowney\n\nMore from Mykal: Kolette is 7. She loves princesses and singing. Oh, and racing dragsters.\n\nA view from above\n\nDuring my daytime shift, I took a bird’s eye look at Indianapolis to better see the pulse that runs through it.\n\nI positioned myself above Herron High School to photograph students as they scurried away for fall break. They formed little clusters on the front lawn along 16th Street, giggling and exchanging hugs before scattering in different directions home.\n\nAt rush hour, I watched traffic stop and go, bunch up and thin out, lighter than usual thanks to school breaks.\n\nThough Indianapolis is a capital city, it marches to the same beat as the small towns that surround it.\n\nJenna Watson\n\nMore from Jenna:Gorgeous exotic cars and a sense of community combine at this Downtown auto club\n\nA moment of reflection\n\nAs I created a time-lapse overlooking Monument Circle, I reflected, as I often do, on the gift journalism gives back to those of us in the profession. It's not money, fame or even career security: It's the ability to satisfy one's curiosity about the city they live in.\n\nWho are the people that make up Indianapolis? What do they need, want, aspire to?\n\nA journalist can move seamlessly between all social classes, walks of life, political leanings, nationalities and more to experience and attempt to understand — with all humility and without judgment. The reward is simply experiencing a moment of someone's life or an event. Often it's someone's best day, but equally often, it's someone's worst.\n\nAs the years go by, the journalist collects more moments, adding them to the memory bank and becoming rich through experience. Lives lived, memories made, and moments shared through pictures that say more than words add to our collective understanding of one another — the gift we endeavor to give back to those who shared a moment of their lives with us.\n\nMichelle Pemberton\n\nMore from Michelle: My search for Indianapolis' oldest dog was a journey of happy tails and heartbreak\n\nA city's late-night charm\n\nThere are some perks in being a night owl.\n\nI know there are a few Indy residents who have experienced a late night or two during a workweek. Though some of our shifts might end at 6 p.m., others are just getting started.\n\nI roamed around the city in the quiet hours around midnight. I found the bartenders, bands, artists and servers who keep the pulse of the city. There was this charm and soft glow when the street lights and neon signs came on.\n\nThe people who live, work and thrive in the city bring the magic to Indianapolis. While some are asleep, others are wide awake. I got to be a part of that glow for one night and be a part of the lives of the people who live for this city.\n\nGrace Hollars\n\nMore from Grace: These handbags are changing women's lives in Indiana\n\nA new day\n\nThe wee hours are where mayhem and bakeries thrive. My shift took place after the bars closed and when the 6 a.m. coffee started dripping.\n\nThe 24-hour Beech Grove Bowl hosted a trio of pro soccer players in town for an earlier game against Indy Eleven; they laughed and joked as they tried to stave off an almost certain gutter ball.\n\nIndy has murders, and TV journalists for Fox 59/CBS 4 talked about them with nice video gear a block away from city hall, in a well-lit area, just in case a mugger had a pawn shop on the brain.\n\nAnd, like a shadowy attack by a folded chair, a giant WrestleMania truck lurched through Downtown in advance of a weekend show.\n\nThe main event of the morning, however, was being in Long's Bakery to witness the making of those glazed doughnuts that are the stuff of office workers' dreams.\n\nRobert Scheer\n\nMore from Robert: Hoosiers told me the White River was dangerous.

Joey B. Fine, 48, who died in January from complications of COVID-19, was the founding pastor at Seasons Church in Prattville and Prattville Christian’s benefit play director. He’d been working with a student cast from grades 6-12 on a production of “Mary Poppins Jr.” “As high school students, for a lot of them this was their first big loss,” said Rebecca W. Thomas, marketing and communications director for PCA. After Fine’s death, a cast member’s parent had the idea to make contact with Andrews and, after days of research and many emails, reached Andrews’ manager. Soon afterwards, Andrews sent the PCA cast a personalized letter: “Hello Everybody! Greetings to you all. A little bird told me that you have been working on a special benefit production of ‘Mary Poppins.’ Great! I am sending you warmest wishes for success. Do it in honor of Mr. Fine. He must have been a really nice guy. Remember, also, to enjoy yourselves and give the audience the gift of this magical show. With love, Julie Andrews.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Public health officials said more than 58% of residents 65 and older have received a COVID-19 vaccination since distribution efforts began. State Epidemiologist Dr. Joe McLaughlin said the state hopes to move the process along faster as more contagious and potentially deadly strains of the coronavirus emerge, Alaska’s News Source reports. “Right now, it’s sort of a race against the variants to get people vaccinated,” McLaughlin said. Alaska’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink said Wednesday that the state wants more Alaskans 65 and older to receive vaccinations. “We still want to prioritize that group and, looking at these variants, we just want that group to be vaccinated in every way we possibly can,” Zink said during a video conference with community officials. “I mean, 58% is great, but it would be great to be even higher on that.” After vaccine appointments prioritized for older residents remained opened for several days, the state moved into the next tier of its distribution plan earlier this month. Zink said that “there was an intentional pause given the really high risk of morbidity and mortality in that group.” The new phase includes educators, some essential workers, and people living and working in congregate settings such as prisons and shelters.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: January was a lethal month in Arizona, with total deaths up by 66.5% over January 2020, preliminary state numbers show. The 9,481 deaths reported by the Arizona Department of Health Services for the month of January reflect the severity of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave. The death toll for January was higher than any single month of reported deaths in 2020, state numbers show. January’s death total nationwide of 95,020 was a pandemic record, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Arizona, coronavirus cases began surging in November and peaked Jan. 4, the latest state numbers say. Hospitalizations for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in Arizona peaked Jan. 11. Deaths are a lagging indicator, meaning they typically spike several weeks after a rise in cases. Last month, the peak for known deaths that occurred on a single day was Jan. 18, with 167 known deaths on that day. January’s total Arizona death toll is a difference of 3,788 deaths over January 2020 and is similar to the number of known COVID-19 deaths reported in January, though the numbers could change. Arizona had one confirmed case of COVID-19 in January 2020 and no known deaths from the illness.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of coronavirus cases in the state rose by more than 280 on Sunday, and the death toll increased by nine, according to the Department of Health. The number of people hospitalized with the virus fell by 28 to 577. On Sunday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson visited a pharmacy in Bryant to discuss vaccine distribution. He had urged vaccine providers Friday to schedule extra hours over the weekend to make up for a slowdown because of last week’s snowstorms. The Arkansas Department of Health reported that more than 9,500 COVID-19 vaccine doses were given Sunday. “Today’s report shows the largest increase in vaccine distribution in over a week,” Hutchinson wrote in a tweet Sunday. “Our efforts to catch up on vaccine distribution this weekend are working.” More than 515,000 vaccine doses have been given in Arkansas. The seven-day rolling average of new cases has fallen during the past two weeks, from 1,737 per day to 443.6, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic remains alarmingly high, topping 49,000 over the weekend, even as the rates of new infections and hospitalizations continue to plummet. The number of patients in California hospitals with COVID-19 slipped below 7,000, a drop of more than a third over two weeks, the state Department of Public Health reported Sunday. The 6,760 new confirmed cases are more than 85% below the mid-December peak of about 54,000. Total cases are approaching 3.45 million. California reported another 408 deaths, bringing the total since the outbreak began to 49,105 – the highest in the nation. Despite the grim death count, the positivity rate for people being tested has been falling for weeks, which means fewer people will end up in hospitals. In Los Angeles County, the state’s most populous, the daily test positivity rate was 3.8% on Saturday, public health officials said. Epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford with the University of California, San Francisco said one of the reasons why cases are dropping so fast in California “is because of naturally acquired immunity,” mostly in the southern part of the state. He estimated 50% of Los Angeles County residents have been infected with the virus at some point.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A pair of childhood friends is looking to solve a pandemic-related dining dilemma. As an answer to restaurant capacity restrictions and unforgiving winter weather, Sean Hudgens, 27, and Seth Pearson, 26, recently launched The Nook, a rentable mobile dining room built to rove Northern Colorado and offer restaurants a new outdoor dining option. The Nook, which Hudgens and Pearson built on an 80-square-foot trailer, is insulated, heated, and outfitted with modern fixtures, a table for six and a Bluetooth speaker for diners to play music on. They see it as a nonpermanent option for restaurants looking to offer a warm, COVID-19-safe dining space for single parties. “I know how hard it’s been for small-business owners but especially restaurant owners,” Hudgens said. “My hope is we can help them provide a spectacular experience for their clientele outside of the normal eating experience. We wanted it to be above and beyond on every level.” He said he got the idea from a mobile dining trailer at The Regional in Old Town Fort Collins. “I was thinking how cool it was that they had provided a trailer that allows people to enjoy food in a safe setting,” Hudgens said, and his concept allows different restaurant owners to share such a space. The Nook is available to book for $80 per day or $500 per week. You can follow its travels across Northern Colorado on Instagram.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Most students in the city will return to school five days a week beginning March 1 as Connecticut’s COVID-19 cases continue to decline. Superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodriguez said the decision announced Friday was made in consultation with health officials and based on guidance from the state. Students in ninth grade and younger who opted for in-person learning will resume the five-day schedule, with half days on Wednesdays, that was in place until rising coronavirus cases forced a shift to a hybrid model in November. Students in 10th through 12th grades will continue in-person learning part time.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state has begun its largest COVID-19 vaccination event to date. The inoculation effort kicked off Sunday at Dover International Speedway. The six-day drive-thru clinic represents a possible blueprint for future vaccine distribution in the state. And it will have the capacity to vaccinate 3,000 people a day. The event is being operated by the state government in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Staff conducted a dress rehearsal Saturday night before the event opened at half-capacity Sunday as a dry run. The event appeared to run smoothly Sunday. The five vaccination stations that were set up rarely had a line of more than a few cars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C.’s municipal courses are gearing up to make improvements to their links amid a pandemic in which golf has become a refuge for people to get outside and safely enjoy going places, WUSA-TV reports. The National Links Trust took control of running the three National Park Service courses during 2020, and the partners agreed to a 50-year deal to overhaul and run the East Potomac Golf Course, Langston Golf Course and Rock Creek Golf Course. Changes have already begun on the district’s courses, with long-term renovations that will include an overhaul of facilities and courses at Rock Creek, Langston and East Potomac. New golf carts, driving range mats, and other little improvements here and there around the courses have been noticeable to the regulars at the courses already. The clearing of non-native and invasive plants and a small number of trees is a noticeable change golfers will see once they make a trip to the courses again when temperatures warm up. The changes will not only create a better golf community for D.C. but also expand the game to communities that may not have as much exposure to the game – including veterans and communities of color.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Four federal mass vaccination sites are coming to the state, officials said Friday. Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville will be the locations of the new Community Vaccine Centers, according to a White House news release. The cities and locations were selected based on their proximity to vulnerable populations, and officials estimate the four centers will give up to 12,000 shots a day in total. The locations are Miami-Dade Community College, TGT Poker & Racebook in Tampa, Valencia Community College in Orlando, and Gateway Town Center in Jacksonville. So far, just over 3.7 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Florida. Since the pandemic began last year, nearly 30,000 Floridians have died. On Friday, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried announced that her agency is launching a bilingual vaccine education campaign to encourage vaccination among the state’s farmworkers. She noted that people in the agricultural community are among the most at risk for dying from COVID-19, according to a recent University of California study. On Friday, Jackson Health System, one of the largest in the state, announced it will now vaccinate residents age 55 and older with specific medical conditions including certain cancers, congestive heart failure and morbid obesity.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: One of the state’s largest school systems is recruiting volunteer medical professionals who would administer COVID-19 vaccinations to teachers and others. Atlanta Public Schools is taking the step in anticipation of shots becoming available to teachers and staff members, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Georgia teachers are not yet eligible to receive the vaccine, but Gov. Brian Kemp has said he will soon make an announcement about expanding vaccine eligibility to include more groups of people. Atlanta Public Schools is preparing for thousands of educators to take the vaccine once eligibility is expanded, Superintendent Lisa Herring wrote in a blog post. “We know that vaccinating as many staff members as possible will be critical for continuing to open our schools safely,” Herring wrote.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Coronavirus testing of travelers arriving on Hawaii island is expected to continue after the end of February, but officials have not yet determined the duration of the extension. Partnerships between Hawaii County and private philanthropists allowing the county to test trans-Pacific arrivals are set to continue, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. “We’re still covered for the end of the month, and then after that we’ll probably extend the testing,” said Cyrus Johnasen, a spokesman for Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth. “As for how long we’ll extend it, we’re not sure yet.” The terms of the continued testing are dependent on the level of funding Hawaii County receives from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill under consideration in the U.S. Congress, Johnasen said. The county will have a better sense of how long post-flight testing can continue after the final form of the legislation is passed and signed by President Joe Biden. “We’ll still be working with our private partners after this month, but we can’t negotiate about the testing if we don’t know how much money we’re getting,” Johnasen said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state House on Friday approved $175 million in emergency rental assistance as people struggle to pay rent during the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers voted 59-8 to approve the money that also requires approval from the Senate, plus Republican Gov. Brad Little’s signature. The money is part of the nearly $900 million the state received under then-President Donald Trump’s coronavirus rescue bill signed into law in December. President Joe Biden last month extended a nationwide eviction ban through the end of March. That puts the financial strain on property owners. Money from Idaho’s program will go to property owners, not renters. The rent assistance money is part of a plan to reduce the spread of the coronavirus by preventing people from falling into homelessness. Republican Rep. Paul Amador said state officials estimate 10% of adult renters have fallen behind, and 34,000 households are at risk of eviction. He said the amount of rent that hasn’t been paid is between $73 million and $103 million. “Whether you want to claim that it was the exclusive fault of the government from preventing these people from working, or if you feel like there are direct impacts from COVID to people and their ability to earn dollars – I think it matters to both of those individuals,” he said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A food bank is $168,000 richer thanks to actress Jennie Garth. Garth is donating the money she won on ABC’s “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” to the Springfield-based Central Illinois Foodbank. “It doesn’t come around too often, so we were really excited and blessed to receive the gift because an extra $168,600 really means a lot of food going out,” said Adam Handy, partner resource coordinator for the food bank. “It really helps us continue the work we’re already doing.” Garth, an Illinois native who grew up outside Urbana, wanted to do something to help people in the food bank’s 21-county service area with her winnings from her successful answer in the “food and drink” category on Thursday’s episode, Handy said. Garth starred in the television shows, “Beverly Hills, 90210,” and “What I Like About You.”\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: A museum founded by a Holocaust survivor who championed forgiveness has reopened following a six-month-long closure prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. The CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center reopened in Terre Haute on Friday, when 26 visitors showed up to see a new exhibit and hear the stories of Holocaust survivors. “We are excited to have people back, and we are trying to be very cautionary with our cleaning routines and safety,” museum director Leah Simpson told the Tribune-Star. She said public interest in the museum and education center has remained strong during the months­long closure amid the pandemic. The CANDLES museum, or Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors, was founded by Eva Kor, who died in July 2019 at age 85. She and her twin sister, Miriam Zeiger, who died of cancer in 1993, endured medical experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp, where their parents and older sister – members of a Jewish family from Romania – died. A new digital exhibit at the museum, “In Their Own Words: The Mengele Twins Tell Their Stories,” includes videos of survivors of experiments conducted by Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor who conducted cruel experiments at concentration camps.\n\nIowa\n\nOrange City: Pizza Ranch, known for its buffet of pizza, chicken and other offerings, expanded last year, even as the pandemic hit the restaurant industry harder than most. Pizza Ranch, based in Orange City, has more than 200 locations in 14 states. The chain added five new locations last year and has six or seven more openings slated for this year, Chief Administrative Officer Ryan Achterhoff told the Sioux City Journal. “We really maintained momentum – that’s below our normal annual expansion of units, but most brands, most concepts, were not expanding at all this year,” he said. The National Restaurant Association reported in September that almost 100,000 restaurants – nearly 1 in every 6 – closed permanently or long-term due to the pandemic. Many restaurants struggled with government-ordered shutdowns across the country, and the industry was expected to lose about $240 billion in sales by the end of the year, according to the association. Even with the expansion, Achterhoff acknowledged that the past year has been challenging for Pizza Ranch, noting the chain weathered it by becoming more reliant on carryout and deliveries in 2020. “Delivery and pickup, or to-go, did overtake our buffet business (in) 2020,” he said. “Historically, we’re 80% buffet, dine-in buffet ... that’s what people think of Pizza Ranch.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Meatpacking plants were hit hard by the coronavirus, yet thousands of workers at facilities in southwest Kansas are still waiting to hear when they’ll be vaccinated. The Kansas News Service reports the wait is frustrating for workers who have watched college faculty, first responders and postal workers get their vaccines, and Kansas has launched a program to get a first dose into the arms of every school worker by early April. Meatpacking plants have been the state’s third-largest source of COVID-19 outbreaks, topped only by long-term care facilities and correctional centers. “Meatpacking workers have taken one of the hardest hits of this pandemic,” said Monica Vargas-Huertas, political director for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 2 representing 7,000 meatpacking workers in two southwest Kansas counties. “They kept working, securing the food (supply),” Vargas-Huertas said, “and securing the economy of the state.” But state officials say meatpacking facilities took steps that greatly reduced transmission. Kansas has some of the country’s most productive beef plants, driving the economies of towns such as Dodge City, Garden City and Liberal. Meatpacking workers are mainly immigrants and people of color.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The congregation at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church hasn’t missed a Sunday “service” since June, though like a lot of things in this pandemic, it looks different from what most might expect. For nine months – rain or shine, throughout sweltering and freezing temperatures – the congregation has kept up with its new tradition of filling pantries instead of pews. Every week a group of the faithful gather outside the church from 9 a.m. until noon and collects food for its sister church Calvary Episcopal Church just south of downtown. It’s a way to practice faith and enjoy fellowship without lingering inside the church and potentially spreading COVID-19. Back in August, St. Paul’s collected about 250 to 500 items per week. Since then, generosity has boomed. Now the church members collect upward of 600 items per week, and more than 75% of the people who drop things off don’t even go to St. Paul’s, according to Dave Dawkins, a church member, who helps deliver the donations to Calvary Episcopal Church each week. Just two weeks ago, the effort crossed a major milestone, gathering more than 20,000 items for people in need since the pandemic began.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: It’s always tough for school districts to find substitutes. The pandemic is making it even harder, officials say. Vermilion Parish Assistant Superintendent E. Paul Hebert said the district’s substitute “pool” has dwindled, leaving fewer folks to fill shortages for all positions. “It’s much worse this year,” Hebert said. “Before COVID, the shortage has been manageable. This year, the shortage has been critical.” The biggest needs are for bus drivers, regular and substitute, as well as cafeteria employees, custodians, bus monitors and classroom teachers. Hebert said those jobs do not get done without a sub. “We need it across the board,” he said. The district has 1,300 employees and a sub list of 400, ranging in age from “right out of high school to senior citizens,” Hebert said. The number officially has remained the same, but the pool is much smaller than it appears. Some, especially older subs, on the list are opting out of any jobs this year due to health concerns, he said. “And we also have a high number of absences and quarantines,” Hebert said. The pandemic also affects how schools can respond to an employee’s absence. For example, classes can’t be combined when a teacher is out due to limits on group size and contact. “Now it’s almost daily that we need a sub,” Hebert said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Vaccinations are coming to the state’s islands. Maine Seacoast Mission is providing island COVID-19 vaccination clinics starting this week with medical and support staff arriving on the organization’s 74-foot boat, Sunbeam. “We have been anticipating this opportunity to serve since the first vaccine was announced last fall,” said Seacoast Mission President John Zavodny. The organization is working in partnership with island residents, county officials, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Mount Desert Island Hospital, and Pen Bay Medical Center. The Sunbeam is equipped with health facilities including a medical-grade refrigerator. Mission Island Health Services Director Sharon Daley said she’s starting with 150 doses for islanders. Meanwhile, more than half of people over age 70 in the state have been vaccinated, the Maine CDC’s director said. Dr. Nirav Shah said Monday during an appearance on Maine Public that the use of multiple platforms has helped swiftly vaccinate older residents. That includes clinics, hospitals and other venues, he said. Shah also said Monday that the appearance of coronavirus variants in Maine and elsewhere is a concern but doesn’t have to be a disaster. Maine has been the site of two confirmed variants so far.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A large number of Marylanders signed up to get COVID-19 vaccines at a sports stadium only to have the appointments canceled. The Baltimore Sun reports most people had signed up using an invalid link. The University of Maryland Medical System said the booking link to schedule appointments at M&T Bank Stadium was “inadvertently” made public. Spokesman Michael Schwartzberg said people who had signed up have since been notified that their vaccines were canceled because eligibility couldn’t be confirmed. He said a nonpublic website had inadvertently made an appointment booking link discoverable. “Vaccination appointments were created in error by several thousand people via this invalid link, where vaccination eligibility was unable to be confirmed, and the link was shared widely before we were able to shut it down,” Schwartzberg said. M&T Bank Stadium is scheduled to open Thursday as the state’s third mass vaccination site. State health officials have yet to say when people can register for the vaccine.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston Calling music festival has been canceled for a second year in a row, organizers announced Monday. “After exploring all possible options for hosting Boston Calling this year, we have made the difficult decision in conjunction with local and state authorities to cancel the 2021 festival,” organizers said in a statement on the festival’s website. “The health and safety of our entire community is always our top priority, and there was no appropriate scenario under which we could provide the Boston Calling experience you love and deserve.” The three-day festival is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend in May. Although ticket refunds are being offered, tickets purchased for the 2021 event will be honored in 2022, organizers said. Foo Fighters, Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers were scheduled to appear at the 2020 festival before the pandemic forced its cancellation.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: In response to the pandemic and thanks to funding from Ford Motor Co., the Salvation Army of Metro Detroit is adding special trips to its daily Bed and Bread program once a month to provide hot meals, care packages and medical checkups and to offer shelter to the city’s homeless. “We’re trying to step up for our brothers and sisters in Detroit, and, just like someone would come to our home, we’re extending the best that we have to these people,” said Jamie Winkler, executive director of the Salvation Army Eastern Michigan Harbor Light System. “We’re doing that to meet a practical, human need that starts off with shelter and food, and at the same time we are giving a message of hope to them.” In 2019, Detroit’s homeless population reached 10,000, according to the Homeless Action Network of Detroit, but city shelters are ill-equipped to meet the need with only about 1,900 beds. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated an already severe situation. Shelters have had to reduce the number of residents, people are more hesitant to accept shelter in fear of contracting the virus, and the places they could go for temporary reprieve – bus stations, restaurants, stadiums – completely shut down.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMahnomen: The state’s only county located entirely within the borders of a Native American reservation has been vaccinating at rates that far surpass most other counties, authorities said. Mahnomen County is in the northwestern part of the state, about an hour’s drive from the Fargo, North Dakota, and Moorhead, Minnesota, metropolitan area. As of this past week, 85% of people 65 and older in the county have been vaccinated. Public health leaders at the White Earth Nation and Mahnomen County credit that high vaccination rate to close collaboration between the tribe and the county to efficiently get those doses to residents, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The White Earth Reservation is a patchwork of tribal and private land, and the people who live there are a nearly equal mix of Native Americans and non-Native people. Because White Earth is a sovereign nation, it has the authority to set its own parameters for who is eligible to be vaccinated. The tribe decided everyone 18 and up in the county should qualify. “Vaccine wasn’t limited to people who were enrolled members or who had a way to prove they had Native Nation blood,” said tribal public health medical director Dr. Carson Gardner. “We discussed that at length and decided that was the right thing to do.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi State Department of Health confirmed 242 new cases of COVID-19 and no coronavirus-related deaths Monday, the second consecutive day with no COVID-19-related deaths reported. Since the virus hit the state in March, a total of 290,874 cases and 6,553 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported. January saw the most COVID-19 deaths in a single month in Mississippi, with 1,240. The single-day record of 98 deaths was reported Jan. 12. On Jan. 7, the state reported a single-day record of 3,255 new cases of the coronavirus. There are currently 93 outbreaks at Mississippi nursing homes. There have been 10,364 cases of the coronavirus in long-term care facilities and 1,937 deaths reported as of Friday, the latest figures available. Residents between the ages of 25 and 39 represent the largest portion of the infected population in the state, with 63,693 cases reported Tuesday, the latest figure available. Among patients under 18, children between the ages of 11 and 17 have the highest infection rate, with 22,157 cases identified. The 65-and-older age group has the highest total number of deaths with 5,004 reported. According to health department data, 336,932 people had begun the vaccination process in Mississippi as of Sunday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The number of new coronavirus cases continued to decline Monday, but state officials cited one cause for concern: Wastewater samples indicate the fast-spreading U.K. variant is “widespread” across the state. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reported 351 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths. The number of new daily cases has dropped off sharply over the past several weeks after a surge during the holidays, and hospitalizations have reached the lowest levels since the summer. The first Missouri case of the U.K. variant was confirmed Feb. 6 in Marion County in northeast Missouri. It remains the only confirmed case in the state. But the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said wastewater sampling has found the variant across the state. The sampling is part of the Coronavirus Sewershed Surveillance Project created by researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia in partnership with the state health department and Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Marc Johnson, a university virologist, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the variant was detected in more than 13 wastewater systems in Missouri. Researchers say the project can provide early detection of an upcoming COVID-19 outbreak or emerging novel viral variants.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians is building its health services largely from scratch roughly a year after becoming the United States’ 574th federally recognized Indigenous tribe. Because of the pandemic, it’s doing it on hyperdrive. The long-sought recognition came just months before the pandemic took hold, arriving in time to guarantee the right to crucial health care and a tribal supply of protective COVID-19 vaccines. Federal pandemic relief dollars are speeding up the Little Shell Tribe’s ability to build its own clinic. Without the federal pandemic funds, Indian Health Service and Little Shell officials said it would have likely taken years using only IHS resources to establish a clinic. The coronavirus has also stalled in-person celebrations and planning in the tribe’s first year of federal recognition. Worst yet, COVID-19 has disproportionately infected and killed Indigenous people nationwide, exposing long-standing health inequities caused by a history of colonization and underinvestment in Indian Country. In Montana, Native Americans make up roughly 7% of the population yet account for 11% of the state’s COVID-19 cases and 17% of related deaths. The Little Shell tribal health care system is so new that it doesn’t have electronic health records set up and hasn’t tracked the statistics.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state launched a federally funded aid program Monday for renters and landlords who have lost income due to the pandemic, but residents of the two largest counties won’t be eligible. The program managed by the Nebraska Investment Finance Authority offers a maximum of 15 months of rental or mortgage assistance per applicant, up to $20,000. State officials said it’s only available to tenants who make 80% or less of their county’s median income and can show they’re unable to pay rent because of a financial hardship caused by the pandemic or at risk of becoming homeless. “It’s our commitment to quickly communicate the availability and guidelines of this program those who are most in need,” Shannon Harner, director of the Nebraska Investment Finance Authority, said at a news conference with Gov. Pete Ricketts. Harner said Douglas and Lancaster counties, home to Omaha and Lincoln, have their own programs that won’t launch until early March. Harner said the state’s program will cover the cost of utilities for renters, dating as far back as April 1, 2020. Landlords who have already evicted their tenants for not paying rent aren’t eligible.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Clark County School District is in need of hundreds of crossing guards for when schools return to in-person learning next month. KTNV-TV in Las Vegas reports Nevada’s largest school district is trying to fill 675 school crossing guard positions to cover 430 intersections. The district has been holding virtual learning since the school year started in August. But elementary school students will be allowed to return to campus March 1. According to the Nevada Department of Public Safety Office of Traffic Safety, 41 children going to or coming from school were hit by cars during the last school year before virtual learning was implemented. Among them, three suffered serious injuries, and one died. The crossing guard positions are part time and pay $15 an hour. They would cover streets in Las Vegas, unincorporated areas of the county and Henderson.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House can proceed with in-person sessions this week without providing remote access to medically vulnerable lawmakers, a federal judge ruled Monday. Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Republican House Speaker Sherm Packard last week arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions and forces them to either risk their lives or abandon their duties as elected officials. They sought a preliminary order requiring remote access, but U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty denied their request. Without ruling on the merits of the case, she said the speaker can’t be sued for enforcing a House rule that is “closely related to core legislative functions.” Packard said in a statement that leaders “will continue to work with all House members to ensure that if they choose to attend any legislative meeting in person, that they can be confident that we are taking a high degree of precaution, and have extensive health and safety measures in place.” But House Democratic Leader Renny Cushing, one of the suit’s plaintiffs, said ruling makes clear that the speaker is “solely to blame for active and obvious exclusion of members of the House.” “As we teach our children, just because you can do something does not mean you should,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Fans will be allowed to attend sports and entertainment events at the state’s largest facilities in limited numbers starting next week, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Venues with an indoor seating capacity of 5,000 or more will be allowed to have 10% of those seats occupied by fans starting March 1, the Democratic governor said on the WFAN sports radio station. For outdoor venues over 5,000 seats, the number will be 15% of capacity. Murphy said he decided to allow the limited in-person attendance after reviewing a vast array of coronavirus-related statistics including hospitalizations, the number of hospital admissions versus discharges, overall positivity rate for the virus and the rate of transmission, and he determined small crowds can be permitted safely. He said face coverings and social distancing will be required at these venues. “If you buy tickets together, you can sit together, but otherwise, we have to spread apart,” he said. The order applies to the state’s major arenas, including the Prudential Center in Newark, where the NHL’s New Jersey Devils play, and outdoor stadiums including MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, home to the NFL’s New York Giants and Jets. The governor said about 1,700 to 1,800 fans should be allowed to attend Devils hockey games under the new rules.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state government is likely to deliver a jolt of one-time spending amid the pandemic and provide sustained funding increases on health care and public education under a newly drafted budget bill. The lead House budget committee on Monday unanimously endorsed the spending plan for the coming fiscal year that increases general fund spending by $332 million for the fiscal year that starts July 1. That represents a 4.6% increase over current fiscal year spending. Total general fund spending would increase to $7.39 billion under the plan that includes a 1.5% raise for employees throughout state government, K-12 schools, and public colleges and universities. Larger raises are slated for prison guards. A vote by the full House of Representatives is scheduled this week before the proposal moves to the Senate for possible amendments and approval. Public schools in New Mexico rely on the state for most is their funding, and the draft budget would increase K-12 spending by 5.5% to $3.39 billion. “We want to extend the school year regarding the loss of learning we’ve seen this last year,” said Democratic state Rep. Patricia Lundstrom of Gallup, chairwoman of the House budget committee.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The first case of the South African coronavirus variant has been discovered in a resident, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. The case involved a resident of Long Island’s Nassau County, Cuomo said in a news release. A Connecticut resident who had been hospitalized in New York City was found to have the South African variant last week. The mutated version of the virus, originally identified in South Africa, was first found in the United States last month. Scientists believe it is more easily spread than other virus strains. Cuomo said the variant’s arrival in New York means COVID-19 safety measures like wearing masks and maintaining distance from other people are more important than ever. “We are in a race right now – between our ability to vaccinate and these variants which are actively trying to proliferate – and we will only win that race if we stay smart and disciplined,” he said. Meanwhile, the state’s latest COVID-19 numbers show a continued downward trend in hospitalizations and deaths following the holiday season spike. There were fewer than 5,800 patients hospitalized with the virus Saturday, a decline of more than 800 from a week earlier. The state recorded 75 COVID-19 deaths Saturday, the first time since Dec. 16 that the daily death toll was under 100.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The “Empress of Soul” has a soft spot in her heart for Haywood County, as well as the showing a brighter path forward in the coronavirus pandemic. Famed soul singer Gladys Knight and her husband, William “Billy” McDowell, who live in the Asheville area, recently received their COVID-19 vaccinations at Haywood Regional Medical Center and encouraged other folks to do the same at a vaccine drive Feb. 13. Knight and McDowell, a Canton native, are working toward establishing a community center with their nonprofit RHS Community Foundation. They worked in partnership with Haywood County Health and Human Services Agency to offer the free drive-thru clinic to help dispel vaccination fears within the community, said Allison Richmond, spokeswoman for Haywood County Emergency Management Team. “I’m concerned about everybody. I’m a people person. I love people, and if not for people I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing,” Knight said in a statement as to why she got the vaccine. Knight, a Grammy winner best known for her hit with the Pips, “Midnight Train to Georgia,” also encouraged the community to wear masks to protect others.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The head of the state’s insurance department has long opposed the Affordable Care Act. But with a special enrollment period underway, residents facing more struggles because of the pandemic still are encouraged to seek out the program. The option to sign up for coverage under the ACA usually is open in November and December. But at the urging of consumer advocates, President Joe Biden authorized a new enrollment period, which started this week and goes until mid-May. Jon Godfread, North Dakota insurance commissioner, said the extended window could be a good safety net for residents who suddenly are without a job and the health coverage that goes along with it. “North Dakota’s been able to weather the storm a little bit better than some other states,” Godfread said. “But that doesn’t mean that there hasn’t been some changes and shifting of people’s employment status and what they’re doing.” He said that’s why those lacking coverage right now should visit the healthcare.gov website to see if it can help. North Dakota is one of 36 states opting for the federally run exchange and not a state marketplace.\n\nOhio\n\nWest Chester Township: A doughnut shop says it had to call police because people who gathered for an event with a state lawmaker over the weekend weren’t abiding by pandemic guidelines, which those attending dispute. People who gathered Saturday for a “coffee chat” with the lawmaker weren’t exercising social distancing, Holtman’s Donut Shop wrote in a Facebook post. The store said staff at the West Chester Township business, outside Cincinnati, asked them to spread out and wear masks, and most abided by the request. A few people began to wander around the shop and mingle without masks, according to the post. Rep. Jennifer Gross, a Republican who represents the Ohio House’s 52nd district, was “conducting a meeting and standing without wearing a mask like we had asked,” according to the post. Gross told the paper the group complied with the staff’s instructions, but police arrived anyway. “Unfortunately, even though we were seated, drinking coffee, spread out, and eating donuts that was not enough,” the 21-year military veteran, who has been in office for six weeks, said in a response to the Facebook post by Holtman’s. The establishment said several other people walked up to the shop or inside but left because of the group.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The state opened its second phase of vaccinations Monday, providing inoculations to public school teachers and staff and to adults of any age with illnesses that make them more susceptible to the coronavirus. “Our goal is to make sure that every Oklahoma teacher and staff member who wants the COVID-19 vaccine can get it by spring break” in mid-March, health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said at a vaccination clinic in Norman. Oklahoma Teacher of the Year Jena Nelson and the six 2021 teacher of the year finalists were the first to be vaccinated at the clinic. More than 681,000 Oklahomans had been vaccinated as of Friday, according to the state health department, and an estimated 60,000 more vaccinations were administered over the weekend, said deputy health commissioner Keith Reed. About two-thirds of those eligible for the shot in Oklahoma have received a vaccination, Reed said. State schools superintendent Joy Hofmeister said she expects a higher percentage of public school staff to accept the vaccine. “Teachers have been clamoring for the prioritization of having the vaccine,” Hofmeister said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: As thousands of Oregonians have lost their jobs or had their hours cut, the number of people working for the state has increased 4% from February of last year. Many of those hires reflect the increased demand for certain state services – like food assistance and unemployment benefits – during the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. State lawmakers tried to stave off big cuts to the state budget last year by using a mix of savings and “one-time” funds. State agencies in the executive branch had a net gain of about 500 permanent workers between February 2020 and February 2021, a jump of about 1%, according to data from the Oregon Department of Administrative Services. Among the gains: 440 new employees at the Oregon Department of Human Services and 76 new workers at the Oregon Health Authority. At the Department of Human Services, workers have been hired to help process food assistance benefits since more people have become eligible because of the pandemic, said a spokeswoman for the department, Lisa Morawski. Workers also have been hired in the child welfare system, and to help with a new system that allows Oregonians to apply online for medical, food and other benefits with one application.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nState College: Penn State students managed to raise more than $10.6 million for pediatric cancer patients in the annual 46-hour dance marathon known as Thon despite mostly virtual fundraising efforts throughout the year and having the event online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The $10,638,078.62 total was announced Sunday at the conclusion of the Penn State Interfraternity Council/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, billed as the world’s largest student-run philanthropy. Money raised benefits pediatric cancer patients and their families at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Child cancer survivors and their families also usually participate. This year, dancers participated remotely from their own homes with a limited stage setup for a livestream broadcast. While dancers traditionally aren’t allowed to sleep or even sit during the event, aided by thousands of other students in support roles, the Centre Daily Times reports that this year they were encouraged to rest from midnight to 6 a.m. because they didn’t have access to the usual medical resources of the in-person event. Last year, the in-person event raised almost $11.7 million dollars. Officials say the event has raised more than $180 million since 1977.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state on Monday started allowing residents 65 and older to schedule appointments for a COVID-19 vaccination. The state said in a statement that it expected to schedule about 10,000 appointments Monday for shots at two state-run vaccination sites at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence and the former Citizens Bank headquarters on Sockanosset Cross Road in Cranston. But the agency also said because of limited supplies, not everyone who wants to make an appointment will be able to right away. Vaccinations are also available at some CVS and Walgreens pharmacy locations and at local clinics. About 9,900 people were vaccinated at the two state-run sites over their first three days of operation, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, according to the health department. Meanwhile, Rhode Island’s largest health care organization on Monday started allowing patients to have visitors again, in line with state Department of Health guidelines announced last week. At Rhode Island and Newport hospitals, two visitors may enter together, but the Miriam Hospital is only allowing one visitor to enter at a time, unless one visitor requires an escort, Lifespan announced in a statement on its website. All visits must be during designated visiting hours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: After a year of cancellations and modified virtual experiences, the city is planning to hold a downtown festival live and in person. Artisphere, one of Greenville’s most popular cultural events, will take place May 7-9, spokesperson Taryn Scher announced Monday. The festival will be “safe, small and socially distanced,” according to a press release. To manage crowd size, Artisphere 2021 will use timed and ticketed entry. Walk-up tickets will be available at the gate during the festival, but organizers encourage reservations in advance. To track entries for each session, every festival attendee will wear a lanyard with a chip that will activate when they enter the gated section, executive director Kerry Murphy said. The area will be sanitized between sessions. Other COVID-19 precautions include required masking and widespread handwashing and hand-sanitizing stations. Social distancing reminders will be posted throughout the festival site, according to the press release.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of people vaccinated for COVID-19 in the state has surged ahead of the total number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Vaccinated individuals, plus the widespread number of people who caught and recovered from the virus, mean a growing number of people have acquired immunity to COVID-19, a major factor in why experts say positive cases have decreased. That was the major highlight emerging in the last week of the pandemic ending Friday. Some people who have battled COVID-19 have also been among those vaccinated, which limits the reach of calculating herd immunity via a simple count of positive cases plus vaccinated people. The Department of Health doesn’t have figures on the crossover between the two groups. And while some experts think people with natural immunity should be moved to the end of the vaccination line, federal guidelines don’t call for that, and thus some of those who already tested positive are getting vaccinated anyway. Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said those who have tested positive for the virus should still get vaccines if they can. “We just want to really encourage that group and not deprioritize them,” she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Six weeks after the state’s coronavirus outbreak began to recede, the number of deaths reported has finally begun to drop – hopefully signaling the last gasp of the horrific winter surge. Tennessee’s counts of infections, hospitalizations and test positivity peaked in early January and have steadily decreased since, now falling to levels not seen since October or November. But the number of virus-related deaths, a lagging indictor of the pandemic’s strength, did not drop. Deaths continued to rise throughout January and into February, reaching a peak of 135 deaths per day in the first week of this month. Now, that appears to be changing. The average number of virus deaths reported each day has fallen by about 80% over the past two weeks, finally bringing the last measurement of the virus in line with the rest. As of Friday, Tennessee was reporting an average of 24 deaths per day, the lowest average in more than four months. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Nashville coronavirus task force, said it was logical for a drop in deaths to follow the state’s well-documented decline of infections and hospitalizations. Now it seems to be happening. “I do think this lowering death rate is real,” Jahangir said. “I think we are on the right track.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients dropped Sunday to their lowest level since mid-November, according to data released Sunday by state health officials. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 7,146 hospitalizations, the fewest since the 7,083 reported Nov. 12. Hospitalizations have been steadily dropping since mid-January. There were an additional 130 COVID-19 deaths and more than 4,259 new cases, the department reported. Texas has had more than 2.5 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and more than 42,000 deaths due to COVID-19, the third-highest death count in the United States, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project and Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of new cases has fallen from nearly 18,980 per day to nearly 5,041, and the average of daily deaths has dropped from 305.7 per day to 127.3, according to the COVID Tracking Project data. During the past two weeks, the rolling average of daily new cases in Texas has fallen by 13,354, a decrease of 75.9%, according to the Johns Hopkins figures.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Southwest Utah Public Health Department has announced plans to reschedule appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations delayed by a winter storm last week. The severe weather affected shipments of vaccine to area clinics from outside the state, KSTU-TV reports. Southwest Utah Public Health Department said its Feb. 18 appointments have been rescheduled for Feb. 22, 25 and 27. The Weber-Morgan Health Department also rescheduled Feb. 18 appointments for Feb. 22. Utah residents age 65 and older are now eligible to receive vaccines and should check with local health departments for appointment availability. Utah so far has distributed more than 607,000 vaccines, including more than 83,000 in the past week.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Schools across the state have lost track of some students and are seeking to reconnect with them. Principals report truancy has been on the rise since the COVID-19 pandemic began, said Jay Nichols, head of the Vermont Principals Association. The Agency of Education is trying to determine the scope of the problem and last week sent a survey on the topic to school districts. “For whatever reason, the students are just not doing their classwork, they’re not signing into Google meets, they’re not coming in for their in-person days, and so it’s a real problem,” Chris Young, the principal of North Country Union High School in Newport, told Vermont Public Radio. Nichols said that in addition to the challenges of virtual learning, the pandemic has also increased financial stress for some families that were already on the economic margins. Young said getting students back into school isn’t about punitive measures. “It is about, ’We want you back, we need you back, we miss you when you’re not here, and what can we do to help you come back into the school environment?’ ” Young said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A bill that would have mandated paid sick leave for a range of essential workers cleared a key Senate committee Monday – but only after it was sharply whittled down to cover only certain home health care workers. The original House bill would have required paid sick leave for grocery store workers, prison personnel, child care providers, farmworkers, poultry workers and others. An amendment by Senate Democrats who did not want to impose such a mandate on private businesses limited the bill to cover only home health care workers serving Medicaid patients. Supporters said they would have preferred a more expansive bill but called the compromise a move in the right direction. “It’s a drastic reduction from what we had wanted, but it’s still a good step forward in that it gets paid sick days for 30,000 home health care workers,” said Kim Bobo, executive director of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. The legislation would require employers to provide up to 40 hours of paid sick leave in a year, unless the employer selects a higher limit. The issue has been divisive, even among Democrats who control state government. Opponents have said the mandate would be onerous and costly for small businesses that are already struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: Local health officials are stepping up efforts to address racial gaps among people getting the COVID-19 vaccine, a growing problem for vaccination efforts in Kitsap County and throughout the United States. The Kitsap Public Health District, tasked with supporting equitable vaccinations, is aiming to increase access to communities of color, immigrants and other marginalized groups through expanded outreach, reserved appointment slots and partnerships with community leaders. On Thursday, the health district launched a vaccine equity collaborative made up of local leaders and community organizations, which will provide input about ways in which vaccine providers can reduce barriers people face in getting a shot. That group is still in its beginning stages, but Kitsap Public Health has already started working with various groups to improve vaccine access. The Kitsap Immigration Assistance Center is helping with outreach in immigrant and Latino communities, while Kitsap County’s Department of Human Services is working to reach and register older people who need help with online systems. Data from the Kitsap Public Health District shows vaccination rates among Hispanic and Black residents significantly lag their white counterparts. The same trend has played out statewide.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: While passing a basketball among a team of kids from different areas of Marion County is not the best activity idea during a pandemic, the Marion County Parks and Recreation Commission has created a new way to teach kids the fundamentals of basketball. MCPARC normally hosts a K-3 basketball league for kids throughout the county but this year will instead provide virtual clinics in partnership with D&C Basketball, a basketball camp and coaching organization based in Marion County. “Normally, we would hold a winter league for kindergartners through third graders that starts in October and runs until March,” said Rachel Mitchell, assistant director of MCPARC. “We were unable to do that this year due to the pandemic. We weren’t able to go into the schools to use their facilities, understandably so, so we decided to switch it to a virtual format.” According to Mitchell, the virtual platform allows MCPARC to hit a wider demographic of participants because the lessons taught by Deon Dobbs and Corey Hines, the co-founders of D&C Basketball, in the videos can be implemented at any level of basketball play. Mitchell said having video clinics also allows the kids who sign up to take the lessons at their own pace.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: No COVID-19 deaths were reported Monday, marking the first time since early September that the state has had two such days in a row. The last time Wisconsin went two or more days without a single reported death from the coronavirus was the three-day stretch of Sept. 6-8. The state’s seven-day average of new cases was at its lowest point since early July, but it increased marginally from Sunday. The seven-day average Monday was 612, up from 610 the day before. Nearly 560,000 Wisconsin residents have tested positive for the virus, and 6,284 have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic started. Wisconsin’s death count is the 23rd highest in the country overall and the 34th highest per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has decreased by nearly 42%. Wisconsin’s vaccination rate dropped from a high of seventh nationally last week to 15th as of Monday, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. As of Monday, 14.9% of Wisconsin’s population had received at least one dose, which was ahead of the national average of 13.3%. Nearly 353,000 residents have received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, or about 6.1% of the population, the state health department said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Meteorologists have warned that low levels of precipitation across the state could increase the threat of wildfires over the summer. Tim Troutman, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Riverton, told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the state is experiencing its worst drought since 2012, the same year it recorded one of its more active wildfire seasons. In 2012, fires in Wyoming burned 875 square miles and cost the state about $100 million to contain. Officials have said more moisture now can help prevent similar conditions later in the year. “If we begin to get more moisture into the area and more snow and rain, that definitely can alleviate conditions,” Troutman said. It is unclear if the state reached its desired precipitation threshold.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/21/mow-may-haunted-house-shooting-monk-seal-birth-news-around-states/50119967/", "title": "No Mow May, haunted house shooting: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Civil rights pioneer Jo Ann Robinson, who played an instrumental role in the historic 13-month Montgomery Bus Boycott in the mid-1950s, had a residence hall named after her on Alabama State University’s campus Tuesday. The hall was previously named for Bibb Graves, former Alabama governor and member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Board of Trustees voted to change the name in September. Dr. Sheree Finley, a relative of Robinson, called the renaming exciting. “She’s finally being brought to the forefront,” Finley said. Local artist Kevin King painted a portrait of Robinson during the event. The featured speaker of the event was Fred Gray, famed civil rights attorney, who recalled planning the bus boycott in Robinson’s living room. “Little did many know that (many of the) activities that (had an) impact on the civil rights movement in Alabama occurred at Jo Ann Robinson’s house,” Gray said. “She was the person who was interested in having mass participation. We could have desegregated the buses without a protest, but she was interested in getting something done with the community.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A legal challenge has been filed claiming proposed state Senate districts for the capital city area unconstitutionally favor the Eagle River suburb. The motion to reject the amended redistricting plan and to modify it was filed Monday as Anchorage Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews considers the legality of the map approved last week by the state’s redistricting board, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The new map was drawn after portions of the board’s first proposal were ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court. Each state Senate district is composed of two House districts. The board’s first proposal sought to link Eagle River to the south Muldoon area of Anchorage, which the Alaska Supreme Court called an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The court ruled in a lawsuit brought by east Anchorage residents Felisa Wilson, George Martinez and Yarrow Silvers, who also filed Monday’s challenge. The new proposal seeks to link south Eagle River to south Anchorage and north Eagle River to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The new challenge claims the redistricting board incorrectly interpreted the court’s instructions by keeping Muldoon districts together but again splitting the Eagle River districts. The filing seeks an order requiring the board to keep both House districts in Eagle River together.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A wildfire nearly tripled in size as relentless winds pushed the flames through neighborhoods on the outskirts of a college and tourist town, keeping hundreds of residents away from their homes and destroying more than two dozen structures. The blaze continued its run Wednesday through dry grass and scattered Ponderosa pines around homes into volcanic cinder fields, where roots underground can combust and send small rocks flying into the air, fire officials said. Persistent spring winds and 50 mph gusts hindered firefighters. “This is a heads-up for everywhere else in the state,” said fire information officer Dick Fleishman. “If you have dry grass up next to your house, it’s time to get that cleaned up.” Fire managers are contending with tight resources as wildfires burn around the Southwest. The U.S. has 16 top-level national fire management teams, and four of those are dedicated to blazes in Arizona and New Mexico – something Fleishman said is rare this early in the wildfire season. Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of the wildfires north of Flagstaff and south of Prescott in Arizona. On the outskirts of Flagstaff – where tourists and locals revel in hiking and horseback riding trails, camping spots, and the vast expanse of cinder fields for off-road vehicle use – flames soared as high as 100 feet. Popular national monuments including Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki were closed because of the wildfire.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: The Cherokee Nation has signed an agreement with the National Park Service to allow citizens to gather plants within the Buffalo National River to use for purposes including food, crafts and medicine. The river, located in the Ozark Mountains, was established as the country’s first national river in 1972. “This area has a vibrant history of helping sustain our Cherokee people with food, the cane and bushes for our Cherokee crafts, and leaves and roots for traditional medicine,” Deputy Chief Bryan Warner said. The agreement, announced Wednesday, will establish a process for Cherokee citizens to gather plants in parts of the national park including the Lost Valley, Tyler Bend, Buffalo Point and Rush areas. “This i7/ 8 s an important step in the continuing efforts to embrace our tribal partners in the management of public lands at Buffalo National River,” said Mark Foust, National Park Service superintendent at Buffalo National River. “The Cherokee Nation offers invaluable information, ecological knowledge, and a unique perspective that will lead to a better understanding of the benefits of public land.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: City supervisors have approved legislation prohibiting police from storing DNA obtained from rape kits and other crime scene evidence in city-run databases for more than 60 days. Tuesday’s unanimous vote came two months after San Francisco’s district attorney disclosed that police used a sexual assault victim’s DNA against her in 2016 in an unrelated 2021 property crime case. The revelation by DA Chesa Boudin prompted a national outcry among law enforcement, legal experts, lawmakers and advocates of sexual assault victims. Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who introduced the legislation, said there were no local laws regulating the storage or use of DNA profiles in local police databases, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Victim samples cannot be uploaded to state and federal DNA databases, which are more tightly regulated, and the legislation does not apply to those databases. “The fact that the police department’s crime lab has been storing and using victims’ physical evidence against victims came as a shock to most of us in the city,” Ronen said. The department stores DNA information in what it calls a quality control database in order to ensure samples are not contaminated. The department has said it stopped the practice. Police chief Bill Scott told police commissioners in March that he’d discovered 17 crime victim profiles, 11 of them from rape kits, that were matched using a crime victims database during unrelated investigations.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A “game changing” app will soon be in the hands of local first responders, and officials say it will improve their interactions with those in the community who have mental health issues or intellectual or developmental disabilities. Fort Collins Police Services announced Thursday that its officers will begin using the Vitals app in a first-of-its-kind partnership with UCHealth through the co-responder program and Mental Health Response Team. People and caregivers can download the Vitals app and create a profile that includes an individual’s name, photo, other identifying information and medical information along with their behavioral triggers and de-escalation techniques, which can help officers respond better in a crisis situation, UCHealth Co-Responder Supervisor Stephanie Booco said during a news conference. Fort Collins police officers and UCHealth co-responders who have the app will receive notifications when they are near someone with a profile and can use the information in the profile to better assist or resolve a situation. The technology is a “game changer” for the community, Fort Collins Police Services Chief Jeff Swoboda said. Fort Collins is the first community in Colorado to start using the Vitals app and the first community in the country to use it with a co-responder program, Booco said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers advanced legislation Tuesday evening that abortion rights advocates say is needed to protect in-state medical providers from legal action, as well as patients who travel to Connecticut to terminate a pregnancy and those who help them. It comes amid new abortion restrictions being enacted in a growing number of conservative states. The bill cleared the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 87-60. It now awaits action in the Senate. Although Connecticut codified the right to abortion in 1990, proponents said steps need to be taken now to prepare for the U.S. Supreme Court possibly overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. However, the socially conservative Family Institute of Connecticut has criticized the legislation, arguing it will create a “safe harbor” for “abortion providers who violate abortion laws in other states.” The bill is considered by some advocates to be one of the most consequential abortion-related proposals to come up for a vote in the Connecticut General Assembly since 1990. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he will sign the legislation in the law if clears the full Democratic-controlled General Assembly.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Sen. Darius Brown has regained his high-profile General Assembly committee assignments, following his acquittal of misdemeanor charges earlier this year. A jury in January found the Wilmington Democrat not guilty of misdemeanor offensive touching and disorderly conduct. A woman accused Brown at the time of hitting her in the head and throwing a drink glass that shattered near her while dining at a Talleyville restaurant in May 2021. Following his arrest, Brown was removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired. In November, months after his arrest, Brown reportedly got into a verbal altercation with Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle, during a bill-signing press event. That led to Senate leadership stripping Brown of his role on the Bond Committee, a high-profile position that helps write the annual infrastructure spending bill. Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola said in a statement Tuesday he has reinstated Brown to these positions due to his “acquittal in court and my belief that the terms of these sanctions have been appropriate.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden plans to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner – the first time a sitting president will be at the event since Barack Obama in 2016. The organization said in a tweet that it was pleased to host Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the dinner April 30 that will honor the First Amendment. Donald Trump opted to skip the event when he was president, and it was canceled in 2020 and last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” is serving as the event’s entertainer. In 2018, Michelle Wolf’s biting, after-dinner comedy routine grabbed headlines, even in Trump’s absence. After the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington earlier this month, some of those who attended, including Cabinet members, other administration officials and members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 amid a surge of cases around the nation’s capital. Capacity for the upcoming dinner is more than 2,600, and the event is fully booked. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, suggested last weekend that the correspondents’ dinner should move forward. He told “Fox News Sunday” that “we are at the point in this pandemic” where “I think we can gather safely.” The association is requiring full vaccination and negative same-day coronavirus tests.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: As critics decried a congressional redistricting map submitted by Republican Ron DeSantis as racially motivated and drawn to benefit the GOP, the staff member who crafted the maps told lawmakers Tuesday that he didn’t take race or party politics into consideration in preparing it. Lawmakers were called back to the Capitol for a special session to approve new congressional districts after DeSantis vetoed the maps they approved last month. The GOP House and Senate leadership opted not to try drawing maps again but rather to take up one submitted by DeSantis. His plan would likely add more Republican seats than the maps the Legislature approved and could mean the four districts where Black voters have the best chance of selecting a candidate would be reduced to two. Five of the current 27 U.S. House members from Florida are Black – one a Republican from an overwhelmingly white district. J. Alex Kelly, DeSantis’ deputy chief of staff, said the map is “race neutral.” Democrats reject that argument. Several Black lawmakers have called DeSantis racist for submitting the map. Rep. Angie Nixon said other lawmakers chastised her for previously using that language, but at a rally before session began, she repeated her opinion and said she won’t be silenced. “That’s what he is,” Nixon said in an interview afterward. “It’s all racially and politically driven. And this is the type of systemic racism that they don’t want us to talk about. It’s because it makes them uncomfortable because it shows people who they truly are.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is appealing a federal judge’s ruling allowing a challenge to her eligibility to run for reelection to proceed. A group of voters last month filed the challenge with the secretary of state’s office alleging that Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. They say that violates a part of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Greene said the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is unconstitutional, and she filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to prohibit state officials from enforcing it. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg on Monday ruled that the challenge can proceed. Greene filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The provision of the 14th Amendment cited in the challenge says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress. Greene has denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection. The challenge, filed on behalf of the voters by a group called Free Speech for People, is set for a hearing before an administrative law judge Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Images of a Hawaiian monk seal being born on an Oahu beach have been captured on camera. An employee of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources shot video and photos of the pup emerging from the mother onto white sands last week. “As soon as its (amniotic) sac burst, the little one starting wiggling around,” Lesley Macpherson, who works for the department’s Division of State Parks, said in a news release Tuesday. The mother monk seal checked on her pup by barking as the newborn flapped its flippers. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species. There are only about 1,400 seals in the world. About three-quarters of this total live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a remote string of small atolls northwest of Hawaii’s populated islands. The rest, about 300 seals, live in the Main Hawaiian Islands including Oahu and Maui. The pup, named PO5, was one of two baby seals born on Oahu last week. Officials and volunteers will actively monitor the moms and their pups until weaning in about five to six weeks. After weaning, officials will aim to tag the pups and may apply temporary satellite transmitters to the seals to help keep track of them. Three other pups born on Oahu this year died from complications related to birth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court has allowed lawmakers to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law they passed earlier this year that would ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The court on Monday approved a request by Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke, Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder and the Legislature to take part in the case. The law is modeled after a Texas law that is enforced through civil lawsuits to avoid constitutional court challenges. The Idaho law had been scheduled to take effect Friday but was temporarily blocked by the court following a lawsuit by a regional Planned Parenthood organization. Lawmakers said Planned Parenthood’s arguments challenging the constitutionality of the abortion law “directly implicate the Legislature’s authority.” The law allows the father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles of a “preborn child” to each sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortion. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but a rapist’s relatives could. The bill passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law but said he feared it would “in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed into law a state budget that aims to soften the blow of inflation with $1.8 billion in tax breaks and direct payments to Illinois consumers – an outline Republicans derided as an election-year ploy. The $46 billion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 also makes substantial investments in debt and savings backed by tax revenues virtually no one predicted a year ago amid a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker, who faces reelection this fall, said in a news release from Chicago that the fiscal outline “brings real improvements to the lives of working families and sets us up for a stronger fiscal future.” He said the funding for schools, updated highways and transportation systems, and paying down obligations in the state pension programs “are the kind of priorities we can invest in when our state is governed responsibly.” Pritzker rolled out his plan in February, when national inflation was at about 7% – the highest in 45 years. The package includes tactical strikes at rising prices: suspending the 1% grocery sales tax, freezing the motor fuel tax increase and offering a one-time $350 property tax refund, totaling $970 million in money consumers could keep or get back.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: There won’t be a balloon release at this year’s Indianapolis 500 in May. For the past two years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off on the pre-race balloon release largely due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the amount of staff on site. But this year, according to vice president of communications Alex Damron, the decision has taken into account the environmental and wildlife impacts – issues critics have raised for years. Speedway officials said they want the pre-race events to bring about unity as a way to honor military heroes, celebrate sporting excellence and build excitement. “We do recognize the release has become more divisive in recent years,” Damron said. “We’ve received significant feedback from groups and individuals opposed to it as well as an increasing number of our fans.” The balloon release has been a yearly staple at the event for more than 70 years. Environmentalists have been calling for the release – one of the few regular large balloon releases that have still been happening across the country – to end for years. Though the balloons are released in Indianapolis, they can travel quite far. In 2018, one woman even found what she believed to be an Indy 500 balloon in Ohio, 100 miles away. When the balloons land, they make their way into the ecosystem and the food chain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two years after fourth grade teachers at Andrew Jackson Elementary asked their students to consider whether the school should change its name, five members of the school’s student leadership team presented their arguments for renaming the school to the Des Moines School Board on Tuesday. The renaming project was waylaid when schools closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, teachers began discussing moving forward with the name change. Bettina Bradley, a reading and math interventionist, advocated letting students lead the project. At this week’s Des Moines School Board meeting, the students highlighted Jackson’s ownership of enslaved people and his signing of the Indian Removal Act, the 1830 law that authorized the president to negotiate the removal of Native Americans from their homelands to federal land – a move that led to thousands of deaths on the Trail of Tears. “The name Jackson is important to our school and community, as we are the stars,” student Keren Moran said, referring to the school’s mascot. “So we’re asking the board to rename Andrew Jackson to Mary Jackson Elementary.” Mary Jackson was NASA’s first Black female engineer. Her story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of two former Sedgwick County sheriff’s employees accused of stealing cash, drugs and weapons from the department’s evidence unit has been sentenced to a suspended jail term and one year of probation. Marc Gordon, 47, was sentenced after pleading guilty earlier this month to one count of official misconduct and three counts of theft, all misdemeanors, the Wichita Eagle reported. He was sentenced to a year in jail, which was immediately suspended, and placed on probation for a year. Gordon would be subject to having the jail term reinstated if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation. Prosecutors say Gordon was a property and evidence technician with the agency when he and a property and evidence supervisor, 55-year-old Robert White, stole more than $7,700 in cash, several pounds of cocaine, meth and other drugs and several samurai-style swords. The missing evidence led the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office to dismiss or review dozens of drug cases. White pleaded guilty in January to 12 counts, including felony official misconduct, drug distribution and thefts. He is set to be sentenced on April 29.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The last stockpiles of a deadly chemical agent in the U.S. have been safely eliminated, according to Kentucky officials in charge of destroying the Cold War-era weapons. The final M55 rocket containing VX nerve agent was destroyed Tuesday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent plant. Officials began disassembling about 18,000 of the rockets and draining the VX agent in July, according to a news release from plant officials. Candace Coyle, the plant’s project manager, said Wednesday that the nation’s entire stockpile of VX nerve agent “is now completely destroyed.” VX is considered the deadliest of the chemical agents that were produced by the U.S., much in the 1960s. It has a consistency similar to motor oil, and even a tiny amount causes victims’ bodies to flood with fluids, producing a feeling of drowning before death. Officials in 2017 declared that assassins used VX agent to kill the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. The central Kentucky Army depot still has 277 tons of other chemical agents left to be destroyed, after beginning with more than 520 tons of VX, GB and mustard agent that was in storage for decades. Officials said it all should be gone by next year after it began eliminating its mustard agent stockpiles in 2019.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Legislation to keep transgender athletes from competing on college and K-12 women’s and girls’ sports teams has been approved by the state Senate with little debate. The Advocate reports that the bill by Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, passed Tuesday evening on a 29-6 vote. It goes next to the state House. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed similar legislation last year, saying it was mean-spirited, unnecessary and could result in loss of NCAA events in the state. He has not said what he would do were the bill to pass this year. The measure would apply to K-12 schools, as well as colleges and universities, if they receive state funding. “Athletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall not be open to students who are not biologically female,” the bill says. Opponents say there are no known transgender athletes currently competing in the state, and the legislation adds to discrimination against an already marginalized group. Mizell said the NCAA hasn’t gone through with threats to pull events from states with similar laws.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday signed into law a bill to create a public-private partnership to help grow the state’s aerospace industry. Supporters envision the corporation as a central hub for innovation and economic development in the state’s air and space industry. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mattie Daughtry, D-Brunswick, said the effort has been years in the making. “The Maine Space Consortium will bring together business, research and state leaders, to help ensure Maine continues to be at the forefront of this industry,” Daughtry said in a statement. Members of the air and space industry have taken an interest in Maine in recent years, in part because it is home to the former Loring Air Force Base and Brunswick Landing, formerly a naval air station. The state’s geography and existing infrastructure make it a candidate to serve as a site for small launches, industry members have said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The addition of about 80 acres to the Pocomoke State Forest through legislation makes an elevated walkway connecting Snow Hill directly to the park possible. HB882, signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan this month, was co-sponsored by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester. According to a statement by Carozza, the project would create a trail network from Snow Hill to Pocomoke City “and has significant social, recreational and economic benefits.” This Maryland Department of Natural Resources project would add the acreage to Pocomoke State Forest as new type of wildlands and would exempt approximately 2 acres for the trail’s construction. She also confirmed in a statement that “the trail will be developed through a collaborative planning process between the Maryland Forest Service, Maryland Park Service and the Town of Snow Hill.” The public hearing on this project was held Oct. 28, 2020, and 98% of the 122 comments were in strong support of the project, including multiple organizations and local government agencies.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A gate separating affordable housing from the new playground at Coes Park was unlocked Friday. Community activists celebrated, having seen the locked gate as a symbol of environmental injustice and racism. “It felt like modern-day segregation,” said Nelly Medina, an organizer with the Tenant and Housing Alliance of Worcester and a Lakeside Apartments resident who spearheaded the fight to unlock the gate. “They got $1.2 million from saying it was in an environmental justice community, and they locked the gate. It put white people on one side and (Black, Indigenous and people of color) people on the other.” But Alex Corrales, director of the WHA, said unlocking the gate was simply a seasonal task. “It’s springtime – that’s all it is,” Corrales said in an interview. “We had been opening it for years, during the summer program for children, and they would do swimming classes, have canoes, but we would not leave it open permanently because we were concerned with safety.” Corrales bristled at the idea of any injustice and said the plan was to open the gate “indefinitely.” “We will obviously monitor the situation in terms of communicating with residents and the community,” he said. “If there are incidents that really put the safety risk of residents involved, we do want to review that very closely.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: A judge denied a motion Tuesday to reduce bonds for the jailed parents of a teenager who is charged in a shooting at his high school that left four students dead. Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews said that James and Jennifer Crumbley’s actions before their Dec. 4 arrests in a commercial building in Detroit were meant to conceal their whereabouts. “The defendants indicate they were devastated when they heard about the alleged actions of their son, felt unsafe in their home, felt hounded by the press and found it necessary to leave,” Matthews said. “The chronology of events that occurred subsequent to the defendants leaving their home is not consistent with cooperation with law enforcement.” The Crumbleys had disappeared the day before after they were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The parents are accused of failing to keep a gun secure at home and failing to reasonably care for their son when he showed signs of mental distress. They have pleaded not guilty. “Upon a warrant being issued, law enforcement is not required to make an appointment with a defendant,” Matthews said. “It is the job of the police to ensure a swift, safe and secure arrest. The defendants’ actions were premeditated to conceal their whereabouts.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear a challenge by environmentalists over portions of a lower court ruling involving a key permit for the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals in January reversed a 2018 decision by state regulators to issue PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It sent the case back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for further proceedings. That was a win for environmentalists, but they’re challenging other parts of the ruling. One prong involves the agency’s decision to issue the permit without setting specific effluent limits on mercury and other pollutants. They also faulted the appeals court for not imposing consequences for the agency’s alleged effort to dissuade the federal Environmental Protection Agency from submitting critical written comments during the water permit review process. “It is so important that Minnesota agencies be held accountable when they circumvent laws that were meant to protect the integrity of the regulatory process,” said Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, one of the three parties that asked the Supreme Court to step in. The other petitioners are the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy and the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A state prison violated inmates’ constitutional rights by failing to protect them from violence, failing to meet their mental health needs, failing to take adequate steps for suicide prevention and relying too much on prolonged solitary confinement, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The department released findings of its two-year investigation of the state’s oldest prison, Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. The probe started after an outburst of violence in late 2019 and early 2020. “The problems at Parchman are severe, systemic, and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision,” the department said in its report. It said the Mississippi Department of Corrections “has been on notice of these deficiencies for years and failed to take reasonable measures to address the violations, due in part to non-functional accountability or quality assurance measures.” “Years of MDOC’s deliberate indifference has resulted in serious harm and a substantial risk of serious harm to persons confined at Parchman,” the Justice Department said. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of Justice’s civil rights division, said 10 homicides and 12 suicides have occurred among inmates at Parchman since 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A bill passed by the state House on Tuesday would put restrictions on how race is talked about in public K-12 schools. The GOP-led House on Tuesday voted 85-59 in favor of the bill, with some Republicans opposing the measure. It now goes to the GOP-led Senate. The legislation would ban schools from teaching “that individuals, by virtue of their race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, bear collective guilt and are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, ethnicity, color, or national origin.” The measure also bans schools from compelling students and teachers to affirm that “individuals of any race, ethnicity, color, or national origin are inherently superior or inferior.” Students, parents or teachers could file complaints alleging violations of those bans with the state education department or Missouri attorney general. Supporters argued that the bill is needed to prevent classrooms from being used to indoctrinate children. But critics said the measure could have a chilling effect and might scare educators away from having difficult discussions about race and American history. “America’s history is not squeaky clean,” Democratic Rep. LaKeySha Bosley said. “We need to be open-minded about that and have the hard conversations and not be scared to talk it through.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city commission has voted 4-1 to deny an appeal from local marijuana dispensary owners over a Safety Inspection Certificate and to bring forward a proposed referendum package regarding adult-use marijuana sales on the ballot this November. City staff will work with city commissioners to get a referendum on the ballot. Janelle and Dale Yatsko, owners of Green Creek Dispensary in Cascade County, applied for a Safety Inspection Certificate, handled by Great Falls Fire Rescue as an annual inspection for businesses within city limits, for the operation of an adult-use marijuana dispensary within city limits in February. GFFR and the City Attorney’s Office advised that their application likely not be processed, according to the agenda background. Legal counsel for the Yatksos, Attorney Raph Graybill, reached out to the City Attorney Jeff Hindoien to argue that “state law entitles the Yatskos to operate their adult-use marijuana business within City limits; any contrary policy is preempted by state law.” The city responded denying the SIC on the basis of a local ordinance that has been in place for medical marijuana and federal law regarding marijuana but said the Yatskos could appeal the decision, which they did.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts touted the tax cuts lawmakers approved this year as they wrapped up their session Wednesday. Ricketts said the $900 million package of income and property tax cuts that the Legislature approved this year delivered “the most significant tax relief bill we have ever had in the state of Nebraska.” He signed the bill last week. Lawmakers took care of their business quickly Wednesday because Ricketts didn’t veto any of the bills they sent to him this week. Ricketts also praised bills the Legislature passed that will lay the groundwork for a canal project to divert water out of Colorado and study the creation of a major new lake along the Platte River between Lincoln and Omaha. Lawmakers also made plans to spend more than $1 billion in federal pandemic relief money, including a package of $335 million to help economic recovery in parts of Omaha and other high-poverty areas in the state. And Ricketts said the Legislature made important investments in public safety including improvements at the state law enforcement training center and setting aside money for a potential new state prison.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Generator, lauded as a headquarters for Burning Man artists, has a new space and a new mission. The arts and maker space reopened this month after signing a 10-year lease with Foothill Partners, developer of the much anticipated Oddie District – a 187,000-square-foot mixed-use space just east of U.S. 395 in Sparks, next to Goodwill. The Generator currently takes up about 70,000 square feet, about twice the size of its former home on Icehouse Avenue in industrial Sparks. Eventually, about half the space will be given to another tenant. “Any time there’s a lot of people in a space making art, it makes us all feel better, right?” said Jessi “Sprocket” Janusee, communications director for the Generator, also lovingly known as The Genny. Since 2013, local and international artists alike have used the space to assemble colossal sculptures, from temples to whales to ships, before sending the installations into the desert to burn. While it continues to be a magnet for Burning Man creations, staff at the Generator say the goals of the space are now more community-driven. Still run by a cast of established Burners, the team is placing a much heavier emphasis on community outreach year-round.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Theo Martey, a teacher of West African drumming and dance and a songwriter, is the state’s next artist laureate. Martey, nominated by Gov. Chris Sununu, was confirmed by the Executive Council on Wednesday for the two-year, honorary position. He had received the Governor’s Arts Award for Arts Education in 2019. Born in Accra, Ghana, he has more than 33 years’ experience as a performer and arts educator across three continents. He has lived and worked in New Hampshire for 20 years. Martey has taught more than 5,000 workshops to students from first grade through high school, college and university students, and in communities. “For over two decades, I have been invited into dozens of schools across New Hampshire as an artist in residence, working with students so that they may experience West African drumming and dance hands-on,” Martey said in a statement. “To be named artist laureate is an honor, and I look forward to continuing to use music to empower others to discover their best selves and promote the importance of arts across the state and the region.” Martey is the state’s ninth artist laureate since 1997.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A Catholic diocese has agreed to pay $87.5 million to settle claims involving clergy sex abuse with some 300 alleged victims in one of the largest cash settlements involving the Catholic Church in the United States. The agreement between the Diocese of Camden, which encompasses six counties in southern New Jersey on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and plaintiffs was filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden on Tuesday. The settlement must still go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge. If approved, the settlement would exceed the nearly $85 million settlement in 2003 in the clergy abuse scandal in Boston, although it’s less than other settlements in California and Oregon. “I want to express my sincere apology to all those who have been affected by sexual abuse in our Diocese,” Bishop Dennis Sullivan said in a statement. “My prayers go out to all survivors of abuse and I pledge my continuing commitment to ensure that this terrible chapter in the history of the Diocese of Camden, New Jersey never happens again.” Details about what allegedly happened to the roughly 300 victims were not included in the proposed settlement, according to Jeff Anderson, an attorney for some 70 of the victims, who called it “a powerful advance in accountability.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials with a U.S. agency undergoing a multibillion-dollar modernization effort that includes the production of plutonium cores for the nation’s nuclear arsenal celebrated the opening of a massive office complex Tuesday. Jill Hruby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, joined other officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Years in the making, the new complex on the edge of Albuquerque will replace a collection of two dozen military barracks and other buildings, some of which date back to the government’s top-secret Manhattan Project during World War II. Officials said some of the old buildings were compromised by asbestos and lead paint and were well past their lifespans. The new building boasts enough space to cover more than five football fields and will end up saving the agency an estimated $40 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. It includes a data center for rows of servers, conference rooms and secure spaces. Construction was supposed to wrap up last year, but officials said pandemic-related labor and material shortages resulted in delays.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: A widely seen video of an 8-year-old Black child sobbing as he’s being led into a police car over a bag of chips was called “heart-wrenching” Wednesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said more needs to be done to build trust with communities of color. The video taken Sunday shows a white officer holding the clearly distraught youth from behind by his elbows, leading him from a sidewalk to the back seat of a police vehicle. Another officer says the situation is about “stealing stuff.” The man recording the video argues with police to let the child go. The video has been widely shared on social media, with many people condemning the officers for treating the child roughly. Hochul, at a COVID-19 briefing in Syracuse, said the video was difficult to watch. “We have more work to do, and I know that the mayor is working closely with the police department to get to the bottom of everything,” said Hochul, a Democrat. “But also make sure that we do protect our children – that they’re handled in a different way when it comes to encounters with law enforcement.” Syracuse police said Tuesday the officers’ actions were being reviewed, along with body-worn camera footage. Police said the incident involved an accusation of youths stealing from a store.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to give a judge another week to work through the latest step in a long-running legal fight over public education spending. The court’s justices granted Special Superior Court Judge Michael Robinson a seven-day extension, which he had requested Tuesday while citing differences between the legal parties over details and numerous documents to review. Robinson was tasked last month with scrutinizing the November order of another judge who had directed that $1.75 billion be moved from state coffers to carry out two years of a remedial plan to address education inequities. In particular, the Supreme Court told Robinson to review Judge David Lee’s order in light of the General Assembly’s passage of a state budget that funds some of the plan’s provisions. Robinson originally had until Wednesday to report his findings to the justices, who afterward will hear appeals that likely would rule on whether the judicial branch has constitutional powers to order taxpayer-funded spending for education on its own. Republican legislative leaders say only the General Assembly can appropriate state money.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Holmberg, 79, the state’s longest-serving senator, stepped down from the legislative management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reports Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges but in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reports. He also said he no longer has the texts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A doctor accused of ordering excessive amounts of painkillers that led to multiple patient deaths at a Columbus-area hospital was acquitted of 14 counts of murder Wednesday following a weeks­long trial. Dr. William Husel, 46, was accused of ordering the drugs for patients in the Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them. Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook told jurors before the start of deliberations that they could also consider lesser charges of attempted murder. They deliberated for six days. Husel would have faced a sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 15 years had he been found guilty of just one count of murder. Prosecutors presented their case beginning Feb. 22 and put on 53 prosecution witnesses before resting on March 29. Those witnesses included medical experts who testified that Husel ordered up to 20 times as much fentanyl as was necessary to control pain.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Emergency responders, National Guardsmen, children, parents, grandparents, members of Congress, City Council members, students and college professors united Tuesday in their desire to remember the 168 lives lost in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building 27 years ago. In spite of the somber reason for the gathering, laughter and joyful conversation were heard among the crowd of nearly 1,000 people filling the pews of Oklahoma City’s First Church ahead of the annual Day of Remembrance Ceremony. The ceremony was moved inside the church east of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum out of concern for chilly temperatures and wind gusts Tuesday morning, but by the time the crowd followed the bagpipers to the Field of Empty Chairs to place flowers on them, the sun was shining brightly. Speakers partaking in the program included Gov. Kevin Stitt, U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. “When you see your fellow human beings as Republicans or Democrats – not as fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters – then you have begun the process of dehumanization. You are paving the path to horror,” Holt said. “That memorial is a symbol of that path’s inevitable conclusion.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon State Treasury has at least $5.3 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, a coalition of environmental groups said in a report Wednesday that blamed the state for adding to global warming and urged divestment. Oregon is considered a “green” state, through its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by state agencies and being the first state to commit to stop using coal-fired power. Yet the state treasury is working at cross-purposes with over $1 billion invested in the coal industry alone, Divest Oregon said in its report. “The state exposes Oregonians to climate and health risks, economic costs, and financial losses” through the investments, the group said. The amount that Oregon has invested in oil, gas and coal companies – whose products are a leading cause of global warming – is probably far higher than $5.3 billion because the numbers that Divest Oregon obtained from the state treasury through a public records request do not include private equity investments, which are not subject to public disclosure. The state treasury did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency’s spokesperson was tied up in a meeting Wednesday of the Oregon Investment Council, which makes investment decisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The federal fraud trial of a City Council member and his wife in what prosecutors alleged was a “widespread corruption conspiracy” has ended in a mistrial following a jury deadlock. Jurors deliberated for about 25 hours over four days but were unable to reach a verdict in the case of Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and his wife, Dawn Chavous, who were charged with honest services wire fraud in a 22-count indictment. Outside the courtroom, Johnson thanked family, friends and supporters “for just praying for us and showing your support during this very stressful time.” The jury told the judge Monday afternoon that they were at an impasse but deliberated all day Tuesday after being instructed by the judge to do so. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office later said “the government is committed to retrying the case.” Johnson, 46, a Democrat who has served on the council since 2012, was accused of engaging in official actions in exchange for payments. Chavous, 40, was accused of having entered into a “sham” consulting agreement with a nonprofit that was used to funnel payments to her husband. Defense attorneys said prosecutors lacked evidence to support their case, defending the work of Chavous as legitimate and saying it had nothing to do with Johnson’s actions on the council.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The downtown arena known as “The Dunk” will keep its name at least through June. Dunkin’ Donuts’ two-decade-old naming rights deal for the building expired Wednesday, but the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority has agreed to a short-term extension through June 30 while it vets new proposals, Executive Director Daniel McConaghy said Tuesday. At the start of this month, the Convention Center Authority went out to bid for new naming rights proposals from companies looking to display their brand to hockey and basketball fans or drivers speeding past on Route 95. Unlike the previous naming rights deal, which included only the arena, this time the authority plans to include the rights for the next door Rhode Island Convention Center, according to the Request For Proposals. While Dunkin’ Donuts – now known as Dunkin’ – may put in a bid to keep the name, it is likely to face competition. And the fact that the doughnut chain didn’t come to an agreement to extend the deal before it went to a formal bidding process may be a sign it has moved on. The arena was built by the City of Providence in 1972 and was originally known as the Providence Civic Center. Dunkin’ first bought the naming rights to the center in a 2001 deal valued at $8.65 million over 10 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: A performer who scared a group at a haunted house was shot by a man who said he thought he was grabbing a prop gun as part of the experience, police said. The employee at the Zombie Experience at the Hollywood Wax Museum Haunted House in Myrtle Beach was hit in the shoulder and survived, authorities said. The man told investigators the group fell to the ground after the performer scared them Saturday, and he felt a gun hit his foot, Myrtle Beach Police said in a statement on Facebook. The man thought the gun was not real and was part of the experience and fired twice, police said. The performer spoke at the suspect’s bond hearing and said the man looked at him before firing. He said since the shooting, he is struggling to work and can’t sleep. So far, the man has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he gave the gun to a 15-year-old after firing it even through he was told it was real, authorities said. Police said they are still trying to determine where the gun came from, and additional charges are likely.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Avera Health has plans to build the state’s largest pickleball facility. The health care provider will construct 12 outdoor courts at its Avera on Louise Health Campus in Sioux Falls at a cost of about $1.5 million. Pickleball is a sport that’s recently grown in popularity, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Combining elements of tennis, badminton and pingpong, it’s played indoors or outdoors on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net. Two or four players can play with simple equipment that involves paddles and a plastic ball with holes. Jason Askew is executive director of Sports Medicine for Avera and said the organization wants to appeal to people of all ages. “Being able to offer something for adults that is growing by leaps and bounds in popularity, both here in Sioux Falls and around the country, is a lot of fun to be able to announce,” Askew said, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Askew said construction will take a few months, and Avera anticipates the free courts will open to the public by early August.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican officials have removed three congressional hopefuls from the GOP primary ballot, including one candidate backed by ex-President Donald Trump. The late Tuesday night decision by the Tennessee Republican Party was a long-awaited result of months of debate over Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s former State Department spokesperson, entering Nashville’s open 5th Congressional District race. Even with Trump’s endorsement, some Republicans criticized the selection after pointing out that she had just recently moved to the state and did not know the region or its voters. Tennessee’s GOP-controlled Legislature had sought to nudge Ortagus and others off the ballot by imposing residency requirements on most U.S. House and Senate candidates. However, that attempt fizzled after the state’s election office told the Associated Press the legislation – which Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee allowed to go into effect without his signature earlier this month – would not apply retroactively to candidates who had already met the qualifications. That left the decision up to the state Republican Party, who had received challenges over the voting records of Ortagus, as well as video producer Robby Starbuck and small-business owner Baxter Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Former state lawmaker Wendy Davis sued Tuesday over the most restrictive abortion law in effect in the U.S., nearly a decade after her 13-hour filibuster of another anti-abortion measure made her an overnight Democratic star. The lawsuit is the latest attempt to halt the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Courts have repeatedly turned back multiple other challenges and kept the law in place since September. That includes both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court, defeats that left attorneys for Texas abortion clinics acknowledging that their path to stopping the law had effectively shut. Like past challenges, Davis calls the law unconstitutional but a takes a different legal approach, suing a Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who earlier this year accused Citigroup of circumventing the law by offering to pay travel expenses for employees who go out of state to seek an abortion. Cain did not immediately respond to an email sent Tuesday evening. The suit also names three private citizens who Davis accuses of using or threatening to use the law’s unique mechanism that enforces the law only through private lawsuits. Davis’ filibuster propelled a failed run for governor. She also lost a bid for Congress in 2020 and now works with abortion funds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As warmer weather draws more people to get out and enjoy the sunshine, officials are urging anyone heading out into the state’s great outdoors with their pets to keep their dogs on leashes. Dogs can have a serious impact on wildlife and on landscapes, and any left off-leash while in nature could act on their instincts to chase deer and other animals, wildlife officials said Tuesday as they issued a statewide request for dog owners to take the issue more seriously. Utah wildlife often struggles to find food during the winter and can be vulnerable and weak come springtime, according to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “If they get chased, it uses up energy they may need to survive,” said Covy Jones, the Big Game coordinator at UDWR. “These animals are already depleted, and they often can’t afford to waste energy. If you or a pet force them to move away from where they are trying to feed, it could be harmful.” Deer and other big game animals typically move to lower elevations in search of feed during the snowy winter months, which typically brings them closer to roads and to people and pets. Dogs that are off leash can also disturb nesting ground birds and can chase, injure or kill small mammals, deer, elk or moose, according to the DWR. Utah law states that a person may kill or injure a dog that is “attacking, chasing or worrying any species of hoofed protected wildlife.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The second of four men accused in a failed plan to build a biotechnology plant in Vermont using tens of millions of dollars in foreign investors’ money raised through a special visa program was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to 18 months in prison. William Kelly, 73, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $8.3 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty last June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of concealment of material information. As part of the plea deal, eight other charges were dropped and he agreed to cooperative with the government. Kelly was indicted in 2019 on multiple fraud charges along with Miami businessman Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski resorts in northern Vermont, and former Jay Peak president William Stenger. Kelly was an adviser to Quiros. The indictment accused the men of conspiring to devise a scheme between 2011 and 2016 to defraud foreign investors in the AnC-Bio project in Newport. The EB-5 visa program encourages foreigners to invest in U.S. projects that create jobs in exchange for a chance to earn permanent U.S. residency.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After two years of pandemic-enforced absence, Tom’s Cove Park campground will again welcome hungry seafood lovers as the Chincoteague Seafood Festival – appropriately themed “Long Time ... No Sea!” – returns for its 52nd year May7. The Chincoteague Chamber-sponsored event is held the first Saturday in May to promote the seafood industry on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The festival offers fresh, local seafood and signature dishes from local restaurants as well as old and new Eastern Shore favorites prepared by festival cooks, volunteers and professionals, according to the chamber. Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the ticket price, with beer available for purchase. Front Page News will provide live entertainment, and festivalgoers can shop an arts and crafts tent featuring handmade creations from area artisans. Ticket sales have been brisk due to the two-year hiatus, according to the chamber.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A citywide “day of service” in May will offer thousands of volunteer opportunities in an event Mayor Bruce Harrell hopes will be a symbol of how his administration plans to beautify the city. Rather than a budget boost or a new devotion of city resources, Harrell is appealing to civic goodwill to help clear litter, weeds, debris and graffiti, The Seattle Times reports. More than 80 city-organized cleanup and volunteer events will take place May 21. Some of the options include picking up litter in Ballard, clearing trails in Jackson Park, working on community gardens in the Chinatown International District, sorting donations at downtown shelters and building tiny homes near the Duwamish River. “This is going to be symbolic of how we’re going to get things done in our city,” Harrell said Monday. “People want to help. Employers want to help; employees want to help.” Everyone who volunteers for the day of service, Harrell said, will a sense of self-fulfillment that they did something about a problem rather than just complaining, along with a T-shirt. The city annually spends about $3.7 million on graffiti removal and has the equivalent of about 15 full-time employees devoted to the problem. Harrell said he’s not yet sure if the city needs to devote more money to it. Volunteers can register at seattle.gov/dayofservice.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A former director at a hospital has filed a lawsuit alleging he was fired after he raised concerns about the safety of patients who were on ventilators and receiving other respiratory care services during a surge of COVID-19 cases. Mark Mustard was fired as director of cardiopulmonary and therapy services at Princeton Community Hospital in September 2021. His departure from the West Virginia University Medicine affiliate came amid the surging delta variant of the coronavirus “at a time when respiratory care was crucial to the community,” according to a lawsuit filed last week in Mercer County Circuit Court. Mustard, then 63, alleges he was terminated after he reported concerns about the quality of medical care being provided as the number of patients requiring respiratory care increased during the pandemic. Mustard was “highly outspoken” about the need for more staff in the respiratory services department “in order to provide an adequate level of care to its patients and the community,” the lawsuit said. He was not warned that his job was in jeopardy or given a reason for the termination, which came less than one month after he received an “exceptional” performance review that included an incentive bonus of more than $6,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Communities are encouraging residents to keep their lawnmowers in the garage next month to boost the population of bees and other pollinators. Appleton became the first city to adopt the “No Mow May” initiative a couple of years ago, and others have followed, including Wausau, Oshkosh, Fort Atkinson and Stevens Point. The idea is to give homeowners the option of letting their lawns become a bit overgrown for a few weeks to ensure that bees coming out of hibernation have plenty of options for the nectar and pollen they need, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Cities temporarily waive enforcement of ordinances that require homeowners to maintain their lawns. This year, the initiative has spread even farther, to La Crosse, Wisconsin Rapids, De Pere and other communities. “Bees, and insects in general, are in a bit of a slump right now,” said Israel Del Toro, a biology professor at Appleton’s Lawrence University. Studies have shown steep declines in wild bee populations in the 21st century. The United Nations characterizes it as a threat to the global food supply. Del Toro said many factors are hurting bee populations, including climate change and irresponsible uses of pesticides and herbicides. But in his view, the biggest stressor is habitat loss. Del Toro said there is plenty of room for compromise. People can plant native flowers or allow growth only in parts of their yards.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A utility company estimates a new law requiring carbon-capture systems be added to coal-fired plants could cost the average customer an extra $500 a month, WyoFile reports. Black Hills Corp. said in a filing with the Wyoming Public Service Commission that the measure passed by the Legislature in 2020 could cost it as much as $1 billion per coal unit, according to the news outlet.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/27/newark-lead-plan-casino-dorm-arpaios-return-news-around-states/40034383/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Some south Alabama breweries are working on a new beer to benefit a nonprofit environmental group that works to protect the state’s coast. Six breweries in Mobile and Baldwin County are teaming up to produce an ale called “Friends in Low Places IPA” as a fundraiser for the Alabama Coastal Foundation. The New England-style India pale ale will be available in the coastal region beginning next month, and it will go statewide after that. Participating breweries are Braided River, Iron Hand, Old Majestic and Serda in Mobile, plus Fairhope Brewing and Big Beach Brewing in Baldwin County. The Alabama Coastal Foundation started in 1993. It teaches about the state’s coastal environment and works to preserve marine ecosystems.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Health insurance officials have announced the state’s plan to weaken air ambulance membership plan regulations. CoastAlaska reports the Alaska Division of Insurance will no longer review consumer membership plans for pre-approval. Department officials say health insurance does not cover the full cost of a flight, so air ambulance companies offer membership agreements. Officials say households pay a flat rate fee between $49 and $125 to ensure they are not paying out of pocket. Air ambulance providers say any changes to membership plans could take months to approve under former rules, but the new rule could speed up the process. Residents say the complaint-driven process means patients have to follow up on their own. It is unclear how many people would be affected by the change.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly three years after he was voted out of office, the former sheriff pardoned by President Donald Trump on a conviction related to rounding up immigrants in the country illegally is going after his old job. Republican Joe Arpaio announced his 2020 campaign for Maricopa County sheriff Sunday on the anniversary of his pardon in 2017 from Trump on the misdemeanor contempt of court conviction for disobeying an order to stop the immigration patrols. Arpaio, 87, spent 24 years as sheriff. In a statement, he pledged to enforce laws associated with the U.S.-Mexico border crimes and laws dealing with migrants coming into the country illegally. He also wants to reopen the outdoor tent jail complex he started that was closed by his successor, Democrat Paul Penzone.\n\nArkansas\n\nElaine: Officials are investigating after someone cut down a willow tree that was planted to honor the victims of the 1919 Elaine massacre in eastern Arkansas. The Elaine Legacy Center says the tree was chopped down at its base last week, and a memorial tag was stolen. Memphis, Tennessee, television station WMC reports that police and state parks officials are investigating. The tree was planted in April in remembrance of the victims of the massacre, which was one of the largest racial mass killings in U.S. history. It occurred during the summer of 1919, when hundreds of African Americans died at the hands of white mob violence during the “Red Summer.” Events are planned for next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the massacre in Arkansas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State wildlife officials don’t want residents keeping nutria – invasive, semi-aquatic rodents – as pets. The California Fish and Game Commission has been trying to keep the South American nutria from spreading in the state. Now the Sacramento Bee reports the commission says it will discuss adding nutria to a list of prohibited pets. Scientists say they’ve captured hundreds as part of a $2 million plan to eradicate the animal. The orange-toothed rodents can give birth to litters of up to 12. Experts say their burrowing is damaging to waterways and flood protection infrastructure. Nutria were imported in the early 1900s for the fur trade, but the market collapsed, and the rodents escaped or were released. Small populations were eradicated in the 1970s, but nutria were again discovered in 2017.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: Archaeological ruins have been unearthed in the path of a proposed highway construction project. The Durango Herald reports well-preserved Native American ruins were discovered while surveying the Florida Mesa for realignment of the U.S. Highway 550 interchange. Researchers say ruins found south of Durango included human and animal bones and shells from the Baja region. The Colorado Department of Transportation says archaeologists have a few months before they plan to begin the $100 million construction project in spring 2020. Archaeologists say digs have turned up indigenous ceremonial sites, large pit houses and living quarters for the first time in hundreds of years. Officials say the new interchange is meant to prepare the state for increased traffic from an expected population increase.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Concerns are being raised by various municipal leaders about the lack of state borrowing authorizations. They note the slowdown has affected local repaving and other transportation-related projects. Lawmakers have yet to finalize the general bonding portion of the state budget. And the State Bond Commission, which ultimately doles out the capital funding, has met twice since Gov. Ned Lamont took office in January. No meetings have been scheduled yet for the rest of the year. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities notes that cities and towns are reliant on the state funds and are being forced to cover the cost of repaving and other projects. A spokesman for the governor says the Bond Commission can release previous unspent allocations for projects without a new bond package in place.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: In a bid to pay for public services without burdening its residents, the city has announced it will impose a 3% lodging tax on hotels, motels and tourist homes. The new tax, passed last week, will go into effect Jan. 1, 2020, and applies to reservations made on or after that date. City officials say it will bring in $113,000 in revenue come fiscal year 2020. That number will likely rise in later years as more hotels open and the full fiscal year plays out. Gov. John Carney signed a bill last month allowing Rehoboth officials to amend the city charter with the new tax, which piggybacks the existing statewide 8% lodging tax. That totals 11% in lodging taxes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of students in the district are returning to school with new or updated facilities, WUSA-TV reports. Five buildings are opening after years of construction to ensure students have equal access to a 21st-century learning experience. Coolidge High School features five shared spaces areas where students and teachers can work outside the classroom. The school is equipped with smartboards in every classroom, a new atrium-style cafeteria, a day care and a community health center. As a part of the school district’s goal to ensure schools are safe and inclusive for all students, the school has several gender-neutral bathrooms. Coolidge is also introducing spaces within the building dedicated to its career academies, such as mass media and health science.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Five acres of a county park were unknowingly auctioned off last year to a private company, which is threatening to sue if park visitors continue to trespass. The Sun Sentinel reports that Miami-based Dorado Bells LLC won the bid for $23,900 for parts of West Lake Park in Hollywood. The auction was conducted by the Broward County tax collector’s office in April 2018 after the previous owner didn’t pay about $1,526 in back taxes. Park officials say they don’t know how the auction happened or how the parcel was originally left in private hands. The 15-foot-wide strip runs nearly 3 miles around a lake. Dorado Bells has put up makeshift fences and “No Trespassing” signs. Attorneys say the trails allow the public to trespass onto the property and must be resolved.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: An organization dedicated to collecting and sharing documents and artifacts important to the state’s history is upgrading its Savannah research center. The Georgia Historical Society recently celebrated the kickoff of its renovation and expansion project. The group’s research center is based at Hodgson Hall, which the historical society acquired in 1876. An annex was added in 1970 to the society’s research and office space in Savannah’s historic district. The society said in a news release that the expansion now underway will improve its ability to examine, collect and share items related to Georgia history. It says the project is being supported by a gift from the Delta Air Lines Foundation, though it did not specify the amount being given.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A Spanish man claimed the title of the first person to cross the Pacific Ocean on a stand-up paddleboard after he arrived in the state. Hawaii News Now reports 42-year-old Antonio De La Rosa arrived at the Waikiki Yacht Club in Honolulu at 8 a.m. Saturday. The endurance athlete paddled away from San Francisco on June 9 in his attempt for the record. De La Rosa covered 2,500 miles of open ocean alone, using wind, currents and the power of his arms. His 24-foot vessel called Ocean Defender is a combination paddle board and small boat with a sleeping cabin, storage bins, desalination unit and solar panels for powering electronics. De La Rosa estimated the journey would take 70 days, but he completed the trip in 76 days.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials say drivers have been following and harassing buses transporting the children of seasonal and migrant farmworkers for early childhood education programs in the state. The Idaho Statesman reports the Community Council of Idaho plans to remove and conceal the “Migrant and Seasonal Head Start” signs on the buses. The council says staff assumes the harassment experienced by dozens of children and bus drivers across the state stems from some people believing the migrant workers have entered the U.S. illegally. Several Head Start centers also are planning to add security cameras and tint windows on buses, as well as make playgrounds safer. The council’s Head Start programs serve about 800 children each year, generally low-income children in families working agricultural jobs.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A new online police tool that lists the status of people accused of gun-related crimes is getting criticism from those who say it unfairly maligns people who are presumed innocent under the law. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson recently unveiled the “Gun Offender Dashboard” to show how quickly and easily people get out of jail. It comes after Cook County’s chief judge two years ago implemented a policy that requires judges to set affordable bail amounts for those not deemed a danger to the community. County Public Defender Amy Campanelli says the existence of such a list sends a message that people are dangerous even before they’ve had their day in court. Johnson and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot say the tool lists information already available to the public.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: A southern Indiana development board has approved bat habitat protections along a $34 million road for heavy trucks that’s under construction. The River Ridge Development Authority Board unanimously approved a resolution setting aside about 27 acres as a conservation easement for bats near the “heavy haul” corridor. The News and Tribune reports dysyr transportation officials proposed the idea amid concerns that the road project that will cut through Jeffersonville’s River Ridge Commerce Center could disrupt bat habitats just north of the Ohio River. The 4-mile-long road project will link River Ridge, the Indiana 265 interchange and the Port of Indiana-Jeffersonville to improve traffic circulation. River Ridge’s executive director, Jerry Acy, says the land that’s set for conservation for bat species is “a real scenic area.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: MidAmerican Energy has announced its plans to erect fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in more than a dozen cities in the state. The Des Moines-based energy company says it plans to build the publicly accessible stations, with two charging plugs per station, in 15 urban and rural communities. A DC fast-charger, also called a “Level 3” charger, can generally charge an electric vehicle in 20 to 45 minutes. MidAmerican seeks to install the stations in Altoona, Avoca, Carroll, Clarinda, Davenport, Dexter, Early, Emmetsburg and Iowa City, as well as Fort Dodge, Little Sioux, Oskaloosa, Sheldon, Sioux City and Waterloo. Once MidAmerican Energy selects site hosts, the company plans to begin building the stations by the end of the year. Charging station hosts will set their own usage fees.\n\nKansas\n\nWinona: A commission has decided not to charge a $50 fee to visit a soon-to-open state park that includes a fragile landscape made up of chalky formations of spires and buttes. The Wichita Eagle reports that scheduled tours of the 330-acre Little Jerusalem Badlands State Park in western Kansas will be free. State Parks Director Linda Lanterman said at this month’s meeting of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism Commission that the “goal is to make it affordable for all.” Backlash from the public and The Nature Conservancy drove the decision to drop the so-called backcountry access pass. The $50 fee originally was proposed as a way to deter visitors from damaging the rock formations, which date back 85 million years to when the area was covered by a giant sea. Vehicle permits will still be required.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A wall is going up between Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol. Senate President Robert Stivers says he authorized building a wall in the State Capitol Annex so that three Republicans won’t have to share office space with Democrats. Stivers says GOP members should have the ability to talk freely without being overheard. Construction of the wall is expected to cost taxpayers about $12,000. An increase in the number of Republicans elected recently has led to one office suite in the annex being shared by both parties. The Senate has 29 Republicans and nine Democrats. Some Democratic senators say the wall is divisive and a waste of money, but Sen. Julian Carroll says while he was surprised, he didn’t have a problem with it. He says Republicans and Democrats have traditionally had privacy.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCarencro: Hot air balloons are heading to the state’s Acadiana region for “Glow in the Cro,” a new event taking place over the Labor Day holiday weekend. Carencro’s inaugural two-night celebration is $5 to attend and will feature food trucks, carnival rides and 20 hot air balloons that will light up the sky each night for night-glow tethered rides at Pelican Park. Pelican Park Director Jim Thibodeaux and Chairman Tom Meyers say they were inspired to bring the festival to Carencro after attending the Ascension Hot Air Balloon Festival last year. They say they were impressed by the vibrancy this kind of festival brings to the public. Gates open at 4 p.m. Friday and 9 a.m. Saturday. Balloon flights also are being offered.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s bears have been snooping around barrels of bait for weeks now, and they’re starting to find out how all that free food got there in the first place. The state’s annual black bear hunting seasons began Monday. Most of the hunt takes place over bait, which hunters began setting July 27 this year. Bait is usually human food, such as granola or doughnuts. The portion of the hunt during which bait is legal runs until Sept. 21. It remains legal to hunt bears until Nov. 30, but the harvest slows down dramatically at the end of bait season. It’s also legal to pursue bears with hunting dogs from Sept. 9 to Nov. 1. The state’s bear population is growing, causing some to call for new hunting laws.\n\nMaryland\n\nSilver Spring: Pet stores are suing to block a state law that will bar them from selling commercially bred dogs and cats, a measure billed as a check against unlicensed and substandard “puppy mills.” The federal lawsuit, filed Friday, challenges a ban set to take effect Jan. 1, 2020. Maryland is the second state, after California, to pass such restrictions on the sale of dogs and cats. The pet stores fear the ban will put them out of business. Their lawsuit says animal welfare organizations have made unfounded claims that pet stores are fueling the growth of puppy mills. The suit also claims the ban will effectively shift the sale of puppies from regulated retailers to unregulated sources. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, signed the legislation into law in April 2018.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Tom Brady has been sacked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Boston Globe reports the office informed lawyers for Brady’s company, TEB Capital Management Inc., on Thursday that its request to trademark the phrase “Tom Terrific” was being refused in part because it is already closely linked to another Tom – Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver. Brady’s company had filed applications to trademark the phrase for trading cards, posters, printed photographs and shirts. The trademark office wrote: “Although Tom Seaver is not connected with the goods provided by applicant under the applied-for mark, Tom Seaver is so well-known that consumers would presume a connection.” Neither Brady’s lawyers nor his agent immediately responded to the Globe’s requests for comment. Brady’s company has six months to respond.\n\nMichigan\n\nMonroe: The city is reviewing potential solutions to help alleviate flooding from Lake Erie onto its streets. Starting in spring, high winds in Monroe have raised the lake’s elevation several feet higher than normal on multiple occasions, according to Patrick Lewis, the city’s director of engineering and public safety. Lakes Erie and Ontario in June reached their highest points since record-keeping began in 1918, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says. Corps hydrologist Keith Kompoltowicz says three months of abnormally wet weather have kept stream flows into the Great Lakes well above average. Lewis says street flooding has been limited due to still backwaters from River Raisin and Plum Creek Bay, and the city is lucky because wave action could have caused significant damage to homes and structures along the shoreline. Some residents, meanwhile, are still experiencing flooding.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state is closing walleye fishing on Mille Lacs Lake effective Sept. 6 so sport anglers don’t exceed the lake’s safe harvest level. The Department of Natural Resources cites high angling pressure and catch rates in July and August, when warm water increased hooking mortality and resulted in a larger-than-expected walleye kill. The DNR this year allowed anglers on the popular lake to keep one walleye through May 31 before it returned to catch-and-release-only walleye fishing. It was the first time since 2015 that Mille Lacs anglers could keep a walleye during the open-water season. Starting Sept. 6 at 12:01 a.m., anglers can’t legally target walleyes on Mille Lacs but may fish for other species.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The city has agreed to sell land to a developer for an upscale hotel downtown. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the Tupelo City Council voted last week to sell the property to the Hattiesburg-based Thrash Group for $300,000. Either side can back out for 90 days. The city bought the land from BankPlus for $500,000, conveying it to Thrash through the Tupelo Redevelopment Authority. The location is part of the Fairpark development adjoining Tupelo’s traditional downtown area. The idea is to build a boutique, specialty hotel with 80 rooms and a restaurant. The Thrash Group plans to study the market and develop hotel plans during the 90-day period. Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton says the city has been seeking a hotel for five years or more.\n\nMissouri\n\nPoplar Bluff: In the market for a bridge? There are two in southeastern Missouri, free for the taking. Television station KFVS reports the Missouri Department of Transportation is offering two old bridges – one at Poplar Bluff and the other near Leeper. They are among eight bridges the department is giving away across the state. The bridges are scheduled for replacement, so the department is offering them for free to other government entities, historical and civic groups, or even private citizens. Interested parties must submit a proposal no later than June 30 describing how they will dismantle and relocate the bridge. Those costs fall to whoever takes the bridge. The bridges in southeastern Missouri include the Poplar Bluff Viaduct, a 399-foot truss bridge built in 1934, and the Route 34 Leeper Bridge, a 988-foot truss bridge built in 1933. More information may be found online.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state enters the new school year back among those without publicly funded preschool. And education groups are a big reason why Gov. Steve Bullock’s fledgling pre-kindergarten program fizzled. The 2017 legislature approved funding for a two-year pilot program to provide preschool programming through a mix of public and private classrooms. But some of Bullock’s education allies were irritated that the program passed in a behind-the-scenes deal with Republican lawmakers on the final day of the 2017 session. After Bullock’s proposed $22 million preschool package failed to get a committee vote in 2019, he backed a compromise bill to spend $15 million on both public and private preschools. Education interests rejected that, arguing the only way to ensure equal access to preschool is to fund it through public schools. Few states fund completely public preschool.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The State Capitol courtyards should start to bloom next year as work gets underway on a long-planned landscaping project. Meanwhile, the group of former state senators who raised nearly $1.4 million for the courtyard gardens is embarking on a new venture, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Their goal this time is to explore options for developing the fifth-floor area overlooking the Capitol’s Rotunda. The area has been vacant and closed to the public for most of the building’s history. Former Sen. Bob Wickersham suggests one possibility would be to display exhibits. That’s how the space was used when it was open briefly to the public in the 1980s, says Bob Ripley, longtime administrator for the Office of the Capitol Commission. But the area required constant staff supervision to prevent people from throwing or dropping things over the railings, he says.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Officials at the University of Nevada, Reno knew it was a bit of a gamble when they agreed to lease a downtown casino hotel tower for a year and turn it into a college dormitory. They expected some criticism but had less than six weeks to find rooms for 1,300 students after a July 5 gas explosion shut down their two biggest residence halls. But with fall classes beginning Monday, school officials say there’s been less pushback than anticipated to the unorthodox arrangement with Eldorado Resorts’ Circus Circus, a half-mile from the main campus. As of Friday, only 19 students remained on the list requesting reassignment from what’s now called “Wolf Pack Tower.” Thirty of the 89 students who originally wanted out have changed their minds. About 40 have requested transfers in, and the list is growing.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A historical society is hoping its art inspires young writers to craft some of their best poems, stories and plays. The Portsmouth Historical Society’s second annual Young Writers Contest will be tied to its exhibition “New Hampshire Folk Art: By the People, For the People,” at Discover Portsmouth. Students are tasked with choosing a piece from the exhibit and writing about the art or about how it inspired them. The writing can take any form as long as the piece is connected to the exhibition. Judges will read and evaluate each entry on its content, creativity, expression, clarity, quality and connection to the original artwork. Prizes will be awarded at a ceremony Sept. 27 at Discover Portsmouth. Entries must be submitted by Sept. 21.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The state’s biggest city on Monday announced a plan to borrow $120 million to dramatically cut the time it will take to replace pipes causing elevated lead levels in drinking water. City, state and county officials said the plan is expected to cut the time from 10 years to under 30 months to replace about 18,000 lead lines in Newark. The announcement came about two weeks after the city began distributing water bottles to residents in about 14,000 homes. Water from two houses tested positive for lead above the federal threshold of 15 parts per billion. The plan depends on approval by city and county officials, who are expected to vote on the $120 million bond proposal Tuesday. Authorities had called on the federal government to help but said Monday they would move forward with their own plan.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will limit licensed medical marijuana providers to 1,750 mature cannabis plants, a drop from the 2,500 plants allowed under an expiring emergency state rule. The Albuquerque Journal reports the new rules adopted by state Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel take effect Tuesday. The changes also include an increase to the annual licensing fee for producers and the elimination of the $50 fee for replacing lost patient identification cards. Ultra Health CEO Duke Rodriguez says the plant limit will exacerbate a medical marijuana shortage and ultimately hurt patients. Ultra Health is one of 35 medical cannabis producers in the state. Department of Health spokesman David Morgan says the department has been transparent about the plant count, and the proposed rule was published in June.\n\nNew York\n\nTuxedo: The latest weapon in the fight against invasive species is the sniffing power of dogs trained to find noxious weeds before they flower and spread seeds. The nonprofit New York-New Jersey Trail Conference has trained a Labrador retriever named Dia to find Scotch broom plants in two state parks 50 miles north of New York City. The invasive shrub is widespread in the Pacific Northwest but new to New York, and land managers hope to eradicate it before it gets established. Detection dogs have long been used to sniff out drugs, explosives and disaster survivors. Now a growing number are being trained to find targeted invasive plants so conservationists can uproot them. Montana-based Working Dogs for Conservation is training dogs to find invasive insects and mussels as well as plants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A local teen has helped more than a dozen people who lined up to buy a chicken sandwich get the chance to line up at the polls. News outlets report 17-year-old David Ledbetter says he registered 16 people to vote at a Popeye’s restaurant in Charlotte on Saturday. Many people have flocked to Popeye’s nationwide to try the new menu item. A tweet announcing the sandwich’s release sparked a Twitter war with Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s. Consumers have been comparing chicken sandwiches sold at the fast-food restaurants. Ledbetter isn’t old enough to vote himself but says he noticed a lack of young people involved in politics. He says he was happy to find the majority of chicken sandwich lovers waiting in the drive-thru were already registered.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nStanton: Generations ago, it wasn’t unusual to hear the native languages of Hidatsa and Arikara spoken in the state. But experts estimate fewer than 65 people in the world today are fluent in Hidatsa and Arikara. After the last fluent Mandan speaker passed away in 2016, tribal elders are now educating future generations to keep what’s left of the languages alive. KFRY-TV reports some remaining speakers of those Northern Plains tribal languages gathered at Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site in Stanton at a native language summit Saturday. The site’s culture resource program manager, Alisha Deegan, says it was a “pretty powerful and wonderful experience.” The historic site is open year-round.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A report highlighting racial disparities in use of force by police in the state capital has prompted promises from local leaders to address the issue. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said at a recent news conference that the city must make improvements. The internal report found about half of the police department’s 438 incidents involving use of force in 2017 were directed against black people, who only make up 28% of the city’s population. Ginther, a Democrat, tells The Columbus Dispatch changing a community’s culture takes time, but the commitment to reform is there. The president of the Fraternal Order of Police lodge that represents Columbus police says officers are “more than happy to improve” relations with the public. But Keith Ferrell says the public also should take some responsibility for confrontations.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Authorities say a security guard at a gas station shot and wounded a man who was swinging an Australian musical instrument at him. Tulsa police said the shooting happened late Saturday at a QuikTrip convenience store in Tulsa. They say the security guard said he opened fire after the man “swung a large wooden club at him” that was later determined to be a didgeridoo. Police say that according to witnesses, the man may have also had a knife. Police say the man was shot once in the groin area but is expected to recover. The security guard told investigators that the shooting was in self-defense. Police say surveillance video appears to back up that claim.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s criminal justice system would be “overwhelmed” if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in an upcoming case that nonunanimous jury verdicts are unconstitutional, Oregon’s attorney general has told the court. Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said in an amicus brief that if the U.S. Supreme Court finds nonunanimous juries unconstitutional, it could invalidate hundreds or even thousands of convictions. Oregon is the only state in America allowing 11-1 or 10-2 jury verdicts in criminal trials, except first-degree murder convictions. Critics say Rosenblum is defending a system that should be abandoned – as voters in Louisiana, the only other state that permitted nonunanimous verdicts, did in 2018.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A hospital’s obstetrics department became Ozstetrics as the staff dressed up four newborns as characters from “The Wizard of Oz.” Allegheny Heath Network’s West Penn Hospital wanted to honor the 80th anniversary of the film. The hospital posted photos on social media. Genevieve Dunkin, daughter of Taylor and Mark Dunkin of Hampton Township, was Dorothy. Jack Minett, son of Brittany and Lewis Minett of Wexford, was the scarecrow. Andrew Gianettino, son of Jennie and Anthony Gianettino of Peters Township, was the Cowardly Lion. Wesley Lynch, son of Lindsey and Andrew Lynch of Hampton Township, was the Tin Man. The hospital says the babies will soon learn there’s no place like home.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials are asking for the public’s input on the state’s forests. The Department of Environmental Management says feedback from an online survey will be used to develop strategies to conserve forest landscapes, protect forests from harm, and enhance public benefits from trees and forests. DEM Director Janet Coit says officials are hoping to hear from people who own forestland, appreciate forest landscapes or engage in recreational activities in forests. The survey closes Aug. 31. The State Forest Action Plan, first completed in 2010, must be updated every 10 years. The revision to the plan will include an assessment of the condition of trees and forests within state boundaries.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: Some neighbors living near a proposed go-kart track on Hilton Head Island say it’s a tacky idea that turns their island closer to Myrtle Beach. The town’s zoning board approved the track, saying there is nothing in the rules against it. The Island Packet of Hilton Head reports the Town Council reviewed the decision last week and let it stand, allowing the property owner to apply to the town’s design review board and start construction. The track will be built at Aerial Adventure Park, which already has a zip line. Neighbors in a nearby gated community say they are already bothered by the screaming from the zip line, and the electric go karts will make it worse. One neighbor said she didn’t move to Myrtle Beach because of the noise and tackiness.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The former bookkeeper for two local dental practices has been ordered to pay more than $100,000 in restitution for embezzling from her former employer. Cheryl Callies also was sentenced Monday to 90 days of jail time, which can be served with electronic monitoring. Callies also received a five-year suspended prison sentence. Callies was accused of embezzling nearly $122,000 from Montoya Dental Office before it became 10th Street Dental. She continued to work at the practice and embezzled more than $8,000 after the business changed hands. Prosecutors say Callies admitted adjusting payment records at the businesses in order to receive cash. The embezzlement occurred from 2011 to 2018. KELO-TV reports court records say Callies told investigators she was stealing money for video lottery and because of “payday loans and loneliness.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee says he doesn’t feel compelled to witness an execution as the state continues to put people to death. Lee, a Republican, was offered a witness seat after he declined to stop the past two executions since taking over Tennessee’s top political office in January. Three more executions are scheduled to take place through early 2020. Lee told reporters last week that he has considered witnessing an execution in his lifetime. But he said he has not felt the need to do so in his time as Tennessee governor. A media witness to an execution last week said afterward that he was “taking a break” and offered his seat to the governor. Governors have a key role in deciding whether to intervene in a death penalty case.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A committee is calling on the city to provide better public beach access, more parking and new dune protection standards. The Galveston County Daily News reports that the beach access and dune protection committee presented its suggestions to the Galveston City Council on Thursday after roughly a year of work that included visiting each beach access point. The committee’s report aims to create standards to bring Galveston beaches back into compliance with the city’s own access plan and to protect beaches from erosion or other destruction. Committee member Chula Ross-Sanchez says efficiently managing beaches is crucial for the health of the Gulf Coast and to continue attracting more than 7 million visitors yearly to Galveston. Residents have complained about unmanageable crowds of tourists at some of the city’s beaches.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A mixed-use recreation trail has been developing across the state with new projects through two northern counties. The Standard-Examiner reports counties partnered with the U.S. Forest Service to develop a 280-mile trail along the shoreline of prehistoric Lake Bonneville. Officials say about 24 of 27 miles of trail were completed in Weber County, and an environmental study is underway to begin 39 more miles in Davis County. Officials say the Davis trail would run through mostly federal land and would require new construction where no trail existed before. Officials say construction could begin by the end of 2019 and last until 2023. Lake Bonneville covered most of present-day Utah and extended into parts of Idaho and Nevada.\n\nVermont\n\nWindham: The National Weather Service says a tornado that recently hit the Green Mountain State was the state’s first since 2012. WPTZ-TV reports the high-end EF1 tornado that was on the ground for less than a mile in Windham on Aug. 21 received an estimated maximum wind speed of 105 to 110 miles per hour. The tornado violently snapped or uprooted dozens of trees and left several homes with roof and shingle damage. Vermont’s last prior confirmed tornado was May 29, 2012, in Orleans County.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Law enforcement agencies across the state will be monitoring 120 checkpoints in the lead-up to Labor Day as part of a campaign to combat driving under the influence. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports this year’s 18th annual Checkpoint Strikeforce campaign is the largest effort in years. Officials hope to combat last year’s increase in alcohol-related traffic deaths. Ninety-eight agencies statewide are participating. The campaign began Aug. 16 and will run until Sept. 3. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor says penalties for drunken driving in Virginia include a mandatory ignition interlock installation on the offender’s vehicle, up to a year of driver’s license suspension and jail time, and up to $2,500 in fines.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Trump administration is opposing the state’s effort to make a privately run, for-profit immigration detention center pay detainees minimum wage for the work they do. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson sued The GEO Group in 2017, saying its Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma must pay the state minimum wage to detainees who perform kitchen, laundry, janitorial, maintenance and barbershop tasks. The lawsuit seeks to force GEO to turn over profits it gained by underpaying them – an amount that could reach into the millions. U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan has already issued some key rulings in the state’s favor. But in a “statement of interest” filed last week, the Justice Department called the lawsuit “an aggressive and legally unjustified effort by the State of Washington to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: A Fairmont State University graduate will be remembered at a concert featuring storytellers from the West Virginia Storytelling Guild next week. The event is in memory of D. Jane Gilchrist, who earned a bachelor’s with an emphasis in folklore and a master’s in education. She worked at the Frank and Jane Gabor West Virginia Folklife Center at Fairmont State and later for AmeriCorps in Arthurdale and Huntington. She taught weaving and owned a studio. She died March 8. The memorial is at 2 p.m. Sept. 7 at the Folklife Center.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Attorney General Josh Kaul is warning that a resurgence of online vigilantes posing as children to trap and embarrass sexual predators is hampering police efforts. Groups have taken to the internet posing as children interested in sex with adults. If an adult shows up to meet the child, the groups walk up to them and ask why they want to have sex with children while posting the encounter online. Kaul issued a news release Monday saying Wisconsin is experiencing a “resurgence” of such groups. He says such activity puts everyone involved in danger and can ruin investigations because the would-be offenders go home and wipe their computers of evidence. State Division of Criminal Investigations Director Matt Joy said he had no statistics on such vigilante groups’ activity in Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Park officials have approved a plan to bring high-speed internet into the Grand Teton National Park. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports the National Park Service authorized a proposal Aug. 15 to build a network of nine cell towers and 63 miles of a new fiber-optic line between Flagg Ranch, Moose and Kelly. Park officials say multiple telecommunication companies proposed the plan to wire the park, and the scope of the infrastructure is unprecedented within the National Park System. Officials say new signals are expected to cover portions of the adjacent Teton Wilderness. Advocacy groups and residents question the importance of internet in the woods. Officials say construction could begin this fall, but the bulk of it is expected to be built in 2020.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/22/lion-man-garden-state-bud-amelia-earhart-news-around-states/50125535/", "title": "Lion Man, Garden State bud: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nCORRECTION: This article originally misstated details about a museum in the works in Atchison, Kansas, the birthplace of famed aviator Amelia Earhart. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world.\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An organization that has staged dozens of protests against a Confederate monument in north Alabama filed suit contending the city is trying to limit the demonstrations in violation of free-speech guarantees. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Project Say Something and its founder, Camille Bennett, claims the city and Police Chief Ron Tyler are trying to clamp down on the protests by telling the group when, where and how it can demonstrate against the monument, located at the Lauderdale County Courthouse. Bennett said the organization, a nonprofit she founded about eight years ago, has tried to work with the city, the TimesDaily reports. “Alabama has a long history of confronting racial injustice through peaceful demonstration, and it is imperative that we not lose that ability to speak truth to power when the situation demands it,” Bennett said in a statement. The city has not responded to the federal lawsuit in court, and city officials declined comment. Project Say Something held as many as 175 demonstrations at the monument in 2020 but cut back the following year because the city used its noise and parade permit ordinances to discourage them, the lawsuit said. The chief relocated the demonstrations to a “protest zone” away from the courthouse to shrink the potential audience, it claimed, and he threatened to issue citations.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is in the midst of her first visit to the state in the role, including a visit to a community at the center of a long-running dispute over a proposed land exchange aimed at building a road through a national wildlife refuge. Residents of King Cove have seen a road as a life and safety issue. Haaland was in King Cove on Wednesday with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Dunleavy’s office said. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to Cold Bay, which is about 18 miles away and has an all-weather airport. The refuge is near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. “The federal government needs to consider human safety and quality of life factors for residents in King Cove. The locals deserve to be heard by the federal government,” Dunleavy said in a statement. A U.S. Justice Department attorney last summer said Haaland had not decided what position she would take on a proposed land exchange, saying Haaland planned to review the record and visit King Cove before making a decision. A planned trip to Alaska last year didn’t materialize.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Republican House speaker on Thursday was named one of five recipients of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for his refusal to consider overturning the 2020 election results despite massive pressure from ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters. Speaker Rusty Bowers rebuffed repeated direct efforts by Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to overturn results that saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona. Trump and Giuliani urged Bowers in a phone call to retroactively change Arizona law to allow the Legislature to chose a different slate of presidential electors than those picked by the voters. “I am very grateful for this honor yet cannot help but feel undeserving of it,” Bowers said in a statement. “Honoring my oath and the people’s choices at the ballot box are not heroic acts – they are the least that Arizonans should expect from the people elected to serve them.” The award created by Kennedy’s family in 1989 is designed “to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most” and is given each year to one or more political figures. This year’s award honors those who showed “courage to protect and defend democracy in the United States and abroad.” The awards will be presented at a May 22 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A local agency says it’s seeing an uptick in calls for help after the end of a statewide rent relief program. The Arkansas Department of Human Services closed its program April 1, leaving many renters struggling to find additional avenues to keep their families housed. The Arkansas Rent Relief Program provided up to 15 months of relief for unpaid rent and utilities due on or after April 1, 2020. As of the beginning of this month, about 30,000 applications had been paid at the close of the program, totaling $92.5 million in funding distributed. Some households are still waiting for assistance as their applications are being processed. As of April 7, about 3,700 applications were still being processed across the state. In the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey taken from Jan. 26 to Feb. 7, 41.4% of Arkansas households surveyed said they were not current on rent or mortgage, making eviction or foreclosure either very likely or somewhat likely in the next two months. Dana Crawford, family services manager at the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, said she has seen an uptick in calls looking for help following the closure of the state’s rental assistance program. “We did have the Arkansas Fresh Start, but we have since depleted those funds,” Crawford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Parents of middle and high school students in the state would be warned about the dangers of firearms every year under a measure that advanced Wednesday. But they would no longer be required to tell school officials if they keep guns in the house, under the revised legislation. The state Senate Education Committee three weeks ago rejected the firearms reporting requirement as an invasion of privacy. So Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino reworked his bill, eliminating the parental reporting. The narrower version cleared the same committee Wednesday on a 5-1 vote. His revised bill requires schools to include information on the safe storage of firearms in the annual notifications they send home to parents of students in middle and high schools, starting in the 2023-24 school year. Legislation with a similar requirement has already passed the California Assembly. More than two-thirds of school shootings involve weapons taken from the students’ home, friends or relatives, Portantino said. “This is an attempt to try to empower school districts to do everything they can to make the school environment safe,” he said. “This errs on the side of caution.” If there are threats or perceived threats of school shootings, the proposal requires investigators to check the state’s firearm database to see if the suspect’s family has registered firearms.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The police chief who led the force in the Denver suburb when a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater a decade ago is returning to temporarily lead the embattled department following the firing of its last chief. Daniel J. Oates, who served as police chief in Aurora from 2005 to 2014 before retiring as police chief in Miami Beach, Florida, will serve as interim chief and help in the selection of the next police chief, the city announced Wednesday. City manager Jim Twombly said he hired Oates “because he has established trust within our community and many of our officers.” Earlier this month Twombly fired Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who was hired in 2020 as the city faced scrutiny over the death of Elijah McClain – a case that received widespread attention in the wake of protests of racial injustice and police brutality. McClain died after being stopped by police, put in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine in 2019. Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted in McClain’s death last year. Wilson acted quickly to fire officers for misconduct, including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock McClain’s death. Twombly praised Wilson’s community outreach but said he fired her because of concerns about her leadership and management of the department, without getting into specifics. Wilson disputed Twombly’s assessment and alleged she was forced out for political reasons.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Emergency responders rescued 50 dogs and cats from a fire at a pet boarding facility after three people had escaped the flames by jumping from a second-floor window, authorities said Thursday. The fire was reported shortly before midnight Wednesday in a two-story building on Post Road East, Assistant Chief Jeff Gootman of the Westport Fire Department said in a news release. Firefighters responded and found heavy fire on the second floor of the building, which housed a pet boarding facility on the first floor and basement and an apartment on the second floor, Gootman said. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they searched the building and determined that the three people on the second floor had jumped to safety from a window, Gootman said. None required hospitalization. Westport firefighters and police officers removed approximately 50 dogs and cats from the boarding facility, Gootman said. The cause of the fire was under investigation Thursday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After decades of criticism over use of force and a strained relationship with the community, the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and procedures are coming under legal scrutiny. A federal lawsuit filed against Wilmington officers involved in the 2020 shooting of a man found sleeping in an SUV lists years of departmental procedures claiming city police are unable to handle many situations, including making contact with unarmed individuals. The civil lawsuit touches on documented accounts of how Wilmington officers have not been taught to give proper verbal warning prior to using deadly force or to take cover when officers believe someone is armed. The lawsuit also claims department supervisors, among others, fail to check that officers use their standard-issue equipment and fail to prohibit officers from making false statements. These failures create unwritten policies, allowing Wilmington officers to engage in acts of excessive force without accountability, which in turn result in injury to civilians, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Jabri K. Hunter, who was shot by a Wilmington officer April 12, 2020. “These inadequate training policies existed prior to the date of this incident and continue to this day,” said the lawsuit targeting the officers involved in the shooting, Chief Robert Tracy and the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and other community leaders announced Thursday that the city’s annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness showed a decline for the sixth straight year, WUSA-TV reports. Over the past year, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has dropped 13.7%. Since 2016, when the Bowser administration began its Homeward DC plan, homelessness has declined by 47% total, data show. For the 2016 Point in Time count, 8,350 people were experiencing homelessness. In 2022, that number was 4,410. That’s the lowest recorded number going back to at least 2005, the mayor’s office said. The 2022 results also show declines in family homelessness (down 14%), homelessness among single adults (down 12%), and chronic homelessness for families (down 26%) and single adults (down 22%). “These results are a culmination of years of working together – across government, with our community partners and providers, and with residents in all eight wards – to implement Homeward DC and build systems and resources that meet the needs of D.C. residents,” Bowser said in a statement. “While we are proud of these results, we know there’s more work to do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the Florida House floor Thursday to protest a congressional map pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that they say will diminish the state’s Black representation in the U.S. House. The DeSantis map would increase Florida’s GOP presence and dismantle two districts now represented by Black members of Congress. As debate on the maps was nearing an end, Reps. Angie Nixon and Tray McCurdy opened up their suit jackets to display “Stop the Black Attack” T-shirts and shouted the same phrase. They sat on the state seal in front of the House speaker’s rostrum and were soon joined by other other Black Democrats and other supporters. The Republican-led chamber called a recess, all GOP lawmakers left the floor, and the state Florida Channel stopped broadcasting the proceedings. “This is good trouble! Necessary trouble!” Nixon shouted, echoing a phrase used by the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. The group sang “We Shall Overcome” and prayed. Some members went on Facebook to stream live feeds of the protest. Nixon said in a text message to the Associated Press that the lawmakers would not leave the floor unless they were physically removed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams’ gubernatorial campaign asked a federal judge Wednesday to shut down unlimited contributions to a committee controlled by Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. The filing is yet more litigation over the constitutionality of a 2021 Georgia law that allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits and coordinate spending with campaigns. The judge earlier denied a request by Abrams to start taking unlimited amounts before she clinches the Democratic nomination May 24. Kemp narrowly beat Abrams in the 2018 general election, and they would match up again if Kemp survives a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue and others. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Donors can give as much as they want, while they can’t directly give candidates for statewide office more than $7,600 for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. Opponents say the law unconstitutionally favors incumbents over challengers because they can raise limitless sums for years ahead of an election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Public school students must continue wearing masks in classrooms despite state officials lifting the same rules for airports and public transportation following Monday’s federal judge decision to remove mask requirements on U.S. flights. Masks are no longer required in Hawaii airports, on city buses or in handicapped vans, but all public students will be required to wear masks through the end of the school year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “I understand that there are different perspectives regarding the Hawaii State Department of Education’s indoor masking in schools,” interim Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in a letter to parents. “We will continue to implement universal indoor masking in schools.” Federal transportation officials announced Monday that they would no longer enforce mask rules after a U.S. judge’s decision to strike down the mandate on domestic flights. The four largest U.S. airlines almost immediately dropped their mask requirements, and Hawaiian Airlines announced late Monday that it would follow suit. “We ask for our guests’ patience and understanding as we update all our communications and announcements,” the airline said. “We advise travelers to stay informed and follow mask requirements that may remain in effect at their origin or arrival airports.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men have been sentenced to jail time and banned from hunting for years after pleading guilty to poaching a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said in a press release that Rex Baum, 79, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the female grizzly’s death last year. He was ordered to serve 3 days in jail and was banned from hunting for a decade. Baum’s son, Jared Baum, of Ashton, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and banned from hunting for life after pleading guilty to a felony in connection with the incident. Fish and Game officers discovered the grizzly’s carcass April 9, 2021, after the bear’s radio tracking collar signaled it had died, the Idaho Statesman reports. X-rays of the bear showed she had been shot more than a dozen times. Conservation officers visited the bear’s den, discovering a dead male cub. The agency contacted the two men after sending a warrant to Google for records of electronic devices that had been in the area around the time of the grizzly’s death. Idaho grizzlies are federally protected. Last month, Gov. Brad Little joined Montana and Wyoming governors in petitioning for the bears to be removed from Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The city will have a starring role in the state’s latest marketing campaign, with the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Cozy Dog Drive-In, and other sites featured in the new promotion. Gov. J.B. Pritzker officially announced the new campaign, “Middle of Everything,” at a ceremony Monday at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium. While the Windy City is spotlighted heavily, Springfield gets plenty of love as well, with sites related to the 16th president, such as Lincoln’s Home and Lincoln’s Tomb, promoted in addition to the museum and a statue of Lincoln sitting on a park bench outside the museum. Pritzker said the $30 million campaign would help to recover tourism dollars lost during the COVID-19 pandemic and put the state in a position to grow in the years to come. A series of TV ads will run with the campaign, directed by Illinois native Jane Lynch, famous for roles such as in the TV series “Glee” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” The Dolton-raised actor, a graduate of Illinois State University, narrates a quartet of 30-second ads that showcase a Lincoln impersonator at the Lincoln Home, a muscle car at the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices downtown, Lynch interviewing a family at the Cozy Dog and speaking with a ghost of Lincoln at “Ghosts of the Library” in the ALPLM, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Thomas McDermott Jr. released a new video ad Wednesday of him smoking marijuana in honor of 4/20, a cannabis-related celebration. McDermott, who will face Republican Sen. Todd Young on Nov. 8, has been vocal about his support for the legalization of marijuana, but the video of him lighting it up is a first. In the video the Hammond mayor posted on Twitter, McDermott lights a joint and smokes it in an Illinois backyard, where marijuana consumption has been legalized. He talks to an attorney, a physician, a criminal defense attorney, a professional distiller and another elected official about the benefits of legalizing weed. “Here’s the bottom line,” McDermott says in the video. “We need to legalize marijuana on the federal level. We need to also legalize cannabis in Indiana as well, so Hoosiers can get the health and economic benefits of cannabis.” The mayor admitted last year on his “Left of Center” podcast that he smoked marijuana at a recent Grateful Dead show at Wrigley Field. McDermott unveiled the ad the same day the Indiana Democratic Party launched a tour to push marijuana legalization. It started publicly advocating for the policy change in November, but with Republicans in control at the Statehouse, it went nowhere in the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: This year’s Major League Baseball Field of Dreams game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs will have an opening act. The Cedar Rapids Kernels and Quad Cities River Bandits will play a regular season minor league baseball game in the stadium located near the iconic diamond from the movie Aug. 9. That showdown is set to take place just two days before MLB’s second-straight visit to the famous farmland and in the same ballpark used last season by the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds will play on the same field Aug. 11. “I think it just adds to an entire week now up there,” said Kernels general manager Scott Wilson. “Instead of just one night even with the major league game, you’ve got Tuesday night with us. It gives the Field of Dreams some opportunity to do some things on Wednesday between us and have that game on Thursday.” It’s a marquee matchup of minor league teams have been rivals in the Midwest League for years. The River Bandits are the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Kernels are the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The two teams, who are are located in Eastern Iowa, will become the first two minor league teams to play on the field.\n\nKansas\n\nAtchison: Aviator Amelia Earhart vanished as she tried to fly around the world in 1937, along with navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra 10-E airplane. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world. That museum is in the works in Atchison, Earhart’s birthplace. Museum founder and president Karen Seaberg announced last week that supporters had already donated $10 million of the estimated $15 million needed to create the museum, including corporate powerhouses FedEx, Garmin and Lockheed Martin. The museum is expected to open next year, according to its website. Earhart, born in 1897 in Atchison, was a social worker in Boston in 1923 when she became the 16th woman in the U.S. to be issued a pilot’s license. She subsequently became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. She was also the first woman to fly nonstop across the U.S. She became a celebrity and drew attention by rejecting traditional women’s roles and speaking in support of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Earhart also created her own line of women’s clothing, featuring comfortable outfits designed for “active living.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he will form an advisory team amid a broad review as he weighs whether to take executive action to legalize access to medical marijuana. Beshear said he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action to create a framework to make medical cannabis available for people suffering from specified ailments. The Democratic governor also made a direct appeal to Kentuckians to offer their views on the issue. “I want to be clear: I am for medical cannabis,” Beshear said at his weekly news conference. “I want it done in the right way. And we’re going to be looking at our legal options very closely. And at the same time, we want to hear from you.” The advisory team will travel the state to gather public input, and Kentuckians will be able to express their views directly to the governor’s office, he said. The expanded review reflects the governor’s growing frustration after the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate during the legislative session that ended last week. Lawmakers failed to “get the job done,” with Kentucky falling behind the majority of states that make medical cannabis available as an alternative to opioid medications, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge and court-appointed monitors hired to oversee reform of the New Orleans Police Department said Wednesday that the long-troubled agency could reach full compliance this year after a nearly decade-old court-backed overhaul of its policies and practices. “I’m proud of how far NOPD has come,” U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan, who approved the agreement in 2013 a highly critical 2011 investigation and report by the U.S. Justice Department. Morgan tempered her praise with acknowledgment of continuing problems, including the short-handed department’s slowdown in recruiting and allegations of wrongdoing by officers who work private duty details arranged through the department. But the department has shown transparency in dealing with such setbacks, Morgan said. The reform agreement, embodied in a court document called a consent decree, was welcomed by department critics when it was negotiated during former Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s administration. They said it was needed for a department that had been plagued by recurring scandals involving corruption or questionable use of force for decades. But the consent decree had its critics as well, including police officer representatives who said it hampered police work.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed off on a $1.2 billion supplemental budget Wednesday that sends more than half the money to residents in the form of $850 relief checks. Backed by dozens of lawmakers and Cabinet members, the governor signed the bill into law in the State House Hall of Flags. “What this budget shows once again – through hard work and good faith negotiation – Democrats, Republicans and independents can come together to do what is right for Maine people. And that we can do so without rancor or bitter partisanship that has sometimes divided Augusta in the past,” she told the assembly. The swift action means the checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 Mainers as early as June. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the budget proposal in a show of bipartisanship. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers, taking a suggestion from Republicans as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. It was originally touted as pandemic relief but is now called inflationary relief. Mills’ opponent in the upcoming election, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, derided the relief checks as a “gimmick.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed measures into law Thursday aimed at increasing public safety, jobs, environmental stewardship and mental health resources. The Republican governor, who prioritized initiatives to support the police and fight crime this legislative session, signed legislation to increase transparency in the criminal justice system and to create a state gun analytics center to coordinate resources to screen and vet gun cases to improve the prosecution of gun crimes. “Violent crime continues to be Marylanders’ top priority, and today we’re signing our Judicial Transparency Act so that the public knows more about the sentences that are being handed down for violent criminals,” Hogan said. “We’re further expanding our warrant apprehension efforts and strengthening prosecutions on gun crimes.” Hogan opened his remarks before signing 103 bills with House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith by noting it was the first time two Black women were the presiding officers representing the Maryland House and Senate together at a bill signing. The criminal justice measures marked a compromise between the Republican governor and the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMartha’s Vineyard: A local family will go to court Friday over its continuing fight over a piece of land in Aquinnah that the Kennedy family donated to the Vineyard Conservation Society in 2013. Tanisha Gomes and her family say they are the rightful owners of that 5.7-acre property and are challenging the society’s motion for summary judgment, which asks a judge to throw out the case. In 2017, Gomes received a letter from Fidelity National Law Group, a firm that represents Vineyard Conservation Society Inc., to inform her and 19 members of her family about title problems with the land. The letter informed Gomes and her relatives that a lawsuit was filed with Dukes County Superior Court against the family, who are considered heirs of Louisa Pocknett. Pocknett, described in the complaint as the former owner of the property, died Aug. 29, 1874, and was a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The family members were asked to sign an agreement to verify they had no right, title or interest in Lot 240, which was indicated on a plan entitled “Plan of Gay Head.” After further research, Gomes and her family found that Lot 240 remains in Pocknett’s name on the town of Aquinnah’s assessor’s website and objected to the lawsuit due to discrepancies surrounding incomplete deeds.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican state Sen. Lana Theis opened a session with an invocation by claiming children are being attacked by “forces” that want to indoctrinate them with ideas their parents do not support. Three Democrats walked out of last week’s meeting to protest her apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation and gender identity and critical race theory. Within days, one who tweeted criticism of the prayer was targeted by Theis in a fundraising email, calling Sen. Mallory McMorrow a liberal social media “troll” and accusing her of wanting to “groom” and “sexualize” kindergartners and teach “that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.” McMorrow responded Tuesday with a forceful, impassioned floor speech that resonated nationwide. “I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom” who wants “every kid to feel seen, heard and supported – not marginalized and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian,” she said. Theis, who declined to speak after the session, released a statement in which she did not apologize but again accused Democrats of trying to undermine parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education. McMorrow’s 5-minute speech found an engaged audience on social media, racking up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mike Dando, a St. Cloud State University English professor, has helped to create a new superhero comic and is aiming to teach students in grades 5-12 literacy skills, critical thinking and self-reflection this summer through an often overlooked medium. Exploring concepts like Afrofuturism and the African diaspora, students can imagine new worlds by reading and analyzing the story of the first Black superhero, Lion Man. In 2018, after the highly successful “Black Panther” movie debuted, Dando worked with a group of artists and professors around the world to revisit Lion Man, the first Black superhero comic, written in 1947 by Black Philadelphia journalist Orrin Cromwell Evans. The original story follows Lion Man, a scientist turned superhero tasked by the United Nations to watch over a magical mountain full of uranium in Africa to prevent war. When All-Negro Comics Inc.’s paper supplier refused to help the company produce another book because its founders were Black, only one Lion Man issue was ever published – until now. Dando’s new, much longer Lion Man comic book follows the character’s journey of self-discovery and heroism as he works to save a group of other heroes trapped in monstrous bodies. He served as editor and project manager for the work written by John Jennings and illustrated by David Brame. Thanks to a grant from St. Cloud State, the team was able to make copies of the comic book – one of which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – and Dando will work with a variety of after-school clubs this summer to talk about the narrative structure and themes of the book, as well as teach students how to make their own comics.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Volunteers on Thursday planted several types of grasses along a stretch of Mississippi Gulf Coast beach to help restore habitat for newly hatched Least Tern chicks. Audubon Delta, along with Harrison County Sand Beach Authority and Gulfport High School, partnered to install several species of beach grasses into a globally recognized conservation zone in Gulfport in order to stabilize the beach, encourage dune formation and provide coverage for the endangered birds. The area was destroyed after hurricanes Ida and Zeta and several tropical storms over the past two years, officials said. The project was made possible by a Caring for Our Coasts grant issued by Citgo and Restore America’s Estuaries.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City leaders on Thursday announced plans for a new institute designed to make the region a major player in geospatial technology. Andy Taylor, executive chairman of the rental car company Enterprise Holdings, is providing financing for the Taylor Geospatial Institute, along with eight St. Louis-area research institutions. The institute will provide funding for research and program development and expects to attract leading scientists to St. Louis, organizers said. Taylor said in a statement that he hopes the institute “will cement St. Louis as the world’s true center for geospatial excellence.” A news release says research and training will focus on topics such as food security, improving health care systems, and national security. Officials did not disclose how much money the Taylor family is investing, but the family has funded more than $1 billion in St. Louis civic initiatives and cultural institutions through the years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers have rejected an attempt to call a special legislative session to investigate the state’s election processes amid continued false claims by ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen. A poll of 149 lawmakers found just 44 approving a special session by Tuesday’s deadline, short of the 75 needed. The secretary of state’s tally showed 60 lawmakers rejected the special session, and another 45 didn’t return their ballots, which counts as a “no” vote. One legislative seat is vacant. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers tried to reach an agreement to ask Gov. Greg Gianforte to call a special session to create new voting districts for the Public Service Commission before three federal judges had to decide how to even out the populations in the five districts. However, GOP leaders were unable to get a commitment from all Republicans to limit the special session to addressing just the voting districts. Gianforte said he would not call a special session without such an agreement. After the court set the PSC districts for the 2022 elections, 10 lawmakers asked for the poll on whether lawmakers wanted to hold a special session on election integrity.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson endorsed state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks on Thursday in her campaign for the state’s 1st Congressional District. Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, is looking to replace former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who resigned after he was convicted on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal campaign contribution. Nelson, a Democrat, said Pansing Brooks has worked with both parties while in the Nebraska Legislature and passed more than 60 bills. Pansing Brooks will face state Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, in a June 28 special election to determine who will serve the remainder of Fortenberry’s term in Congress. She’s also expected to face Flood again in November, assuming that they both win their parties’ May 10 primary nomination as expected. Nelson is the most recent Democrat to have served as Nebraska’s governor, with a tenure from 1991 to 1999. He was a U.S. senator from 2001 to 2013. Pansing Brooks has served in the Legislature since 2015 and is leaving office in January due to term limits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Most of the five leading Republican candidates for governor who gathered Wednesday for a campaign forum offered dire assessments of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, rising crime and struggling schools – and asked for votes for their visions to fix them. Several also blamed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the consensus GOP front-runner, for skipping the event. “We want to have the best, well-run, state in the country,” said Guy Nohra, a Reno venture capitalist, drawing applause from among about 100 people at a Republican women’s club luncheon in Las Vegas. “But we don’t. We’re 50th in everything,” said Nora, who called his foray into politics the culmination of an American dream after his own teenage experience fighting a war in his home country, Lebanon, and his business ventures in the U.S. The event also featured North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, Gardnerville surgeon Fred Simon, former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and firebrand northern Nevada lawyer Joey Gilbert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House approved a resolution Thursday in support of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary before advancing a bill opponents said would threaten it. The nonbinding resolution came a week after the Democratic National Committee approved a plan to revoke the guaranteed first-place spots in the presidential nominating calendar long held by the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Noting New Hampshire has withstood previous challenges, lawmakers affirmed their commitment to the tradition and said candidates are well-served by campaigning in a state with an engaged citizenry and “well-run, free and fair elections.” But a supporter of a bill to create a provisional ballot system later called the current system “laughable,” claiming it allows people to cast fraudulent ballots with virtually no consequences. Under current law, voters who arrive at the polls without the necessary identification fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days; those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. The votes themselves remain valid, but under a bill sent to the House Finance Committee on Thursday, the state would create a new type of “affidavit ballots” that would be thrown out if voters fail to follow up. Opponents called it an expensive and complicated solution to a problem that doesn’t exist and said creating a system that would delay the final results for more than a week would threaten the state’s ability to hold the first primary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBloomfield: The flowers were finally on full display Thurday as recreational marijuana sales began in the Garden State. Michael Barrows wore his Grateful Dead T-shirt and Jerry Garcia face mask for opening day of legal cannabis sales and was one of dozens of people who lined up before dawn to join the celebratory scene. “It’s pretty amazing, exciting, and if I get pulled over on the way home, and I’m ever asked if I have any drugs in the car, now I’m allowed to say ‘only this,’ ” Barrows said, holding up the canister of marijuana flower he had just purchased. Possession of cannabis is legal now in New Jersey, though driving under the influence is still prohibited. Barrows, 60, joined a steady stream of other novelty-seekers, longtime marijuana users and medical patients at RISE in Bloomfield, near the state’s biggest city, Newark, and not far from New York City. With soul music blaring, free doughnuts in the parking lot, a steel drum and a balloon arch at the entrance, New Jersey’s cannabis kickoff for people 21 and older had the feel of a fair more than a store opening. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has long backed recreational marijuana legalization and signed the bill that set up the new marketplace kicking off at 13 existing medical marijuana facilities across the state, appeared at ZenLeaf in Elizabeth for its first day of recreational sales. The governor said he wouldn’t be trying any pot; earlier this week he said it’s not his “thing,” and he prefers scotch.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Habitat for about a million bats will be protected from human impacts through a deal between a nonprofit and the federal government. About 315,000 acres of southern New Mexico land owned by billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner were protected from development in a partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and New Mexico Land Conservancy. The deal saw a conservation easement added to Armendaris Ranch, owned by Turner, due to perceived cultural significance and biological diversity on the land in Sierra and Socorro counties. The ranch land supports more than 500 vertebrate species, according to a report from the Land Conservancy, including multiple listed for federal and state protections. It also contains the Fra Cristobal Mountain Range, home to 230 desert bighorn sheep, and lava fields that include the Jornada cave system that houses bats of multiple species. “This land is laden with important and unique natural and cultural resources, and the opportunity to permanently protect a property with conservation values of this magnitude was at the heart of our organization’s decision to tackle this landscape-scale project,” said Ron Troy, southern New Mexico program manager with the Land Conservancy.\n\nNew York\n\nOlive: As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The fight over a downtown Confederate marker is not over, according to the attorney challenging the city’s removal of Vance Monument, and documents filed Wednesday attempt to take the issue to North Carolina’s highest court. Despite an April 5 ruling from the N.C. Court of Appeals in favor of the city, affirming a lower court judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing removal of the monument, the city finds itself again in limbo. Nearing midnight Wednesday, Edward Phillips, lawyer for the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops, which brought the challenge against the city, filed a petition for discretionary review with the N.C. Supreme Court. This document is a request for the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Court of Appeals. It does not ensure the high court will hear an appeal, said City Attorney Brad Branham. “I am not going to cede the point until I’m told there’s just no path forward,” Phillips said. The filings add to an already lengthy process to determine the fate of the obelisk that was built to honor racist Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance. The 75-foot-tall granite Vance Monument stood in Pack Square Plaza in the heart of downtown Asheville. All but its base was taken down as of June 2021 after the City Council voted to remove it. The historical preservation group is seeking to stop and potentially reconstruct the monument to Vance.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state and several western counties that could have resulted in the construction of additional roads in parts of the Badlands. The Badlands Conservation Alliance says the ruling protects some of the most pristine areas of the Badlands from traffic and potential oil development. “I think it’s a really serious win for the Badlands, for the long-term integrity of those areas that are still roadless and considered suitable for wilderness,” said Connie Triplett, president of the alliance. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s and counties’ claim is barred by a 12-year statute of limitations that was passed years ago. Their ruling upholds an earlier decision by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, who dismissed the matter in 2017, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The case began a decade ago when Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie and Slope counties sued the federal government. The state followed with its own lawsuit, and the court consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs sought to claim rights to section lines used in land surveying and mapping in the Little Missouri National Grassland and other areas that make up the Dakota Prairie Grasslands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A lawsuit has been filed targeting legal protections granted to health care providers that allow them to deny treatment they oppose on the basis of their conscience or religious beliefs. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on Wednesday sued the state over the measure known as the “conscience clause.” According to the law, a medical provider can be “excused from participating” whenever a treatment conflicts with a provider’s “moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or convictions.” Opponents of the law say it could limit abortions or other medical care. The city also argues the measure violates Ohio’s Constitution and the federal Affordable Care Act. If nurses employed by the city are opposed to a medical procedure, “they can refuse it, and we as a city can’t do anything about it,” Klein said. He also said insurance companies could refuse to pay for certain procedures, and “that obviously causes significant problems for our employees.” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine kept the language of the law in place when he signed the 2021 budget. DeWine said the provision merely sets into state law what’s already being practiced. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the lawsuit “meritless, anti-democracy and authoritarian.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Plans to fully legalize marijuana can proceed to the signature-gathering stage, the state Supreme Court ruled, paving the way for two more cannabis plans seeking voter approval. The high court’s ruling late Tuesday comes amid a marijuana boom in the Sooner State after voters in 2018 approved the most liberal medical marijuana program in the nation. Nearly 10% of Oklahoma’s 4 million residents have qualified for a medical-use card – by far the highest percentage in the country. Supporters of the two separate proposals still need to gather enough signatures to put the plans on the ballot for voters. The plans approved Tuesday, State Question 819 and a companion State Question 818, would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to protect the right of residents age 21 and older to use marijuana. It’s part of a nationwide push to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults, which 18 states and the District of Columbia have already approved. Because the two proposals seek to amend the constitution, supporters will have to gather more signatures, about 178,000 in 90 days, for them to qualify for the ballot. “Whether we’ll get on the November ballot this year remains to be seen,” said Jed Green, a longtime Oklahoma cannabis activist behind the plans. “We’re going to push, push and push to get it done.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Native American tribe in the state said it is assessing its legal options after learning the U.S. government plans to release water from a federally operated reservoir to downstream farmers along the Oregon-California border amid a historic drought. Even limited irrigation for the farmers who use Klamath River water on about 300 square miles of crops puts two critically endangered fish species in peril of extinction because the water withdrawals come at the height of spawning season, the Klamath Tribes said. Last year, critically endangered sucker fish central to the Klamath Tribes culture and religion didn’t have enough water to spawn, and thousands of downstream juvenile salmon died without reservoir releases to support the Klamath River’s health. The tribes said in a statement that the decision to release any water to about 1,000 farmers in the massive, federal agricultural project was “perhaps the saddest chapter yet in a long history of treaty violations” and placed the blame for the current water crisis on “120 years of ecosystem mismanagement at the hands of settler society.” The fish are important to the inland tribes’ cultural and religious practices and were once a dietary staple. The Klamath stopped fishing for the sucker fish in the 1980s as numbers dwindled. They now run a captive breeding program to ensure the species’ survival and note that no juvenile sucker fish have survived in the wild in recent years. “We have nothing left with which to ‘compromise,’ ” the Klamath Tribes said in a statement. “Global warming is certainly a global problem, but thus far its local consequences appear to be exacerbating existing and systematic inequalities between ourselves and the larger society.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors said Thursday that they will not re-try a Philadelphia man whose 2012 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month, citing weak evidence and the involvement of a disgraced former detective now charged with sexually assaulting witnesses in other cases. Rafiq Dixon, 40, had been serving a life sentence in the 2011 fatal shooting of Joseph Pinkney. The 40-year-old was expected to be released from prison Thursday afternoon, hours after a Common Pleas Court judge granted the motion to withdraw charges, his attorney said. The initial case relied heavily on testimony from three witnesses who gave inconsistent accounts. All three were interviewed by former homicide detective Philip Nordo, who has been charged with various crimes including stalking, intimidating, and sexually assaulting male suspects and witnesses during his career. In June, a judge reversed the 2015 conviction of Arkel Garcia, who confessed to murder during an interrogation in which, his lawyer said, Nordo asked the teenager to view pornography with him. The ruling came after both sides presented evidence that Nordo had sexually groomed witnesses in the case and trial prosecutors had suppressed his misconduct. Garcia was also serving a life sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic former state lawmaker David Segal has joined the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a fellow Democrat who’s retiring after more than two decades in office. Segal announced his decision Wednesday, saying that many voters are fed up with federal politics and that “government should be able to do more to address the concerns of our neighbors.” Segal served on the Providence City Council before winning a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He served for two terms, from 2007 to 2011. In 2010 he lost a bid for Congress and founded a national liberal advocacy organization known as Demand Progress. He’s the latest entry in a crowded Democratic field that also includes state Treasurer Seth Magaziner; Joy Fox, a former top aide to Langevin; Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau; Omar Bah, executive director of the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; and former political strategist Michael Neary. “We have the people power to reach the voters, we have the money to compete, and we have the urgent case to make that we deserve leaders who can bring people together and ensure their voices are heard,” Segal said in his campaign announcement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Wednesday issued a temporary stay blocking the state from carrying out what was set to be its first-ever firing squad execution. The order by the state Supreme Court puts on hold at least temporarily the planned April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, who drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. The court said in issuing the temporary stay that it would release a more detailed order later. Attorneys for the 57-year-old inmate had sought a stay, citing pending litigation in another court challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina’s execution methods, which also include the electric chair. Moore’s lawyers also wanted time to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether Moore’s sentence was proportionate to his crime. It has been more than a decade since the last firing squad execution in the U.S. The state of Utah carried out all three such executions in the nation since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The most recent was in 2010. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday also set a May 13 execution date for Brad Sigmon, 64, convicted in 2002 of the double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s parents in Greenville County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A leadership shake-up and shorter wait times for service are welcomed changes for disgruntled military veterans who say the federal health care system is failing them, but that’s still not enough to appease the dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as a handful of elected officials, who showed up at the South Dakota Veterans Council’s quarterly meeting Wednesday. Praises of this week’s removal of the now-former Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs director were tempered by caution for a need for more systematic improvements. “If you walked the halls on Tuesday, there were more smiles in the Sioux Falls VA Hospital than there have been in 14 months,” said Hawk Mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran, referring to the departure of now former Sioux Falls VA director Lisa Simoneau. “But we’ve been shut out.” Simoneau was removed from the position as of Monday after growing pressure for a regime change from both veterans, VA employees and South Dakota’s congressional delegation. Since at least October, members of the South Dakota Veterans Council have voiced concerns about a lack of responsiveness from Simoneau regarding what’s described as an inadequate level of care being provided to veterans entitled to medical services through the veterans’ health care system. Some employees at the VA have also blown the whistle in recent weeks on poor management practices and a hostile work environment under Simoneau.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would become the latest to impose harsh penalties on doctors who violate new, strict regulations dictating the dispensing of abortion pills under a proposal headed to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. It’s part of a coordinated nationwide effort spearheaded by anti-abortion groups upset over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to remove a rule that required women to pick up the abortion medication in person. After Tennessee’s GOP-controlled House approved the measure last week, Senate Republicans on Thursday signed off on sending the proposal to the governor. Lee hasn’t publicly weighed in on the measure, but he has yet to veto a bill while in office and frequently stresses his opposition to abortion. According to the bill, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed, and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills. The drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians – effectively barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine. The in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A prominent conservative activist has been charged with unlawful restraint and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon over an October incident involving a contractor the activist hired, his attorneys said Wednesday. Jared Woodfill and Gary Polland, attorneys for Dr. Steven Hotze, said the Harris County District Attorney’s Office told them Wednesday that Hotze was indicted over allegations against a former police officer, Mark Aguirre, who worked for Hotze. Aguirre had been retained to pursue a voter fraud investigation on behalf of Houston-based Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization Hotze runs. Aguirre was charged Dec. 14 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after a man accused him of running him off the road and holding him at gunpoint in an effort to prove what authorities have called a bogus voter fraud scheme. Aguirre claimed an air conditioner repairman was the mastermind. He said the man’s truck was filled with fraudulent ballots when he ran his SUV into it Oct. 19, according to authorities. Aguirre told police he and some friends set up a “command post” at a Marriott hotel in suburban Houston that conducted 24-hour surveillance on the repairman for four days, according to a police affidavit.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Faced with continuing drought and one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., the Washington County Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to apply new water restrictions to every new residential and commercial development. The new rules won’t apply to any existing homes or commercial buildings, but they could hopefully provide a better balance between what water is available and the continued demand for new construction, said Adam Snow, a member of the three-member commission, which regulates buildings requirements for all of the unincorporated areas of the county. “We want to have beautiful communities and a beautiful place to live and maintain our quality of life,” Snow said. “We’re doing it as effectively and efficiently as possible with our water, which is a very sacred resource right now.” The changes will be written into Title 10, Chapter 27 of the county code. They will only apply to projects on unincorporated county land that still need approval from the county to go forward, although they resemble similar measures being passed by cities and towns in the area. Snow said about 5% of the county’s population lives on unincorporated land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Property owned by Vermont-recognized Native American tribes will be exempt from property taxes under a new law that takes effect in July. The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, recognizes that Vermont lands “are the historic and current territories of the Western Abenaki people.” “I sign it out of respect for the heritage of our Native American communities and traditions,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “Further, the associated costs to the Education Fund and the General Fund borne by all Vermonters are forecast to be negligible.” To be exempt from the state and municipal property taxes, the property must be used for the purposes of the tribe and not leased or rented. Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation, has said the tax exemption allows the tribes, which rely on grants and donations, to be able to use those resources “to help uplift our people” with food security and other needs. The legislation states that “stewardship of these lands was removed from the Abenaki by European governments and settlers” and acknowledges “the Abenaki people as the traditional land caretakers of Ndakinna, which includes parts of Vermont, New England, and Quebec.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWestlake: Officials at Booker T. Washington National Monument are asking the public for help in unraveling one of its biggest mysteries. Hidden away in a section of the park just off its Jack O’ Lantern Trail rests a cemetery that predates much of the known history of the former plantation where Booker T. Washington was born a slave and later freed. The cemetery has few markings to provide context to who was buried there or when they were buried. “It’s definitely one of the biggest mysteries at the park,” said Tim Sims, senior park ranger. Archaeologist with New South Associates recently began taking a deeper look into the cemetery, commonly referred to as the Sparks Cemetery named after a person who once lived nearby. Some of the Black families who have lived near the cemetery include the Brown, Holland, Divers, Burroughs, Ferguson, Taylor, Green, Harris, English, Edwards, Starkey, Swain, Saunders, Childress and Dudley families. Sims said the names of the families were found looking through property deeds, slave records and federal census records. People with information on those possibly buried in the Sparks Cemetery are asked to contact Velma Fann, historian, at New South Associates at 770-498-4155, x126 or vfann@newsouthassoc.com.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that an Edmonds city ordinance requiring that guns be locked up and kept out of unauthorized hands is preempted by state law. The ruling affirmed a three-judge state of appeals ruling last year in the case sparked by a lawsuit filed by three residents against the city of Edmonds after it approved an ordinance in July 2018 requiring residents to lock up their guns or else face fines. “Under our system of divided government, many elected bodies hold legislative power, including elected city councils. These councils, however, must legislate within constitutional constraints,” Chief Justice Steven González wrote, joined by the eight other justices on the high court. “One of those constraints is that city ordinances must not ‘conflict with general laws’ that have been enacted by the people of our state by initiative or by our state legislature.” A statewide ballot measure that passed later that same year on gun safety doesn’t mandate that a firearm be stored in a particular way or place, but it created criminal penalties for when a gun isn’t properly stored and accessed by someone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm – such as a child – and used to injure or kill, displayed in public in an intimidating manner or used during a crime.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A health care system has partnered with a junior college on a program aimed at addressing the shortage of nurses in the state. Mon Health System and West Virginia Junior College signed a letter of intent to launch a nursing education program that will put students at the school on an accelerated path to becoming nurses, officials said during a signing ceremony Monday. Mon Health nurses will serve as faculty, and the students will have digital coursework as well as learning through work at the hospital – what Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg called patient-side, The Dominion Post reports. The program plans to open enrollment in September and start its first class next April. The collaboration, Goldberg said, will serve “to bring not only the best nurses to patient-side through Mon Health, but keep people in this community, grow our own, take care of our own neighbors, family members and friends, so we continue to be the best health care location in north-central West Virginia and improve our health care outcomes.” West Virginia Junior College CEO Chad Callen said nursing shortages are at near crisis levels in some areas of the state. “Such challenges require bold thinking and innovative, out-of-the-box approaches,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker in the state as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves snakes and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman’s reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman’s website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s senior population grew at the nation’s second-fastest rate in the second decade of the millennium, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Citing research from online resource hub AgingInPlace.org, the newspaper points to a 40% increase in the proportion of Wyoming residents who are 65 or older between 2010 and 2020, with the level sitting at 17.8% in the latest census. Only Alaska was found to have a faster-growing senior population when comparing U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}]}

Early Swedish settlers completed the church in 1699, and much of the original structure stands today. It is known as the oldest American church still used for worship.\n\nThe Rev. Patricia Downing, who leads services at the church, says she's been involved in national park discussions in Delaware for about a decade. \"We think it's a wonderful opportunity for the congregation and for the state and for increasing awareness of our history,\" Downing said of a potential park designation.\n\nThe Senate could consider the legislation as early as Wednesday.

Think of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming or Acadia National Park in coastal Maine.\n\nNational historical parks generally are not confined to a single property or building. One example is Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia, which includes Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center, among other sites. Both designations are considered units of the national park system and require Congressional approval.\n\nMonuments are created by presidential proclamations. It's unclear whether Delaware will get more federal funding with historical park designation.\n\nCarper said. \"Having a designated national park gives those of us in Delaware a chance to reach out across the world and invite people through the national park website to visit.\"\n\nThe sites – those already designed under the First State National Monument, as well as new proposed sites – celebrate the state's Swedish, Dutch and English colonial roots, and mark events leading up to the signing of the Constitution.\n\nDickinson – known as the Penman of the Revolution for his pro-independence writings – was a Delaware delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787.\n\nAlso, famously, 30 Delaware delegates met on Dec. 7, 1787, at the Golden Fleece tavern on The Green in Dover, a park site, to make Delaware the first state to ratify the Constitution.\n\nIn Lewes, the Ryves Holt House, built in 1665 by Dutch settlers, is known as the oldest house in Delaware. Ann Hilaman, president of the Lewes Historical Society, which owns the building, said they've had no formal discussions with the Park Service yet about an easement to be included in a national park.\n\n\"Naturally we're interested, we think it would be a great honor,\" said Hilaman, \"We really have not been contacted officially to negotiate who's going to do what and how it's going to be done.\"\n\nAdditional sites would be added to the park through preservation easements, not purchases by the park service, according to Carper's office.\n\nBlaine Phillips, mid-Atlantic director for the Conservation Fund, which was critical to designation of the monument, said designating a national park was the next step for Delaware.\n\nThe Conservation Fund, with a $20 million gift from the Mt. Cuba Center, purchased the Woodlawn property and gifted the site to the National Park Service.\n\n\"It was a $20 million gift that created the energy and the excitement to really jump-start the whole process. In my opinion, that's the momentum we're still riding,\" Phillips said.\n\nOnce the park is designated, \"work really begins,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"You have to roll up your sleeves and help create it and implement how it will be run,\" he said. \"It's a new park. And people need to have patience as it takes shape.\"\n\nPresident Obama created the national monument in March 2013 by proclamation. Vice President Joe Biden visited the New Castle sites, including the Old Sheriff's House, the New Castle Court House Museum and the New Castle Green, that month to dedicate the monument.\n\nProgress has been steady, but slow since, admits Russ Smith, the park superintendent and the monument's only employee. Smith has placed signs marking the entrance of the Woodlawn property, and is planning informative signs on The Green in Dover.\n\nHe recently completed a series of four public meetings to gather input on the park, and its future.\n\nA visitor center is on hold for New Castle. But Smith has commissioned a cultural landscape study of the Woodlawn property and a historic structures report on the Old Sheriff's House, the eventual site of a park headquarters and visitor center.\n\n\"Right now we are doing all the base work,\" said Smith, who would not comment on a potential national park designation. \"There will be a lot more conversation as we go through.\"\n\nStaff reporter robin brown contributed to this article.\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or jstarkey@delawareonline.com.\n\nPARK COMPONENTS\n\nIn already\n\nThe park would include sites designated as Delaware's national monument last year, including:\n\n•The 1,100 acre Woodlawn property near Brandywine Creek State Park.\n\n•New Castle Court House complex in Old New Castle.\n\n•The Green in Dover.\n\nLater entries\n\nNew sites could also be added through preservation easements, including:\n\n•Trinity (Old Swedes) Church in Wilmington.\n\n•John Dickinson Plantation in Dover.\n\n•Ryves Holt House in Lewes.\n\n•Fort Christina, home of the first Swedish settlement in U.S.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/04/12/delaware-national-historical-park-tours/510234002/", "title": "Tours tie together themes in Delaware's national park sites", "text": "Ethan McKinley, the superintendent of Delaware's seven-site First State National Historical Park, can easily see the ribbons of geography, history and culture that bind the park into a whole.\n\nAnd to help visitors see it, too, he's designed five tours that focus on different aspects, from the pristine landscapes that would have supported Native Americans and welcomed colonists, to the dawn of the industrial age and the changes it wrought.\n\nFrom north to south, those sites are Beaver Valley, Fort Christina, Old Swedes Church, New Castle Court House, the Dover Green, John Dickinson Plantation and Ryves Holt House in Lewes.\n\nThe themes can easily be enhanced by venturing outside the park’s borders: Lewes, Dover, Wilmington and the Brandywine Valley are filled with historic sites, interesting architecture and lovely spots to get close to nature.\n\nMcKinley likes to start in Beaver Valley, a living reminder of how Delaware was carved by William Penn from lands once consider Pennsylvania. The scale and layout of the land capture how it was used and subdivided by generations of Quaker families, he says.\n\n“Exploring Beaver Valley is a great way to contextualize the park and show why people settled here,” McKinley says. “It’s a place frozen in time.”\n\nHere's how he recommends visitors go exploring.\n\nFounding the New World\n\n• Ryves Holt House is Delaware’s oldest house. It dates back to 1665, just 34 years after the first European settlement of Delaware, a Dutch commercial effort called Zwaanendael that only lasted a year. The Dutch returned in 1658 to settle, creating Lewes.\n\n“The Dutch and Swedes often get little mention in American history and the story of the country’s mixing pot,” said Michael DiPaolo, executive director of the Lewes Historical Society, which uses the Ryves Holt House as its visitor center. “But once they hear about it, they’re intrigued by it.”\n\n• Fort Christina is where the Swedes first landed in 1638, and only the boulders that gave the name to the site (The Rocks) remain from so long ago. Visitors will get a deeper and more fulfilling perspective on New Sweden at the adjacent Kalmar Nyckel Foundation (a museum and a re-creation of a tall ship used four times by Swedish and Finnish settlers) and Old Swedes Church, built in 1698-99 a short walk away. The Christina Cultural Trail Pass for all three is $8. The church’s roots go back to 1640, when the first services led by a priest of the Church of Sweden were held at Fort Christina.\n\nMore:Kalmar Nyckel becomes official Tall Ship of Delaware\n\n• New Castle was founded in 1651, and its strategic location drew shifting control by the Dutch, Swedes and British. The New Castle Court House was built in 1732 on the foundation of a 1680s court, and the site served as Delaware’s first court and state capitol. “Three Forts, One Community,” an exhibit in the museum, covers the European power play and Native Americans. “The three Delaware counties grew to resent Pennsylvania’s Quaker-led assembly and in 1704 established their own legislature in New Castle,” according to to the park’s new brochure.\n\n• William Penn founded Dover in 1683, right after he landed in the New World. He called for three squares: Meetinghouse Square (for the Quakers like him), Church Square (the first Presbyterian church was built in 1708) and Courthouse Square, which became The Green and was laid out in 1717.\n\n• In the early 18th century, first- and second-generation Quaker immigrants established farms and mills along the Beaver and Brandywine creeks. Swaths are still farmed (Ramsey’s Farm offers school field trips and a fall fun for all, with details at www.ramseysfarm.com), but modern technology means you’ll only see remnants of the mills.\n\nBecoming America\n\n• John Dickinson was nicknamed the penman of the revolution because of his passionate writing, starting with 12 letters in 1767-68 that “were an appeal to reason to avert or postpone a break with England,” the National Park Service says. “From infancy, I was taught to love humanity and liberty,” he wrote in the first letter, anonymously credited to “a farmer in Pennsylvania.” “Our goal is to bring his story to life and show that the words he penned 250 years ago are still full of meaning today,” said Gloria Henry, supervisor of the plantation.\n\n• At the New Castle Court House on June 15, 1776, the Assembly of the Three Lower Counties declared independence from Pennsylvania and England and decided to call the colony the Counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex Upon Delaware. Separation Day is celebrated with a festival in mid-June. The Declaration of Independence was first read in Delaware from the building balcony on July 14, 1776. Museum staffers conduct two indoor building tours for the general public, one a basic tour and another on the Underground Railroad and key trials there.\n\n• Wartime fears led Delaware to move its capital from New Castle to Dover in 1777. At the Golden Fleece, a now-demolished tavern on Dover’s Green, 30 men voted on Dec. 7, 1787 to ratify the new U.S. Constitution, making Delaware the first state. That vote is celebrated as Delaware Day. The tavern also hosted the 1790 discussion of the Bill of Rights. The Old State House on the Green housed Delaware’s legislature from its 1791 construction to the 1933 move to Legislative Hall.\n\n• The Lewes Historical Society in April started hosting tavern talks at the Ryves Holt House, which DiPaolo called “interactive debates” about the pressing issues of 1777. These programs get their title from the house (once a tavern), historical context (Colonial taverns served as meeting places) and ambiance (beer for the modern sessions). The house was also a witness, he said, to nearby riots over how delegates were elected to that Constitutional meeting at the Golden Fleece, and that argument pitting western vs. eastern Sussex eventually led to moving the county seat to Georgetown.\n\nLewes was a key access point for vessels trading to and from Philadelphia (America’s capital from 1790 to 1800), and the subject of a blockade and bombardment in April 1813, as part of the War of 1812. A memorable reminder is the historical society’s maritime museum, called the Cannonball House for the cannonball stuck in its side. The society programs multiple historic structures, including the Lewes History Museum, not quite a mile away, at 101 Adams Ave.\n\n• Soldiers, primarily British and Hessians, were quartered near Old Swedes Church during the Revolutionary War, said Rebecca Wilson, executive director of the Old Swedes Foundation. Records also show them demanding religious services in the church.\n\nDelaware’s natural side\n\n• With the rolling hills, mossy stone walls, serene woods, meandering waterways and a patchwork of farmland, the 1,100 acres that form Beaver Valley are the most picturesque part of the park. The best spots to start exploring are from the Smith Bridge or Thompsons Bridge parking areas, which also offer picnic tables, fishing and canoe/tubing access. Eighteen miles of trails for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding crisscross the park and connect to Brandywine Creek State Park to the south.\n\n“The park is extremely biodiverse,” McKinley said, with bald eagles and great herons among its signature species. Citizen scientists in 2016 documented 116 species in Beaver Valley. An app called iNaturalist helps visitors identify new species and add to the total.\n\n“It’s the next best thing to having a ranger at your shoulder,” he said.\n\nCloverleaf Stables offers horseback rides from its Beaver Valley Road stables. A reservation-only one-hour ride is $50, and longer rides allow time to take horses swimming or explore more of the 2,000 acres in the federal park and adjacent green space. Details: http://cloverleaf-stables.com, 484-841-6230.\n\nWilderness Canoe Trips offers $23 unguided tubing trips in warmer weather from Smith Bridge to Thompson Bridge. The Brandywine is “a very slow, meandering river,” it says on www.wildernesscanoetrips.com, averaging 2 to 3 feet deep. The 1.5-mile trip takes two hours.\n\nThe Wilmington Trail Club often organizes hikes in the park. Details: www.wilmingtontrailclub.org.\n\nThose fishing, except children and seniors, need state fishing licenses and must follow state rules. Catch-and-release is recommended, and if fish are eaten, the state recommends consumption limits.\n\n“Brandywine Creek proper (non-tidal) has the largest population of smallmouth bass in the state, and also contains largemouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, redbreast sunfish, pumpkinseed, crappie, channel catfish, muskellunge, tiger muskellunge, white sucker, yellow perch, common carp,” the state says. “Species in Beaver Run are typically smaller fish — smallmouth, largemouth, rock bass, bluegill, redbreast sunfish, pumpkinseed, catfish, white suckers, yellow perch, common carp.” Beaver Run, in the northern edge of Beaver Valley, is also stocked with trout.\n\nStream Stewards, a program coordinated by the Nature Conservancy, involves citizen scientists to track the health of the waterways in Beaver Valley — source of all of Wilmington’s water. Details: www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/delaware/events/delaware-stream-stewards-citizen-science.xml.\n\nA few families enjoy the valley all the time by renting a house there. The most spectacular recent listing was an 18th-century stone colonial with a five-car garage and pond on 2 acres.\n\nDelaware’s only cave, which inspired the cave in “Dead Poets Society,” is on Beaver Dam Road.\n\n• From Fort Christina, anglers are most likely to encounter white sucker, channel catfish, bluegill, largemouth bass, crappie, pumpkinseed, redbreast sunfish, common carp and yellow perch.\n\n• “The Green is a really cool microcosm of trees,” said Sarah Zimmerman, superintendent of First State Heritage Park, noting it includes elm, sycamore, dawn redwood, juniper, maple, locust, holly and Kentucky coffee. It looks nice now, but that’s a Victorian creation. Old newspapers ran complaints about broken fences, scraggly grass and feeding pigs (but cows were OK). The Green hosts Dover Days (starting in 2018), summer concerts, a Shakespeare play and an 18th-century market fair.\n\n• John Dickinson cared about preservation, said Gloria Henry, site manager of the John Dickinson Plantation. He told his slaves (he released them by 1786) and tenants (he had a lot, since he owned 5,000 acres, although the plantation is down to 18) they couldn’t cut down healthy live trees.\n\nMake a Splash, an annual festival, teaches hundreds of schoolchildren about water resources at the plantation and the St. Jones Reserve.\n\nMore:Frog Hollow, a Wilmington Garden Club tour staple, gets new owners\n\nBiking the route\n\nA devoted cyclist could hit all the sites, but it’s about 100 miles, longer to avoid busy roads.\n\nIt’s much more realistic to bike the between Dover’s Green and the John Dickinson Plantation. A less-trafficked route takes 9 miles along Del. 8/South Little Creek Road and Del. 9/Bayside Drive.\n\nThe four New Castle County sites are doable by bike, especially after the Jack Markell Trail opens in June, after a decade of advocacy. The 8-mile trail runs south from the Wilmington Riverfront, tied to a 1.5-mile trail running to the New Castle Court House. From the Wilmington Riverfront, city streets reach Fort Christina and Old Swedes Church and then north to the Brandywine.\n\nThe Northern Delaware Greenway then gives bicyclists a decent ride (watch out for the bumps and the steep grade in Alapocas Run State Park), and it’s back to roadways until a dedicated trail pops up in Brandywine Creek State Park, leading directly into another dedicated trail in Beaver Valley.\n\nOn delawaregreenways.org, Delaware Greenways colors in trail ideas that would cover the entire length of the Brandywine, from the Pennsylvania line to its juncture with the Christina.\n\nAll about architecture\n\n• The area around the New Castle Court House is second in the country in number and authenticity of its Colonial and Federal structures. The courthouse is in Georgian style, and a window on the floor allows visitors to peek into the 1680s foundation. Some interesting elements in the museum, according to site supervisor Cindy Snyder, include a chair for the Assembly speaker, used since Colonial days; and ironclad doors installed in an 1845 renovation in an attempt to make some rooms fireproof.\n\nInteresting elements that used to exist nearby include a 44-cell jail that began the county prison system, a separate debtors prison and a whipping post (whipping was legal in Delaware until 1952) with a pillory on a platform on the top.\n\nThe adjacent Sheriff’s House, planned to become the park visitor center, is an 1858 Victorian brownstone. Three walking tours run by the museum explore the area, focusing on the Green, veterans and nearby buildings.\n\n• Old Swedes Church has the oldest known pulpit in the U.S., with a canopy projecting the speaker’s voice. The pews, 1899 reproductions, could be closed to keep out drafts and are raised so the doors would not catch on the uneven brick floor. Even so, “worshippers often brought heated rocks or pans of hot coals into their pews to keep themselves warm,” the church says. Through the 1700s, Swedish custom called for men on the right and women on the left.\n\nThe congregation outgrew Old Swedes, building Trinity Chapel at Fifth and King streets in 1830 and moving again in 1882 to Adams Street. Along the way, members restored Old Swedes. One unusual element they left is graffiti — mostly just initials and dates but also a drawing of the church.\n\nThe Hendrickson House was moved from Pennsylvania to the grounds in 1958. Although some date it to before 1690, Wilson said the latest research places its construction to 1720 to 1736. It was likely built for new widow Catherine Hendrickson and is “a large home for a wealthy family,” Wilson said.\n\n• John Dickinson’s father built the main house in 1739-40, and it stayed in the family until 1933, becoming a museum in 1956. It’s an early Georgian mansion (restored after an 1804 fire), illustrating “telescope type of planning, in which a series of smaller wings are added to the main house at later dates,” the National Park Service says.\n\nMultiple outbuildings have been reconstructed: granary, feed barn, double corn crib, stable, smokehouse and slave/tenant house (a log cabin with a dirt floor).\n\nThe plantation only has a few items owned by John Dickinson, Henry said, including his travel inkwell, a razor he planned to give as a gift, a teapot, some plates and some books.\n\n• First State Heritage Park includes several buildings on The Green. One is the John Bell House, probably built as a simple workshop in the 1740s, used for multiple purposes over the decades, including a post office, and now as the park visitor center. “It’s just a humble building, but visitors are intrigued that it’s been there the whole time,” Zimmerman said. It’s a rare example of Chesapeake vernacular style — rare because most such wooden buildings have not lasted the centuries.\n\nAnother interesting building on The Green is the Old State House, built in 1791 in Georgian style. Notable details include the gilt sunflower ceiling sham and the dual stairways up to the legislative chambers. And the Kent County Courthouse, built in 1874 in Second Empire style, is open for First Saturday programs, in which varied sites in the park explore the same theme once a month.\n\nAll the other buildings on The Green are private residences or offices, Zimmerman said, highlighting the Parke-Ridgely House, which was built in the 1730s in the hall and parlor style and renovated over the centuries in styles reflecting the changing look of the area. The Green is also a microcosm of architectural styles, including Second Empire and Italianate.\n\nArchitectural tours of Dover’s Green are offered on some Saturdays, on by appointment for groups.\n\n• The stone farmhouses dotting Beaver Valley are “similar in size, materials, layouts and ornamentation to those forbearers in England and Ireland,” the park says. As technology and the economics of farming changed, structures like bank barns and springhouses were abandoned. At least eight structures from the 18th century remain on the property, preserved as a private park starting in 1906 by Quaker industrialist William Poole Bancroft.\n\n• The Ryves Holt House (named for Delaware’s first chief justice, also speaker of the House and a sheriff) is in Delaware Valley Dutch vernacular style. It’s one of 14 Lewes Historical Society buildings of varied styles, including an 1898 bank used as the museum store; the Cannonball House from about 1760, with its War of 1812 cannonball; the 1884 Life-Saving Station, which the society says is “best known for its heroic surfmen’s actions during the great blizzard of 1888”; and the society museum.\n\nThe nine buildings in the society’s Shipcarpenter Street complex include a plank house from about 1690; a house from about 1720; a house from about 1740, which the society says “reflects the hard and simple life of southern Delaware’s 18th century farmers”; a Federal-style house from about 1789; a blacksmith shop from about 1790; a clapboard Sussex County farmhouse from about 1800; a country store from about 1800; a doctor’s office from 1840, the only example of Greek Revival architecture in Lewes; and a one-room school from 1898. The 1720 house is the only one on its original foundation. Period furnishings make the past come alive in all of them.\n\n“Delaware’s natural resources were historically valued for serving human needs,” the park brochure says. “Today, thanks to Bancroft and many others, they are valued for just being themselves.”\n\nMore:State's history of lobotomies preserved at Georgetown mental institution\n\nMore:Expedia likes Dover as state's 'Best Place to Escape'\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nFirst State National Historical Park consists of seven sites.

Each state boasts unique symbols based on its history and greatest strengths.\n\nCan you guess your state's nickname? Some are well-known, with sports teams donning the nickname on the field or court. Others have a more complicated history and come from the early settler days before statehood.\n\nWe're breaking down each state's nickname and how it came to be.\n\nAlabama\n\nAlabama doesn't have an official state nickname, but residents have adopted a few unofficial ones. Alabama was known as the \"Cotton State\" starting in the mid-1860s, but as its agriculture diversified some turned to call the state the \"Heart of Dixie.\" This was printed on license plates beginning in 1955, AL.com reports. Another nickname is the \"Yellowhammer State,\" as the yellowhammer is Alabama's official state bird. According to AL.com, it also has roots with Confederate soldiers in the Civil War, some of whom were teased for their cavalry yellow uniforms because they looked like yellowhammer woodpeckers.\n\nAlaska\n\nThe largest state in the United States by area still has unexplored territory, so naturally, Alaska's state nickname is \"The Last Frontier.\"\n\nArizona\n\nArizona is home to most of the Grand Canyon, so it makes sense Arizona's nickname is \"The Grand Canyon State.\"\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas' state nickname is \"The Natural State,\" named for \"beautiful mountains, towering forests, scenic rivers and rich farmland\" according to documents from the Secretary of State's office.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia's nickname is \"The Golden State\" because of both its long history with the Gold Rush and the presence of golden poppy flowers in the spring.\n\nColorado\n\nBecause Colorado's statehood came 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the state's nickname is \"Centennial State.\"\n\nConnecticut\n\nConnecticut's official state nickname is the \"Constitution State\" because of historical claims that the Fundamental Orders of 1638 and 1639 were the first constitutions ever written. Connecticut is also unofficially known as the \"Nutmeg State\" because \"its early inhabitants had the reputation of being so ingenious and shrewd that they were able to make and sell wooden nutmegs\" in place of real ones to trick customers, CT State Library writes.\n\nDelaware\n\nAs the first of the 13 original states to ratify the U.S. Constitution, Delaware is predictably known as \"The First State.\"\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida's state nickname is \"The Sunshine State.\" This, along with the state motto \"In God We Trust,\" appears on Florida's famed orange and green license plate. Despite the myth that Florida is the sunniest state, National Weather Service data actually points to Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas beating out Florida for most sunny days because of Florida's frequent afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia is known as \"The Peach State,\" but not because it's the biggest peach producer. Georgia's well-known fruit has roots in slavery and the South's need to rebrand itself after cotton was widely known as being associated with poverty and slavery, NPR reports. Peaches were seen as \"refined and European.\"\n\nHawaii\n\nHawaii's official state nickname comes from Hawaiian greeting – the \"Aloha State.\"\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho is known as \"the Gem State\" because of its abundance of gems and minerals. The name Idaho itself is thought to have been a Native American word meaning \"gem of the mountains,\" but it has since been discovered that white settlers made up the word.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois is nicknamed \"the Prairie State,\" a name given by the first settlers when they saw the vast expanses of prairie, Illinois' Department of Natural Resources says.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndiana's state nickname is the \"Hoosier State,\" as residents of Indiana are called Hoosiers. There's no direct explanation as to why, but the Indiana Historical Bureau traced general usage to the 1830s, including a poem called \"The Hoosier's Nest.\" One theory says settlers asking who was knocking at the door frequently asked \"Who's yere?\" Another says the Indiana rivermen were called \"hushers\" because of their success in brawling. One theory even suggests the name comes from a contractor named Hoosier who preferred to hire men from Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa is called the \"Hawkeye State.\" According to the University of Iowa, whose athletic teams are known as the Hawkeyes, the name came from a character in the novel \"The Last of the Mohicans\" by James Fenimore Cooper.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas is known as the \"Sunflower State\" because of the native wild sunflowers that grow in the state, which are also the official state flower. The state is also known as \"Jayhawker State,\" a name whose origins may have originated as a name Kansas soldiers adopted for troops along the border at the beginning of the Civil War, Kansas Historical Society writes.\n\nKentucky\n\nKentucky's state nickname is the \"Bluegrass State\" because of the abundance of the grass in its pastures.\n\nLouisiana\n\n\"Pelican State\" is Louisiana's state nickname because of its state bird.\n\nMaine\n\nMaine is called the \"Pine Tree State\" because of its white pine tree population, National Geographic reports. It's also known as \"Vacationland\" because of its booming tourism.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland has two state nicknames: \"Old Line State\" and \"Free State.\" The first was bestowed by George Washington because of the Maryland troops who served in the Revolutionary War, and the \"Free State\" nickname began in 1864 after the state abolished slavery.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWith Massachusetts Bay, Cape Cod Bay and Buzzards Bay along the coastlines, Massachusetts is known as the \"Bay State\" or \"Old Bay State.\"\n\nMichigan\n\nMichigan's official nickname is the \"Wolverine State\" because of the significance of wolverine pelt trading in the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnesota is known as \"The Gopher State,\" \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\" and the \"North Star State.\" The gopher reference came from an 1857 cartoon poking fun at a controversial bill to provide money to build railroads. The second nickname comes from the number of lakes in the state, but there are actually closer to 12,000 lakes in the state.

Only Christianity and Islam have more followers. The vast majority of Hindus live in India.\n\nThe United States is home to about 3 million Hindus, said Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism. Hinduism is considered the fourth-largest faith in the U.S., behind Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\n\nWhere does the name 'Hinduism' come from?\n\nAccording to the book \"World Religions\" by John Bowker, Hinduism comes from the Persian word \"hindu\" or Sanskrit word \"sindhu,\" which means \"river\" and refers to people of the Indus River Valley. The Indus River Valley runs through northwest India into Pakistan and is considered the birthplace of Hinduism.\n\nMore news:Sandmann lawyer: Letters sent to media, celebrities may precede suits\n\nDo Hindus believe in one god or many?\n\nThis is where many misconceptions and myths surrounding Hinduism come in.\n\nThe Hindu American Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group for Hindus in the U.S., said the \"Hindu understanding of God cannot be pigeon-holed into the Western binary of 'monotheistic' and 'polytheistic.'''\n\n\"It it simultaneously neither and both,\" the HAF said. \"Hindu teachings describe one Supreme Divinity or Absolute that is the formless underlying reality, which can manifest and be worshiped through infinite forms.\"\n\nThis aspect of the Hindu faith came up in a previous Kentucky-related incident.\n\nIn 2011, then-Kentucky State Senate President and Republican gubernatorial candidate David Williams came under fire after he criticized then-Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear for participating in a Hindu religious ceremony to inaugurate a new manufacturing facility in Elizabethtown.\n\nWilliams also expressed hope that Hindus would \"open their eyes and receive Jesus as their savior,\" which drew a strong rebuke from the HAF.\n\nSee also:Person with mental illness ordered to get treatment under 'Tim's Law'\n\nHow long has the Swaminarayan Temple been in Louisville?\n\nThe Swaminarayan Temple has been at 4032 Bardstown Road for about five years, said Raj Patel, a spokesman for the temple.\n\nBefore the temple, the building was home to a church, officials said.\n\nThe temple is affiliated with Maninagar Shree Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan, a Hindu sect and \"worldwide center for spiritual, cultural and social welfare\" located in Ahmedabad, India.\n\n\"Our fellow disciples come to our temple to pray, find inner peace, interact and learn from one another, provide good teachings to their children, and practice the highest form of morals and ethics — just as followers of all faiths,\" Patel said. \"Service to society before self, expressing kindness to all, and doing things for the betterment of humanity are some of our key teachings.\"\n\nThe sect of Swaminarayan Hinduism gets its name from devotion to Lord Shree Swaminarayan, a Hindu figure believed by followers to be a manifestation of God, Zed said.\n\nLord Shree Swaminarayan founded the sect at the end of the 18th century in northern India, according swaminarayangadi.com.\n\nRelated:Gov. Bevin calls vandalism of Louisville Hindu temple 'reprehensible'\n\n\"Maninagar\" refers to an area of Ahmedabad, the largest city in the Indian state of Gujarat, where most Swaminarayan followers are from, Zed said. \"Sansthan\" translates to \"institution\" or \"organization\" in English.\n\n\"Lord Shree Swaminarayan instilled into people the ideology of high morals, love and compassion for all, irrespective of caste, creed, color or gender,\" according to the organization's website. \"His sole intention was to rejuvenate the principles of true religion, which were being disintegrated by irreligious and evil practices.\"\n\nHis Divine Holiness Acharya Shree Purushottampriyadasji Swamishree Maharaj is the fifth and current spiritual leader (similar to the pope in Catholicism) of Maninagar Shree Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan.\n\nTemples belonging to the Maninagar Shree Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan organization are located in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nBesides the Swaminarayan Temple in Louisville, other temples in North America that are part of the Maninagar Shree Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan sect are in Illinois, California, Delaware, Florida, Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio and Canada.\n\nMany Swaminarayan Hindus live in the state of Gujarat in India, said Jay Kansara, director of government relations for the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nIn January, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin led a U.S. delegation to Gujarat for an economic development summit.\n\nMore headlines:Missing armored car driver was trying to get a new ID, police say\n\nHate crimes against Hindus in the U.S.\n\nLouisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has called the vandalism of the Swaminarayan Temple a hate crime, but the state or federal authorities will decide whether to treat it as such.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation did not begin tracking hate crimes against Hindu, Sikh and Arab-Americans until 2015.\n\nThere were five Hindu victims of hate crimes in 2015, and 15 Hindu victims in 2017, according to the FBI.\n\nOverall, 2017 saw 1,749 victims of religious-based hate crimes, according to FBI figures. Approximately 58 percent of those victims were Jewish.\n\nExamples include incidents in 2015 when Hindu temples in Washington and Texas were vandalized. Later that same year, 40 Hindu flags were burned at a home in Queens, New York.\n\nIn February of 2017, a Hindu man from India was shot and killed at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, after the shooter reportedly yelled \"get out of my country.\" The victim's Indian friend was also wounded in the shooting.\n\nThe Hindu American Foundation believes many hate crimes against Hindus in the U.S. are not reported.\n\nICYMI:T. Vaughn Walker, Louisville pastor and history-making professor, dies\n\nMat McDermott, HAF's director of communications, told the Courier Journal many hate crimes against Hindus tend to reflect more of a \"generalized anti-immigrant bias\" rather than a specific hatred against Hinduism.\n\n\"Sometimes it’s a case of mistaken identity — the Olathe, Kansas shooting, for example, involved Hindus who the shooter thought were Muslim and Iranian,\" McDermott wrote in an email. \"Such mistaken identity doesn’t make the incidents any less heinous, obviously.\"\n\nThe vandalism at the Swaminarayan Temple in Louisville, in which the suspect spray-painted phrases such \"Jesus Is All Mighty\" and \"Jesus Is The Only Lord\" on temple walls, seems to have been \"motivated out of a sense of religious superiority,\" McDermott said.\n\nPolice have not released a motive for the vandalism, but McDermott said those types of apparent anti-Hindu hate crimes are not as common in the U.S.\n\nTo learn more about Hinduism, visit hafsite.org.\n\nReach Billy Kobin at bkobin@courierjournal.com or 502-582-7030.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "These are the names of more than 800 of the Iowans who have died ...", "text": "Des Moines Register\n\nThe numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly.

In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises.

It did not respond to requests for comment, and Middletown is not included on its public list of upcoming locations. Large businesses like Target typically prefer to remain anonymous until a lease is signed and construction plans are approved.\n\nThe Middletown Planning Commission last week recommended the Town Council approve 147,613 square feet of retail space for what planning documents refer to as Northside shopping center. The final step in the approval process is a vote by the Town Council, which Branner said is scheduled for Sept. 12.\n\nThe exact location of the Target is unclear. Advertising materials indicate a letter of intent has been signed for a large space behind Popeyes backing up to the Middletown Village apartments.\n\nWhere are the Targets in Delaware?\n\nIf built, it will be the fifth Target in Delaware, joining locations at Brandywine Town Center off Concord Pike, the Christiana Mall, Prices Corner shopping center and on Route 13 in Dover.\n\nThe Prices Corner Target opened in place of Sears in April 2021. The company completed construction and the store opened about a year and a half after the new location was officially announced. Chris Robbins, the owner of the shopping center, said his conversations with Target began more than a year prior.\n\nThe Dover Target has been closed since early July after a man started a fire in the linen section of the store \"as a diversion to steal a cart full of merchandise,\" according to Dover police.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

It is a standalone building with a drive-thru near the WSFS building on the south end of The Grove.\n\nThe chain has been expanding rapidly, having added more than 500 locations in the last decade. Its restaurants make essentially one item: chicken fingers.\n\nMost of the menu items are different-sized combo meals with fingers, crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw and the company's signature Cane's sauce. The only deviation is the chicken sandwich, which is three chicken fingers on a bun. The tenders are hand-dipped to order.\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes brings specialty bakery to Christiana\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes, a national chain of bundt cake-only bakeries, is expanding to a second Delaware location.\n\nDelaware's first Nothing Bundt Cakes opened in December in the Market Square shopping center bordering Brandywine Town Center on Concord Pike. The second is being built in the Churchmans Place strip center on Churchmans Road in Christiana.\n\nConstruction began earlier this month. Franchisee Patrycja Swan is hopeful it will open this summer.\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes offers 10 bundt cake flavors and a rotating specialty flavor in five sizes, ranging from a tiered cake to mini \"bundtinis.\" Shoppers can select from a variety of decorations. All of the cakes are served with a signature butter cream cheese frosting.\n\nAs the name suggests, you won't find sheet cakes, cupcakes or cookies in the shop.\n\n\"I know people think we're crazy,\" Swan said. \"We focus on what we're good at.\"\n\nSwan's husband, David, first tried a Nothing Bundt Cake while on a business trip in the company's home city of Las Vegas, Nevada. It immediately hooked his sweet tooth.\n\nBefore long the Chester Springs, Pennsylvania couple was day-tripping to Shrewsbury, New Jersey to visit the nearest Nothing Bundt Cakes as conversations unfolded with the company's founders. Patrycja was looking for a new challenge after being a stay-at-home mother.\n\nIn 2018, they opened their first location in Exton, Pennsylvania. The Concord Pike location opened in December after a few months of equipment delays.\n\nAs for more Nothing Bundt Cakes in Delaware, Swan said, \"I think I've got my hands full with three.\"\n\n\"It's like with kids they say three under three. I've got two under one,\" Swan said. \"It's like having twins almost.\"\n\nConstruction begins at Crumbl Cookies in Christiana Fashion Center\n\nWork recently began on the Crumbl Cookies in the Christiana Fashion Center.\n\nThe store did not return a request for comment this week. The company previously said it is projected to open \"this spring.\"\n\nCrumbl Cookies features a rotating menu of six varieties: a chocolate chip and five more unique flavors pulled from a back catalog of recipes or developed fresh. Packaged in a signature pink box, its cookies have inspired viral social media reviews.\n\nA Crumbl Cookies opened in late February on Route 202 in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania in a strip center near Wegmans.\n\nTaco Bell leads a new shopping center in Glasgow\n\nConstruction of a Taco Bell in a new shopping center along Route 40 in Glasgow is nearly complete.\n\nThe development is being built along the west lanes of Route 40 at Biddle Avenue in a historic area west of Glasgow Avenue and southeast of the La Grange subdivision.\n\nEast of where the shopping center is being built sits La Grange Manor House, built in 1815 and the site of several important experiments pertaining to cultivation techniques and fertilization. It's often referred to as the Samuel Henry Black house, for its owner who was a doctor and farmer in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nA Taco Bell spokesperson said Wednesday the company is planning to open \"within the next two weeks.\"\n\nOther tenants for the center include AutoZone and ChristianaCare GoHealth Urgent Care.\n\nWaffle House opens doors in Bear\n\nA Waffle House opened earlier this month on Route 40 in Bear.\n\nThe restaurant took the place of a medical office at 1450 Pulaski Highway.

It's one of almost 50 locations listed as \"coming soon\" on the company's website.\n\nMORE ON TARGET: New details on the planned Middletown Target, and how Target is changing in Delaware\n\nTarget will be part of a new shopping center on Middletown Warwick Road at Ash Boulevard behind Popeyes and Middletown Wine and Spirits. The development includes about a half dozen smaller retail buildings and backs up to the Middletown Village subdivision.\n\nAt 148,000 square feet, the Middletown Target will likely follow the company's new \"larger-format store.\" It will be about 30,000 square feet larger than Target's newest Delaware store in Prices Corner.\n\nTwo Jersey Mike's planned for Lower Delaware\n\nJersey Mike's is on its way to Milford and Selbyville, according to the company's website.\n\nThe Milford location will be on Route 113 near Route 14.

At 113,000 square feet, it is the smallest of Target's four Delaware stores, but larger than most of Target's urban small-format stores.\n\nTarget will be on the first floor of the Sears building. A vacancy for a second business on the second floor is being advertised. Deborah Mills Houston of Robbins Property Management said the company has \"explored a number of different ideas\" for the second-floor space, but has not finalized any deals.\n\nThere is an atrium to the left of the Target entrance with an escalator and an elevator to the second floor of the building. The open space is advertised as being up to 66,720 square feet.\n\nSears opened on Kirkwood Highway in 1963. It closed in 2018 in one of several waves of closures by the company in the 2010s as it nosedived toward bankruptcy. Delaware's last Sears in the Concord Mall on Route 202 closed in February 2020.\n\nParking\n\nThere is a total of more than 1,500 parking spaces located in front of and behind the store. To access Target from the back parking lot, there is a stairwell to a walkway between Gabe's and the atrium connected to Target.\n\nHouston said the shopping center did not need any parking variances to support the Target.\n\nBy comparison, the Brandywine Town Center that includes a larger Target, Lowes and several other large box stores has more than 5,000 parking spaces.\n\nWhat else is coming to the shopping center?\n\nWith Target as the anchor, the shopping center has attracted several new tenants.\n\nThose coming soon include Tropical Smoothie, Two Claws, Urban Kitchen, Chick-fil-A and Chase Bank.\n\nChick-fil-A and Chase Bank will fill two new pad sites being built in place of the Sears Auto Center near the road. Houston said she expects them to open in late summer. The others are taking existing in-line space.\n\nThe shopping center has at least three additional vacancies.\n\nOnce Upon A Child and AutoZone are also recent additions to the shopping center. Last year, Robbins renovated the entire facade of the shopping center shifting it from a beige and brown color to dark gray.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

Now it's closed.\n\nMiniso\n\nThe Christiana Mall will be home to one of the first Miniso stores on the U.S. East Coast.\n\nMiniso is a Chinese retailer with some 4,800 locations worldwide specializing in household and consumer goods such as cosmetics, stationery, toys and kitchenware. It is planning to add around 25 U.S. stores this year, which will about double the company's U.S. presence.\n\nMiniso will be between JC Penney and Target and is expected to open during the holiday season, Wille said.\n\nPopeyes\n\nA Popeyes has been under construction in the mall's food court since at least March. Brookfield initially said the fast food restaurant would open in summer 2021. The mall owner then said it would open Sept. 1.

Both concepts come from Triple T Hospitality Group, a restaurant group with roughly a dozen locations mostly in New Jersey.\n\nTommy's Tavern + Tap will take over the former JB Dawson's between Macy's and Nordstrom on the west side of the mall, and Tio Taco + Tequila Bar will take over the former California Pizza Kitchen next door.\n\nTriple T describes Tommy's Tavern + Tap as a \"rustic, industrial tavern and restaurant.\" The menus for its existing locations include a variety of sandwiches, burgers and salads as well as coal-fired pizza and sushi. Tommy's also has an extensive draft beer list.\n\nTio Taco + Tequila Bar pairs a \"exciting, casual-sophisticated atmosphere\" with craft cocktails, a variety of tequilas and foods like homemade guacamole.\n\nJB Dawson's and California Pizza Kitchen were among a handful of restaurants added around the exterior of the mall as part of renovations around a decade ago.

More locations could follow as the company looks to almost double in size over the next three years.\n\nThe planned site is at 601 S. Ridge Ave. near the Westown Kohl's off Middletown Warwick Road. A development plan is making its way through Middletown's approval process having gone to the Planning & Zoning Commission in mid-May before a final Town Council hearing.\n\n\"The family-friendly atmosphere and strong community ties in Middletown felt like a perfect fit for Freddy’s,\" Freddy's Assistant Public Relations Manager Kim Huynh said in a statement.\n\nFreddy's uses a franchise system. The Delaware territory is owned by JRI Hospitality, the company's largest franchisee and one of its earliest. President and CEO Jason Ingermanson said he is aiming to open the Middletown restaurant by the end of next year.\n\nIngermanson said he will evaluate other locations in Delaware once his group can use the results of the Middletown store to develop criteria for the market. JRI Hospitality owns and operates almost 80 Freddy's locations, including the Freddy's nearest to Delaware in Exton, West Chester, Broomall and Brookhaven, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We have a lot more in the pipeline,\" Ingermanson said.\n\nFreddy's signature is its pressed thin and crispy-edged steakburgers cooked to order. The burgers are served with shoestring fries and a special fry sauce. The seasoning blend used on the burgers and fries is also available on the side.\n\nFreddy's also offers patty melts, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken tenders, onion rings and cheese curds. The desert menu features frozen custard, milkshakes, floats and turtle sundaes.\n\nFreddy's was founded in 2002 by brothers Bill and Randy Simon and named for their father. It slowly expanded across the Midwest and now has a presence in the Southeast, the Southwest and Texas. The deepest into the Northeast it's gone is northern New Jersey.\n\nIn 2020, Freddy Simon died at the age of 95.

Oberly\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOver the past 40 years, I’ve prosecuted and overseen the prosecution of scores of gun cases and white-collar cases. In total, many thousands of cases in federal and state court – including some later in my career as a defense attorney.\n\nFrom those cases and what I recall of the Department of Justice’s standards, I’m one of many who have observed the DOJ’s prosecution of the president’s son with increasing disappointment.\n\nLike any Delawarean, I know many parties involved. Special counsel David Weiss was my first assistant (No. 2 in the office) when I was U.S. attorney in Delaware. As a prior three-term attorney general and former state prosecutor in Delaware, I have known President Joe Biden for decades, worked closely with his late son, Beau, and saw Hunter many times.\n\nEven accepting all the government’s allegations as true, it’s hard to understand why it is prosecuting the younger Biden: At the time he purchased a firearm, Biden was a nonviolent, 40-something struggling drug addict with zero criminal history. He proceeded to possess a firearm for 11 days and did not use it for any purpose (let alone in a crime).\n\nIt has been reported that he is charged with a crime that has almost never been prosecuted – an addict without criminal history misrepresenting his addiction on a firearm purchase form.\n\nAt Hunter Biden trial, laptop returns:Trump right about Hunter's 'laptop from hell,' though Biden claimed Russian disinformation\n\nWhy is Hunter Biden being prosecuted? Precedent doesn't explain it.\n\nModern prosecutors’ offices have developed simple guideposts for whether to prosecute gun possession:\n\nWas it used in a crime?\n\nWas the purchaser a felon?\n\nWas the purchaser a suspect in another (typically, violent) crime?\n\nDid the purchaser have a criminal record?\n\nWas the person a danger to the community?\n\nThat is: From all available information, in this time where violent crime is every office’s priority and nonviolent addicts are treated differently than they once were, I cannot conceive of an office spending any resources – let alone five-plus years, countless agents and numerous prosecutors – on a case with similar facts.\n\nTrump hush money case was a sham:Trump was found guilty in a case DA Bragg never should have prosecuted\n\nAs right-wing former Congressman – and former federal prosecutor – Trey Gowdy said last week, “We never prosecuted addicts for lying and buying on federal forms.”\n\nIndeed, the office prosecuting this case – the office I once led – now rarely prosecutes even the most violent gun offenders. Of the thousands of gun charges in Delaware, the U.S. Attorney’s Office prosecutes very few. When viewed against those statistics, the choice to make an example of the younger Biden raises, at a minimum, questions.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland may have missed the mark on fairness\n\nThe tax case, by contrast, raises questions for a different reason: The DOJ has a long history of engaging with nonviolent, middle-age men who fail to pay taxes – even those connected to politicians and presidents. As has been extensively reported, however, that engagement almost never results in criminal charges when the tax avoider pays what is owed.\n\nRoger Stone owed nearly $2 million in taxes and this same DOJ pursued that civilly, not via criminal charges. Rudy Giuliani owes $550,000 in taxes, and this DOJ has not charged him. Hunter Biden's lawyers said he repaid the back taxes, and he faces multiple felony charges?\n\nAs former Attorney General Eric Holder observed, this is not the type of case that the DOJ ever prosecutes.\n\nThe purpose of prosecutorial discretion is to make the law work for its intended purpose. Addicts and nonaddicts alike make mistakes every day; no office has the ability or desire to prosecute each infraction. And certainly no office should chase felony convictions and jail time in a misguided effort to appease either side in Congress.\n\nOn the federal side, this is where the attorney general’s guidance is important. Here, he has strained to stay far away from the case. I do not know his motives. But I fear his desire to tell investigating Republicans that he did not interfere has caused the pendulum to swing so far that this particular defendant is being targeted in a way that no other individual would – and in so doing, tarnishing the DOJ and its career employees’ reputations.\n\nIn his first address as attorney general in March 2021, Merrick Garland told the DOJ’s 115,000 employees, “The only way we can succeed and retain the trust of the American people is to adhere to the norms that have become part of the DNA of every Justice Department employee since Edward Levi’s stint as the first post-Watergate attorney general. ...\n\n\"Those norms require that like cases be treated alike. That there not be one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans; one rule for friends and another for foes; one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless; one rule for the rich and another for the poor; or different rules depending upon one's race or ethnicity.”\n\nAn eloquent and admirable standard, one that the attorney general has upheld through three tumultuous years – except as it relates to one defendant.\n\nCharles M.

The Anti-Defamation League Philadelphia said it saw a spike in the number of antisemitic incidents in Delaware.\n\nThe group, which has been tracking antisemitic incident since 1979, said it saw 13 across the state – four times as many as the previous year and more than double the previous high of the decade.\n\n\"The total number may seem small but in the context of where the numbers have been over the last decade and longer it was actually a very troubling sign,\" said Jeremy Bannett, ADL Philadelphia's associate regional director, which covers Delaware. \"It's showing that these incidents are on the rise and it's something that we need to monitor.\"\n\nThere were 15 reported hate crime incidents reported in Delaware in 2016, the most recent numbers provided by the FBI. This tied with 2011, which saw a drop of such incidents from 2010 which had 20 hate crimes reported.\n\nDelaware's most commonly reported hate crime in 2016 was motivated by race, ethnicity or ancestry – there were 12 such incidents. Three hate crimes were related to religion, while one was because of sexual orientation.\n\nLast year's figures are expected to be released next month.\n\nAntisemitism\n\nThe Siegel Jewish Community Center received multiple bomb threats. A court in Israel convicted Michael Ron David Kadar for making a string of bomb threats to Jewish community centers around the world, including the one in Talleyville. The U.S. Justice Department has filed hate crime charges against 19-year-old Kadar.\n\nSome of last year's incidents included a swastika spray painted across the hood of a car parked in Wilmington. A profane insult to \"Obama\" covered the front passenger window near the N-word. On the roof, one word: \"Trump.\"\n\nGerard Medvec, 64, of Delaware City, was charged with threatening his neighbors because he believed they were Muslims. Medvec was charged with terroristic threatening in association with a hate crime.\n\nHate crimes reported in Delaware are few, but when they occur it places a strain on a community.\n\n\"When there are even low-key acts of hatred against others, it represents a breakdown in civil society and in how we treat other people,\" said Jennifer Steinberg co-chair the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of Delaware.\n\nSteinberg said it is important to let the public know when acts of hatred occur. It doesn't matter how small.\n\n\"Anything that really prohibits you from feeling you can speak openly, is a problem for society in general,\" she said. \"It also prevents us from having an important conversation that we need to have.\"\n\nThe KKK\n\nWhile the Ku Klux Klan is active in Delaware, the organization didn't really grow deep roots to grab the attention of such hate group monitors as the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nThe center instead identifies two other organizations has being hate groups: ACT for America, an anti-Muslim group based in Bear; and the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist organization based in Wilmington.\n\nThe Klan never gained a real foothold in post-Civil War Delaware, when \"night riders\" terrorized black people in the former Confederate states. Although Delaware was a slave state that voted against Abraham Lincoln in both his presidential races, it did not secede from the Union.\n\nThat meant, unlike Confederate states, Delaware was not subjected to Reconstruction and the white backlash that sparked the birth of the Klan in 1866 in Pulaski, Tennessee.\n\nDelaware Democrats, proudly billing themselves as \"the white man's party,\" ruled the state in the postwar years – and they quickly began passing laws that severely limited the activities of its black population.\n\nWith black residents denied any meaningful political or economic clout, whites saw no need for a Ku Klux Klan here.\n\nAlthough modern Delawareans tend to think of hate groups in terms of race, some of the earliest clashes in Delaware were between settlers of English and Scots-Irish origin.\n\nRace became the primary concern of white Delawareans in the 1830s, after Nat Turner's slave rebellion in Virginia rocked slave-holding states and prompted legislation that curtailed even the rights of free blacks.\n\nLegislators built on those statutes in the Civil War postwar years, and it wasn't until the 1920s that the Klan became somewhat of a force in Delaware.\n\nIn 1915, the Klan was reborn as a \"mystic, social, patriotic\" group dedicated to protecting white womanhood and white supremacy. It later included Jews, Catholics, foreigners and organized labor on its list of undesirables.\n\nIn 1922, two Klan units formed in Newport, and its rolls included members from the Newport, Marshallton, Five Points and Christiana school boards. A year later, Newport Klansmen and local Catholics engaged in a brawl when the Klan tried to burn a cross in New Castle.\n\nAlso in 1923, the Elk Klan Klavern formed in Childs, Maryland, northeast of Elkton. Cecil County remained a Klan stronghold for decades.\n\nWhite People's movement\n\nWith World War II looming, the Klan fell into disrepute nationally and locally when it was linked to fascist and pro-German groups.\n\nIt reappeared in the 1950s and 1960s, after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools.\n\nBut in Delaware, it wasn't the Klan that took up the segregationist cause: It was the National Association for the Advancement of White People, led by a rabble-rousing Floridian named Bryant Bowles.\n\nFour months after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, Bowles helped engineer one of the more shameful episodes of Delaware's troubled racial past, calling massive rallies in September 1954 to protest the admission of 11 black 10th-graders to the all-white Milford High School.\n\nBowles was fond of incendiary rhetoric, and he stirred the all-white crowds by holding his 3-year-old daughter over his head and vowing that she \"never would attend school with Negroes as long as there is gunpowder to burn – and gunpowder will burn.\"\n\nBut gunpowder did not burn, at least not in Delaware.

A month after Jethani dropped off his kids for their freshman year in October 2022, there was a fatal shooting near their dorm.\n\n“This was a real rude awakening,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY's Crimes on Campus tool for detailed information. Zoom in on the map below to search crimes on more than 10,000 college and university campuses. Don't see a map? Click here.\n\nJethani and other parents were concerned that crime across the city of Berkeley seemed on the rise. A February shooting scared some parents, too. No one was injured and a suspect was reportedly taken into custody.\n\nHiring private security officers didn't sit well with Berkeley administrators. In a statement to USA TODAY, spokesperson Janet Gilmore said money intended to keep Berkeley students safe would best be spent supporting the school’s police force.\n\n“Hiring private security raises a number of concerns, including the training and experience of individuals hired by such firms,” Gilmore said.\n\nCampus crime rebounds to pre-pandemic levels\n\nThe number of crimes reported by college campuses across the country rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, government data shows.\n\nCrime reported from nearly 6,000 institutions rose about 8% from 2019, even though enrollments dipped during that timeframe. The jump in offenses between 2019 and 2022 coincided with students’ post-pandemic return en masse to campuses. Compared with year-over-year changes before 2019, the recent jump represents the largest increase since post-secondary institutions that receive federal funding began reporting campus safety statistics.\n\nExperts see little reason to worry and say the numbers are largely consistent with what colleges have been experiencing since 2013, according to S. Daniel Carter, president of the consulting firm Safety Advisors for Educational Campuses.\n\nFollowing a steady decline starting around 2006, the number of crimes reported by colleges and universities remained pretty stagnant over the past decade, according to government data. Yet when foot traffic on and around campuses diminished in 2020 after classes went online during the pandemic, crime dropped precipitously in 2020. In the years since it has inched up again.\n\nThe recent increase was mostly driven by a surge in reported motor vehicle theft, which more than doubled from 2019 and accounted for more than a quarter of offenses in 2022. Carter was skeptical of that increase, saying it could be traced to schools changing their reporting requirements to comply with federal law.\n\n“There has been some work done to increase awareness that scooters and golf carts are motor vehicles – that could be a factor,” he said.\n\nGovernment data is not yet available for 2023, so these numbers don’t account for the turmoil on college campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. Recent surveys show many Muslim and Jewish students reported feeling unsafe on campus since the Oct. 7 attacks, which prompted massive campus clashes and protests, as well as surges in Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents.\n\nThe reported numbers from 2022 include offenses that occurred on and off campus, including on university properties located elsewhere; offenses that occurred on public property adjacent to campuses, and a small number of offenses reported to institutions by local police.\n\nRenewed push to encourage students to report crimes\n\nColleges and universities that receive federal funding must compile statistics about crimes that occur on or near campus under the Clery Act. The federal law, passed in 1990, was named after 20-year-old Jeanne Clery, a student whose rape and murder at her dorm at Lehigh University drew national attention.\n\nThe tension colleges contend with in simultaneously trying to encourage students to report crimes and keep numbers down was on full display during a recent scandal at Liberty University, a private Evangelical university in Virginia.\n\nThe federal government concluded last year that the school created a culture of dissuading victims of sexual assault from reporting what happened to them, according to a preliminary report obtained by USA TODAY. Then, in March, the Education Department slapped the school with a $14 million fine and ordered officials to pay an additional $2 million for “on-campus safety improvements and compliance enhancements.” In a written statement in March, Dondi E. Costin, Liberty’s president, said the school sincerely regretted the errors.\n\nThe scandal shed light on the consequences schools face if they don’t fully comply with the law, said Abigail Boyer, the associate executive director of the Clery Center, which tracks campus safety trends.\n\n“Ultimately, we want campuses to create a culture in which students are comfortable about reporting,” she said.\n\nClery Act figures are self-reported, and the Department of Education doesn’t verify them independently. However, the agency conducts periodic reviews of Clery Act compliance. Over the past 15 years, the agency has evaluated at least 110 universities. Dozens of those cases have led to fines.\n\nDo stolen scooters and e-bikes explain the apparent crime surge?\n\nThe Clery Act requires schools to report “motor vehicle thefts,\" but the statute doesn’t only include cars – scooters, electric bicycles and golf carts fall into the same category.\n\nSeveral schools said the surge in crime on or near their campuses in 2022 could be attributed to their revised reporting of scooter, electric bike and golf cart theft. In 2022, Grand Canyon University in Arizona began classifying thefts of skateboards, scooters and bikes under the umbrella of \"motor vehicle theft.\"\n\nSpokesperson Bob Romantic said the “overwhelming majority” of the school's additional criminal offenses in 2022 were due to that change.\n\n“Beyond that,” he said, “we saw slight increases in some other offenses due mostly to the rapid growth of our campus population, increased crime in the Phoenix area, and the fact that we were still coming out of COVID.”\n\nDavid Kelly, spokesperson for the University of Colorado, Denver-Anschutz Medical, said the school has taken steps to combat a jump in motor vehicle thefts, installing more security cameras and deploying officers to monitor parking lots and garages.\n\nIt could be that there are more of these vehicles on campuses as well, according to Bethanie Glover, a spokesperson for the University of Virginia.\n\n“The presence of motor scooters on (grounds) and across the country has increased dramatically, and reports of theft have increased along with them,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2016/09/07/heroin-dover-de-crime-statistics-violent-crime/89927806/", "title": "Big-city crime seeping into Dover", "text": "Jerry Smith\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe Rev. Eric Cooper was walking along New Street near downtown Dover last week when he witnessed a group of young men selling drugs out in the open.\n\nThe pastor at Bible Church of God Delaware said that scene plays out regularly on New Street and the surrounding area he calls \"ground zero\" of a city that has seen an unprecedented increase in crime.\n\n“The last two, three, four years, heroin has come to Dover and crime has escalated,” said Cooper, who believes not as many murders were taking place in the late 1990s because the drug scene wasn’t as high stakes as it is today. “There have been more shootings, more burglaries and an increase in other violent crimes since heroin has become the drug of choice in Dover.”\n\nCity crime statistics back up Cooper’s assessment; City Council recently considered buying ShotSpotter, a technology usually reserved for much bigger cities.\n\nDover was looking at the gunshot detection and location service as a way to combat an increase in gun violence. On Aug. 18, 25-year-old Emmitt Brown was shot in the torso and later died in a Dover hospital, becoming the city’s first homicide victim in 2016.\n\nThe shooting was the third in the month of August in Dover and the ninth in 2016. In 2015, Dover saw a record seven homicides.\n\nOther crimes have followed suit. A Dover Police Department report recently sent to City Council showed robberies have increased 150 percent (from 14 to 35) in the first six months of 2016 compared with 2015. Assaults have increased 21 percent (from 517 to 625); burglaries, 62 percent (from 37 to 60); and weapons law violations, 73 percent (from 55 to 95).\n\n“There is obvious concern in certain areas as we continue to address crime in the city,” said Cpl. Mark Hoffman, the department’s public information officer. “While we are pleased with the decrease in some categories (motor vehicle theft and shoplifting), we are seeing increases in assault and burglary cases, as well as a significant increase in robberies. We stand firm in our belief that the majority of these cases can be tied to the illegal drug trade, specifically the rise in heroin use.”\n\nSTORY: Dover won't be using ShotSpotter\n\nSTORY: Dover man held in city's first homicide of 2016\n\nThe Dover Police Department’s 2015 Annual Report shows that heroin use has increased at a high rate in Dover. The Drugs, Vice and Organized Crime Section seized 1,700 grams of heroin in 2015, an 871 percent increase over 2014.\n\nHoffman said a number of initiatives have been put in place to try to reverse the crime trends. He also believes patrol shifts being at or near full staffing for the first time in several years will show positive results.\n\nHe said that community policing and community outreach events, increasing the number of detectives in the Criminal Investigations Unit and Street Crimes Unit, continuing the Police Athletic League and other educational programs, as well as working with other agencies such as Delaware Probation and Parole to expand drug enforcement and violent crime enforcement are steps in the right direction.\n\n“Our downtown surveillance cameras have also been excellent in obtaining evidence in solving crimes,” Hoffmann said.\n\nThe state has offered funding. In December 2015, the Delaware Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, during a rare out-of-session meeting, awarded $580,000 to address crime. The funding comes from a financial settlement with Bank of America related to a 2008 financial crisis and is part of a broader effort by lawmakers to stem violence in Delaware.\n\n“We are utilizing the money given to us at the request of AG Matt Denn for downtown foot patrols several days a week to combat crime and build community relations,” Hoffmann said.\n\nMore intervention needed\n\nCooper and other leaders in the black community believe efforts in community policing have helped some but think those programs don’t get to the heart of the matter. Helping those ensconced in a life of crime break out is the answer, according to Cooper.\n\n“When you don’t give people a reason to break the habit, it becomes a revolving door,” he said. “A lot of young men and women have been in jail so much, that is all they know. We have to stop them from being put in prison and when they come out, give them the resources to keep them out.”\n\nCooper has used a two-pronged approach. One comes from his standing as an ordained minister, while the other comes from his role as a community leader. Both require getting out and coming face-to-face with those who are either currently breaking the law, or those who are most at risk of falling into a life of crime.\n\n“We are at the point in our ministry that the church has to come outside of the walls to change this,” Cooper said. “I believe that after a person gives his life over to Jesus, he will find that the community has resources to help him become a productive citizen. We have to get out there and make them see they are somebody. We may not change the world, but if we can help some of them change their lifestyle, then we can definitely make our community better.”\n\nDover City Council member Roy Sudler Jr. agrees, saying the biggest cause of the increase in crime is a lack of recreational programs and activities and stronger support services for families.\n\n\"We need to focus on mentor and job-seeking programs that will enrich one’s abilities and life skills,\" he said in an email. \"Although I agree with the mayor of Dover’s statement that Dover is no Wilmington, I’m concerned that if we do not discover a long-term solution to mitigate criminal activity here, our minimized crime statistics will maximize overnight. I believe that we need to get serious and robust with eradicating criminal enterprises throughout the city of Dover.\"\n\nDonell Fears, a barber apprentice for Janaid's Salon for Men on West Loockerman Street, had his own idea about why crime is on the rise and what could be done to stop the upward trend.\n\nFears believes the lack of employment is why so many young kids turn to drugs and crime. He knows when you have financial hardships like many of the young people in the inner city do, most of them have no other recourse.\n\n\"I would like to see the city come together with the community to create some type of job and/or after-school program to help those young people in need,\" said Fears, who has been with Janaid's for five years. \"We can talk to them and mentor them all day long, but at the end of the day, what have we given them? False hope.\"\n\nSherie Vaughn says she grew up in Dover and has seen crime trends change over time. The 90-year-old owner of Needful Things Consignment Shop on West Loockerman Street says she has been around so long, she is insulated from the drugs and crime just a couple of blocks away.\n\n\"It doesn't concern me personally because I know most of the [business owners and residents] around here and they are very protective,\" she said. \"They come in and check on me from time to time, so I feel safe.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean Vaughn is blind to what is going on in the neighborhood around her. She owns the building she is in and others on Loockerman and has had the business more than 25 years. She doesn't necessarily see the crime as being worse, just different.\n\n\"As a child, we never locked our doors or our cars,\" she said. \"We've become a city instead of a small town and that changes things.\"\n\nVaughn said she has seen the city react to the increased crime in the area and try to keep it in check. One example, she said, is when the city tore down houses on New Street that had become eyesores and known for drug activity and have looked to renovate some of the neighborhoods.\n\n\"Instead of drug dealers, they want homeowners,\" she said. \"When people are proud of their community, the worst crime seems to go away. That's what needs to happen in this neighborhood.\"\n\nMary-Beth Johnson, property manager for House of Pride, is working in the inner-city to provide help to those individuals who need help getting back on their feet. She says HOP has been rehabilitating homes in the area many call ground zero for crime in Dover and trying to get the community interested.\n\n\"We're trying our best, but it's individuals who come down [from Wilmington] to do their business,\" Johnson said. \"More than 95 percent of the people you see here don't live here. It's difficult to get a sense of community.\"\n\nContact Jerry Smith at (302) 463-3344 or follow him on Twitter @JerrySmithTNJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/11/verizon-strike-becomes-increasingly-bitter/84228894/", "title": "Verizon strike becomes increasingly bitter", "text": "Jeff Mordock\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe tense standoff between Verizon and its striking workers has turned increasingly bitter in Delaware and along the East Coast.\n\nVerizon has alleged picketers have cut cable and phone lines and harassed replacement technicians.\n\nUnion leaders charge the cut lines are the result of Verizon using untrained workers and the company has misrepresented these incidents to curry public favor.\n\nBoth sides are refusing to back away from their rhetoric.\n\n\"This is a particularly nasty and personal strike,\" said Louis Moffa, Jr., a labor and employment lawyer who teaches at the University of Delaware. \"It is not typical.\"\n\nNearly 40,000 Verizon landline and cable workers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states — including Delaware — went on strike last month. The employees, represented by Communications Workers of America Locals 13100 and 13101, have alleged Verizon is outsourcing jobs and cutting benefits. Workers have picketed outside Verizon call centers and retail locations throughout Delaware.\n\nVerizon said it has offered a wage increase of 7.5 percent and will continue to match employee retirement saving contributions and increase pensions over three years.\n\nAs the strike, which began on April 13, enters a second month, the rancor on both sides has increased with no end in sight. Some issues have impacted businesses, while others have required police intervention.\n\nTuesday, Delaware State Police said a Verizon picketer rear ended a replacement worker's car in a three-vehicle crash northbound on I-95 near Harvey Road in Wilmington. The female contractor's car ended up in a ditch as a result of the accident. Three people were transported to Wilmington and Christiana Hospital for non-life threatening injuries, according to Master Cpl. Jeffrey Hale. The protester was cited for an improper lane change.\n\nSTORY: Police - Crash involved Verizon contractor, protester\n\nSTORY: Verizon strike impacts Delaware businesses\n\nVerizon spokesman Richard Young claimed the female contractor was targeted by picketers who deliberately followed her. He said the picketer engaged in \"outrageous and intolerable behavior.\"\n\nBeth Marvel, executive vice president of CWA 1301, claimed the contractor, not the picketer, is responsible for the crash. Marvel claimed the woman intentionally stopped her car while driving along the busy highway causing the accident.\n\n\"Stopping in the middle of I-95 is aggressive driving,\" Marvel said. \"If she really feared for her safety, she would have pulled over called 911. Whether stopping was intentional or not, she was the cause of the accident, not our member.\"\n\nSgt. Gerald Bryda of the Newark Police Department confirmed a Verizon contractor reported being followed by a car for over an hour as he traveled to assignments. Bryda said the department confirmed a union member followed the contractor, but no arrests were made because a crime was not committed.\n\nMarvel said union members are permitted under law to follow contractors and protest in front their vehicles at locations where they are working, including private residences. Moffa agreed the law extends such protections as long as the picketers do not block traffic or expand their protest beyond where the vehicle is parked.\n\n\"It is technically legal,\" Moffa said. \"But if you have a private property you have more rights than a public business. They cannot trespass on your property.\"\n\nYoung said Verizon offers contract employees security escorts to take them to job sites.\n\nThe animosity between the two sides is particularly harsh over a rash of damaged fiber optic cable boxes throughout Delaware. So far, seven instances of damaged fiber optic lines have occurred in northern New Castle County, according to Sgt. Tom Jackson of the New Castle County Police Department.\n\nJackson said the incidents, which have largely occurred in Hockessin and Newark, are actively under investigation, but police have not yet determined it was sabotage. The damage is estimated to be around $1,500 per location, he said.\n\nIf it is determined the lines were cut deliberately, the responsible party could be charged with a Class G felony because they interfered with public communication, Jackson said.\n\nYoung said that, on average, Verizon has about five incidents of wire cutting along the East Coast per year. Since the strike, the telecommunications giant has had 160 reports of cut wires along the coast.\n\n\"It is deliberate acts by criminals who are putting the lives of our consumers in danger,\" he said. \"One of our consumers could lose the ability to call 911.\"\n\nMarvel said none of her members are committing sabotage against Verizon. She blamed the damage on a combination of natural deterioration that occurs over time and the use of replacement workers, whom she said do not have the training to adequately repair the equipment.\n\n\"I don't know who is behind it,\" she said. \"I do know before the strike it was trained technicians fixing the box and after the strike it was untrained technicians who don't have a clue.\"\n\nYoung called Marvel's argument, \"ridiculous and nonsensical.\"\n\nMoffa said the longer the strike continues, the worse he expects both sides' rhetoric to become.\n\n\"There will come a point where people won't tolerate from either side acts that tend to touch people personally or get law enforcement involved,\" he said. \"I certainly hope it doesn't come to that.\"\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect new information on the traffic accident. The information is based on a second statement released late Thursday by the Delaware State Police.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2024/01/18/delaware-hate-crime-numbers-have-more-than-doubled-since-2020/72196186007/", "title": "Delaware hate crime numbers have more than doubled since 2020", "text": "The number of hate crimes reported in Delaware has more than doubled since 2020, according to newly released data from the state Department of Justice.\n\nIn 2020, the year of COVID-19 and George Floyd, there were 13 hate crime incidents reported to Delaware law enforcement, according to Department of Justice spokesman Mat Marshall. Fifteen hate crimes were reported in 2021, but in 2022, the number jumped to 29. The number was nearly the same in 2023 at 28.\n\nHate crime incidents are on the rise not just in Delaware but nationwide. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were 11,613 hate crimes reported in 2022 (the most recently available data), compared with 10,875 in 2021 and 9,944 in 2020.\n\nHowever, the actual numbers are likely much higher. An estimated average of 250,000 hate crimes were committed annually between 2004 and 2015 in the United States, according to the FBI, the majority of which were not reported to law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn addition, there’s no national reporting mandate, according to Brian Levin, the founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. Those agencies that do report to the FBI may have different definitions of what constitutes a hate crime, Levin said, while some states, such as South Carolina, don’t even have hate crime laws.\n\nThe FBI defines a hate crime as “crimes committed on the basis of the victim’s perceived or actual race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.” Delaware’s hate crime law, updated in 2022, covers all that and then some, expressly including interference with First Amendment rights.\n\nAt an early January meeting of the Sussex-based Speak Out Against Hate, Attorney General Kathleen Jennings called Delaware’s hate crime law “probably the strongest hate crime statute in the country.”\n\n“It’s extremely broad and powerful, but only ... if it is used,” she said.\n\nRelated:Why this Jewish professor at UD was 'saddened' but not surprised to find swastika on door\n\nJennings urged anyone who believes they may have been the victim of a hate crime to reach out to police.\n\n\"We encourage people to report it,\" she said. \"Even if doesn't amount to a hate crime, it is a biased incident, and we need to know about that, too, because we learn from it.\"\n\nHate crimes in Delaware vs. nationwide\n\nNationwide, hate crimes reported to police in America’s 10 largest cities last year rose 13%, according to preliminary data collected by Levin. It was a record year, in part due to a record surge of anti-Jewish cases, Levin said.\n\nIn Delaware, hate crimes reported over the past few years “overwhelmingly tended to be racial or religious in nature,” Marshall said. He credits, in part, “greater awareness and training around the state’s hate crime laws” for the rise in hate crime numbers, but said \"the overall occurrence of hate crimes is also likely increasing.”\n\nMarshall provided the following list of hate crimes, all reported to Delaware law enforcement in 2023.\n\nJan. 28, Wilmington, investigated by Delaware State Police.

Two suspects threatened to blow up a business and kill employees while yelling racial slurs over an incorrect food order.\n\nA pledge to Speak Out Against Hate\n\nSpeak Out Against Hate is an offshoot of the Southern Delaware Alliance For Racial Justice. Their nonprofit status is pending, according to president Patty Maloney.\n\nCo-founder Peter Schott explained why the group formed last year.\n\n“There had been a few hate-related incidents and people started talking about how there was a failure to respond to them,” Schott said. “We’ve got to make sure elected and appointed officials respond when they hear these things.”\n\nThe hate-related incidents Schott was referring to include when, in 2020, \"TRUMP\" was burned into alliance founder Charlotte King's Lewes yard, likely with weed killer. Then there was the incident with Allan and Leslie Slan in Rehoboth, around Christmas 2022, in which someone strewed a newspaper across their lawn and neatly placed the obituary of a Jewish person, marked with the Star of David, next to a sign that said \"Happy Hanukkah, Love and Light.\"\n\n\"We realized: This is happening here,\" Maloney said. \"We're trying to make sure hate doesn't grow here, that people want to come here and feel safe.\"\n\nSpeak Out Against Hate has five action groups, including faith, businesses, police, youth and schools and elected officials, and the leaders of each group reported on their progress at January's meeting.\n\nRelated:Antisemitism almost quadrupled in Delaware last year. What it means for the First State\n\nNancy Clack leads the elected officials' action group and said their first order of business was to ask all Sussex County legislators and mayors to sign a pledge to speak out against hate.\n\nThe pledge states: \"There is no place for hate in Sussex County or the State of Delaware. Therefore I (name, office, district or town) pledge to speak out against hate publicly and to support legislation that is designed to hold individuals and other entities who express hate accountable for acts defined as a hate crime.\"\n\nAfter two rounds of attempts to contact Sussex's 25 mayors, five senators and nine of 10 representatives (Ruth Briggs King had announced her intent to vacate her seat and Valerie Jones Giltner had not yet been elected), only one person, Mayor John Collier of Milton, has signed the pledge.\n\n\"In my opinion, there is nothing radical about that statement,\" Clack said. \"Signing this pledge is not a political opportunity. It's what's right to do.\"\n\nShannon Marvel McNaught reports on Sussex County and beyond.

That's where additional resources are deployed.\n\nSTORY: Twenty years after Capano arrest, juror breaks silence\n\nSuperintendent of the Delaware State Police Col. Nathaniel McQueen Jr. believes the new practice will reduce crime, improve traffic safety and strengthen community partnerships by leveraging technology.\n\nUp and down the state, McQueen has seen the model that holds Troop commanders and troopers alike accountable yield results.\n\n\"To date, the S.P.E.A.R. program is working effectively in all three counties,\" Col. McQueen said. \"Future success of the S.P.E.A.R. program will require it to become institutionalized into the daily operations of the Delaware State Police, similar to answering 911 calls.\"\n\nIn Sussex County, Oak Orchard is a target, where crime had been on the rise the better part of the last decade until DSP initiated the S.P.E.A.R. model there.\n\nCrime drivers in that area are burglaries, thefts and robberies, most of which are tied to drugs. DSP looked at data the past three years and found an inordinate amount of these crimes occurring, with the majority being burglaries and thefts from vehicles in the Oak Orchard area.\n\nTrooper Garcia believes his presence in that hotspot and the community outreach efforts made by himself and other troopers has paid dividends in this community nestled against the Indian River.\n\n\"Because we have had more of a police presence in this area, crime has gone down,\" said Garcia, the Delaware State Police 2016 Trooper of the Year. \"Not only have we successfully targeted certain crimes in certain areas, we've gained the community's trust.\"\n\nThe crime stats tell a similar story.\n\nSince 2015, complaints in Oak Orchard have been reduced almost in half, from 2,491 complaints in 2015 to 1,508 in 2016 and then 1,225 year-to-date in 2017.\n\nThere were 2,276 criminal incidents reported in Oak Orchard since Jan. 1, 2015, of which 57 percent were mainly non-criminal offenses (disorderly conduct, family offense, trespassing, local fugitive, sudden death investigations).\n\nA quarter (25 percent) of the Oak Orchard criminal incidents were core crimes (aggravated assault, burglary, drug offense, homicide, robbery, rape, shoplifting, theft and vehicle theft).\n\nSTORY: S.P.E.A.R. model reduces crime in Dover's Alder Park\n\nSTORY: Middletown looks for money to attract downtown investors\n\nSince the inception of S.P.E.A.R., the Oak Orchard area has experienced a 12.8 percent decrease in the number of incidents involving core crimes in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. Data from January-September in 2017 showed that lower level of core crime incidents continuing.\n\n\"When we started S.P.E.A.R., we were handling as a troop about 200 complaints a month in Oak Orchard, which included everything from a domestic, shoplifting, theft, burglary, we were handling it,\" said Troop 4 Commander Capt. Rodney Layfield. \"When we started S.P.E.A.R. ... within about a year, and it has continued since, we have almost cut crime in half down there.\"\n\nLayfield said that because his troopers are now aggressively targeting that area, they are also reporting more criminal complaints, which in turn continues to reduce the level of crime and makes the success even greater.\n\nWhile it has been a progressive downturn, Layfield said there are still spikes in the summer months. He said that happens more in Long Neck, but Oak Orchard has a summer population that comes down from other areas which he says increases the workload and crime across the board.\n\n\"We have a larger population, which means the crime complaints you handle will go up,\" he said. \"We've seen great success in targeting Oak Orchard in this manner. We have a large percentage of our crime committed by a small percentage of the public and we are able to target these people.\"\n\nLayfield said the success has come from having troopers in the right area at the right time. He said that there are different shifts held accountable, but in the big picture of the Troop, the hotspot areas are saturated about four hours a day.\n\n\"We don't want every trooper in Oak Orchard 24/7 because it's a hotspot,\" he said. \"We'll take one encumbered resource (trooper) and put them in the area for that specific time. We’re going to solve crimes by troopers taking the extra step. It's just smarter policing.\"\n\nS.P.E.A.R. policing model\n\nState Police Enhanced Analytic Response (S.P.E.A.R.) essentially says we are using evidence-based procedures to respond to crime and help solve those problems that are occurring in the communities, said Capt. William Crotty, the man in charge of implementing the program DSP-wide.\n\nCrotty said the model uses hotspot analysis, which is date, time-of-day, day-of-week frequency for particular problems.\n\nCore crime management also is used to determine the highest crimes in a certain hotspot and crimes that are most important to that community.\n\nIn addition, micro-time hotspots, or trends, are looked at to determine where to deploy DSP resources (troopers).\n\n\"These pillars become priorities for resources,\" Crotty said. \"Commanders have to make sure they have enough resources in place to cover all the aspects. Our goal is to stop trends as early as possible.\"\n\nCrotty likens hotspots to a similar data-driven model in professional baseball. He said it is a proven model in Delaware.\n\n\"If you are a fan of the movie 'Moneyball' it's like playing the shift in baseball,\" he said. \"A question every day is are we patrolling the areas or communities that need it the most? And when we are in there, are we participating in behaviors that optimize solving the problem? That’s what we focus on.\"\n\nLayfield sees the model work every day. He said in the past, he would have troopers come into work and if there was something pressing they would be given direction. But he said there was a percentage of the time where they would leave the Troop and decide then and there if they should go left or right.\n\nNow, he said they are given a specific mission based on the data and the hotspots where they are needed.\n\n\"If they are in a certain sector, they know where to target,\" Layfield said.\n\nThe Troop 4 captain said that when his troopers respond to a car burglary scene, for example, they aren’t just asking an owner of that vehicle if they want the vehicle processed. That is no longer acceptable, he said. They are held accountable for doing more.\n\nLayfield said troopers are processing vehicles and entering information into databases to search for different stolen items and to see if there are similarities to other break-ins.\n\n\"We want our troopers to do more than just show up and say you have a really nice car and you may not want dust thrown all over it to be processed because you just lost $1.50 in change,\" he said. \"That used to be a good answer. But the process now is we’re going to dust your vehicle for prints because they might have taken a $1.50 from you, but three houses down they took a GPS, they took a lady’s pocketbook that has all of her credit cards and important information. So if they happen the same night, those fingerprints from your car might lead to the person who broke into the other cars as well.\"\n\nLayfied said his troopers are doing more canvassing of crime areas and knocking on doors as well.\n\nHe said you’d be amazed at how helpful canvassing an area can be. For instance, somebody might just say he has a deer camera in his yard and maybe it picked something up that would help solve the crime. That just happened recently in Dagsboro.\n\n\"If troopers weren't canvassing, they wouldn't have gained that information that solved the crime,\" Layfield said.\n\nTraffic hotspots, too\n\nLayfield said that if you live in Sussex County, you've seen a trooper sitting at the cemetery between Millsboro and Georgetown on U.S. 13 because that stretch of the highway is a traffic hotspot.\n\nIt means there has been an inordinate number of accidents, so the DSP targets that area based on data and accident trends.\n\n\"We’ve helped correct it with DelDOT by putting a light at the speedway to try to diminish the number of accidents, but we also target that area,\" Layfield said. \"When it is congested we have a lot of accidents.\"\n\nLayfield said there is a specific time that troopers are out there and wherever he goes in Sussex County and asks people if they see troopers in that area, they all nod their heads because they know not to speed between Millsboro and Georgetown.\n\nAnother traffic hotspot is Route 24, east of Millsboro, which ties into Long Neck and Oak Orchard, Layfield said.\n\n\"So our criminal hotspot also has a little bit of a tie to our traffic hotspot,\" he said.\n\nRight now, Layfield said there is a statewide goal to reduce traffic collisions, as well as clamping down on drunk driving.\n\n\"We have a DUI hotspot where we are having a lot of related accidents and we try to put troopers in that area to target DUIs with additional enforcement,\" he said.\n\nMany of the accidents involve people who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Out of the 119 deaths in Delaware related to fatal crashes in 2016, 69 were operators of the vehicles. Out of those 69, 36 were under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Out of 36, 14 were under alcohol alone, while 17 had marijuana in their system.\n\n\"The most prevalent drug of all of the fatal operators was marijuana,\" Layfield said. \"Intoxicated drivers from substance abuse is huge.\"\n\nCommunity outreach\n\nOne of the final steps in the State Police Enhanced Analytic Response model is community outreach.\n\nTrooper Garcia has made inroads in the Oak Orchard area by getting out of his vehicle and talking to residents and assuring them DSP is paying attention to crime in the area.\n\n\"I look to have a positive interaction with the community or outside of residences and that is building trust,\" he said. \"I don't want to just drive by people. If they are out, I normally stop and engage with them.\"\n\nGarcia said that recently, community resource officers and troopers are going out into the communities to attend events to strengthen that community tie.\n\nIt appears to be working.\n\nMillie Charnick, vice president of operations of Boys and Girls Club of Delaware, said that the partnership with the Delaware State Police in the Oak Orchard area is helping the community gain trust and feel more comfortable with the police presence.\n\nShe said troopers often attend community events, volunteer as a judge for the club's Junior Youth of the Year event, provide fingerprinting opportunities, and also led a discussion recently about bullying prevention with the youth who attend the club.\n\nDSP also has made special arrangements for the K-9 unit, helicopter, and the mounted unit to attend the Boys and Girls Club community days.\n\n\"The Delaware State Police are a great asset to the entire community because they are visible and understanding to issues,\" Charnick said.\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

Cities see large increases in carjackings ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCarjackings have risen dramatically over the past two years in some of America’s biggest cities.\n\nJust outside Chicago, a state senator’s car and other valuables were taken at gunpoint in December, and a group of children, one just 10 years old, carjacked more than a dozen people. A rideshare driver being carjacked shot his attackers earlier this month in Philadelphia. Last March, a 12-year-old in Washington, DC was arrested and charged with four counts of armed carjacking.\n\n“The majority of it is young joyriders. They’re not keeping the cars. They’re jacking cars to commit another crime, typically more serious robberies or shootings, or joyriding around for the sake of social media purpose and street cred,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “It’s a disturbing trend.”\n\nComprehensive national data isn’t available because the FBI’s crime reporting system doesn’t track carjackings. But large cities that track the crime reported increases in 2020 and 2021, especially as the pandemic took hold of the country.\n\nThe number of carjackings quadrupled in New York City over the last four years, according to data released by the NYPD. The city recorded more than 500 carjackings in 2021, up from 328 in 2020, 132 in 2019, and 112 in 2018.\n\nCarjackings in Philadelphia nearly quadrupled between 2015 and 2021, according to figures released by the city’s police department. They recorded more than 800 last year, up from about 170 in 2015.\n\nIn New Orleans, there were 281 carjackings last year, up from 105 in 2018, the earliest year of available data. The city has also seen a string of carjackings this year, with NOPD reporting 39 as of January 21.\n\nMore than 1,800 carjackings were reported in Chicago last year, the most of any large city, according to data released by police departments to CNN. Chicago’s 2021 tally was the most on record over the last 20 years. Carjackings had been steadily declining in the city after 2001, hitting a low of 303 in 2014, but began to tick upward before skyrocketing to 1,400 in 2020 following the onset of the pandemic. Last year saw more than five times as many carjackings as in 2014.\n\n‘We recognize the fear and uncertainty’\n\n“It is lawless,” said Raymond Lopez, an alderman for Chicago’s 15th Ward. “It doesn’t feel lawless. It is.”\n\nChicago’s clearance rate for carjackings is low, and has further declined during the pandemic. According to the University of Chicago’s Crime Lab, only 11% of carjacking offenses resulted in an arrest in 2020, down from 20% in 2019. Just 4.5% of offenses resulted in charges approved by the State Attorney’s Office.\n\nChicago, a city of 2.7 million people, recorded more than three times as many carjackings as New York, where the population is almost three times higher. Chicago police officials declined to comment.\n\nPhiladelphia police posted a message on Facebook telling residents they were prioritizing the solving of carjacking cases and that more officers had been dedicated to that task.\n\n“We recognize the fear and uncertainty these incidents bring, as the victims in these cases have touched nearly every demographic,” the statement read. “The PPD has deployed additional resources to investigate these incidents and apprehend offenders.”\n\nIn December, Pennsylvania Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D) was carjacked at gunpoint in Philadelphia – a 19-year-old from Delaware was later arrested for the crime. News outlets in Philadelphia have reported more than 100 carjackings have already taken place so far this year.\n\nThere are problems tracking data\n\nMany cities do not have data on carjackings readily available, as police departments will often categorize these crimes as robberies or assaults. It’s difficult to understand the scope of the problem at a national level because the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, which law enforcement agencies voluntarily submit their crime data to, does not track carjackings.\n\nHowever, more agencies are beginning to track carjackings separately. Dallas began classifying these crimes separately from robberies in their data last year and reported 453 carjackings in 2021. The Metropolitan Police Department in DC last year created a task force dedicated to addressing carjacking and auto thefts. Reports of auto thefts are also up across the country and are more reliably tracked than carjackings.\n\nKim Smith, director of programs at University of Chicago’s Crime Lab, says that tracking crimes in greater detail is a key part of finding solutions.\n\n“I do think it’s important to be as granular as possible when you’re collecting data on crime,” she told CNN. “Who are the victims? Where do things take place? A lot of carjackings are done with a gun. If we’re trying to address gun violence, then we need to be as granular as possible.”\n\nMore detailed reporting also makes it easier to spot trends and patterns – in its 2021 report, “How the pandemic is accelerating carjackings in Chicago,” the Crime Lab found that the majority of carjackings were concentrated in the south and west sides of the city, where gun violence is disproportionately high. The majority of the victims of carjackings were Black or Hispanic.\n\nSmith says she hopes the detail provided in the Crime Lab report can encourage officials in other cities to take a closer look at the circumstances under which these crimes occur. “There’s a lot that surprised us in the analysis, and I do think some of this is a call to action,” she said.\n\nSome ‘emboldened to be repeat offenders’\n\nShifting attitudes toward the juvenile justice system, and Covid-related restrictions aimed at reducing the number of people in county jails or juvenile facilities, has created a situation where accused criminals who’d normally be held in custody are free while awaiting trial, experts told CNN.\n\nThat’s created a “revolving door” situation where “some were emboldened to be repeat offenders,” said Jeffrey Norman, chief of the Milwaukee Police Department. “We saw this on a higher level in 2020 and 2021.”\n\nIn Chicago, Lopez said people arrested and sent home with electronic monitoring sometimes reoffend while awaiting trial for something they’ve been arrested for.\n\n“It’s like the perfect storm, where all these soft on crime policies have come to a head during this pandemic,” he told CNN.\n\nThe Crime Lab’s study of Chicago’s carjackings found that almost half of all carjacking arrestees in Chicago in 2020 were under 18. Between 2019 and 2020, there was a 104% increase in the number of arrestees who were minors. For many of them, it was their first contact with the criminal justice system, according to Smith.\n\nThe increase in carjackings committed by minors underscores the extent to which the pandemic has impacted young people in America – especially in areas that were already struggling. The report states that carjackings occurred with more frequency in areas with poorer internet access and lower school attendance.\n\nSmith noted that kids living in areas with lower internet access had fewer opportunities to engage in school, remote learning and program providers over the past two years. “The impact of the pandemic, I think, can’t be overstated,” she said.\n\nLopez said the choice to not take crime seriously among young teens will have consequences years later when they age out of the juvenile justice system.\n\n“When you have carjackers who are 15 on their third car, that’s a problem,” he said.\n\nNorman, the Milwaukee chief, said it would take a multi-faceted approach to begin addressing the rise in carjackings.\n\n“You’re not going to police your way out of this,” Norman said. “Everyone has to share responsibility when it comes to kids.”\n\nNorman said that the behavior of children in a community were like “canaries in a mine. When a community has issues, kids are falling to particular types of behaviors.\n\n“This is my thing. When a child doesn’t love himself or herself, I worry about the community that has that child. That’s no holds barred behavior that child will be engaged in,” Norman said. “A hungry kid will do whatever it takes to put food in his stomach.”\n\nThe closure of schools and advent of remote learning, the stress within households related to that and economic insecurity, and the pandemic stress on other institutions have all contributed to teens having more free time and less stability in their lives.\n\n“You don’t take care of basic things, you can’t get to self-realization,” Norman said. “Not every kid is out doing things to put food in their stomach. But there are things not being take care of – whether it’s having positive mentorship, or areas of socialization not (being) available.\n\n“It’s sad seeing despair and the lack of resources any normal kid should have,” Norman said. “As the old saying goes, ‘Idle hands are the devil’s work.’”", "authors": ["Peter Nickeas Priya Krishnakumar", "Peter Nickeas", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/13/campaign-light-up-dover-crime/459779001/", "title": "Campaign launched to light up Dover's high-crime areas", "text": "When Lamotte McCallister opened his front door to four people wearing fluorescent yellow shirts bearing the phrase \"Lights-On Dover Strong,\" he didn't know what to expect.\n\nWhen he heard why they were there, he was all in.\n\nThe volunteers were among a group going door to door providing residents in central Dover energy-efficient LED lights for their front porches and solar-powered LED motion-sensor floodlights for their backyards. It is part of an effort to reduce crime in an area that has historically seen the highest numbers.\n\nUnder the program, residents on 14 streets – including New, Queen, Kirkwood, Bradford and Governors streets – can get the free lights if they pledge to turn them on every night.\n\n\"The goal is to increase security and empower residents to increase public awareness of criminal activity in these high-risk areas,\" said Chanda Jackson, community engagement specialist for Restoring Central Dover. \"Neighbors working together and talking to each other creates a sense of community. We hope it will demonstrate a unified community approach to public safety.\"\n\nVolunteers from the HELP Initiative Inc. and the Restoring Central Dover, along with interns from Delaware State University, have been out all week installing the lightbulbs and motion floodlights on houses whose owners signed a pledge to reduce crime during a kickoff block party at the end of June.\n\nSTORY: Three state hospital workers charged after patient dies\n\nSTORY: Smyrna hires firm to investigate police chief\n\nThe boots-on-the-ground effort also approaches owners in houses that are not already signed up to try to get full neighborhood participation. McCallister fell into that category.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" said McCallister, who lives on South Queen Street. \"I didn't know this was happening, but I think it might help deter people from going in backyards. I think this will help decrease crime in the area.\"\n\nThat's the hope of the Dover Police Department, a community partner in the campaign. Dover Police Chief Marvin Mailey Jr. believes the effort is a great prevention tool in some of the city's high-risk neighborhoods.\n\nThe area around South New Street, South Governors Avenue, South Bradford Street and South Kirkwood Street has seen more than its share of crime and is considered one of the worst areas in the city, he said.\n\nMailey said people there want to have a better quality of life.\n\n\"Typically, this is our high-crime area, and we are trying to change the landscape of the city,\" Mailey said. \"This program will definitely make Dover safer. Our bad guys don't like to stand under lights when they commit crimes.\"\n\nAccording to Dover police data, burglaries and robberies rose by double-digit percentages in 2016, as were violent crimes, including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. A large number of those crimes are occurring in the campaign's target area, Mailey said.\n\nWhen the campaign was first discussed publicly in April, the goal was to reach 200 homes in a 75-block area. That number is now 500 homes, according to Jackson. She estimates the cost for materials is $9,000, with the labor being donated by volunteers.\n\nJackson said a number of partners have pledged money and labor, including the HELP Initiative Inc., Delaware State University, NCALL Research Inc., Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County, Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility, the Home Depot and Dover police.\n\n\"This is a community effort and the residents seem pretty receptive. So far, we've had positive reaction to the campaign,\" she said. \"We're getting calls from residents asking when they can get their bulbs. It's a matter of breaking the ice and building relationships.\"\n\nCharlie Kistler and Harold Stafford have been providing the installation labor this past week and will continue their efforts until all the houses in the target area have bulbs and motion sensors. Along the way, the founders of the HELP Initiative Inc. have been educating homeowners about the campaign and also about energy efficiency in general.\n\n\"The residents commit to leaving the lights on and also to keeping their neighbors aware that it is important to keep their lights on, too,\" Kistler said. \"When we go from house to block to neighborhood and then the city, we want to light it up to the point where we can reduce crime.\"\n\nBut the effort is about more than crime, Jackson said.\n\nRestoring Central Dover was adopted in 2014 as a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization plan. Jackson said the plan represents the community’s vision for restoring the vitality of Central Dover and lists recommendations for implementation over the next 10 years.\n\nResident input and priorities have been derived from a community survey, meetings, events, activities and community outreach, she said.\n\n\"Lights-On Dover Strong is just a piece of the puzzle,\" she said. \"Relationships are important in this campaign and all of our efforts. If we don't trust each other, nothing will change.\"\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com. Follow him on Twitter at @JerrySmithTNJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/13"}]}
