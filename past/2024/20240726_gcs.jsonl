As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Devika Rao", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/07/23/israel-gaza-war-netanyahu-updates/74509608007/", "title": "Israel Gaza war updates: Netanyahu says hostage deal could be near", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. families of hostages held in Gaza that a deal to secure their release could be near, crediting pressure Israel's military is putting on Hamas, his office said Tuesday.\n\nNetanyahu met with the families and some hostage relatives who accompanied him on the trip from Israel on Monday, as protests against him were brewing. A vigorous one that led to arrests took place Tuesday near the Capitol in Washington.\n\n\"The conditions for returning them are becoming ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas,\" Netanyahu told the families, according to information released by his office. \"We see a certain change, and I think that this change will increase.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet with families of the American hostages at the White House later this week, Reuters and other media reported, citing a U.S. official. It would be Biden's second such meeting since Hamas attacked Israeli border communities Oct. 7, killing almost 1,200 people and seizing more than 200 hostages.\n\nNetanyahu, who is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday, will also meet with Biden and Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris on Thursday.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ After going back and forth on the scheduling, former President Donald Trump said in an online post he'll meet with Netanyahu on Friday. The Times of Israel reported the location will be Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\n∎ Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will preside over Netanyahu's speech, Senate sources told Reuters. Harris, who would normally preside in her role as president of the Senate, will not be in Washington.\n\n∎ The threat to international shipping from Yemen's rebel Houthis is growing, U.N. Special Envoy to Yemen Hans Grundberg told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. The Iran-backed militants have been attacking ships in and around the Red Sea since November, claiming the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nDeal near?Netanyahu said Israel will send team to negotiate hostage release deal\n\nNetanyahu visit draws protests, criticism\n\nThousands of demonstrators are expected to converge on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to protest against Netanyahu and the Gaza war.\n\nSeven labor unions totaling millions of members sent a letter Tuesday to the White House demanding a truce in Gaza and for the U.S. to stop supplying weapons to Israel. The signatories included the United Auto Workers, based in Michigan, home to the biggest percentage and second largest number of Arab Americans in the country.\n\nIn addition, several aid groups and other organizations have partnered to launch a mobile billboard that will drive around Washington on Wednesday with the message: “No more bombs for Netanyahu.” Abby Maxman, U.S. CEO of the British-based anti-poverty agency Oxfam, called Netanyahu's planned congressional address \"wildly inappropriate.\"\n\n\"His governing coalition continues to bombard Gaza, international condemnation is growing, Israelis are demanding that hostages be brought home, and, under his leadership, the Israeli military is bombing aid workers, schools and hospitals,\" Maxman said in a statement.\n\nTuesday protest near Capitol a possible harbinger\n\nIn perhaps a preview of what's in store Wednesday, a few hundred members of the group Jewish Voice for Peace wearing red T-shirts protested the war and demanded a cease-fire Tuesday in the rotunda of the Cannon House office building near the Capitol.\n\nThe demonstrators had large signs with messages such as \"Jews to Congress: Stop Arming Israel'' and \"Let Gaza Live'' as they sat in a circle, clapped and chanted.\n\nVideo images showed some of the protesters being detained by law enforcement, which Capitol Police confirmed in a posting on the X platform that said: \"Demonstrations are not allowed inside the Congressional Buildings. We told the people, who legally entered, to stop or they would be arrested. They did not stop, so we are arresting them.''\n\nThe office of Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., said in a statement that Capitol Police were called after protesters \"became disruptive, violently beating on the office doors, shouting loudly, and attempting to force entry into the office.'' The incident was soon quelled, Kildee's office said.\n\nNew York Rep. Jerry Nadler tears into Netanyahu\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler of New York said he'll attend Netanyahu's address to Congress, in contrast with several lawmakers who plan to boycott in protest of the Israeli leader's policies toward Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nBut Nadler did not hold back in expressing his disdain for Netanyahu, calling him \"the worst leader in Jewish history since the Maccabean king who invited the Romans into Jerusalem over 2100 years ago.''\n\nNadler, the most senior Jewish member of the House, said Netanyahu is merely trying to boost his standing at home and should not have been invited. In a social media posting explaining why he's still attending, Nadler also said: \"The Prime Minister is putting the security of Israel, the lives of the hostages, the stability of the region, and longstanding Israeli democratic norms in perilous jeopardy, simply to maintain the stability of his far-right coalition and absolve him of his own legal troubles.''\n\nHamas, Fatah sign agreement\n\nPalestinian factions led by Hamas and longtime political rival Fatah have signed a national unity agreement aimed at maintaining Palestinian control over Gaza after the war. Final details for an “interim national reconciliation government\" were hammered out Tuesday in Beijing. More than a dozen groups signed off on the plan.\n\nFatah leads the Palestinian Authority presided by Mahmoud Abbas, which has administered the West Bank under Israeli occupation. Hamas has governed Gaza for almost two decades.\n\nThe Biden administration wants a revamped authority to run Gaza, and it has rejected the idea of Hamas playing a role unless the militant group recognizes Israel. Israel, which has repeatedly pledged to crush Hamas, was quick to criticize the agreement.\n\n“Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on social media.\n\nIsrael pounds battered city of Khan Younis\n\nIsrael said it had unleashed tanks and fighter jets to combat Hamas militants regrouping in the Khan Younis area of the southern Gaza Strip. The announcement came hours after the Gaza Health Ministry said 70 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded by Israeli fire on the city. Israel first targeted the city more than six months ago, and by spring claimed to have taken complete control. Israel previously has returned to Gaza City and other areas it had seized because of the apparent reestablishment of militant activity.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported that Israel's top security chiefs agree that if a truce and hostages-for-prisoners deal is reached with Hamas, the Israeli military could leave Gaza for the required six weeks without losing control of the enclave.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/953838/man-breaks-speed-drinking-record", "title": "Man breaks speed-drinking record | The Week", "text": "A man in New York won a Guinness World Record when he drank a two-litre bottle of fizzy drink in 18.45 seconds.

Kathleen Roberts says: “Michael stays in me all the time so he comes to the restroom with me and calls these special bonding moments ‘toiletries’.” Kathleen, who insists she is a reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe, says Jacko’s spirit isn’t interested in a sexual relationship and “scares me with spider visions and dead corpse visions if I kiss him or try to initiate romance physically”.

This colossal revenue stream pours “vast sums into the coffers of the Qatari state” that have been further “boosted by rocketing demand and prices caused by the Ukraine war”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhat does Qatar own?\n\nQatar “boasts massive global holdings”, said CNBC. Assets in the UK include Harrods, which Qatar bought in 2010, a 20% stake in London Heathrow, and 25% ownership of British Airways’s parent company IAG . Qatar-backed entities have also snapped up property assets including Canary Wharf, HSBC Tower and The Shard.\n\nQatar’s grip “reaches far into the British state”, said i news, with other holdings ranging from The Ritz hotel to “an industrial unit in the West Sussex town of Crawley and an Essex farm”.\n\n“Such is the concentration of luxury homes and offices belonging to Qatari nationals in one part of London’s Mayfair that it is known among estate agents as ‘Little Doha’,” the site added. These properties include Dudley House, a £200m mansion owned by “horseracing mogul” Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah al-Thani which is of “such opulence” that the late Queen Elizabeth is said to have remarked during a visit: “This place makes Buckingham Palace look rather dull.”\n\nA recent audit by The Observer found that the Qataris’ British property empire has “ballooned” into a “sprawling portfolio likely to be worth in excess of £10bn”. The ruling family holds more than 4,000 land titles on everything from “luxury mansions and hotels” to “obscure industrial estates and terraced houses”, according to the paper.\n\nThe Middle Eastern country is also tightening its hold on British businesses. The QIA has a 14.3% stake in Sainsbury’s and is also “the largest shareholder in banking giant Barclays with a 6.4% stake”, said This is Money.\n\nThe site reported that Qatar’s other “major investments” include a 7% stake in the London Stock Exchange Group; 4.6% in water firm Severn Trent, and a 0.5% stake in Shell.\n\nFurther afield, the QIA has a 9.9% stake in Empire State Realty Trust, the owner of the Empire State Building. And in 2016, the sovereign wealth fund bought the iconic Asia Square towers from BlackRock for $2.5bn – the biggest office transaction in Singapore’s history.\n\nQatar has made various sport and entertainment-related investments too, as well as pumping hundreds of billions into hosting the World Cup. Qatari media group BeIN purchased Miramax Studios in 2016 for an undisclosed amount, and Qatar Sports Investments has owned Paris Saint-Germain football club since 2011.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961441/holiday-island-goes-phone-free", "title": "Holiday island goes phone-free | The Week", "text": "A holiday island has announced a “no phones” policy for tourists planning to visit this summer.

Sign up\n\nHere is how the scandal played out.\n\n1. 15 May 2020\n\nThe first restriction breaches took place days after Johnson announced that the country would begin taking the “first careful steps” out of lockdown, the Evening Standard said. People could not leave home without a reasonable excuse and could only meet one person outside while exercising, according to rules at the time.\n\nAn investigation by The Guardian in December 2021 led to the publication of a picture of Johnson, flanked by Carrie Symonds and his then chief adviser Dominic Cummings, drinking wine and eating cheese in the No. 10 garden.\n\nThat day, the health secretary at the time, Matt Hancock, had urged “people to stick to the rules and not take advantage of the good weather over the May weekend to socialise in groups”.\n\nWhen asked about it later, Johnson said: “Those people were at work talking about work.” The event was not investigated by the police.\n\n2. 20 May 2020\n\nOne of the most explosive of the lockdown parties was revealed when an email leaked to ITV News showed more than 100 Downing Street staff were invited for “socially distanced drinks” in the garden of No. 10 to “make the most of the lovely weather”.\n\nSent by Johnson’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, the email invited employees including advisers, speech writers and door staff to come over and “bring your own booze”.\n\nJohnson told Prime Minister’s Questions in January 2022 that he attended for around “25 minutes” but thought it was “a work event”.\n\n3. 19 June 2020\n\nITV News reported in January 2022 that a birthday party was held in the Cabinet Room for Johnson with up to 30 people. His then girlfriend Carrie Symonds apparently presented him with a cake and “led staff in a chorus of happy birthday”, said the broadcaster.\n\nJohnson famously claimed he had been “ambushed by cake”, and that he was there for less than 10 minutes.\n\nPolice determined that the event breached the rules, which at the time banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people. Johnson and Symonds both received fixed-penalty notices, as did the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The latter claimed to have been “unintentionally present” when the cake was served, while waiting for a meeting.\n\n4. 13 November 2020\n\nIn early November new lockdown restrictions were introduced to deal with rising Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations, banning indoor gatherings and leaving the home for non-essential activities. Two gatherings allegedly took place eight days later, the evening No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings was sacked.\n\nA spokesman for Johnson’s then fiancée denied that these events, reported in The Daily Telegraph, had taken place. According to the police investigation an event on this day did breach the rules in place at the time, but it did not confirm whether it was one or both.\n\n5. 25 November 2020\n\nThe Times revealed in December 2021 that an “impromptu” party was held in late November 2020, to celebrate Sunak’s autumn spending review.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury told The Guardian that a “small number” had remained after work to celebrate at their desks. According to The Times, “about two dozen civil servants” took part in the drinks after “wine and beer were brought into the Treasury”. “They’d all been working really hard,” sources told the paper.\n\n6. 27 November 2020\n\nTwo days later, it was alleged that the prime minister attended a leaving event for Cleo Watson, a former Downing Street adviser.\n\nA source told The Guardian “that Johnson personally attended and gave a speech”, mentioning how crowded it was in the room before leaving shortly afterwards to continue working.\n\n7. 10 December 2020\n\nEight days after the second national lockdown was replaced with the tier system and indoor meetings of two or more were banned in London, the Department for Education (DoE) held a Christmas party at which two dozen people drank in the department canteen. Susan Acland-Hood, a senior civil servant, said it had been organised at the request of former education secretary Gavin Williamson, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe DoE confirmed that the party had taken place “to thank staff for their work during the pandemic”.\n\n8. 14 December 2020\n\nShaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, was forced to apologise in December 2021 after the Daily Mirror published a photograph of him at a Christmas party held at the Tories’ campaign headquarters in London, alongside 24 other people, on 14 December. The photo showed the group smiling at the camera, next to catered food.\n\nThe Conservative Party would later admit that an “unauthorised gathering” took place at its Westminster headquarters. Bailey stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crimes committee over the revelations.\n\nPolice said there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rules had been broken, and the event was not included in the eventual report into parties in and around Downing Street by senior civil servant Sue Gray.\n\n9. 15 December 2020\n\nPictures published in the Sunday Mirror in December 2021 showed Johnson hosting an online quiz in Downing Street in December 2020. He was with two members of his team wearing tinsel and a Santa hat. Johnson denied breaking any guidance or rules at this event.\n\nThe image served to “seriously undermine Downing Street’s claims” that “no parties had taken place in No.10”, said the paper.\n\nRules at the time banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless necessary for work purposes, but this event was not investigated by the police.\n\n10. 15 December 2020\n\nPictures published in the Daily Mirror last month showed Johnson hosting an online quiz in Downing Street in December 2020. He was seen with two members of his team wearing tinsel and a Santa hat.​​\n\nA source told the paper “many staff huddled by computers, conferring on questions and knocking back fizz, wine and beer from a local Tesco Metro”. The image serves to “seriously undermine Downing Street’s claims” that “no parties had taken place in No.10”, said the paper.\n\n11. 16-17 December 2020\n\nThe Department for Transport was forced to apologise over allegations that a dozen of Grant Shapps’s team were “boozing and dancing” during a Christmas party on the same day that London had moved to the highest tier of restrictions at the time.\n\nIt was “inappropriate” and an “error of judgement” by staff, the department said.\n\nThe Cabinet Office later confirmed that staff took part in a virtual quiz on 17 December 2020, which was reportedly listed in digital calendars as “Christmas party!” in Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s office.\n\n“Dozens” of officials from the Cabinet Office’s Covid-19 taskforce also attended a “boozy” leaving party for their boss Kate Josephs, according to The Telegraph. The bash was hosted in the 70 Whitehall office of the government unit while “the country was still under draconian restrictions” drawn up by the taskforce.\n\nPolice determined that an event on these dates breached the rules, but did not confirm which.\n\n12. 18 December 2020\n\nA second Christmas party, also revealed by the Daily Mirror, took place in No. 10.\n\n“Officials knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home,” said the paper. One source described the event as “a Covid nightmare” in which around “40 or 50” were crammed “cheek by jowl” into a medium-sized room in Downing Street.\n\nDowning Street originally denied the report, but ITV would later publish a video of the prime minister’s then press secretary, Allegra Stratton, joking about the party taking place. Police would later rule that the event breached the regulations at the time.\n\n13. 16 April 2021\n\nTwo further leaving events, one for departing director of communications James Slack and a second for a Downing Street photographer, took place on the evening before Prince Philip’s funeral.\n\n“It is alleged that excessive alcohol was drunk, while at points, guests danced,” The Telegraph said. “The gatherings stretched late into the night – well beyond midnight.”\n\nDowning Street would later apologise to Buckingham Palace. Police said that one event on this date breached the rules, but did not say which. BBC News reported that some people at Slack’s leaving party were issued with fines.\n\n14. 30 November 2021\n\nThe then political editor of the Daily Mirror, Pippa Crerar, first broke the story that Downing Street staff had held three parties in November and December 2020, while London was under lockdown restrictions.\n\n“Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number 10 in the run-up to last Christmas,” began the article that would kickstart more than two years of revelations, reporting and inquiries.\n\nDowning Street said that Covid rules were followed at all times, and denied that any party had taken place.\n\n15. December 2021\n\nA video obtained by ITV News showed Allegra Stratton joking about the party in Downing Street on 18 December 2020. She resigned the following day, after an intense backlash.\n\nJohnson then instructed Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, to investigate claims of a Christmas party in Downing Street, telling MPs that he was “furious”. The next day, he announced a Cabinet Office inquiry, but reports emerged that Case was found to have attended one of the parties and he was forced to remove himself from the investigation. He was replaced by experienced civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nPolice later determined that the event did take place, and that it breached the rules at the time.\n\n16. 25 January 2022\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into 12 of the 16 events examined by the Sue Gray inquiry.\n\nMore than 100 people were sent questionnaires as part of Operation Hillman, about alleged Covid law-breaking events that took place between May 2020 and April 2021.\n\nJohnson told the Commons he welcomed the investigation.\n\n17. 12 April 2022\n\nJohnson was issued with a fixed penalty notice by the Metropolitan Police for lockdown breaches during the pandemic, making him the first serving prime minister found to have broken the law while in Downing Street. His wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak also received a fine.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said the PM and chancellor had “broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public” and “must both resign”.\n\n18. 21 April 2022\n\nThe House of Commons passed a motion to refer Johnson to its Privileges Committee, to consider whether he had deliberately misled the Commons when he said no Covid guidance or rules were breached in Downing Street.\n\nThe inquiry was delayed until after the Met Police and Gray investigations.\n\n19. 19 May 2022\n\nThe Met Police concluded its investigation, which had examined evidence from the Gray inquiry as well as records and photographs from the time.\n\nOverall, it made 126 referrals for fixed penalty notices, to 83 people, with 28 people receiving between two and five fines.\n\nThe investigation cost nearly half a million pounds.\n\n20. 25 May 2022\n\nGray published her full report. She found “failures of leadership and judgement in No 10 and the Cabinet Office” for which “the senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility”.\n\n21. 6 June 2022\n\nJohnson won a vote of no-confidence, but announced that he would stand down as prime minister less than a month later after a mass resignation of members of his government.\n\n22. 22 March 2023\n\nJohnson appeared before the Privileges Committee. During a mammoth televised hearing lasting nearly five hours, he told the cross-party group of MPs that his assurances to the House of Commons that Covid rules had been followed were made in “good faith”.\n\n23. 23 May 2023\n\nJohnson was referred to the police by the Cabinet Office over more claims that he had broken the law during lockdown. Johnson’s ministerial diary from 2020 and 2021 revealed visits by friends to Chequers, his grace and favour residence, during the pandemic, said The Times.\n\nJohnson gave the diaries to his lawyers defending him during the Covid inquiry, but as the lawyers were being funded by the government, the Cabinet Office was allowed to see them.\n\nThe Cabinet Office then referred the matter to the police and the House of Commons Privileges Committee, saying it was obliged to do so by its code of conduct.\n\n24. 15 June 2023\n\nThe Privileges Committee released its report into whether Johnson misled Parliament.\n\nIt found it “highly unlikely” that Johnson could have “genuinely believed” his statements that the rules or guidelines were being complied with, given his “direct personal experience” of the events and his familiarity with said rules and guidance “as their most prominent public promoter”.\n\nIt was “just as unlikely” he could have continued to believe this when he gave evidence to the committee, it said.\n\nIf Johnson had not resigned as an MP on Friday, pre-empting the committee’s findings, the report would have recommended a suspension of 90 days, rather than the anticipated 10 days. A suspension of any more than 10 days could have triggered a by-election.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber", "Rebecca Messina"], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/961878/cold-tongue-pacific-ocean-cool-patch-climate-change", "title": "Pacific Ocean 'cold tongue' mystery explained | The Week", "text": "A thin stretch of the eastern Pacific Ocean has been getting colder for the past 30 years, defying the broad global trend and baffling scientists.\n\nThe anomaly, known as the “equatorial cold tongue”, is affecting an area that extends west from the coast of Ecuador for thousands of miles.\n\nOver at least three decades the region has cooled by roughly half a degree and it “has scientists wondering how long that will hold”, said The Atlantic.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But Richard Seager, from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, said one factor appears to be trade winds in the region, which carry warm water away from the surface stimulating cooler water to rise.\n\n“The trade winds blow from east to west across the tropical Pacific Ocean,” Seager told Newsweek. “Because of the rotation of the Earth, the winds drive waters northward to the north of the Equator and southward to the south of the Equator. As the waters are driven away from the Equator, water is pumped up from below and since the waters below the surface are cold this creates the equatorial Pacific cold tongue.”\n\nYet despite the effect of these winds, the cold tongue has “puzzled scientists”, Newsweek said, “because advanced climate computer models suggest that the waters should have been warming for decades at a faster rate than the rest of the Pacific due to rising greenhouse gas emissions”.\n\nOther hypotheses suggest that the answer may be found in the cold seas of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, which have also seen sea surface temperatures decline in recent decades.\n\nSuspected drivers include the melting of Antarctic glaciers as global temperatures rise, and ozone depletion in conjunction with rising greenhouse gas emissions, which are intensifying the movement of cold air from Antarctica.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis isn’t just an “academic puzzle”, New Scientist said. In fact, according to Pedro DiNezio, at the University of Colorado Boulder, it is “the most important unanswered question in climate science”.\n\nNot knowing what is causing it “means we also don’t know when it will stop, or whether it will suddenly flip over into warming”, New Scientist added. This has huge worldwide implications and “could determine whether California is gripped by permanent drought or Australia by ever-deadlier wildfires” as well as “the intensity of monsoon season in India and the chances of famine in the Horn of Africa”.\n\nMore profoundly still, “it could even alter the extent of climate change globally”, the site said, “by tweaking how sensitive Earth’s atmosphere is to rising greenhouse gas emissions”.\n\nWhat are its effects on wildlife?\n\nAs well as the climate-related questions it presents, the cold tongue is also of interest to biologists, particularly in relation to the Galápagos Islands, which lie about 600 miles off Ecuador.\n\nThis is because the “cold, nutrient-rich water” of the cold tongue has become a “prosperous patch [that] feeds phytoplankton and breathes life into the archipelago”, said The Atlantic.\n\nAccording to Judith Denkinger, a marine ecologist at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito in Ecuador, the ecological impacts of the cold tongue are profound.\n\n“The cool water sustains populations of penguins, marine iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, and cetaceans that would not be able to stay on the equator year-round,” Denkinger told The Atlantic.\n\nColder temperatures can also “inhibit coral growth rates” and “fish may experience shifts in their distribution due to changes in water temperature, which can also affect their metabolism and reproduction”, said Brilliantio in its explainer on temperature in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDo cooler waters challenge existing climate models?\n\nAs well as the cold tongue, other pockets of cool oceanic water sporadically present themselves, such as an area of the Pacific Ocean near San Francisco that has recently been the coldest it’s been in more than a decade.\n\nDespite this, the overall direction of ocean temperatures is going up, said Ryan Walter, associate professor at California Polytechnic State University. “We know that long term there’s climate change and warming,” Walter told the San Francisco Chronicle. “In the meantime, you have all these ups and downs.”\n\nSolving the puzzle of the cold tongue “isn’t about proving climate models wrong”, said New Scientist. “On the big issues… they have been remarkably accurate.\n\n“Rather, the cold tongue is the last big piece of the puzzle. Fit that in and we can build a more accurate picture of how life will change in a warming world – and how best to prepare for that future.”", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Devika Rao", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/03"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956440/why-the-uk-chose-rwanda-to-process-asylum-seekers", "title": "Why the UK picked Rwanda to process asylum seekers | The Week", "text": "Rishi Sunak's Rwanda Bill has cleared Parliament, paving the way for the first deportation flights to begin by July.\n\nFollowing eight hours of tortuous debate during which MPs and peers sat through the night, the bill was finally passed after the House of Lords decided not to table any further amendments.\n\nWith the bill's passage the first group of migrants will be sent letters within days notifying them of the government's intent to deport them to Rwanda.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

It is expected to focus on single men, rather than women and children.\n\n\"Critics point to Rwanda's poor human rights record,\" he explained, meaning ministers will be expected to justify why it is \"the right place to entrust with protecting the human rights of vulnerable asylum seekers who hoped the UK would protect them\".\n\nThe Daily Mail's Stephen Glover pointed to a 2020 report from Human Rights Watch that found high-profile government critics had been arrested or threatened and that \"arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities continued\".\n\n\"Not the sort of place where most of us would choose to end up, or with whose government we should be seeking a close partnership,\" said Glover.\n\nHowever, Rwanda has shown that it is \"hospitable towards refugees and has experience as a host\", said Cristiano d'Orsi, a lecturer in international law at the University of Johannesburg. Rwanda currently hosts more than 135,000 refugees and asylum seekers, the majority from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and their rights are \"protected under various laws\", d'Orsi wrote for The Conversation.\n\n\"Nevertheless, there are many rights they don't have\" and they are \"still a long way away from being able to make independent lives for themselves\".\n\nNext steps\n\nFollowing the passage of the Rwanda Bill, planes will now depart for Kigali \"come what may\", said Sunak, and there will be a \"regular rhythm of multiple flights every month\" over the summer and beyond.\n\nThe bill's passage is a \"major coup for Mr Sunak\", said The Telegraph, and \"in theory a step closer to his objective of stopping the boats\".\n\nYet support for the bill is remarkably low, with almost everyone agreeing the government's Rwanda plan is a \"bad idea\", said Simon Jenkins in The Guardian. The scheme represents \"appalling value for huge sums of public money\". Its \"trivial\" impact on the issue of irregular migration means it can only be seen as \"a mere sop to rightwing voters\".\n\nThe plan will cost £1.8 million for each of the first 300 deportees, the National Audit Office has confirmed.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber", "Rebecca Messina", "Theara Coleman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960884/pros-and-cons-of-coalition-governments", "title": "Pros and cons of coalition governments | The Week", "text": "Westminster is abuzz with talk of coalition governments again after recent local election results suggested Labour could fall short of an overall majority at the general election next year.\n\nKeir Starmer refused to rule out a coalition with the Lib Dems but has said he would not go into partnership with the SNP.\n\nA survey by YouGov for Times Radio found that while a Labour majority was the preferred election outcome for most voters, many were also open to a coalition.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nHere are some of the arguments for and against such a set-up.\n\n1. Pro: tempers extreme views\n\nCoalitions on the continent are often lauded for being “broad churches” that temper extreme views and deliver compromise. Analysing the “Grand Coalition” of left and right that governed Germany in the 2010s, DW said it was “a good instrument for turning political consensus into reality”.\n\nIn the UK, between 2010 and 2015 the Lib Dems repeatedly attempted to portray their role in the Coalition government as a mediating force on the Conservatives. The Lib Dems’ Danny Alexander, who was chief secretary to the Treasury during the coalition years, claimed his party “anchored economic policy in the centre ground and have constantly had to keep the Tories reined in”.\n\n2. Con: waters down pledges\n\nA party’s manifesto forms the cornerstone of its time in government, but a major problem with coalitions is that pledges presented in the run-up to election day are rendered unrealistic in the horse-trading that follows.\n\nIn a country like the UK, which is used to long periods of majority single-party rule, there is a perception that weak and indecisive coalition governments lead to the worst-of-both-worlds and put a block on big legislative progress. There is an argument to be made that neither the trade union reforms of Margaret Thatcher nor Tony Blair’s raft of improvements to public services could have been carried through as part of a coalition.\n\nThings can also work the other way. In 2015, David Cameron pledged to hold an in-out referendum on the UK’s EU membership, reportedly believing he would fail to secure a majority and could ditch the manifesto commitment as part of a new coalition deal with the Lib Dems. Needless to say things turned out very differently.\n\n3. Pro: better than minority\n\nThe closest the UK has got to a minority government in the last 50 years was from 2017-19 when Theresa May was forced into a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) after her decision to call a snap election backfired disastrously. What followed was two years of political stasis and stagnation that came to be defined by the “Brexit forever wars”, dominated by endless parliamentary manoeuvring that saw legislation repeatedly fail to pass.\n\nThe experience appears to have resonated with the public, with 46% of respondents in the recent Times Radio YouGov poll saying hung parliaments were bad because they led to weak government, compared to just 27% who thought they were good because they forced parties to work together. In the event of a hung parliament, 42% of voters said that parties should form a coalition in order to provide stable government.\n\n4. Con: dangers for smaller parties\n\n“The Lib Dems’ demise will become a cautionary tale,” predicted FT Adviser after the party was all but wiped out in the 2015 election, slumping from over 20% of the vote share in 2010 to just 8% and losing all but 11 of its MPs. “The smaller party was ruthlessly punished for ‘propping up’ the Tories.”\n\nAs is often the case with smaller parties in coalitions, the Lib Dems were scapegoated for unpopular policies – such as the introduction of university tuition fees – while the Tories took credit for positives such as reviving the economy. It has taken nearly a decade for the party to begin to repair the damage to its reputation and it still remains way off its pre-coalition standing.\n\n5. Pro: greater representation\n\n“There are a lot of reasons to think coalitions are good,” said Professor Nic Cheeseman in South Africa’s Mail and Guardian in 2019. “They bring more parties into power which, in ethnically and racially divided societies, often means that they give a wider range of communities a taste of government. In a dominant-party system like South Africa, where the ANC has consistently won a large majority of the vote, this can bring into government parties that would otherwise be permanently locked out of power.”\n\nIn his book “Coalitional Presidentialism in Comparative Perspective”, Cheeseman conducted hundreds of interviews with MPs across nine countries with experience of coalition government. In every country bar one, a majority of MPs agreed that coalitions had “permitted the representation of diverse social interests” and “enhanced the quality of public policies”. Coalitions can also open up a wider talent pool of politicians and experts to serve in government.\n\nIn the UK, coalitions or other power-sharing arrangements already happen at a local level, where there are currently 91 district councils outside London with “no overall control” (almost one-third of local authorities), up from 75 before the most recent local elections. “This has not created instability,” said New Camden Journal. “The bins still get emptied and decisions are made, just usually with support from councillors outside of the largest political group”.\n\n6. Con: held hostage by smaller parties\n\nAt the 2015 general election the Conservatives under Cameron successfully deployed fears of a “coalition of chaos” in which Labour would be beholden to the Lib Dems and the SNP. The campaign claimed then-Labour leader Ed Miliband would be forced to call another Scottish independence referendum in exchange for backing from the SNP. While this ultimately failed to happen after the Tories won a surprise majority, something similar happened during May’s time in office, when the DUP often wielded disproportionate influence on government policy by threatening to pull its support entirely to win concessions.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "Rebekah Evans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/17"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/sport/954136/doping-in-sport-should-cannabis-be-on-the-list-of-banned-substances", "title": "Doping in sport: should cannabis be on the list of banned ...", "text": "When US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson missed the Tokyo Olympic Games after testing positive for a chemical found in cannabis, her suspension “reignited a long debate over marijuana prohibition in Olympic sports”, said the BBC’s Robin Levinson-King.\n\nConsidered a top contender for the 100m, Richardson tested positive during the US Olympic Track & Field trials in June and was given a one-month suspension. The 21-year-old said she had used cannabis as a way of coping with the death of her biological mother and not to boost performance. Her exclusion became a matter of “heated debate”, Scientific American reported at the time.\n\n“Don’t judge me, because I am human, I just happen to run a little faster,” she told NBC’s Today show. “I apologise for the fact that I didn’t even know how to control my emotions or deal with that during that time.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Which made it kind of perfect.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nPregnant and stunning in red: Rihanna crushed the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show\n\nAfter party: 7 Westgate restaurant and bars offer late hours on Super Bowl Sunday\n\nWhether you celebrating your team's win or looking for a pick-me-up if they didn't, you won't need to go far for a post-game drink.\n\nSeven restaurants and bars near the stadium at Westgate Entertainment District are staying open late after the game. Karaoke, check; food, check; drinks, check; pool, check.\n\nHere are seven restaurants and bars with extended hours on game day.\n\n— Bahar Anooshahr\n\nAfter a powerhouse Super Bowl performance, everyone wants to know: Is Rihanna pregnant again?\n\nAt around 6:28 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 12, the yearslong Rihanna drought came to an end.\n\nAmid the excitement surrounding hearing her perform classics like \"Umbrella,” there was rampant speculation on social media about whether Rihanna is pregnant again nine months after giving birth to her first son. Some posts were more tactful than others.\n\nThe NFL shared footage of A$AP Rocky enjoying Rihanna’s performance and some millennials drew parallels between Rihanna’s backup dancers’ outfits and the 2008 Disney film ‘Minutemen.’\n\nA representative for Rihanna confirmed that she is indeed expecting her next child, making her Super Bowl performance possibly the biggest pregnancy reveal ever.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna reasserts her pop music dominance at her halftime show\n\nWe’ve all been wondering who Rihanna might bring out to join her in the spotlight when she took the world’s biggest stage at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show and … surprise.\n\nShe got along just fine without a single cameo.\n\nRihanna made her entrance on a floating platform high above the field, rocking a stylish red jumpsuit and matching latex bustier singing “Bitch Better Have My Money,” seamlessly working her way through a dizzying celebration of her catalog that put the focus squarely on her most iconic hits, from “Umbrella” to “Work.”\n\nShe hasn’t toured since late 2016 and this halftime show more than lived up to the promise of a world-class performer reasserting her place in the pop music stratosphere.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nRihanna's Super Bowl 2023 playlist: Here's every song from her halftime show performance\n\nOne fan paid over $30K for her seat. Was it worth it?\n\nLiz Foster had the best seat in the house for Super Bowl 57, between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd she’s a Cincinnati Bengals fan. She and her husband Bill bought the tickets before the AFC Championship, in which the Chiefs beat Cincinnati.\n\n“We were just hoping the Bengals would be here so we planned ahead,” Foster said. “We were putting out good vibes.”\n\nThey were also putting out good money — Foster wouldn’t come clean on exactly how much they spent, but she hinted at it — “30-ish,” she said.\n\nAs in $30,000?\n\n“Plus some.”\n\nPlus how much? Foster wasn’t saying. But even without her favorite team playing in the game, she said a backup plan:\n\n“I’m here for Rihanna.”\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nFan zone:The best seat at Super Bowl 2023 cost her $30,000 (plus some). And she's a Bengals fan\n\nFans at the Hance Park watch party aren't just blown away by Rihanna\n\nIt's getting a bit rough in downtown Phoenix for us mere mortals who didn't make it inside State Farm Stadium in Glendale.\n\nThe winds are whipping around Margaret T. Hance Park, where the official NFL watch party is underway at the Super Bowl Experience. According to the National Weather Service, the wind is blowing west at more than 20 mph, kicking up dead grass and the few leaves left on the trees.\n\nThat hasn't tamped down the excitement at the park, where it's been difficult — if at all possible — to navigate from one side to the other because the crowd in front of the stage is just that dense.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nAre you ready for Rihanna?\n\nThe Super Bowl has rarely had a more anticipated halftime show.\n\nRihanna, one of the most successful pop sensations of the century, is making her return to live performance for the first time since 2018, when she did the Grammys. It's been even longer since she’s toured.\n\nWe spoke to several members of the team that helped her put this show together and they promised us \"It's nothing like you've ever seen before.” Her music director added, “Trust me, this is my fourth Super Bowl halftime. And I must say, Rihanna has pushed the bar.\"\n\nThe singer herself is promising a “jam-packed ... celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nAdele at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl: 'I'm going just for Rihanna'\n\nAdele is cheering for Team Rihanna at Super Bowl 2023 in Glendale, just like she promised.\n\nThe British singer — who can always be counted on for a good reaction meme — was spotted in a box at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Just over a week earlier, she told the crowd at one of her Las Vegas residency shows that she's \"going just for Rihanna.\"\n\nHopefully there will be some cameras pointed her way during the halftime show performance.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nChris Stapleton spared us the all-too-common national anthem showboating\n\nIs Chris Stapleton “only the best voice in the world,” as Babyface suggested at a press conference in downtown Phoenix Thursday morning?\n\nTo be fair, few singers could hope to live up to that level of hype. But Stapleton does have a wonderful voice, as anyone at all familiar with the Grammy-winning country singer’s catalog would surely testify.\n\nAnd he used it to brilliant effect at State Farm Stadium without making it feel like he was out there to impress us with a show of vocal pyrotechnics.\n\nIt was more about the song itself, which as Stapleton said, can go horribly wrong. But this one didn’t.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nReview:Chris Stapleton's deeply soulful Super Bowl national anthem, plus Sheryl Lee Ralph, Babyface\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph delivers a monumental ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, the Emmy-winning star of “Abbott Elementary,” got the pregame entertainment off to a breathtaking start with her version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black national anthem, looking powerful in a flowing, off-the-shoulder red gown and matching gloves.\n\nAt Thursday’s pregame press conference in Phoenix, Ralph said her goal was “to make sure we could have a version for people to understand the great lyrics of this song and what it means.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly how it went, a life-affirming testament to the deep meaning of the lyrics, well served by Ralph’s Broadway experience. If you didn’t understand those lyrics, you weren’t listening. — Ed Masley\n\nHere's what to expect in 2023:How long does the Super Bowl national anthem take?\n\nHow to watch Chris Stapleton sing the national anthem at Super Bowl 2023\n\nCountry superstar Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem just before Super Bowl 2023 kicks off at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at State Farm Stadium.\n\nHe’ll be joined in the pregame ceremonies by Babyface, who will sing “America the Beautiful,” and Sheryl Lee Ralph, of “Abbot Elementary,” who will sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”\n\nEach song will be performed in American Sign Language as well, by Arizona native Troy Kotsur, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Coda”; Colin Denny, a member of the Navajo Nation in Arizona; and Justina Miles.\n\nHere’s everything to know about today’s national anthem, including how long it might last.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nSuper Bowl pregame: Sheryl Crow soaks up the sun, suggests new footwear for Patrick Mahomes\n\nSheryl Crow was midway through a hit-filled concert at the On Location tailgate party outside State Farm Stadium when she took a moment to reflect on her footwear — spectacular studded black open-toed clogs with heels that had to be at least 4 inches high.\n\n“All I’m saying,” she said, “is I think Patrick Mahomes should have to run in these shoes.”\n\nThat would definitely be a game changer.\n\nCrow and her band took the stage to a raucous recording of the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” — a bold move, to be sure, and a handy frame of reference for the brand of rock ‘n’ roll that has underscored her finest hours from the start.\n\nAfter setting the tone with “If It Makes You Happy,” Crow proceeded through such classics as “A Change Will Do You Good,” the decidedly Stonesy “My Favorite Mistake” (which always makes me think of “Goats Head Soup”), her stellar cover of Cat Stevens’ “The First Cut Is the Deepest,” “Soak Up the Sun,” her breakthrough single “All I Wanna Do” and “Every Day Is a Winding Road.”\n\n“Can you believe this weather?!” she asked. “It’s supposed to be snowing in Nashville today. I’m just really happy to be here, if nothing else to give myself a killer suntan.”\n\nShe also took a moment to note another cause to celebrate this weekend.\n\n“Yesterday was my birthday,” she said. “I’m 38 again.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nThe downtown Phoenix Super Bowl action has moved to Hance Park\n\nThe Super Bowl Experience at Phoenix Convention Center is officially over, and the NFL fans who have swarmed downtown Phoenix for the past week moved north to Margaret T. Hance Park for the free Super Bowl Experience fan event.\n\nThat’s where the NFL’s first ever official Super Bowl watch party is taking place on what officials claimed were the largest LED screens in Arizona. An hour and a half before kickoff, the bar scene near the Convention Center was subdued, with a smattering of patrons at venues such as Majerle’s Sports Grill and Barrel and Bushel.\n\nThe real fans — sorry, not sorry — were at Hance Park, biding their time by completing the QB obstacle course, playing corn hole and enjoying local food and drinks.\n\nThe lines for the bars, craft beer and portable toilets were manageable with an hour to go before kickoff. Visitors were eager to get their hands on some food; lines for the vendors on the north side of Hance Park far surpassed the shorter ones on the south side.\n\nBut the majority of fans were staked out in front of the screens, braving the full sun exposure (my weather app showed it was 76 degrees) as they sat on blankets and folding chairs.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nHance Park dining guide:What to eat and drink at the 2023 Super Bowl Experience\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on?

Then she reportedly removed all her photos with MGK and unfollowed everyone except Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet and Eminem.\n\nShe has since appeared to have deactivated her Instagram.\n\nOnly time will tell what this development actually means.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna, Dave Grohl, Paris Hilton:Celebrities spotted in Phoenix for Super Bowl 2023\n\nSibling rivalry at Super Bowl 57\n\nCornell and Darlene Brooks are siblings who may agree on some things, but football isn't one of them. Though the pair are attending Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium together.\n\nCornell, from Chicago, wore a Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Darlene, from coastal Mississippi, wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she’s doing,” Cornell said of his sister. “She’s starting to get on my nerves.”\n\nFor her part, Darlene responded with an eye roll. Nothing like sibling rivalry.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nA peek inside the swag bags for premium seat ticketholders\n\nAs if great seats weren’t enough, fans sitting in the best seats in State Farm Stadium had a cooler full of snacks waiting for them.\n\nZachary Ginsberg of Scottsdale was one such fan. He was sitting with his father, who got the tickets.\n\n“I’m a plus-one,” Zachary said.\n\nInside the collapsible cooler was a Twix candy bar, almonds, Skittles, Doritos and … condiments.\n\nWhy condiments?\n\n“You can never have enough mustard and ketchup,” Zachary said. Fair enough.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSuper Bowl announcers walk the field at State Farm Stadium\n\nThe NFL on Fox crew set up on the field just outside the Kansas City Chiefs endzone. Meanwhile, announcers Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen walked the field, chatting with players and surveying the scene.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nDon't let Tom Brady make it his last:Greg Olsen is about to call his first Super Bowl\n\nSuper Bowl 57 is all about sponsorships\n\nEverything is sponsored at Super Bowl 57. Even the pop-up store in State Farm Stadium. It’s open for Arizona Cardinals games all season long, but Sunday its stock was limited to Frito Lay and Anheuser-Busch. So if you wanted Lay's potato chips or Bud Light, this is the place for you.\n\nOn the other hand, what else do you really need?\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOh, it’s on: Puppy Bowl is happening now.

By 12:30 p.m., hundreds of people were trudging down the street in a line toward the stadium.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nPlan ahead: Super Bowl travelers should allow extra time when returning rental cars to Sky Harbor Airport\n\nAt least 180,000 passengers were expected at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the Monday after the Super Bowl. That's about 60,000 more people than an average day.\n\nThousands of those people will be returning cars to the Rental Car Center. If you’re one of them, allow yourself ample time to drop off your car and ride the PHX Sky Train to your terminal. Airport staff recommends Super Bowl travelers allow at least four hours before departure to return car rentals.\n\nThe Rental Car Center is at 1805 E. Sky Harbor Circle South, south of Buckeye Road. It's accessible via exit 149 off Interstate 10. It’s roughly 2 miles from Terminal 3 and Terminal 4.\n\nHere are more tips on how to navigate Sky Harbor Airport after the Super Bowl.\n\n— Michael Salerno\n\nWhat to expect from Rihanna's halftime show, in her own words\n\nIn the event that you’re wondering what to expect from Rihanna when she hits the stage at State Farm Stadium, she shed some light on that in downtown Phoenix on Thursday, promising “a jam-packed show.” Her biggest challenge was \"trying to cram 17 years of work into 13 minutes,\" she said.\n\n\"That was the hardest, hardest part, deciding how to maximize 13 minutes, but also celebrate. That’s what this show is gonna be — a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\nHere’s hoping she checked out our countdown of her greatest songs before she made the final edit to that setlist.

She is a rising senior and journalism major at University of Missouri.\n\nOver the last few weeks, and especially in the last few days since announcing her candidacy for president, there has been a total rebranding of Kamala Harris amongst Gen Z and Millennial voters from the funny, but generally disliked, in-the-background vice president, to a charismatic, progressive girl-boss.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate in 2020 after the initial excitement of the decision to put a Black woman and Asian American into the vice presidency died down, people began to examine who she was. Harris is the former district attorney of San Francisco, the attorney general of California, and before assuming the vice-presidency, was a U.S. senator from California. Those from the state know her well, and in turn, so did we.\n\nKamala labeled herself as a “progressive prosecutor.” In many ways she was. She has openly opposed the death penalty, led California to become the first justice system to require body cameras, and created a re-entry program for first-time offenders in San Francisco called “Back on Track.”\n\nHowever, she has faced rightful criticism for her anti-truancy efforts, which charged parents whose children missed significant amounts of school. Many say the legislation disproportionately targeted low-income families and families of color. Additionally, in 2015 she withheld support for a bill that would have required independent investigation for police shootings. Harris also has a history of wrongful convictions in her time as a prosecutor.\n\nThe decision to choose a former attorney general to compliment the ticket also came at a pivotal time, as the country was still reeling from the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis Police in May 2020. Many Gen Z voters picked up on this note and brought Harris under fire for her career in prosecution, even nicknaming her “Copmala.” It was a title she was unable to shake. Until recently.\n\nUnwavering support for Kamala Harris comes at a fault\n\nHarris’ joyful personality, philosophical way with words and infamous silk press quickly led her to become a meme amongst Gen Z and Millennials. In the lead-up to Biden's dropping out of the presidential race and the desperation for a moment of laughter amid the current political chaos, her comedic influence over social media has only grown stronger.\n\nSince announcing her candidacy, what used to be sardonic quips about the vice president have turned to fierce support, even to a fault. Those who attempt to bring up Harris’ past as a prosecutor or are even concerned about her odds of winning are quickly shot down and accused of trying to derail the campaign effort.\n\nAmongst the overflow of endorsements from her Democratic peers, one voice was missing – Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the only Palestinian American in Congress. Given Biden’s unwavering support for Israel despite nationwide protests boycotts, and significant pushback against his now-ceded presidential campaign, Tlaib’s voice has become increasingly important in Congress, even despite her censure in the House.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tlaib finally broke her silence, and rather than endorse Harris, advocated for an open convention, and for the DNC to call for “an arms embargo to stop the Israeli government’s war crimes.” Her act was one of bravery and dedication to both the Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and the community of Arab Americans that she represents at home (Michigan has the largest Arab American population by density), but she has been met with backlash. Some of the same people who have been advocating for Gaza have turned around and attacked Tlaib for derailing the campaign effort. This is absurd.\n\nThe hard line for many voters against Biden for the last eight months has been his complicity and in many cases active participation in the massive loss of life and destruction occurring in Gaza. Some absolve Kamala of this as she sidestepped Biden to call for a six-week ceasefire in March, and refused to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial visit to Congress.\n\nBut let us not forget that she is in fact part of the Biden administration. The same administration that has sent several multi-billion-dollar aid packages to Israel, despite our own budget deficit and while Americans suffer from an affordable housing crisis among other issues. Although she called for the temporary ceasefire, Harris has not taken an aggressive stance on Israel’s actions in Gaza, or any potential embargoes or sanctions, as Tlaib has called for.\n\nWho are we to tell the only Palestinian American in Congress, someone who is in a position of power to raise concerns about the last eight months to the right ears, what is best for her people? Why are we idolizing Kamala Harris?\n\nHarris may be best bet to defeat Trump, but criticism is valid\n\nI understand the desperation, and that Harris is likely Democrats' best shot at beating Trump. The prospect of a younger leader, more skilled than Trump in debate, and the potential for the first African American woman, and South Asian in the presidency is exciting. She also begins her campaign with historical support. In just three days she has secured all 1,976 of the delegates needed for the Democratic nomination.\n\nA Zoom call with over 44,000 Black women in attendance, including members of Congress and Rev. Bernice King, daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King, raised $1.5 million for Harris’ campaign, and in just 24 hours, Harris accrued a total of $81 million dollars, the fastest in history. She has also gained the support of top Democratic leaders such as Nancy Pelosi, and several congressional caucuses. Harris’ candidacy has tipped the scales and made a nearly hopeless election seem more feasible for Democrats.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, she is a politician, and there is no such thing as a “good” politician. Some are better than others, but all have flaws, and when you are in a position of power such as Harris’, mistakes can be the difference between life and death for your constituents.\n\nWhen we idolize Harris, or any politician for that matter, it leads to a very dangerous ideology where we turn a blind eye to their wrongdoings. When we don’t hold people in positions of power accountable, both they and the public become complacent. This is how we go from election cycle to election cycle without anything changing or even becoming worse.\n\nI do not have internalized racism or misogyny. I am not trying to bring a Black woman down. I am not trying to pave the way for a Trump win. I am just saying let us not lose sight of the fact that Harris is not faultless. We can vote for her, and still actively question and criticize who we are putting in the highest office in the land. And those who have made up their minds on whether they will vote for her because they have lost dozens of their family members in Gaza, or because they experienced her policies as California’s attorney general firsthand should be allowed to do so without being attacked.\n\nIf anything, Harris should be open to criticism if she wants to work to differentiate herself from the Biden administration in the last four months until the election. If you want her to have a better chance at capturing voters, and in turn enacting real, lasting change during her presidency, stop attacking any commentary that is not immediately supportive.\n\nElena Wilson is a summer intern on The Tennessean's opinion and engagement journalism team.

The Democrats currently control the House by a small margin, while the Senate is split evenly, with Vice-President Kamala Harris holding the deciding vote. But Biden faces the very real possibility of losing control of both houses.\n\nWill the midterms impact the 2024 vote?\n\nMidterms are “almost always a referendum on the incumbent president”, said The Washington Post. Although the re-election of Biden won’t be on the table for another two years, the midterm results will reflect how Americans feel about his performance so far.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, the Republicans lost 42 seats in Congress, and Donald Trump went on to lose the 2020 presidential race.\n\nOn the other hand, “two years is a lifetime in politics”, said political analysis website FiveThirtyEight. A lot can and almost certainly will happen between now and 2024, with the continuing fallout of Covid, the war in Ukraine and the predicted recession likely to have significant impacts.\n\nThe candidates for the 2024 election are also undecided. Although the race looks likely to be between Biden and Trump, the latter has yet to announce his formal bid, while the incumbent will be 82 just after the 2024 election – a major cause of concern among many Democrats.\n\nAxios reported that Trump is gearing up to announce another run for the presidency, in an attempt to “surf the GOP’s expected post-midterm euphoria” and “build momentum for his own effort to retake the White House”. Trump could launch his presidential campaign on 14 November, the news site reported.\n\nBiden is also yet to formally declare a run for re-election, but has been “quietly” preparing a “potential 2024 reelection bid” with a “small group” of senior advisers, reported The Washington Post.\n\nGerrymandering – the political manipulation of electoral district boundaries – has also drastically changed the playing field in the midterms, with both parties “redistricting” to increase their chances of winning.\n\nWhat the midterms will definitely determine is whether Biden will struggle to pass bills over the next two years. Since assuming office in January 2021, the president’s power has been curtailed by the Democrats’ narrow majority, stalling legislation on issues including gun control and voting rights.\n\nWhat is the expected result?\n\nThe final national NBC News poll ahead of the midterms found a “highly competitive campaign landscape” as Democratic voters “pulled even” with Republicans in terms of their interest in the elections.\n\nPolling suggests that both Democrats and Republicans are highly interested in the vote, with 73% of voters from both parties registering either a “9” or “10” on a 10-point scale, said NBC.\n\nSome 48% of voters said that they would prefer a Democratic controlled Congress as the outcome of Tuesday’s vote, while 47% prefer Republicans to be in charge. This is a “reversal from October” when 48% wanted to see the GOP gain control of Congress, while 47% wanted Democrats to have overall control. However, “the shift is well within the poll’s margin of error”, said the news site.\n\nMidterm elections frequently “favour the party that is out of power”, said Jeffrey M. Jones and Lydia Saad in their analysis for Gallup, “and if that pattern holds, the Republican Party will win back their majority in the US House of Representatives, if not also the US Senate”.\n\nIts analysis found that “all national mood indicators similar to, if not worse than, what they have been in other years when the incumbent party fared poorly in midterms”, pointing to some major victories on the horizon for the GOP. As the US heads into the midterms “40% of Americans approve of the job Joe Biden is doing as president, 17% are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. 49% describe the health of the economy as poor (compared with 14% saying it is excellent or good), and 21% approve of the job the Democratically led Congress is doing”, said the pollster.\n\nAccording to the latest analysis from FiveThirtyEight, the Republicans are poised to win control of the House of Representatives, with their statistical model – which simulates the election 40,000 times using polling data – returning a Republican victory in the House 82 times out of 100.\n\nBut the model suggests a “dead heat” between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to control of the Senate, with the pollster describing the race as a “toss-up”. The modelling suggests a roughly 50/50 split in the number of wins secured by each party in 100 simulations of the race.\n\nWhile the Democrats hold a narrow majority in the House, with 221 seats (218 is the minimum for a majority), compared to 212 held by Republicans, the GOP came close to toppling the Democrats’ majority in 2018. With the 2022 playing field transformed due to redistricting – the redrawing of electoral boundaries – many analysts believe the GOP could succeed in that goal this time round.\n\nBut there have been glimmers of hope for the Democrats. In five special congressional elections (where the incumbent has either resigned or died) since the Supreme Court controversially overturned Roe vs. Wade in June, a party representative has triumphed and overperformed the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nWhere are the tightest competitions?\n\nThe five “toss-up” states in the Senate race are Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In 2020, Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes, becoming the first Democratic nominee to triumph in the southern state since Bill Clinton in 1992. But “Georgia is about as purple as it comes now”, said NPR, in a reference to the colour used to denote a swing state.\n\nGeorgia’s Senate race is set to be a “nail-biter” between incumbent Democratic senator Raphael Warnock and his Republican rival, ex-NFL player Herschel Walker, who has Trump’s backing. Warnock is pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church – “the same post once held by Dr Martin Luther King Jr” – and is tipped for a narrow win, but the contest “has remained close”, the news site continued.\n\nThe GOP may also lose Pennsylvania, a seat currently held by the Republicans, after nominating controversial television doctor Mehmet Oz. Even though his Democrat opponent, John Fetterman, suffered a stroke “that kept him off the campaign trail for months”, Oz has been unable to effectively “pierce Fetterman’s brand”, NPR added. This is “despite a halting performance” from Fetterman at last week’s debate with Oz “that raised questions about his health”, said The Hill.\n\nWhat will prove the decisive factors?\n\nThreats to democracy and the economy were high on the list of voter issues when polled by NBC this week. When voters were asked what they considered the most important issue facing the US, 23% answered with “threats to democracy”, 20% said jobs and the economy, and 17% replied with the cost of living, according to polling.\n\nWhen asked which issues were more important in deciding their vote, “50% of voters said a candidate’s position on abortion, threats to democracy and addressing the cost of living by raising taxes on corporations” – issues which largely echo Democratic messaging – compared to “44% who picked a candidate’s position on crime, the situation at the border and addressing the cost of living by cutting government spending”, echoing Republican messaging, said NBC.\n\n“The mood is dark in America”, with the atmosphere on the campaign trail “one of fear” among voters who believe the country is “on the brink”, said Sky’s international affairs editor Dominic Waghorn.\n\nAnd it is “not just a fear of the other side winning”. Democrats are terrified that democracy in the US is “about to be subverted” as “people who claim the electoral system is rigged are running for key positions that will give them power over that system”. Meanwhile, Republican voters are “equally passionate” in their fears that the US is “being taken in the wrong direction by elites that are unaware how much the ordinary American is hurting”.\n\nThere has been a febrile atmosphere in the US in the run up to the midterms, with the “fault lines” in American society now running “alarmingly deep”, said Sky News US correspondent Mark Stone. “It would be wrong to think America can just muddle its way through this inflection point in its history”, he said, noting that “recent polling suggests that a growing number of Americans believe political violence is acceptable”.\n\nThe Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was apparently targeted at her San Francisco home, where her husband was seriously injured by a hammer-wielding assailant.\n\nThe attacker reportedly searched for her at one point during the assault, shouting: “Where is Nancy?

I was sceptical before the recent congressional sessions, said Max Boot in The Washington Post. “What more is there to be said, I wondered?”\n\nThe evidence of Donald Trump’s guilt in inciting an insurrection was so glaring that it was hard to see what a select committee could add. It’s not like Watergate, “where the scandal happened behind closed doors. The entire nation saw Trump’s incendiary remarks and tweets, and the riot that followed, on national television.” But these hearings have proved more than justified. They’ve been forensic and gripping. There has been no “grandstanding”, no petty point-scoring; just facts, explanations and “the relentless march of evidence”.\n\nWe heard how Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr, called him “detached from reality”, said Quinta Jurecic in The Atlantic. We heard how family members and advisers pleaded with him to call off the mob, insisting there was no evidence of electoral fraud. We saw fresh footage of rioters attacking police and chanting “Hang Mike Pence” – a fate Trump reportedly said his vice-president deserved. In live testimony, a Capitol police officer described “slipping in people’s blood” amid “hours of hand-to-hand combat” that left her and more than 140 officers injured. Some 20 million people tuned in for the first hearings, which were crafted with the help of a former president of ABC News into what The New York Times described as something akin to “a documentary or a must-watch mini-series”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But the Democrats are “delusional if they think hysterically dramatising the events of that sad day will help them in the midterms or move the dial one iota on public perception of the Biden administration’s failures”. The clear aim of these hearings is to make sure that Trump is never elected again, said Marc A. Thiessen in The Washington Post, but they may have the reverse effect. Voters have more pressing concerns right now. Many will be asking: “Why are these people rehashing 6 Jan when I have to choose between filling my gas tank and feeding my family?”\n\nThe hearings are unlikely to rescue the Democrats from a midterm drubbing, agreed Jonah Goldberg in the Los Angeles Times. They’ve benefitted US democracy, though, by creating “a safe space” for some Republicans to acknowledge what actually happened, and distance themselves from Trump’s stolen-election lie. Another useful function of these hearings, said Neal K. Katyal in The New York Times, has been to lay the foundation for a future criminal case against Trump. Attorney General Merrick Garland surely has to bring charges now. The committee has laid out strong evidence that Trump committed “serious federal crimes”, including attempted obstruction of an official proceeding – in this case the 6 January vote certification. Trump could also be charged with wire fraud, for duping his own supporters into donating $250m to an “official election defence fund” to overturn the election, which never existed; the money was just lumped in with the rest of Trump’s war chest.\n\nGarland faces “an excruciatingly difficult decision”, said Ken Dilanian on NBC News. Filing charges against Trump could cause civil unrest, added Barbara McQuade, an NBC legal analyst and a former US attorney. No former president has ever been indicted, let alone by an opposing administration. But failing to hold him accountable for his attempt to subvert democracy could be “even worse”.", "authors": ["The Week", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Richard Windsor", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Rafi Schwartz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/957403/us-presidential-election-2024-the-possible-democratic-candidates", "title": "2024 presidential candidates | The Week", "text": "Election Day 2024 will be here before we know it, and a once-crowded presidential field has now narrowed to its final contestants.

Nothing more sacred,\" the president said at the start of a three-minute launch video. \"Around the country, MAGA extremists are lining up to take down those bedrock freedoms.\" This is \"not a time to be complacent,\" he continued, \"and that's why I'm running for re-election.\" Should the president succeed in reclaiming the White House, he will be 86 at the end of his second term.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, Biden secured enough delegates to clinch the Democratic Party's nomination, setting him up for a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Trump will carry the banner of the Republican Party into the general election on the back of 88 criminal indictments against him.\n\nMarianne Williamson (D) — odds of winning: not displayed\n\nCall it a comeback (or not), but Marianne Williamson is not giving up the Democratic nomination without a fight. Her unsuccessful 2020 bid saw Williamson drop out of the race almost a full year before election day, and she did the same in 2024 — for a while. Following a third-place finish in the Democratic primary in Michigan, Williamson unsuspended her campaign in a rare reentry into the presidential race. Williamson had dropped out \"because I was losing the horse race, but something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond,\" the candidate said in a video on X . Like most of the remaining candidates beyond Biden and Trump, however, Williamson's chances of winning the White House are believed to be low, and her name is not even listed among the betting candidates on Oddschecker's presidential odds.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. (I) — odds of winning: +3,300\n\nAn environmental lawyer as well as the son of late U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy — yes, that one — RFK Jr. is perhaps best known for his support of anti-vaccine rhetoric, beliefs that have been vehemently denounced by his own family. After initially launching his White House bid in conjunction with the Democratic Party, Kennedy in October switched to independent, which could complicate things for both Biden and Trump alike .\n\nThe aforementioned condemnation by his own family has made him an outlier among the Democratic tentpoles. RFK Jr.'s nephew, Jack Schlossberg, said his uncle was \"trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain,\" calling his candidacy \"an embarrassment.\" As the election creeps closer, RFK Jr. is believed to be courting a number of vice presidential candidates, with a Bay Area lawyer and the backer of an RFK Jr. Super Bowl ad, Nicole Shanahan, reportedly at the top of the list.\n\nCornel West (I) — odds of winning: +99,900\n\nPhilosopher, scholar and activist Cornel West raised the perennial debate over third-party spoilers when he announced a run for president alongside the People's Party, then the Green Party, and now as an independent. \"People are hungry for change,\" West wrote on X when announcing his switch to run as an independent. \"They want good policies over partisan politics. We need to break the grip of the duopoly and give power to the people.\"\n\nLike RFK Jr., though, his run as an independent means West is unlikely to travel very far in his presidential aspirations. He has recently been using the events of the Israel-Hamas war as a catalyst to draw in Muslim and Arab American voters, many of whom have become disillusioned with the Biden administration's response to the war.\n\nChase Oliver (L) — odds of winning: not displayed\n\nChase Oliver , a libertarian, announced his candidacy in April 2023, per Ballotpedia . Speaking at the Iowa State Fair, the 2022 U.S. Senate candidate out of Georgia described himself as \"armed and gay,\" and urged a \"cultural war ceasefire,\" per the Des Moines Register . \"I don't care how you live, who you love, how you worship, how you express yourself, if you do it in peace, that's your business, not the government's,\" he said. Oliver is also pro-choice, supports the legalization of marijuana, and wants to see an increased focus on combating addiction and drug use in the U.S. Like Williamson, his odds of winning are so low that they are not displayed on Oddschecker.\n\nDropped out\n\nWill Hurd (R), former congressman from Texas: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nFrancis Suarez (R), mayor of Miami, Florida: dropped out of the race in August 2023 after promising to do so after failing to secure a spot in the first GOP debate.\n\nLarry Elder (R), conservative political commentator and radio host: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nPerry Johnson (R), businessman and former gubernatorial candidate: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence (R), former vice president: dropped out of the race in October 2023, saying it was \"not my time.\"\n\nTim Scott (R), South Carolina senator: dropped out of the race in November 2023 during a surprise announcement on Fox News.\n\nCorey Stapleton (R), former Montana secretary of state: dropped out of the race in October 2023.\n\nDoug Burgum (R), governor of North Dakota: dropped out of the race in December 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nChris Christie (R), former New Jersey governor: dropped out of the race in January 2024 and said he would not \"enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again.\"\n\nAsa Hutchinson (R), former Arkansas governor: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after getting less than 200 votes in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy (R), businessman and entrepreneur: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nRon DeSantis (R), governor of Florida: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nNikki Haley (R), former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador: dropped out of the race in March 2024 after a resounding defeat to Trump on Super Tuesday.\n\nRyan Binkley (R), pastor and entrepreneur from Texas: dropped out of the race in February 2024 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nUpdated March 18, 2024: This article has been updated throughout.", "authors": ["Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Brigid Kennedy", "With Contributions From", "Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Irenie Forshaw", "Rafi Schwartz", "Susan Caskie", "Peter Weber"], "publish_date": "2024/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/20/queen-prairie-sports-bubble-bursts-reactor-overhaul-news-around-states/50112783/", "title": "'Queen of the Prairie,' sports bubble bursts: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Plaintiffs in lawsuits challenging the state’s law criminalizing medical treatment for transgender youth plan to file a new suit after withdrawing two actions Friday. Melody Eagan, an attorney with Birmingham-based Lightfoot, Franklin and White, which represented two families and two physicians in a lawsuit titled Ladinsky v. Ivey, wrote in an email Monday that they planned to “file a new case in the immediate future” against SB 184. Gov. Kay Ivey signed the law April 8; it will take effect in early May. “We promptly filed a lawsuit on behalf of two families and two doctors on the day Governor Ivey signed the bill,” Eagan wrote. “After filing that case, we are hearing from numerous Alabama families, including patients facing loss of critical medical care and parents facing potential criminal penalties. We also are hearing from numerous medical providers and others who care for transgender youth.” The law subjects doctors who prescribe puberty blockers and hormones to transgender youth to a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It also forbids public and private school personnel from withholding information about a student’s confusion over their gender identity and bans genital surgeries (except circumcisions) on minors. Health professionals have said surgeons don’t perform those procedures on youth in Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials have purchased a gondola in Austria for a city-owned ski area in Alaska’s capital city, but questions remain about the installation and long-term plans for the gondola. City officials have expressed interest in working with an Alaska Native corporation on the project. Eaglecrest Ski Area’s general manager and a city project manager recently visited a ski area in Austria to examine the lift and sign a sale agreement for $1.33 million, the Juneau Empire reports. Deputy City Manager Robert Barr said the city is seeking bids from transport companies to bring the gondola to Juneau. Eaglecrest has said its leaders have been looking for ways to expand summer operations and create opportunities for a more sustainable year-round model. The ski area, on its website, said it would work with planners, engineers and contractors on the best placement for the new infrastructure. Eaglecrest is on Douglas Island. City leaders last week authorized City Manager Rorie Watt to negotiate an agreement with Goldbelt Inc., an Alaska Native corporation that operates a tram near downtown Juneau and owns land near Eaglecrest. Watt, in a memo to the city’s Assembly, said Goldbelt has expressed interest in providing funding for up to $10 million for the installation of the gondola and “other related improvements.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Metro-area eviction filings are climbing back to pre-pandemic levels despite hundreds of millions of dollars in rental aid going to landlords. Moratoriums helped keep many Valley renters in their homes, but those are over. Now tenants, some still trying to pay back rent after struggling during COVID-19, are also facing skyrocketing rents and wages that aren’t keeping up. And Maricopa County renters who had evictions filed against them during the pandemic are facing record judgments despite all that relief money funneled to landlords. Housing researchers and tenant advocates say the rent-income gap, the lightning speed of Arizona’s eviction process and a lack of legal support for renters led to an eviction crisis in the Phoenix area that started even before the pandemic. An Arizona Republic analysis found eviction filings in Maricopa County hit a five-year high in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, February and March of this year, Valley evictions reached about 91% of filings from the first three months of 2019. About 65,000 Arizona renters believe they will likely be evicted in the next two months, according to the latest Census Pulse Survey. State law allows a landlord to initiate an eviction as soon as five days after a tenant misses rent, and the tenant is typically locked out within three weeks of filing.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders continues to far outpace her rivals in fundraising and spending for her bid for governor, the latest campaign finance reports show. Sanders, the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, reported raising more than $680,000 last month in her bid for Arkansas governor by Friday’s deadline for monthly campaign finance reports. She faces former talk radio host and podcaster Doc Washburn in next month’s Republican primary. Sanders spent more than $834,000 during the month and reported having nearly $7.4 million on hand. Sanders has raised more than $14 million since announcing her candidacy last year, a record for a governor’s race in the state. Sanders’ closest rival among the Democrats, Chris Jones, raised more than $120,000 in March and spent more than $213,000. Jones’ campaign reported having nearly $94,000 on hand. Jones faces Anthony Bland, Jay Martin, James “Rus” Russell and Supha Xayprasith-Mays in next month’s Democratic primary. Term limits bar Republican incumbent Asa Hutchinson from seeking reelection.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $1.8 billion facility intended to connect Metro light-rail lines under downtown Los Angeles is 90% complete, and test runs of trains are underway, officials said Monday. The Regional Connector Project was designed to save commuters’ time by eliminating transfers between trains, allowing one-seat rides across Los Angeles County. “The trackwork, the rail guideways, the platform areas are now complete,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a press conference. “We’ve been waiting for like 10 years.” County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, board chair of the Los Angeles County Transportation Authority, said the connector will open later this year. The overall project is a 1.9-mile underground light-rail extension connecting the A, E and L lines and three new stations, including the Grand Av Arts/Bunker Hill Station about 100 feet beneath ground level.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state is expecting the birth of another litter of wolf pups any day now, creating both excitement and concern over the natural rebirth of a predator with a long, human-induced absence from the state. The breeding pair of wolves that naturally migrated into the state last year formed the pack north of Walden in Jackson County with the birth of six pups. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials had watched the pups for some time before announcing their birth in early June as the first litter of wolf pups born in the state in several decades. And soon that pack could grow, as wolves typically have pups from mid-April through mid-May. State wildlife officials said staff have not seen evidence of denning behavior or any sign of a new litter from the pack this year. “How could it get any better that soon we will see more pups,” said Dale Baker, a wolf advocate from Fort Collins who volunteered to watch North Park rancher Don Gittleson’s cattle herd after Gittleson lost three cows to the wolfpack. “The folks in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming had a big outcry when they brought wolves there, but now that this is naturally happening here, it seems like there should be less of an outcry.” Gittleson said the pack’s adult female was observed in heat, ready to mate in a pasture on his property in February.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city’s aging housing is creating public health concerns on top of squeezing a tight market. Shiela Hayes, president of the NAACP Norwich Branch, said the pandemic laid bare the importance of having the city address housing quality. “We can no longer act like that neighborhood, or that section, or that backstreet (can) continue to be underperforming housing stock; we don’t have that kind of luxury,” Hayes said. The majority of resident-owned homes in the state are 60 years or older, said Sam Giffin, a policy and data analyst for the Hartford-based Open Communities Alliance, as housing production has fallen since the baby boom – more so in Connecticut than in other parts of New England. Some of the risks that come from older houses include paint and other sources of lead. “There’s concern across the state that our old housing stock is a concern to both health and safety,” Giffin said. Hayes said Norwich has a lot of older housing, especially in Greenville, Taftville and downtown, where there are cheaper, privately held, multi-rental units converted from single-family homes. “They’re old, and they take a lot of maintenance,” Hayes said. Maintenance is usually not a matter of upgrading a single unit but multiple units at the same time, which means more money must be spent to get them up to code.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: President Joe Biden will return to his alma mater to give the commencement speech at the University of Delaware graduation in May, the university announced Tuesday. It’s the first time a sitting president will speak at a UD graduation ceremony. Biden is no stranger to visiting UD or giving graduation speeches there. May’s ceremony will be his fifth time speaking at commencement at the school – last in 2014, while serving as vice president. “(Biden’s) commitment to a lifetime of public service is an inspiring example for our graduates, as well as all our students and alumni, of what they can accomplish with a UD education, whatever path they may choose in life,” University President Dennis Assanis said in a statement. Students and their guests should expect heightened security at the graduation ceremony, UD spokeswoman Andrea Boyle Tippett said. Secret Service members will also likely visit campus to prepare with UD Police Department officers prior to the president’s arrival. The ceremony to honor this year’s 4,000-student graduating class is slated to start at 9:30 a.m. at Delaware Stadium on May 28. The event will also be livestreamed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Museum of American History is opening a permanent entertainment exhibit in December, WUSA-TV reports. “Through the National Museum of American History’s extraordinary collection of theater, music, sports, movie and television objects, the exhibition Entertainment Nation will feature a powerful, ever-changing selection of objects and interactive experiences,” the museum said in a press release. “Through the objects and their stories, the exhibition will explore how, for over 150 years, entertainment has provided a forum for important national conversations about who we are, and who we want to be.” Some of the items set to go on display can be previewed online, including pop culture relics like Prince’s yellow “cloud” guitar, Muhammad Ali’s boxing robe, and Tejana singer Selena’s leather jacket and pants. The goal is to highlight how entertainment has shaped the nation’s society and shine a light on entertainers who have broken barriers. The permanent bilingual exhibit is set to open Dec. 9.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Department of Education rejected more than 50 mathematics textbooks – about 40% of those submitted – for failing to meet Florida’s new learning standards or because they “contained prohibited topics” that included references to critical race theory. Now, the only publisher approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the department for K-5 mathematics is Houston, Texas-based Accelerate Learning. “In the subject area as large as mathematics for grades K through five, it is unusual for there only to be one publisher to choose from,” said Billy Epting, assistant superintendent for academic services for Leon County Schools. DOE said more than half the textbooks being disallowed incorporated “prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies, including CRT,” which is an academic framework that is rarely seen outside of higher education. The term has become a highly charged catch-all buzzword for discussion of diversity of inclusion. Other books were not allowed because publishers “rebranded” Common Core Standards. DeSantis has taken a lead role nationally in Republican efforts to aggressively push back against liberal cultural values and what he calls “woke indoctrination.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Students at Druid Hills High School put together a short documentary video, shot on iPhones, to show the troubling conditions inside their learning environment. The video opens with a student explaining how human waste flows up from the ground and floods an area where he and his friends eat lunch. The high schoolers’ footage shows the classrooms, hallways and bathrooms crumbling around them. Plaster falls off walls, and water drips around electrical outlets. So much water has leaked into the weight room that it oozes up from the floor when a student steps on it. Another student demonstrates how one of the holes in a ceiling is so large that he can put his entire hand through it. “You can tell someone about the conditions, but when you visually see it, it’s a lot more impactful,” sophomore Harley Martz, one of the video’s producers, told the Associated Press in an interview. “Some of the things we pointed out in the video are very undeniable.” In the video, Druid Hills junior Montrice Berry describes the assault on the senses: “As you walk through the school now, you can smell the mold, and it’s kind of really nasty. So I tend to walk outside just so I can avoid the smell.” The video, which has garnered more than 40,000 views since it was posted on YouTube this month, has prompted outrage among some parents in the suburban area just east of Atlanta who want repairs made. It was produced after the DeKalb County School Board in February removed Druid Hills from a list of schools in need of priority renovations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal authorities have begun monitoring the state’s wastewater for COVID-19, while Hawaii expects its own monitoring program to be fully operational this summer, officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been testing in the islands as part of its National Wastewater Surveillance System, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The agency posts wastewater data on its COVID Data Tracker website, denoted by dots on a U.S. map. Data from Hawaii hasn’t been included yet due to “a technical glitch being resolved with how the points are displayed on the map,” said CDC spokesperson Nick Spinelli. The agency said it would also display data from the Hawaii Department of Health once the state is able to submit its own figures. More than 30 states have been funded to participate in the CDC program, but some are still getting their collection efforts up and running. Several issues delayed Hawaii’s early plans to set up its own statewide monitoring program. The state faced a six-month wait for shipment of sample-collection machines, which were back-ordered due to high demand. Federal funds paid for the the monitoring equipment at a cost of about $100,000. The equipment is now in place, as are protocols.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory have completed a rare overhaul of one of the world’s most powerful nuclear test reactors, and normal operations are expected to resume later this spring, officials said Monday. The 11-month outage at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Test Reactor in eastern Idaho allowed a core overhaul that’s done, on average, about every 10 years. The change-out was the sixth since the reactor started operating in 1967 and the first in 17 years. “Overall, I’m very pleased with the ATR workforce and teamwork they demonstrated during the longest and most complex outage in our history,” said Sean O’Kelly, associate lab director for the Idaho National Laboratory’s Advanced Test Reactor Complex. He said the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues caused some delays beyond the best-case scenario of completing the work in nine months. Experiments at the reactor help the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered war fleet stay at sea longer, bolster NASA’s space exploration, and advance lifesaving medical treatments. The reactor also plays a key role in the effort to keep commercial nuclear power plants running longer and creating new and safer reactors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reactor is now going through readiness assessments, instrument calibrations and low-power system checks.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal authorities on Monday said they will not criminally charge Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting death of Black teenager Laquan McDonald. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago said in a news release that the decision was made after consulting with the McDonald family and that the “family was in agreement not to pursue a second prosecution.” According to the release, prosecuting Van Dyke on federal charges would have been much more difficult than it was to prosecute him in state court because the burden of proof is far higher. Federal prosecutors “would have to prove not only that Mr. Van Dyke acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids, but also that his actions were not the result of mistake, fear, negligence, or bad judgment,” the office said in the release. “It requires federal prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what Mr. Van Dyke was thinking when he used deadly force, and that he knew such force was excessive.” Van Dyke, who was captured on video shooting the teenager 16 times, was convicted in Chicago in 2018 of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to 81 months in state prison. The former officer served less than half that sentence before he was released from prison in February.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: A priest who was “suspended from public ministry” last month is suing a man who came forward with allegations about the priest’s behavior. James De Oreo, who was an associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, was suspended March 11 after allegations of “inappropriate conduct with a minor.” The priest filed a lawsuit April 4 against the man who wrote two letters in 2021 to the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana about De Oreo’s behavior toward him when he was a teen attending St. Alphonsus Liguori Catholic Church in Zionsville. The man said he was considering becoming a priest, and De Oreo used his position of power to emotionally abuse, sexually harass and groom him for sexual abuse. This led to an eating disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as “extreme emotional distress” from acts that his lawyer said were intentional and preventable. In the lawsuit, De Oreo disputed the man’s claims and said there was no “intentional infliction of emotional distress.” He said the man’s allegations could lead to “irreparable harm” that would prevent him from participating in parish ministry and doing his job. Diocese spokesperson Gabby Hlavek confirmed the diocese was aware of the De Oreo’s lawsuit but didn’t comment further.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A ride at an amusement park where an 11-year-old boy died last summer will not reopen this year, the park’s new owners said. Bill Lentz, general manager of Adventureland in Altoona, said officials have not determined if the Raging River ride will ever reopen. Michael Jaramillo died and his brother and father were injured July 3, 2021, after their raft overturned and trapped them in the water. Park owner Palace Entertainment has hired the ride’s original maker, Intamin Amusement Rides, to determine what would be needed to make the ride safe, Lentz said. That project could take several months, he said. Palace Entertainment, the U.S. subsidiary of Madrid-based Parques Reunidos, bought the almost 48-year-old theme park in December. Ryan Best, the attorney representing the Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, said recently that his clients believe the ride should never be reopened. The Iowa Division of Labor, which licenses amusement park rides, required Adventureland to make several changes and receive approval from the ride’s manufacturer or a certified engineer to reopen the ride.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Under legislation signed Monday by Gov. Laura Kelly, fairgoers will be able to more widely consume adult beverages at the Kansas State Fair. The proposal, Senate Bill 2, will allow beer and wine to be consumed outside designated areas. The fairground’s current liquor policy confines drinking to the grandstands and certain beer gardens throughout the property. It will also pave the way for the sale of hard liquor. Fair officials have not yet determined if the policies will be in place for the 2022 edition of the fair, scheduled to take place Sept. 9-18, or if they will instead roll out next year. The policy was intended to help the fair recoup revenue lost after the 2020 event was canceled due to COVID-19. Legislative proponents of the bill also argued it was in line with what consumers were demanding from the event. “People wanted to have more wine and more outlets at the state fairground. They also wanted spirits,” Rep. Louis Ruiz, D-Kansas City, said on the floor of the Kansas House. “They wanted to walk around to look at animals ...with a daiquiri.” But the move was not without its critics, some of whom argued making liquor more readily accessible would harm the fair’s family-friendly nature. Some Wichita-area lawmakers pointed to the city’s vaunted Riverfest festival, which opted to expand liquor sales, dividing residents.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The National Corvette Museum says it’s adding an education gallery that will feature artifacts and interactive technology to share the brand’s story. Construction of the 2,000-square-foot gallery is set to begin in late May, museum officials said. The gallery is scheduled to open late this year or in early 2023 at the Bowling Green-based museum. “This new gallery will educate, engage and entertain our guests,” said Sharon Brawner, the museum’s president and CEO. The gallery will provide a state-of-the-art educational experience geared toward the next generation of Corvette enthusiasts, the museum said. “The new education gallery will be designed for both children and adults to enjoy, featuring artifacts and interactive technology celebrating the unique story of Corvette,” said museum educator Deb Howard. The project was made possible through the generosity of donors Tim and Melanie McMichael of Gypsum, Colorado, the museum said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to let New Orleans adopt a set of gun control measures than are stronger than the state currently allows was overwhelmingly rejected Tuesday by a state House panel. The Criminal Justice Committee voted 9-1 against the measure by state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, despite calls for passage from a City Council member, a deputy chief of the police department and District Attorney Jason Williams. Among the specified laws the city would have been allowed to pass were the bill to become law: a requirement that loss or theft of firearms be reported to police, prohibition against openly carrying firearms at public events requiring government permits, and prohibition on carrying firearms where alcohol is being served. Backers of the bill said it would help fight increasing violent crime by helping prevent gun trafficking or the use of guns at large events where alcohol is consumed, in a city known for festivals and Bourbon Street nightlife. “At the end of the day, we’re asking this committee and the Legislature to allow New Orleans to carve out legislation that affects the unique problems that we have,” said City Council member Eugene Green. Gun control advocates said the laws the city sought to pass would be ineffective and slammed the bill as an attack on Second Amendment rights.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The arrival of the first large cruise ship in two and a half years in Maine is another signal tourism is getting closer to pre-pandemic normalcy. Last year, more than 15.6 million visitors came to the state – a third more than made the trip the year before, at the start of the pandemic, officials said. But there were no large cruise ships until the arrival of the Norwegian Pearl in the waters off Bar Harbor. The ship dropped anchor in Frenchman Bay, and visitors were ferried to shore on tenders. “It’s exciting to see these ships and their passengers coming back to Maine,” said Sarah Flink, executive director of CruiseMaine. Cruise ships could restore some visitation. The number of visitors last year remained about a million below 2019, before the pandemic. Cruise ships made 409 port calls and brought 450,000 passengers in 2019. One positive sign from the 2021 tourism numbers is that spending soared. Spending grew 63.7% from 2020 and 20.3% from 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A former small-city mayor who admitted to posting nude photos of his ex-girlfriend on Reddit will not have to spend time behind bars under a plea deal announced by the state prosecutor’s office on Monday. Former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing revenge porn online and was sentenced to a year and a day for each of the five counts, with all the incarceration time suspended. He also was sentenced to three years of supervised probation and fined $1,000 for each count. Bradshaw was ordered to pay $750 in restitution to the victim and to perform 100 hours of community service. The ex-mayor had faced a maximum penalty of two years’ incarceration and a $5,000 fine for each count. Bradshaw pleaded guilty to posting nude photos of a woman with whom he was once in a relationship after the relationship had ended. The woman contacted authorities in May after learning the photos were posted on Reddit. She told authorities she had sent the photos only to Bradshaw while they were in an intimate relationship, and she didn’t give him permission to redistribute them. Investigators discovered Bradshaw had made numerous separate public posts that contained at least 10 unique visual representations of the victim, many with language related to humiliation and degradation, the state prosecutor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shooting at an MBTA station in the city left one person injured Monday, according to transit police. Officers were called to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Ruggles Station shortly after 6 p.m. on reports of shots fired. At an area where buses stop for passengers, officers found a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. The man was taken to a hospital with injuries that were considered serious but not life-threatening, police said. No arrests had been made in the shooting. Police said they were investigating and would continue to look for suspects. Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden denounced the shooting and said gun violence “is something that we’ve really got to lay a hold of and take care of.” “Every time there’s a shooting, there are multiple victims,” Hayden said, according to WCVB-TV. “There’s obviously the victim that’s shot, but there’s also the community at large.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state has reached a 19.3% recycling rate, an increase of 35.4% from prior to 2019, according to an analysis the state of Michigan released Monday ahead of Earth Day on Friday. Before 2019, the state estimated Michigan’s recycling rate, the rate at which recyclable materials are recycled from waste, was 14.25%. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy estimates the state now has a 35.4% recycling rate. Increasing access to recycling services has helped the state to increase recycling, EGLE Director Liesl Clark said at a news conference Monday. More than 75% of the state’s households have access to either curbside recycling bins or drop-off sites in their communities. The increase in recycling equals out to Michigan recycling 500,000 more tons of recyclable materials a year, according to EGLE. Since 2019, more than $460 million has been invested into technology for recycling and maintaining existing recycling infrastructure, Clark said, all in an effort to help Michigan reach its goals to fight climate change and reach a 45% recycling rate by 2030. This Thursday, the state will release a plan outlining a 30-year strategy to make Michigan a carbon neutral state by 2050. A rough draft of the plan was released earlier this year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Roseville School District has settled two federal lawsuits accusing a former second grade teacher of discriminating against Black students. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the district settled the cases privately, and terms were not disclosed. One case was settled last week and the other in January, according to court records. The lawsuits accused Geraldine Cook of making the Black students in her class sit apart from their peers in 2019. She allegedly grabbed a girl’s arm, tearing her shirt, and choked a boy after he gargled water and made him walk to the principal’s office with his hands behind his back. The mothers of the girl whose shirt was torn and the boy who was choked filed the lawsuits. Cook taught at Harambee Elementary, a year-round racial integration school. She resigned in December 2019.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An assistant chief says the city’s police department is short-staffed, and recruitment and retention are big challenges. Joseph Wade of Jackson Police Department discussed staffing levels Monday during the City Council’s Public Safety Committee meeting, WLBT-TV reports. He said JPD is budgeted for 356 sworn officers but has 258. On the civilian side, JPD is budgeted for 199 employees and has 132. “I went to a leadership class in Ohio, and guess what? They’re having (retention issues),” he said. “It’s not a popular job right now.” JPD loses officers to smaller departments, where officers can earn comparable salaries but answer fewer calls, Wade said. He said the city needs to enforce a state law that would require departments to reimburse JPD for training costs of any officer it hires who has been with Jackson less than three years. Wade said JPD leaders appreciate the premium pay that the City Council approved for police department employees earlier this year. The assistant chief also suggested a signing bonus and a tuition reimbursement program for new officers. Capitol police officers, who work for the state Department of Public Safety, also patrol in parts of Jackson where state government buildings are located.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Regal fritillary butterflies, which subsist on violets and stick to prairie habitats, are disappearing. “They’ve almost been entirely lost from the eastern U.S.,” Chris Barnhart, distinguished professor of biology at Missouri State University, said of the vulnerable insect species. One-third of Missouri used to be covered in tallgrass prairie. Where there’s a decent patch of prairie, regal fritillary butterflies can be seen in good numbers, Barnhart said. However, without extra help, Missouri may lose the “Queen of the Prairie” altogether. MSU and the Missouri Department of Conservation are two years deep into a project to examine the reproduction and survival of the butterflies, developing methods to raise them in captivity and reintroducing them to suitable sites. Missouri has some of the highest numbers of these butterflies, Barnhart said during a tour of MSU’s Temple Hall greenhouse. Fifteen million acres of tallgrass prairie once covered Missouri, said Francis Skalicky, MDC spokesman. “Today, 99% of Missouri’s tallgrass prairie habitat has disappeared, and a number of species that depend on plants found in this habitat have been negatively impacted by the state’s dwindling prairie acreage,” Skalicky said. The regal fritillary butterflies are considered “a species of concern” and at a S3 level of endangerment, Skalicky said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The board of trustees of the state’s largest school district has voted to allow students additional time to graduate after a public campaign by the family of a student with Down syndrome who otherwise would not have been allowed to attend her senior year with her classmates. Under the policy passed Monday by a 5-3 vote, any student who does not turn 20 before Sept. 10 will be able to enroll in classes at Billings high schools. For students receiving special education services, enrollment will continue as long as the student hasn’t turned 21 before the Sept. 10 deadline, The Billings Gazette reports. The family of Emily Pennington had urged the school district to take advantage of a law passed by the Legislature in 2021 that offered some state funding for students who are receiving special education services to continue attending school as long as they had not turned 21 before Sept. 10 and had not graduated. Schools are not required to participate. Emily repeated kindergarten because she had been dealing with numerous medical issues. She will turn 19 in July, which would have made her ineligible to attend school this fall under the old policy. After the school board declined to hear Emily’s request for a change in the age-out policy, Billings West students staged a brief walk-out in support.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, a Democrat who served one term representing the state’s Omaha-centered district, died Tuesday morning. He was 72. Ashford’s family announced his death in a Facebook post, saying that “his death was peaceful though much too premature.” Just two months earlier, Ashford had revealed he was undergoing treatment for brain cancer. Ashford was a state senator from Omaha when he unseated longtime Republican incumbent Lee Terry to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Ashford lost the seat two years later to current GOP Rep. Don Bacon. He sought the seat again in 2018 but lost the Democratic primary to Kara Eastman. In 2020, his wife, Ann Ferlic Ashford, announced her candidacy for the seat, but she also lost the primary to Eastman. Brad Ashford shook up the general election race by endorsing Bacon over Eastman. An attorney and lifelong Omaha resident, he began his political career in the 1980s as a Democrat but switched parties several times over the years and pitched himself as an independent-minded moderate. Ashford earned his bachelor’s degree from Colgate University in 1971 and his law degree from Creighton University in Omaha in 1974. He worked as an attorney for the Federal Highway Administration in 1974 before opening a private practice the next year. In the 1990s, he became co-owner of the Nebraska Clothing Company.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Nevada office of the FBI has a new special agent in charge, with the announcement Monday that Spencer Evans will head the bureau’s Las Vegas field office. Evans has held various investigative and leadership positions since joining the FBI in 2004 as an agent in New Haven, Connecticut. His most recent post was as deputy assistant director in human resources at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In Las Vegas, Evans replaces Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse, who retired in February after 25 years with the bureau. Rouse arrived in the city in 2016 and headed the Nevada field office during the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that killed 58 people and became the deadliest in modern U.S. history. Two additional deaths later were attributed to the shooting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: A chemical company agreed Monday to providing drinking water to about 1,000 properties in the state that showed elevated levels of toxic industrial compounds associated with serious health conditions. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics announced the agreement for properties in the towns of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry and Merrimack. It also provides a framework should additional properties be affected. “Ensuring safe drinking water is something we take very seriously,” state Attorney General John Formella said in a statement. “This agreement is an important step forward in a continuing, multi-faceted effort to ensure impacted New Hampshire residents have access to clean drinking water.” A spokesperson for Saint-Gobain didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company, which bought the Merrimack plant from ChemFAB in 2000, initially believed it wasn’t emitting anything harmful. But the state said that changed in 2004 after the company installed more sophisticated technology and realized it was emitting the chemical. After the company alerted the state, DES determined Saint-Gobain was exceeding state air limits for the chemical, and the company agreed to significantly reduce emissions.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s robust sports betting market broke the $1 billion mark for the sixth time last month in terms of the amount of bets taken. But the news was bad in March for seven of the nine casinos that continued to lag behind their in-person gambling revenue levels from before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to figures released Monday by state gambling regulators. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the state’s casinos and three horse tracks that take sports bets handled over $1.12 billion worth of such wagers in March, aided by the March Madness college basketball tournament. Yet out of that total, only $66.4 million was kept as sports betting revenue by the casinos and tracks after paying off winning bets, third-party partners and other expenses. The casinos and tracks made $423.6 million in gambling and sports betting revenue in March, up nearly 18% from a year earlier. However, that comparison is flawed because in March 2021, Atlantic City’s casinos were still operating under state-imposed pandemic-related restrictions. Going back two years is also an invalid comparison because the casinos shut down in the middle of March 2020 as the pandemic originally surged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is getting married, and Vice President Kamala Harris has been picked to officiate. The first-term Democratic governor made the announcement through her personal spokesman Tuesday, saying a small ceremony will be held May 21 in Washington, D.C. No other details about the upcoming ceremony were released. Lujan Grisham, who is running for reelection, will be tying the knot with fiancé Manny Cordova. The couple have been together about 10 years, and Cordova was at her side during an inaugural Mass in Santa Fe before her public swearing-in ceremony Jan. 1, 2019. “We’re delighted to celebrate our wedding in front of family and close friends,” Lujan Grisham and Cordova said in a joint statement. “Like so many New Mexicans, we’ve postponed family celebrations over the past two years during this pandemic. We feel fortunate to be with our loved ones in celebration of our marriage.” The couple initially planned to get married in 2021 but had not set a date, said Jared Leopold, a spokesman for Lujan Grisham. Both Lujan Grisham, 62, and Cordova, 66, were previously married and have adult children and grandchildren. Lujan Grisham was married to her first husband, Gregory Grisham, for more than 20 years until his death in 2004. The son of ranchers, Cordova grew up in a rural community south of Albuquerque. He owns an auto repair shop in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nBinghamton: About 100,000 customers were without power Tuesday morning in upstate New York as a late-season storm dumped a foot or more of heavy, wet snow on some high-elevation areas. In the Binghamton area, Broome County Executive Jason Garnar declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban for nonessential workers. Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an interview on Binghamton radio station WNBF that listeners in the area should stay home if they could. “It was a very heavy snow. And as a result, the weight … is snapping these limbs, which is sad when you see your beautiful trees harmed like that,” Hochul said. “But it also can be dangerous for people walking on the streets or walking under power lines or if people are getting into their cars.” Some higher-elevation areas of the Southern Tier had up to 14 inches of snow, though accumulations were less for lower elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Binghamton. “That is pretty typical for a for a late-season storm; you’re going to have quite a bit of elevation dependency,” said meteorologist Bryan Greenblatt. Power outages stretched from the Southern Tier to the Adirondack Mountains, which was forecast to get up to a foot of snow by Tuesday night.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Buncombe County jail detainees have spent up to a week in group holding areas with no blankets, constant light, cold temperatures, and nowhere to sleep but hard surfaces, such as concrete floors, according to several people who spent time behind bars in the local facility. “There’s no cots; they don’t give you a blanket. Everyone is in flip-flops without socks. And all the drunk tanks were full. There’s 10 of you in there. And it’s all concrete,” said Eric Stimson, who said he spent five days trying to find ways to sleep and stay warm in a group cell with an overflowing toilet before being moved to a regular cell for the remainder of his 16-day DUI sentence in January. The harsh conditions were detailed by three detainees and confirmed by the Buncombe County chief public defender. They appear to represent direct violations of state rules meant to protect those in the custody of the jail, most of whom have not been convicted of crimes of which they are charged and are awaiting their day in court. Spokespeople for Sheriff Quentin Miller, who is responsible for managing the jail, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In an attempt to block out light to sleep and find some comfort, detainees took to stuffing their court papers behind COVID-19 masks to use as eye shields, Stimson said, adding that they would stack their slippers to create something like a pillow. As far as COVID-19 infection concerns go, “if you didn’t have COVID coming in, you’ve got it now,” he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: The future of Minot State University’s sports bubble is up in the air after a blizzard last week caused it to collapse. The university was forced to cancel all the activities that were scheduled in the bubble, which is on the grounds of the athletic facility. The bubble has been used as a fallback location for softball games when weather is poor, Minot Daily News reports. And MSU planned to hold a spring football game in the bubble, which is also used for various sports practices. The athletic staff is meeting this week to begin rescheduling and searching for other places to practice. Athletic director Andy Carter said the university is waiting for the company that supplied the bubble in 2016 to send representatives to assess the damage and how much it would cost to repair it. “It’s covered in snow now,” he said. “You can’t even really get to it right now.” He said a considerable amount of sporting equipment had been stored in the bubble. “It could be a big issue. We don’t even know because we can’t see it. So we don’t know if it’s damaged or it’s just sitting there under the tarp,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge has blocked early enforcement of an abortion law signed by Gov. Mike DeWine in December that included additional licensing requirements challenged by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood as unnecessarily onerous. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Alison Hatheway’s ruling Friday blocked restrictions imposed on two southwest Ohio clinics by the Ohio Department of Health that came before June 21. That date ends a 90-period for compliance that followed its original effective date of March 23. Hatheway issued a temporary restraining order against the law March 2, before it could take effect. The stated goal of the bill was to impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance of a baby born alive following an abortion attempt. However, provisions were added to the legislation that prevented abortion providers from contracting with backup physicians who teach at or contract with public medical schools. Abortion rights groups said eliminating such a broad swath of physicians to serve as their backups could lead to two clinics in southwest Ohio being closed. The lawsuit argued the requirements would almost certainly have shuttered Women’s Med in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio in suburban Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation Monday to allow law enforcement to keep from the public audio or video recordings showing an officer’s line-of-duty death. The measure was drafted after Tulsa police were required under Oklahoma law to release a video of a suspect shooting two officers, one of whom later died. A jury trial began Monday for the man accused of the killing. “This bill is about protecting the dignity not only of our fallen heroes but their fellow officers and surviving family members who can be retraumatized by these recordings,” state Sen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, said in a statement. “It can also make it more difficult to seat a jury in such cases.” The bill prohibits the public release of such videos unless a judge determines the public interest outweighs the reason for denial. It also authorizes a deceased officer’s family members to view the audio or video. Prosecutors and defense attorneys retain the right to use such videos in legal proceedings under the new law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill into law that phases out the state’s agricultural overtime pay exemption. The Capital Press reports Brown wrote in a letter Friday to Senate President Peter Courtney and Speaker of the House Dan Rayfield that she views the bill as an important step in the right direction to correct a historic wrong. “This policy will make a significant difference in the lives of farmworkers and their families,” Brown wrote. The new law establishes overtime pay requirements for agricultural workers in Oregon after 40 hours per week, with the requirements phased in over five years starting in 2023. Under the law, farmworkers will be owed time-and-a-half overtime wages after 55 weekly hours of work next year, after 48 hours of work in 2025-2026 and then after 40 hours per week beginning in 2027. Most farmers will be eligible for one of three tiers of tax credits, depending on how many people they employ. Tax credits will incrementally decline between 2023 and 2028 and then will end or be reevaluated by lawmakers. Brown wrote that the law may need to be changed and improved over time, so she said it’s important that conversation about the issue continue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDents Run: The FBI might not have found any Civil War-era gold at a remote woodland site, but it definitely has records of the agency’s 2018 dig and will soon have to turn them over to a father-son pair of treasure hunters. A federal judge has ordered the FBI to speed up the release of records about the search for the legendary gold, ruling Monday in favor of Finders Keepers, the treasure hunting outfit that led FBI agents to the remote site. The group accuses the Justice Department of slow-walking their request for information. The FBI must turn over 1,000 pages of records per month, starting in 30 days, and the first batch of records must include a key report sought by Finders Keepers, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta ordered. The ruling came four months after Finders Keepers sued the Justice Department over its failure to produce records on the FBI’s search. The FBI has long insisted its March 2018 dig came up empty, but Finders Keepers says the government has acted suspiciously throughout the four-year saga. Finders Keepers’ owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, spent years looking for the fabled 1863 shipment of Union gold that was supposedly lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The pair eventually led the FBI to the remote site, where the agency took over.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s newly formed reparations commission is considering what form payments might take and looking to other cities for inspiration. In a meeting Monday, Silas Pinto, who is serving as Providence’s first-ever director of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, noted that reparations are being considered and implemented in a dozen other cities, including Boston and Amherst, Massachusetts. So far, housing and land ownership comprise one of the largest spending categories for cities investing in reparations. Those funds are not paid to individuals but toward renovations and down payments, for example. Direct cash payments, tuition and scholarships have also been popular investments. Pinto said it’s evident that cities are “viewing reparations work really through the lens of closing the racial wealth gap,” and “it’s going to come down to issues around land ownership, around how are we supporting our minority-owned businesses, and how are we helping individuals?” However, as Providence is aiming to use $15 million in federal pandemic relief, it will need to comply with rules on how those funds should be spent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Five University of South Carolina trustees won’t be allowed to run for reelection next month after some powerful lawmakers felt they were responsible for hiring a president who crudely criticized the school, interfered in daily school affairs and left in less than two years. The legislative board that screens university trustees is refusing to send them to a May 4 election by the General Assembly at which more than a dozen other trustees for universities across the state will be elected. The decision comes as the state Senate prepares to review a bill that passed the House earlier this month, the day after it was proposed, that would fire all current trustees at the end of June 2023 and redraw their districts, cutting the board from 20 members to 13. Trustees kicked off the board could run for the new seats. The University of South Carolina trustees the College and University Trustee Screening Commission refused to allow to run for reelection to a new four-year term are board chairman C. Dorn Smith as well as trustees Thad Westbrook, C. Edward Floyd, John von Lehe and Charles Williams. The trustees will be allowed to remain until either the board is restructured or the screening board takes further action.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A deadline for Gov. Kristi Noem to respond to a pair of ethics complaints levied again her last year has passed. But neither Noem nor the panel of retired judges vetting whether the Republican governor misused state airplanes for personal use and improperly interfered in a state certification program in which her daughter was enrolled will say whether a response was submitted by Friday’s deadline. The South Dakota Government Accountability Board is scheduled to revisit both complaints during its next meeting at 10 a.m. May 2 in Sioux Falls. But because the confidential nature of the board and the complaints it examines, few other details are known. Assistant Attorney General Katie Mallery, who serves as the board’s liaison, said Tuesday that the April 15 deadline for the subject of the complaints to respond remained in place, though she declined to say whether any response or responses were received by the board. Created in 2017 by the Legislature, the South Dakota Government Accountability investigates complaints against state officials. The majority of its work is done behind closed doors. Considering complaints in secret, GAB is by law required to keep any complaints and related information it receives confidential throughout its proceedings.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican legislators passed legislation Monday to make camping on public property a misdemeanor crime, which critics say effectively criminalizes homelessness. Under HB978, a person who camps on the shoulder, right-of-way, bridge, overpass or underpass of a state or interstate highway could face a misdemeanor offense and a $50 fine or community service requirement. The legislation cleared the state Senate last week after a lengthy debate and now goes to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. Sponsors Sen. Paul Bailey, R-Sparta, and Rep. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville, have defended the bill as a tool local law enforcement could use to address homelessness. Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, said he experienced homelessness multiple times as a child and criticized the legislation, calling for a more “compassionate” approach. Sen. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, drew widespread criticism last week for meandering comments tenuously connecting Adolf Hitler to the legislation. Niceley said Hitler at one point lived on the streets and used the experience as a “way to connect with the masses.” “People can come out of these camps and have a very productive life, or in Hitler’s case, a very unproductive life,” Niceley said. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Nashville, called the comments “embarrassing” to Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Some Republicans are pushing state leaders to declare an “invasion” at the Mexican border in response to an increase in migrant border crossings, allowing Texas to enforce federal immigration policies, according to some interpretations of the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chair of the House Committee on General Investigating, has asked state Attorney General Ken Paxton for a legal opinion on “whether the federal government has failed to uphold its obligations to protect Texas from invasion under article IV section 4 of the United States Constitution, and whether Texas has the sovereign power to defend itself from invasion.” Paxton’s opinion would be nonbinding, but his answer could add ammunition to a push from conservative groups for states bordering Mexico to use a formal declaration of an “invasion” to justify allowing state authorities to deport migrants suspected of crossing the border illegally. The effort comes as Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have continued to criticize the Biden administration for not doing enough to stem the flow of illegal immigration and as federal authorities prepare to end a Trump-era public health mandate that allowed for the immediate expulsion of migrants.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Huge numbers of Washington County students started eating breakfast and lunch at school last year when pandemic-related federal waivers made it possible for schools to offer free meals to all students. Now, the program that made those free meals possible is ending, and some hunger advocates are worried that children who benefited from the program could go back to being hungry. The Seamless Summer Option program had allowed any Washington County School District student to receive two free meals per day, regardless of status. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, school officials in Washington County and across the U.S. were concerned for students’ well-being and whether they would find enough food to eat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture set aside money to help schools offer free meals on a temporary basis. With the expiration of the federal waivers, as well as the SSO program, local schools will go back to offering free or reduced-price meals only to students who qualify under household income guidelines. With no limits on who could get their meals for free, the district saw large increases in the number of students who ate at school. In September 2020, the district provided 1,842 breakfasts and 10,712 lunches a day on average. By March 2022, those figures had jumped to 4,531 and 16,166.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: After a failed attempt to pass a plan to regulate short-term rentals, city councilors have decided to begin the process again in an attempt to reach a compromise. City officials and councilors agree that short-term rentals are contributing to the housing shortage. The ongoing argument lies in how to regulate the housing that is commonly rented through sites like Airbnb and VRBO. A new version of the ordinance that will be considered in the City Council’s ordinance committee would allow for short-term rentals to be located in detached homes, accessory dwelling units, duplexes and homes with three to four units as long as they are on the same lot as the host’s primary residence. Hosts could also rent their own home out to guests. The exceptions to the necessity for owner-occupancy would be seasonal homes and units in a multi-unit building where one unit is rented out at an affordable rate to a long-term tenant. A previous version of the ordinance that Mayor Miro Weinberger vetoed would have limited short-term rentals to bedrooms within a host’s home with few exceptions. The prior proposal would have stopped people from creating short-term rentals out of independent units on their property such as detached houses, carriage houses and units in an owner-occupied multi-unit home.The ordinance committee will bring a new proposal for regulating short-term rentals to council by June 1.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The father of a journalist fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015 has conceded that he failed to make the ballot in the Democratic nomination contest for the 5th Congressional District. Andy Parker, who announced in January that he would seek to unseat incumbent GOP Rep. Bob Good, said in a statement Monday that he would instead throw his support to Democratic nominee Josh Throneburg. “I was looking forward to a spirited primary and campaign against Good this fall, but to my great disappointment our campaign did not meet the technical requirements to be on the primary ballot. I want to thank the thousands of Virginians and supporters across America who stood with me,” Parker said. Since the death of daughter Alison, a 24-year-old reporter at Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV who was killed by a former colleague during an interview, Parker has pushed for gun-control measures. He’s also battled with Facebook over its allowing the video of his daughter’s slaying to circulate. Parker’s campaign told WDBJ last week that it was reviewing its petition signatures after being informed that the 5th District Committee was able to verify only 937 of the 1,000 required. Alison Parker’s death also prompted her boyfriend, WDBJ anchor Chris Hurst, to run for the General Assembly in 2017. The Democrat served two terms in the House of Delegates before being unseated by a Republican last November.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Klickitat County’s claim to a portion of the Yakama Indian Reservation, likely ending a dispute that has raged for more than a century. The court denied the county’s appeal without comment. Klickitat County had argued that 121,465 acres in the southwestern portion of the reservation, including the eastern half of Mount Adams and the Glenwood Valley, were not actually included when the reservation was created. “The Supreme Court’s decision once again validates the continuing strength of our treaty rights under the United States Constitution,” said Yakama Tribal Council Chairman Delano Saluskin. “The Yakama Nation will never compromise when our treaty is at stake.” The dispute involved ambiguous language in the tribe’s Treaty of 1855 with the U.S. government. Territorial Gov. Isaac Stevens, who drafted the treaty, wrote that the reservation’s southwestern border passed “south and east of Mount Adams, to the spur whence flows the waters of the Klickatat and Pisco rivers.” The tribe said that no such spur existed and that the Yakama Nation had always understood that Mount Adams and land known as Tract D was reservation land. That position was affirmed by the Indian Claims Commission in 1966, by an executive order by President Richard Nixon in 1972, by federal surveyors in 1982 and by numerous earlier court cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National Park and Preserve is offering special events this week to celebrate National Park Week. The park is uploading its museum collection online. Information and images give details about the prehistoric and industrial past of the communities in the area. Some of the more than 5,000 items include a miner’s belt designed for self-rescue, a fossil from a time when the entire gorge was an underwater home to marine life and a Native American hammerstone used to prepare food hundreds of years ago. On Wednesday, the public can watch Cultural Resource Program Manager David Fuerst clean a 1942 mural that depicts early 20th-century coal miners. The park hopes to restore the painting to its appearance 80 years ago. The mural demonstration leads up to the opening Friday of the Smithsonian Institution’s “Crossroads: Change in Rural America” exhibit at the historic Cottle Mountainair Hotel in Mount Hope. The exhibit runs through May 30. Winning art for the Youth Arts in the Parks Appalachian Spring Wildflower Art Contest will continue to be displayed at Tamarack Marketplace and online at nps.gov/neri/youth-arts-in-the-parks.htm.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The brother of former first lady Michelle Obama and his wife are suing a private school alleging it refused to allow their two sons to reenroll after they voiced concerns that racism and inappropriate conduct at the school had not been satisfactorily addressed. In a civil lawsuit filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Craig and Kelly Robinson accuse University School of Milwaukee of terminating their 9- and 11-year-old sons’ reenrollment contracts for the 2021-2022 school year after the couple complained that teachers treated students of color and socioeconomically underrepresented students unfairly. According to the lawsuit filed Monday, the school failed to provide the supportive and inclusive learning environment it had promised in its enrollment contracts with the Robinsons. The boys had attended the pre-K-12 school for about five years, the Robinsons said Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a trial by jury. USM said in a statement that the enrollment decision had nothing to do with their complaints of inequity or discrimination. The independent school, with a campus that stretches from Milwaukee to the nearby suburb of River Hills, enrolls about 1,100 students every year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Federal officials are including only about two-thirds the previously expected number of Wyoming sites for lease for oil and gas exploration this summer, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The first such lease sale of President Joe Biden’s administration will list 129 tracts across the state, covering more than 130,000 acres, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/27/john-prine-rocky-horror-rembrandt-news-around-states/50778515/", "title": "John Prine, Rocky Horror: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Two U.S. military veterans who disappeared three months ago while fighting with Ukrainian forces against Russia arrived home Saturday, greeted by hugs, cheers and tears of joy at the state’s main airport. Alex Drueke, 40, and Andy Huynh, 27, had gone missing June 9 in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border. The Alabama residents were released as part of a prisoner exchange. The pair had traveled to Ukraine on their own and bonded over their shared home state. “It’s them!” a family member shouted as the pair appeared at the top of an escalator at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. Smiling but looking tired, the two were pulled into long, emotional hugs by family members after their connecting flight home, then whisked to a waiting car. “Surreal. I still have chill bumps,” said Drueke’s aunt, Dianna Shaw. “I always imagined this day. I always held not just hope but belief in this day. But I thought it was going to be two or three years from now at best.” The families of the two men announced their release Wednesday. They were among 10 prisoners released by Russian-backed separatists as part of a prisoner exchange mediated by Saudi Arabia. “I had to get my hands on him to actually believe it,” said Darla Black, whose daughter is engaged to Huynh. “I’m just overwhelmed with gratitude. We got our miracle.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman was killed when the plane she was piloting crashed into Whiskey Lake near Skwentna, Alaska Wildlife Troopers said. The pilot was identified as Janell Rude, 67, of Anchorage, troopers said. An Air Force rescue team was deployed Sunday and found the plane submerged in the lake. She was the sole occupant onboard the Cessna 180A, troopers said. Troopers and military rescue swimmers recovered the body, which was then sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy. The National Transportation Safety Board said in a tweet that it was investigating the crash. Skwentna is located about 65 miles northwest of Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Planned Parenthood asked a judge Monday to put on hold a ruling that allowed prosecutors to enforce a Civil War-era state law banning abortion in nearly all cases. Arizona’s largest abortion provider said the ruling issued late Friday has created confusion about the status of the law. Its lawyers cited conflicts created by the abortion ban dating to 1864, a more recent law banning abortions after 15 weeks, and a variety of other laws regulating the processes and paperwork when terminating pregnancies. “This confusion has forced Planned Parenthood Arizona to pause abortion services and cancel appointments scheduled this week – meaning that members of our community once again have been and will continue to be denied medical care that they deserve and need while this decision is in effect,” Brittany Fonteno, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson’s ruling lifted a 50-year-old injunction blocking enforcement of the 1864 law, which allows abortion only when the mother’s life is in danger. The injunction was imposed after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed a right to abortion on 1973. Planned Parenthood asked Johnson to put her ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Pharoah Sanders, the influential tenor saxophonist revered in the jazz world for the spirituality of his work, has died, his record label announced. He was 81. Sanders, who launched his career playing alongside John Coltrane in the 1960s, died early Saturday, said the tweet from Luaka Bop, the label that released his 2021 album, “Promises.” It did not specify a cause. “We are devastated to share that Pharoah Sanders has passed away. He died peacefully surrounded by loving family and friends in Los Angeles earlier this morning. Always and forever the most beautiful human being, may he rest in peace,” said the label’s message on Twitter, accompanied by a heart emoji. Among the saxophonist’s best-known works was his two-part “The Creator Has a Master Plan,” from the “Karma” album released in 1969. The combined track is nearly 33 minutes long. Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1940, Sanders began his early musical life by playing drums, then the clarinet in church. In high school, he began renting out the school saxophone. After high school he moved to Oakland, California, where he intended to attend art school. But he soon moved to New York to join the city’s avant-garde jazz scene. He hitchhiked his way across country, he told The New Yorker magazine in 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A prominent law school named for a 19th-century rancher who sponsored deadly atrocities against Native Americans has a new name after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation approving the change. It was among several bills concerning indigenous people that the Democratic governor and former San Francisco mayor signed into law Friday, which he declared “Native American Day” in the state. The University of California’s Hastings College of the Law will be known as the College of the Law, San Francisco. The school’s graduates include former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. The school was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton Hastings, a wealthy rancher and former chief justice of the California Supreme Court who helped orchestrate and finance campaigns by white settlers in Mendocino County to kill and enslave members of the Yuki Indian tribe. The legislation also lays out restorative justice initiatives to be pursued by the college, such as renaming a law library with a Native language name, according to a statement from the governor’s office. Newsom also signed legislation to remove an offensive term for a Native American woman from all geographic features and place names in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A suburb’s plan to show a nearly 50-year-old movie at its arts center has officials scrambling to revamp the town’s indecency laws. The Denver Post reports the city of Parker plans to show the 1975 cult classic “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” at the Parker Arts, Culture & Events Center in October. But because the event center holds a liquor license, and the movie includes a momentary glimpse of a woman’s breast, the showing is prohibited under a town ordinance prohibiting “lewd and indecent” displays. “ ‘Lewd or indecent displays’ include the display of the female breast,” town staff said in a memo to Parker’s elected leaders. “Thus, the definition of ‘lewd and indecent displays’… would prohibit the screening of a movie, such as the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which displays the female breast.” Parker’s town council is considering two ordinances on the issue that officials say will bring the indecency code into compliance with a recent federal court ruling by no longer singling out female breasts – but not male breasts – as indecent. The council is expected to cast a final vote on the measures next month, potentially paving the way for the movie showing to continue as planned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nOld Saybrook: A 76-year-old man died Saturday when his SUV plunged into the water at Saybrook Point Marina and Resort in Old Saybrook, police said. Wedding guests at the nearby Saybrook Point Inn jumped in, pulled the man to shore and performed CPR but were unable to save him, police said. The man, identified as Steven Mark Wahle, of Old Saybrook, was pronounced dead at Middlesex Medical Center Shoreline in Westbrook. The incident happened about 10:15 p.m. The marina is located between the Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River. A fire department dive team determined Wahle was the only person in the SUV. Police pulled the vehicle from the water and impounded it, pending an ongoing investigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit against Democratic Gov. John Carney over the state’s requirement for political balance on its courts. Friday’s ruling is the latest in a long-running legal battle over a “major-party” provision in the Delaware Constitution under which judicial appointments to the state’s three highest courts are split between Republicans and Democrats. The Delaware Supreme Court, Court of Chancery and Superior Court are subject to a separate “bare majority” provision that also applies to Family Court and the Court of Common Pleas. That provision says no more than a bare majority of judges on those courts can be affiliated with a single political party. The result of the major-party provision is that any person not affiliated with either the Republican or the Democratic Party is unable serve on any of those courts. Wilmington lawyer James Adams, a former Democrat who is now an unaffiliated voter, claims that the provision violates his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by barring him from being considered for a judgeship on the Superior Court, a position for which he has twice applied and been rejected. Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Friday that Adams had legal standing to challenge the major-party provision and denied Carney’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police during the Jan. 6 siege has a book deal. Steven A. Sund’s “Courage Under Fire: Under Siege and Outnumbered 58 to 1 on January 6” will come out Jan. 3, just shy of the two-year anniversary of the riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. “It’s time to break my silence and reveal everything that I know happened,” Sund said in a statement released Monday by Blackstone Publishing. Sund resigned under pressure soon after the insurrection and testified the following month that he hadn’t seen an FBI field report warning of potential violence. He said the overrunning of the U.S. Capitol was the result of widespread failures. “No single civilian law enforcement agency – and certainly not the USCP – is trained and equipped to repel, without significant military or other law enforcement assistance, an insurrection of thousands of armed, violent, and coordinated individuals focused on breaching a building at all costs,” he testified. According to Blackstone, Sund will provide “a detailed and harrowing minute-by-minute account of the attack.” He will include a “never-before-heard accounting of a call from the White House” during the siege and “never-before-detailed conversations” between himself and congressional leadership.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz will begin their rebuttal case Tuesday, challenging his attorneys’ contention that he murdered 17 people because his birth mother abused alcohol during pregnancy, a condition they say went untreated. Prosecutor Mike Satz’s team is expected to call experts who will testify Cruz has antisocial personality disorder – in lay terms, he’s a sociopath – and fully responsible for his Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. According to the National Institutes of Health, people with antisocial personality disorder commit “exploitive, delinquent and criminal behavior with no remorse.” They usually have no regard for others, don’t follow the law, can’t sustain consistent relationships or employment, and use manipulation for personal gain, the NIH says. Prosecutors will want to reemphasize Cruz “understood exactly” what he was doing during the massacre and could “formulate and carry out a plan,” said David S. Weinstein, a Miami defense attorney and former prosecutor.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A district attorney said he may revisit a decades-old case in which the state Supreme Court overturned three murder convictions of a Black sharecropper in the killing of a white man, aiming to determine whether the sharecropper deserves to be formally but posthumously exonerated. Weaknesses in the case were detailed in a book published this year, “The Three Death Sentences of Clarence Henderson.” Carroll County District Attorney Herb Cranford has launched a review of the case and could ask a judge to formally clear Henderson’s name, as charges against him were never dismissed, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. He was tried and convicted three times for the 1948 killing of 22-year-old Carl “Buddy” Stevens Jr., a Georgia Tech student who was shot while on a date in Carrollton, a town about 40 miles west of Atlanta. Henderson was arrested more than a year after the killing, and defense lawyers, including a biracial team funded by the NAACP, repeatedly poked holes in the prosecution’s case. Those questions, including some focusing on the alleged murder weapon at a time when forensic science was in its infancy, weren’t enough to persuade jurors to acquit Henderson. But they helped persuade appeals courts to repeatedly overturn the conviction. In January 1953, Henderson was allowed to post bail and leave jail, but the charges were never dropped.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A 52-year-old man has been indicted on multiple counts after he allegedly forced a 15-year-old girl to tie up her boyfriend, then kidnapped and sexually assaulted her, as well as forcing her to smoke meth. Authorities say Duncan Mahi walked up to the girl and her boyfriend at Anaehoomalu Beach on the Kona side of the Big Island on Sept. 16, put a knife to her throat, and took the girl’s money and her boyfriend’s cellphone. Court documents allege Mahi told the girl to tie her boyfriend’s legs and hands together using zip-ties and tape that he provided. He forced her to put the boyfriend’s shirt in his mouth, cover his head with a towel and secure both items with the tape, the police booking sheet said. Mahi told the girl she would die if her boyfriend got loose, according to the police account. Once at his property, he shackled her to a yellow bus behind the main house by putting a fabric cuff around her left ankle that was attached to a cable. Police said the girl managed to get free the next day after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat. A witness saw them scuffling outside Cafe Pesto and stopped Mahi from running after the girl. A homeless man sitting on the sidewalk said, “That’s the girl in the news,” after which Mahi ran to a car. Police found Mahi in Hilo about two hours later.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge has banned cameras from the courtroom in the high-profile triple murder case against a mother and her new husband, saying he fears the images could prevent a fair trial. Seventh District Judge Steven Boyce made the ruling Friday, saying news organizations will no longer be able to shoot still photography or videos inside the courtroom in the criminal case of Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell. The couple are charged with conspiring to kill Lori Vallow Daybell’s two youngest children and Chad Daybell’s late former wife, and the strange details of the case have drawn attention from around the world. Both Vallow Daybell and Daybell have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry a potential death penalty. Late last month, Vallow Daybell’s attorneys asked the judge to ban cameras from the courtroom. They contended that one news organization abused the privilege by repeatedly zooming in on Vallow Daybell’s face during an Aug. 16 hearing. The attorneys, Jim Archibald and John Thomas, also claimed the cameras and microphones could potentially be used to overhear private conversations or to view private notes on the defense table, though they did not suggest that the equipment had ever actually been used in that way.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man climbed five stories of a fire escape to infiltrate a police facility Monday while officers were undergoing a SWAT training exercise and grabbed at least two guns before he was shot and wounded by police, the chief said. Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said the suspect was taken to the hospital with injuries not considered to be life-threatening. One officer was taken to the hospital with a sprained ankle. Brown said the suspect was seen on video leaving the facility and then returning to infiltrate it. He asked where to go to retrieve personal property at the facility in Homan Square on Chicago’s West Side. Then he came back to the building and climbed the fire escape to the fifth floor, where a door had been propped open for ventilation because there are no windows on that floor. Brown said it has not been determined if the man went to the building to retrieve property, saying that the man had an extensive record. It wasn’t immediately clear if property taken from the man was stored in the building. He had no other information about the man, other than to say he was a resident of Waukegan, a suburb about 42 miles north of Chicago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state could face a growing number of extreme heat days in the next 30 years, affecting the number of heat-related illnesses as well as seasonal energy costs in the state. The extreme heat designation is characterized by the National Weather Service as days on which the heat index reaches above 125 degrees. A recent study from First Street Foundation found that most counties in Indiana will continue to see high heat day hikes, with the southern portion of the state seeing the largest increase in what are called extreme heat days. Martin, Harrison and Clark counties are expected to see the greatest increase. Greenhouse gas-induced climate change is a driving factor for the rising number of high or extreme heat days in the 21st century, according to a 2020 Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences study. Urban development and population growth are also contributing to the growing number of extreme heat days. Low estimates show a minimum temperature increase across the U.S. of 2.5 degrees over the next 30 years, but since warmer air has a greater capacity to hold water, humidity will increase as well. This will have a compounding effect on heat indexes, the study says.\n\nIowa\n\nBondurant: The city is bucking a decades­long Beggars’ Night tradition by setting a new day for trick-or-treating. The Bondurant City Council in January passed a resolution that sets the trick-or-treat holiday, known as Beggars’ Night, to the last Saturday of October. That means this year, trick-or-treating is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Oct. 29 in the Des Moines suburb. In future years, trick-or-treating could be as early as Oct. 25 or on Halloween itself. Since the 1940s, cities across the Des Moines metro have held Beggars’ Night on Oct. 30 to avoid what had become some Halloween-night mischief. Most communities in the Des Moines metro will stick to that this year. In Bondurant, the idea to change to the last Saturday of October came from a community Facebook post. The city later conducted a survey to gauge interest. Of the 141 people who participated, 65% said they supported holding Beggars’ Night on a Saturday. City staff identified pros of setting a permanent day of the month, which included consistency, less rushing for families to enjoy the celebration, and kids not having school the next morning. Some possible cons included an impact on households with nontraditional work schedules, confusion about being the only metro community with that date, and a possible influx of people from outsiders.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: After the state paid out up to $466 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits, an oversight council tasked with ironing out issues doesn’t know the status of correcting critical cybersecurity issues. “I just don’t have a lot of confidence right now in the security of the system,” said state Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, “and I’m afraid for Kansas citizens.” Contractor FORVIS performed a cybersecurity audit, broken down into a risk assessment report and a penetration testing report. The firm also performed a forensic audit of unemployment insurance, estimating up to $466 million in fraudulent payments. The council released a redacted version of the penetration testing report this month. The risk assessment report hasn’t been publicly released. Officials said the risk assessment identified 31 recommendations, including six of a high priority, 11 medium and 14 low. The agency didn’t disclose an update on any of the six high priority recommendations, telling lawmakers the information could only be discussed in secret. “It’s got to be noted that there are 206 vulnerabilities listed in this report, of which 43 of them are critical, 74 are high and 89 are medium,” said Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, in apparent reference to the confidential risk assessment report from April.\n\nKentucky\n\nGreenville: A park in western Kentucky is being renamed after singer-songwriter John Prine. A dedication ceremony for the John Prine Memorial Park at Rochester Dam in Muhlenberg County is scheduled for Oct. 1, news outlets report. The project is part of updating an existing county park, said Karen Harper Lain, a spokesperson and committee member for the John Prine Memorial Park. The project includes a new boat ramp, more parking, a picnic pavilion, new playground equipment and landscaping improvements. Prine, who died in 2020, wrote “Paradise” for his father about the small town of Paradise on the banks of the Green River. Now a ghost town, the Muhlenberg County site became the home of a coal plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority from the early 1960s to 2020. Prine attributed the town’s demise to strip mining, with a father telling his son, who asks to return to the county and Paradise: “Mister Peabody’s coal train has hauled it away.” After his death, Prine fans began to visit Rochester Dam, which is also mentioned in the song, to leave memorials to the musician. Lain and others approached Muhlenberg County Fiscal Court about renaming the park after Prine’s death and said officials were “immediately on board.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A federal judge has decided not to block the state’s plan to move two dozen troubled juvenile offenders from a suburban New Orleans detention center to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. In a 64-page ruling issued late Friday, Chief U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick denied a motion to immediately halt the plan to move the teenagers to the adult maximum-security facility despite calling it “untenable” and “disturbing,” The Advocate reports. The state’s Office of Juvenile Justice proved in a three-day court hearing this month that it could provide the youth constitutionally required levels of care at the Angola facility, Dick wrote. “The prospect of putting a teenager to bed at night in a locked cell behind razor wire surrounded by swamps at Angola is disturbing,” the judge said in the ruling. “Some of the children in OJJ’s care are so traumatized and emotionally and psychologically disturbed that OJJ is virtually unable to provide a secure care environment.” But she also wrote: “While locking children in cells at night at Angola is untenable, the threat of harm these youngsters present to themselves, and others, is intolerable. The untenable must yield to the intolerable.”\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Clammers will once again be permitted to dig for soft-shell clams, quahogs, oysters and mussels at Brave Boat Harbor. With the nod of approval from the state Department of Marine Resources, the town is reopening a long-closed tidal flat now deemed safe for shellfish harvesting. A limited number of licenses to harvest shellfish from Brave Boat Harbor will be sold by the town starting in October to both residents and nonresidents, as approved by the Kittery Town Council. Chuck Moran, the town’s deputy harbormaster and shellfish warden, told the council that the Department of Marine Resources found Brave Boat Harbor to be safe for clamming close to a year ago. Since that time, the town has been working with the Department of Marine Resources to prepare for the tidal flat’s reopening and the rollout of shellfish harvesting licenses. “We are now ready to look to sell licenses and open up the clamming season,” Moran said. Department of Marine Resources spokesperson Jeff Nichols confirmed the state found Brave Boat Harbor, which had been closed for a number of years due to higher levels of fecal coliform, to be safe to reopen last October.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The official portrait of retired Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera has been unveiled. The depiction was destined to be highly symbolic, as it would be the first of 24 such drawings of the state’s top jurists going back to 1778 to feature a woman. But contained in the portrait are a host of symbols chosen to depict a dedicated judge, accomplished appellate attorney, fierce advocate, proud Marylander, and loving wife, mother and grandmother. Barbera stepped down from the high court last September upon reaching Maryland’s mandatory judicial retirement age of 70. Current Chief Judge Matthew J. Fader hosted the unveiling ceremony at the high court and said a young girl visiting the Court of Appeals might reasonably ask where the women are upon gazing at the portraits of all the men circling the atrium outside the courtroom. “After this afternoon, never again,” Fader said. “We will finally have a portrait of a female chief judge.” In the portrait, Barbera is seated in the red judicial robe she wore for the eight years she served as chief judge, and on her lap are legal briefs of a case pending before the high court. On the table beside her is a gavel, which she said represents not only the job of a judge but a note of thanks to her dozens of law clerks.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The city’s fire department has been awarded nearly $15 million in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hire 60 new firefighters and purchase new equipment. “This funding from FEMA will assist our department in accomplishing its mission to protect the lives and property of the community by increasing daily staffing for a safer and more effective fire and emergency response,” Acting Fire Chief Martin Dyer said in an announcement. “We have a growing community, and that requires increased resources to ensure we have the personnel and equipment needed.” The city received two grants. The Staffing for Adequate Fire Emergency Response program awarded $14.1 million for the salaries of 60 new firefighters over the next three years. A second grant of $806,000 from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program will increase the fire department’s inventory of self-contained breathing apparatuses, personal radios and turnout gear for new recruits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state loosened regulations on staffing levels this spring and allowed for more frequent lockdowns at Wayne County’s juvenile jail amid understaffing and overcrowding so severe it has been operating under a “temporary disaster” plan. Complaints have grown that the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Facility has confined residents to their rooms for long periods and deprived them of basic care, including daily showers, recreation time and vital medication. In a move described as “rare,” the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, which is charged with overseeing the facility, first approved the jail’s request for a temporary waiver of licensing rules at the end of April because of its staffing problems. The rules variance allows the jail to operate with fewer staff and lets them lock residents in their rooms facility-wide when there aren’t enough workers. A month after the rules were relaxed, police were called to control a group of 18 residents who had gotten out of their secure rooms, destroyed property and fought each other, after one boy may have popped a lock and snagged a staffer’s set of keys. The juveniles blamed their breakout, in part, on not being let out of their rooms. “We are tired of not getting our showers. Nothing against you,” a youth told a staffer, according to an internal county investigation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: In-person voting for the midterm elections opened Friday, kicking off a six-week sprint to Election Day in a landscape that has changed much since the pandemic drove a shift to mail balloting in the 2020 presidential contest. Twenty people voted in the first hour as Minneapolis opened its early voting center, taking advantage of generous rules that election officials credit with making the state a perennial leader in voter turnout. First in when the doors opened was Conrad Zbikowski, a 29-year-old communications and digital consultant who said he has voted early since at least 2017. “I like to vote early because you never know what might happen on Election Day,” Zbikowski said, displaying his civic pride with a T-shirt that bore the sailboat logo of the City of Lakes. “You might get sick; you might get COVID; you might get in a car crash – there’s many things that can happen. But what you do have control over is being able to vote early and getting that ballot in.” Minnesota’s ballot includes races for governor and other statewide offices, with control of the Legislature at stake, too. Zbikowski said he doesn’t take the right to vote for granted, given that his family came to America from Russia when it didn’t have free elections. As a part-time poll worker – he was off duty Friday – he said he’s seen Minnesota’s safeguards firsthand and has full confidence in the integrity of the process.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: After the state spent millions of dollars in welfare money on Brett Favre’s pet project, a university volleyball arena, the retired NFL quarterback tried two years later to get additional cash from the state’s welfare agency for another sports facility, new court documents show. The governor at the time, Republican Phil Bryant, texted in 2019 with Favre, who wanted to build an indoor practice facility for the University of Southern Mississippi’s football team. Bryant told him federal money for children and low-income adults is “tightly controlled,” and “improper use could result in violation of Federal Law.” Text messages between Bryant and Favre are in court documents filed Friday by Bryant’s lawyers that seek to show the governor was willing to help Favre raise private money for the volleyball facility starting in 2017 and was unaware for more than two years that welfare money was going to the project. Mississippi’s largest-ever public corruption case has ensnared several people, including a pro wrestler whose drug rehab was funded with welfare money. The state has filed a civil lawsuit against Favre and others to recover more than $20 million in misspent welfare money intended to help needy people in one of the country’s poorest states. Neither Bryant nor Favre is facing criminal charges.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The speaker of the state House is urging the U.S. attorney in Kansas City to shut down Agape Boarding School, accusing the Christian school of “what amounts to organized crime against children.” Republican House Speaker Rob Vescovo sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore that was made available to reporters Monday. In it, Vescovo said state efforts to close the school have failed, and the local prosecutor has failed to take action to protect the boys who attend the school in the southwestern Missouri town of Stockton. “Right now in Missouri we are faced with the horrifying truth that a network of immoral individuals have engaged in what amounts to organized crime against children,” Vescovo wrote. But he said the situation is “more far-reaching and contains more deeply-rooted corruption than we are able to address solely at the state level.” Vescovo didn’t immediately respond to an interview request to explain his concerns about corruption. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City declined comment. Agape’s attorney, John Schultz, called the allegations against the school “100% false.” “There’s no evidence to support closing down Agape,” Schultz said.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest is seeking outdoor enthusiasts to spend the spring or summer working to preserve and protect one of the landscapes that they love. “Positions are available in multiple fields, including fire, recreation, natural resources, range, timber, visitor services, and archaeology,” park officials said in a statement about the more than 150 seasonal jobs for next spring and summer, with a weeklong application window opening Thursday. “Whether you want to work outside next summer or help visitors plan their trips, working for the Forest Service is an excellent way to build lifelong skills and connections. You will have the opportunity to enjoy a challenging adventure while contributing to an important mission.” The forest encompasses 2.8 million acres across central and north-central Montana. It includes island mountain ranges bisected by the Continental Divide and Missouri River and portions of 17 Montana counties, extending from the border of Glacier National Park to the southern tip of the Crazy Mountains and east across the Big Snowy Mountains south of Lewistown. “This forest provides timber for people, forage for cattle and wildlife, habitat for fish, plants, and animals, and some of the best recreation opportunities in the country,” the news release said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A mining company that wants to extract an assortment of rare elements from southeast Nebraska has announced an agreement that will provide up to $285 million to help cover the roughly $1.1 billion cost of building the mine. In addition to a merger with a special purpose acquisition company called GX Acquisition Corp. II that NioCorp announced Monday, the Colorado-based company also signed letters of intent to borrow up to $81 million more from Yorkville Advisors Global. So NioCorp could get as much as $366 million to finance the project. NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said that “these transactions have the potential to put NioCorp on the fast track to obtain the required project financing.” The main element NioCorp plans to produce at the mine about 80 miles south of Omaha near the town of Elk Creek is a heat-resistant element called niobium, along with scandium and titanium. The company has said analysis of samples from the site shows there is also a significant amount of rare earth elements there like the ones President Joe Biden wants to produce more of domestically. But it’s not yet sure whether it will be economically feasible to also produce some of those elements that are used to create the strong magnets used in a variety of high-tech products such as electric vehicles and cellphones.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Gov. Steve Sisolak says the state is launching a prescription discount card, a method of softening the rising costs of medications. The digital card, called ArrayRX, saves an average of 80% on generic prescriptions and up to 20% on brand-name drugs and is free for Nevadans, Sisolak said. For those without health insurance, the card is set to lower costs significantly, the Democratic governor said at a Thursday press conference in Las Vegas. Those with health insurance will be able to compare their costs with ArrayRX and can opt for whichever option is cheaper, he said. “Taking care of yourself and prioritizing your health shouldn’t leave you bankrupt,” Sisolak said. State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said the digital card is “another tool in our toolbox to ensure that Nevadans can continue to afford the health care that they need and to take care of their families.” Sisolak announced in February at his State of the State address that Nevada would join Oregon and Washington in the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium, a program to reduce prescription costs through state discount systems. There is no cost to the state, Nevada’s Health and Human Services spokesperson said. Instead, a small transaction fee built into the price paid by the consumer helps cover the cost of the program.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSeabrook: The state Department of Safety’s report on the July 12 false alarm sounding at the NextEra Seabrook nuclear power plant finds that because there was no procedure in place for an inadvertent siren activation, it took almost an hour to start notifying the public there was no emergency at the nuclear plant. The result, according to officials in the beach communities, was a certain degree of panic from many beachgoers and local residents who had been told to leave the area by the sirens’ verbal broadcasts at 10:50 a.m. That panic was made worse by a few well-meaning but problematic good Samaritans who drove around Hampton telling people to evacuate because there was a problem at the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant. Although many could accept human error at the power plant caused the 10 alarms to be sounded by mistake, it was the lack of proper public notification that frustrated authorities and the public. It wasn’t until 11:49 a.m., according to the report’s timeline, that state officials transmitted information to the public of the inadvertent alarm activation via social media. WOKQ, the radio station listed in the Seabrook Station Emergency information brochures to get updated information in case of an emergency, was never notified.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Former Gov. James Florio, who championed a plan that substantially raised the state’s sales and income taxes, leading to his reelection defeat in 1993, died Sunday. He was 85. His law partner Doug Steinhardt and current Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed Florio died in statements Monday. “Governor Florio was a fighter who never backed down. He was a leader who cared more about the future of New Jersey than his own political fortunes,” Murphy, a fellow Democrat, said in his statement. Florio was a longtime public servant who held numerous posts on the local, county, state and federal levels. A Democrat, he made three unsuccessful gubernatorial runs before finally succeeding in 1989, when he defeated Republican Jim Courter and became the first Italian American to serve as the state’s chief executive. Florio drew sharp criticism in 1990 when he pushed a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature that extended a sales tax to, among other things, toilet paper. It spawned massive voter resentment and spurred the formation of Hands Across New Jersey, an anti-tax grassroots group that used rolls of toilet paper as its symbol. Florio was ousted after one term by Republican Christie Whitman, who tapped into voter anger over the tax hike and won the race by about 26,000 votes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has granted funds to pay for possible prosecutions connected to last year’s fatal film-set shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. The state Board of Finance greenlit more than $317,000 to cover the cost of investigating potential charges in the shooting on the set of “Rust” outside Santa Fe. First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies made an emergency request for the funds to go toward a special prosecutor, special investigator, several experts and other personnel. As many as four people could face charges, according to a copy of the request obtained by the newspaper, though Carmack-Altwies did not say anyone definitely would. “One of the possible defendants is well known movie actor Alec Baldwin,” she said. When reached for comment by the newspaper, she declined to say which crew members or cast could face charges. The possible charges at which her office is looking range from homicide to violations of state gun statutes. Carmack-Altwies said she is expecting to receive the final investigation report from the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office soon.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City officials are appealing a judge’s ruling that they lacked the legal authority to fire members of the city’s largest police union for violating a COVID-19 vaccination mandate. State Supreme Court Judge Lyle Frank in Manhattan ruled Friday that the city health department’s mandate couldn’t be used to fire or put on leave members of the Police Benevolent Association. Frank said it was “undisputed” that city officials could issue vaccine mandates. But the judge said officials overstepped their authority by unilaterally creating a new condition of employment, as opposed to going through collective bargaining. Frank ordered the reinstatement of union members who were “wrongfully” terminated or put on unpaid leave for refusing to get vaccinated. The city immediately filed a notice of appeal, freezing the judge’s decision until the appeal is heard. “This decision confirms what we have said from the start: the vaccine mandate was an improper infringement on our members’ right to make personal medical decisions in consultation with their own health care professionals,” PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. A spokesman for the city’s Law Department said the ruling “is at odds with every other court decision upholding the mandate as a condition of employment.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: After years of anticipation, a collection of rarely exhibited drawings by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn is now on display at the Ackland Art Museum. The Ackland’s newest exhibit, “Drawn to Life: Master Drawings from the Age of Rembrandt in the Peck Collection,” includes dozens of 17th and 18th century drawings by Dutch and Flemish artists, including five sketches by Rembrandt, who died in 1669. They’re all from the Peck Collection, which the Ackland received in 2017. It was the largest-ever gift for the UNC-Chapel Hill art museum, courtesy of the late UNC alumnus Sheldon Peck and his wife, Leena Peck. This vast collection, valued at $17 million, included 134 Dutch and Finnish drawings. “Drawn to Life,” with 70 pieces of work, marks the first time many of these drawings will be on view to the public since the donation. The museum notes that many can only be on display for short periods of time because they’re sensitive to light. While Rembrandt’s paintings and portraits from the Dutch Golden Age famously strike viewers with awe and a radiant glow, these drawings tell a vastly different story. This collection features more understated works that are meant to be looked at for longer periods of time.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There is little indication that an 18-year-old who died after being struck by an SUV was a political extremist as the driver claimed. Investigators say none of the witnesses they have interviewed support the idea that there was a political argument before authorities say Shannon Brandt struck Cayler Ellingson with his vehicle Sept. 18 in McHenry, and a family friend who knew the teen said he wasn’t active in politics. Court documents said Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that he felt threatened after having a political argument with Ellingson and believed the teen was part of a “Republican extremist group.” North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind said Friday that authorities have talked to dozens of witnesses and plan to talk to more as they try to get a better picture of exactly what happened before the crash. “I can’t get into details about what the witnesses are describing to us. But what I can tell you is that this is not political in nature at all,” he said. “There is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim on the 911 call that Mr. Ellingson was a Republican extremist. There is no evidence to support that all through our continued investigation.” He also said there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was calling others to come hurt Brandt.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Teachers barricaded classrooms, kids texted their parents, and police rushed to high school campuses across the state Friday as a rash of hoax reports of school shootings were made. Legislators are trying to make it a felony to knowingly make a false emergency report. State Rep. Kevin Miller, R-Newark, and state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, have introduced companion bills to increase the penalties on “swatting” − making bogus reports to bring about a big police response, usually to a residence. The legislation would make it a third-degree felony and elevate it to a first-degree felony if anyone is seriously injured as a result of the false report. Those convicted could also be ordered to pay the government for resources spent on the hoax call. “I’m appalled by this type of behavior. It especially sickens me that they’d do this to schools. Think of the emotional impact that these types of incidences have on all those involved,” said Miller, a retired state trooper. He said currently such calls are prosecuted as misdemeanors under inducing panic or making a false alarm. Brenner said in testimony that swatting started as a prank among online gamers who would call in a report to get a SWAT team to show up while someone was streaming their video game play. Brenner and Miller both said they hope their bills gain momentum when lawmakers return to voting session after the elections.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A church with a distinctive white, egg-shaped dome was torn down early Monday after the congregation’s attorney previously said recent asbestos removal was not part of any plan to destroy the First Christian Church building. The property, which also includes the former home of Jewel Box Theater, was home to one of the city’s biggest churches when it opened in the 1950s. The property was put up for sale in 2017 with a dwindling congregation still worshipping there. Preservationists thought they had a savior for the building when Crossings Church signed a purchase contract for the landmark in 2019. But that deal fell through when the congregation’s leadership concluded the costs of renovation exceeded their budget for a new location. A local developer, Andy Burnett, was among the latest to make an offer for the property. When contacted by phone Sunday night, Burnett confirmed he offered $2 million, all cash, with a closing in 45 days, to buy the property and keep the buildings standing as part of indoor and outdoor sand volleyball and sports complex. Burnett said he had not gotten a response but was hopeful and willing to continue the conversation.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Some parks officials say high demand for crowded campsites is leading to arguments, fistfights and even so-called campsite pirates. Brian Carroll with Linn County Parks and Recreation said park rangers had to play mediator this summer as would-be campers argued over first-come, first-served campsites at Sunnyside County Park. “People were literally fighting over campsites,” Carroll said. “What we experienced this year was certainly a general level of increased frustration and anxiety of people not being able to get their campsite. There seems to be less general common courtesy going on.” Tensions also escalated over reserved campsites, with some recreationists wrongly claiming already-reserved sites by tearing off the reservation tags and replacing them with their own, prompting the nickname “campsite pirates.” The original parties end up angry and confused when they arrive to find their campsite occupied. The practice isn’t common, but it’s happening more than it used to, Carroll said. “In the past, it was extremely rare,” he said. Earlier this year, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department said it would seek legislation to give rangers added protection because of the increasing level of assaults and harassment targeting rangers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers at the Philadelphia Museum of Art began a strike Monday, citing wage and health care issues, as the institution said it would remain open during the walkout. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the union representing about 180 of the museum’s approximately 350 workers set up picket lines Monday at entrances to the main building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and at the nearby Perelman Building and the Rodin Museum on the parkway. The museum posted a notice on social media saying it was open as usual Monday, with officials saying managers and nonunion employees would run the operation. “We are committed to serving our community as we continue to negotiate in good faith toward a fair and appropriate new labor agreement,” the museum said. Museum workers voted to unionize in July 2020, and leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 47, Local 397, said Friday that they had been in talks with the museum on a new contract for two years without success. Union officials said higher wages and reducing health care costs are among the important issues outstanding. “Our members will not accept a contract that does not bring wages and benefits at the museum up to an acceptable standard,” DC47 President Cathy Scott said in a statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With his Republican challenger nipping at his heels and calling him “out of touch,” Gov. Dan McKee on Monday scaled back, for now, the raises of up to 43% his administration was proposing for his Cabinet members. In a statement read aloud at a public hearing by Brian Daniels, the head of the state’s Office of Management and Budget, McKee said he was unaware of the state law dictating flat salaries for high-level agency directors when his administration submitted the original salary package. Among the proposed moves: a $60,000 pay hike for the state’s health director that would raise the salary for the position – held by a series of temporary replacements since Dr. Nicole Alexander Scott’s resignation last winter – from $140,000 a year to $200,000 a year. When first talking about that and other double-digits pay hikes, McKee said he envisioned them as new salary maximums to be phased in over time, not all-at-once increases. “However, it is now my understanding that, by statute, the proposals represent flat rates and not salary caps,” he said. “With that in mind, I conducted a balancing test between what is best for talent development in the civil service and what is the most fiscally responsible path forward for Rhode Island taxpayers.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 20 people were arrested and more than 300 dogs rescued as authorities raided dogfighting kennels in the state, federal prosecutors said Monday. The sting started when state and federal agents interrupted a dog fight in Richland County on Saturday, U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said in a statement. That led agents to serve 23 warrants Sunday at what were known to be places where dogs fight or are trained to fight in Clarendon, Lee, Orangeburg, Richland, Sumter and York counties, investigators said. Twenty people face state charges of animal cruelty and dogfighting, authorities said. Investigators also seized about 30 guns and $40,000 in cash, prosecutors said. Officials said 305 dogs were rescued, with about 275 of them believed to be part of the dogfighting ring. The Humane Society of the United States and Bark Nation are helping to take care of the dogs. Some of the dogs had severe scars, open wounds and cuts, the Humane Society said. Some of the dogs were unusually thin, chained to trees with no way of getting food or water, the agency said. The arrests over the weekend are the first steps in a broader investigation that could include federal charges, Boroughs said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State Rep. Linda Duba, D-Sioux Falls, shared her abortion story for the first time in public during a reproductive justice rally organized by the South Dakota Democratic Party on Sunday. Standing on a stage and speaking to a crowd of people dressed in green – the international symbol for abortion access – at Fawick Park in Sioux Falls, Duba told the story of a young college girl in the winter of 1976 who found herself pregnant. Although abortion had been legal in the United States for nearly three years with the passage of Roe v. Wade, abortions were still not provided in South Dakota. “She came from a family who was pretty strict. She was worried about what people would think of her if they found out that she was pregnant, and that young girl was me,” Duba said. Duba was one of five speakers, four of whom are running for office this November, who spoke about the importance of abortion access. Because of a 2005 trigger law tied to the U.S. Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe in June, abortions in South Dakota are banned, even in cases of rape and incest. Duba said that women today must travel out of state, similar to what she had to do 47 years ago when she was a sophomore at South Dakota State University and went to Minneapolis on a Saturday for a 15-minute abortion procedure. “It was probably one of the scariest times in my life, and then I came back home, and I never told a soul,” she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennesseans are being asked to cement a right-to-work law into the state constitution at the ballot box in November – a move touted by pro-business leaders but adamantly opposed by labor unions. The state’s right-to-work law allows employees to opt out of joining a union and paying the dues even if the workforce is unionized. Tennessee’s major unions are against Amendment 1 and criticized the right-to-work law for creating a “free-loader situation.” “It makes unions the only entity that has to provide services to people who did not pay for them,” said Jason Freeman, the political director with Service Employees International Union Local 205, based in Nashville. “A majority of workers in a place can choose to unionize, and then the people who have not joined are entitled to the benefits and services their co-workers are paying for, while they are not.” Supporters of the amendment said they believe the right-to-work law bolsters Tennessee’s business-friendly economic climate and provides workers with a choice. “Through unions, employees can be forced to join something that they disagree with,” said Justin Owen, the president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, a conservative think tank. “That violates their freedom of association and should ultimately be left up to the individual.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A year after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott defended the state’s new abortion law – which makes no exceptions in cases of rape – by assuring that Texas would get to work eliminating sexual assaults, Lindsey LeBlanc is busy as ever helping rape victims in a college town outside Houston. “The numbers have stayed consistently high,” said LeBlanc, executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Bryan, near Texas A&M University. Despite hiring two additional counselors in the past six months, she still has a waitlist for victims. “We are struggling to keep up with demand,” she said. Overwhelming majorities of voters think their state should generally allow abortion in specific cases, including rape, incest or if the health of the pregnant person is endangered. Asked what Abbott has done in the past year to eliminate rape, spokeswoman Renae Eze highlighted older measures to clear rape test kit backlogs, a law signed in June aimed at coordinating and expanding sexual assault resources, and a task force his office launched in 2019 to address the issue. More than 14,000 rape crimes have been reported in Texas since the law took effect last year, according to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety. That was slightly down from the year before and consistent with a decline in other violent crime figures across the state.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Two women survived a mountain lion attack over the weekend when they were running in a canyon east of Salt Lake City. They came upon the mountain lion as they came around a corner on a trail run Sunday morning in Millcreek Canyon, said Faith Jolley, a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The mountain lion leapt at the woman closest to the animal, leaving two puncture wounds on leg, she said. They were able to get away and down the mountain after the uninjured woman threw a rock at the mountain lion. The woman’s injuries aren’t considered life-threatening, Jolley said. Wildlife officials later found the mountain lion they believe was the one in the attack and euthanized the animal. Jolley said mountain lion attacks are quite rare in that part of Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The retail sale of adult-use marijuana becomes legal in the state Saturday, ushering in a new source of revenue for Vermont, as well as satisfied customers, advocates hope. But in reality, hardly anyone will be ready to start selling Oct. 1. As of Friday, only three businesses had their licenses from the Cannabis Control Board: Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland, FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury and CeresMED in Burlington. And only three businesses had their licenses from the city of Burlington − Ceres, Grass Queen and Green State Dispensary − making CeresMED the only business in the city with both state and city licenses in place. Russell Todia, chief operating officer of CaresMED, said in an email that the downtown Burlington store is “tracking to begin adult-use cannabis sales in Vermont on October 1.” Nellie Marvel of the Cannabis Control Board said Friday the board will likely approve at least one more retail outlet at next week’s board meeting. “I cannot say at this time which those might be, or how many will be presented to the board for approval,” Marvel said. “Those numbers are subject to change pretty much until the last minute as we continue to have communications from applicants.” A total of 30 businesses have applied to the Cannabis Control Board for retail licenses.\n\nVirginia\n\nMcLean: The CIA has revealed a model of Ayman al-Zawahri’s safe house, used to brief President Joe Biden about the al-Qaida leader’s whereabouts before the agency killed him in a drone strike in Afghanistan. Shortly after al-Zawahri’s death, White House officials released a photo showing Biden talking to CIA Director William Burns with a closed wooden box on the table in front of them. Now, the contents of the box – a model depicting a white-walled home with at least five stories and three partially obscured balconies – are on display at the CIA Museum inside the agency’s Virginia headquarters. The museum is closed to the public, and access is generally limited to the agency’s employees and guests. The CIA allowed journalists to tour the museum, newly refurbished in time for the agency’s 75th anniversary, as part of a broader effort to showcase its history and achievements. Most of the exhibits took years or decades to declassify. The al-Zawahri model home is the rare artifact that had been used by intelligence officers just weeks beforehand. Al-Zawahri was killed in late July, nearly a year after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ending a two-decade war in which the CIA had a central role. The agency sent the first American forces two weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People in the greater Seattle area will be asked to approve as much as $1.25 billion in new taxes to improve the mental health system and build five regional crisis care centers. The Seattle Times reports King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell and others on Monday said they would put the tax plan on the April 2023 ballot. The King County levy would begin in 2024. The median-value homeowner would pay about $121 that year and continue through 2032. Officials did not say where the new five crisis facilities would be located. The tax package would also maintain and invest in residential treatment beds at long-term facilities that provide youth and adults with addiction and mental health treatment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeaver: A federal civil rights lawsuit has been filed against a jail on behalf of current and former inmates who have described conditions at the facility as inhumane. The complaint filed last week about conditions at Southern Regional Jail in Beaver references a lack of access to water and food, as well as overcrowded conditions and fights that were allowed to continue until someone was injured, WVVA-TV reports. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the station that the agency could not comment on ongoing litigation, but an investigation of conditions at the jail earlier this year found no evidence of inhumane treatment. Republican Gov. Jim Justice ordered the investigation in March after WVVA reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in an April statement.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative news outlet sued the Wisconsin Parole Commission on Monday, alleging that it has refused to comply with open records requests made earlier this year. Wisconsin Right Now has been publishing a series of articles highlighting violent offenders who have received parole under Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration. A reporter for the outlet in May requested lists of all offenders who have been granted parole, release or early release since 2019, when Evers appointed John Tate as chairman of the commission. The commission sent a list of offenders released through 2021 and said in June that it would provide more recent information as it became available. According to the lawsuit, the commission did not respond to further communications or provide that information. The commission and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to messages left Monday. Tate stepped down from his role in June at Evers’ request after the decision to parole a man who served less than 25 years of an 80-year sentence for stabbing his wife to death angered the victim’s family and drew criticism from Republicans in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state’s Department of Transportation wants to use 23 acres of federal land to house temporary laborers as construction ramps up on a highway project, but conservationists are pushing back, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The parcel, under U.S. Bureau of Land Management control, isn’t “an appropriate site” and would be better turned into a public park, a proposal first made in the 1990s, said Jared Baecker, director of the nonprofit Snake River Fund. Bob Hammond, an engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation, told the newspaper that while he understands the desire to preserve the land for recreation, “there’s no funding to do it in the next five or more years.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}]}

The show recounts the time of survival after the crash, as well as events that occur 25 years later. Yellowjackets premiered in 2021. Its third season is scheduled to be released in 2025.\n\nTREAT (18A: Pet's reward) and VET (44A: Animal hospital doc) and CANS (29D: Cat food containers) We have a trio of cat-related clues/answers today, and my cat, Willow, is happy about two of them. I took this photo of Willow the other day as she was attentively looking out of our basement window. If you look closely, you can see the bunny in the yard that attracted her attention. The bunny was not at all worried; it knew it was safe from the inside cat.\n\nNET (42A: Part of a lacrosse goal) Lacrosse is the oldest organized sport played in North America, as it originated with indigenous peoples as early as the 12th century. Players use the head of their stick, which features a NET, to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the rubber ball into the goal. As lacrosse goals are not situated on the end boundary line, play often occurs behind the goal. The NET on the lacrosse goal prevents a ball that has crossed the goal line from reentering the field of play.\n\nSLOGANS (51A: \"Taste the Rainbow\" and \"Just Do It\", e.g.) \"Taste the Rainbow\" is the SLOGAN for Skittles, and \"Just Do It,\" is a SLOGAN for Nike.\n\nIRA (53A: \"SEP\" or \"SIMPLE\" savings plan) SEP and SIMPLE are varieties of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). SEP stands for Simple Employee Pension, and SIMPLE stands for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees. The abbreviations SEP and SIMPLE in the clue alert solvers that the answer will be an abbreviation.\n\nRUSSET APPLES (56A: Yellowish-brown fruits in an orchard) RUSSET APPLES are varieties of APPLES that exhibit russeting, rough patches of yellowish-brown that cover part or all of the fruit. RUSSET APPLES are often aromatic and sweet.\n\nGREEN (67A: Kermit the Frog's color) I'm a fan of any clue that gives a shoutout to Kermit the Frog. The GREEN puppet was created by Jim Henson, and first introduced in 1955.

The book imagines a world in which pain and strife have been taken away and replaced by \"sameness.\" The Giver won the 1994 Newberry Medal, an honor awarded for \"distinguished contributions to American literature for children.\" A 2014 film adaptation of the book starred Meryl Streep, Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites.\n\nSLED (36D: Skeleton racer's vehicle) In the winter sliding sport known as skeleton, a face-down, head-first person rides a small SLED down a frozen track. The rider gets a running start at the beginning of the race. Skeleton was an event at the Winter Olympics in 1928 and 1948, but wasn't added permanently to the Olympic program until the 2002 Winter Olympics. Skeleton racers can reach speeds of up to 81 mph.\n\nELEVEN (49D: Baker's dozen minus two) A baker's dozen is thirteen, so thirteen minus two equals ELEVEN. The most widely accepted theory about how the term baker's dozen came to mean 13 dates back to medieval England. There were laws at the time that prevented bakers from cheating their customers, which some bakers would do by selling underweight loaves. These laws required a dozen baked goods to be a certain weight, and breaking the laws could result in fines or flogging. Bakers adopted the practice of adding a bit extra to an order to make sure they met the weight requirement.\n\nLEE (61D: \"Squid Game\" actress Yoo-mi) Squid Game is a South Korean TV series about a group of players who risk their lives playing deadly children's games for the chance to win a large cash prize.

Because of what I suspected the theme would be, I guessed RUMMAGE SALES as the answer to 19-Across instead of \"garage SALES\" (which fits the clue but doesn't have enough letters). I wasn't sure exactly what kind of APPLES were being described in the clue for 56-Across, but because I knew the theme, I was able to fill in RU___APPLES until the help of crossing answers revealed the rest.

If you’re missing Westeros, we recommend these substitutes.\n\nIf you want a dragon-filled fantasy epic: Merlin ​\n\nThe world of Westeros is a draw to Game of Thrones, with its own politics and gods and weather. If you’re looking for another high-fantasy story with its own world and rules, King Arthur has you covered. British series Merlin reimagines the classic story through the young warlock’s eyes. It has all the medieval hallmarks of a big fantasy show. Including, of course, dragons.\n\nStream Merlin on Netflix.\n\nIf you prefer your fantasy with a lot of soapy drama: The Magicians\n\nSometimes Game of Thrones has battles on huge scales, and sometimes it’s got a really well-placed slap across your spoiled nephew’s face. If you’re looking for another fantasy where the magical and political mixes with the petty and personal, try Syfy’s The Magicians, based on the books by Lev Grossman. The series follows a group of adult magicians in what is effectively a magical grad school as they discover a Narnia-like fairytale land and the evil within it. But there is plenty of time for relationship drama that would make fan-fic writers on Tumblr proud.\n\nStream The Magicians on Netflix.\n\nIf you dug the swords but are less into the sorcery: The Last Kingdom\n\nIf you're one of the Game of Thrones fans that's into the bloody battles sequences but less into Bran's visions, The Last Kingdom is a good option for you. The British historical drama is an adaptation of Bernard Cornwell’s historical novels series The Saxon Stories and follows the Anglo-Saxon wars in England in the ninth century. It has battles and dirty long-haired men galore.\n\nStream The Last Kingdom on Netflix.\n\nIf you like the multi-generational family story: The 100 ​\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Game of Thrones is the way it weaves multiple generations of characters together to tell a singular story. If you like the adult vs. kid aspect, try The CW’s The 100. The series follows a post-apocalyptic Earth devastated by nuclear war when survivors from a space station touchdown to try to forge a new life. The first to go? 100 juvenile delinquents that are considered expendable, some of whose parents are the leaders of the community.\n\nStream The 100 on Netflix.\n\nIf you like a high-concept genre show with a big cast and many fan theories: Battlestar Galactica\n\nIt’s no secret that HBO was dipping into the Game of Thrones well with its complex, sci-fi Westworld, but if you already hit that train last fall, allow us to point you to another sci-fi show that will get you thinking really Big Thoughts. Galactica, which follows the last survivors of humanity after a deadly attack from the robotic Cylons, is one of the more thought-provoking shows you’ll watch. Its titular Battlestar is the home of the last remnants of the military and government after the Cylon attack, and the series sees ethical and moral questions abound.\n\nStream Battlestar Galactica on Hulu.\n\nIf you love political wheeling and dealing (and beautiful gowns): Outlander\n\nIf you love everything that Dany and Cersei wear as well as the political intrigue in their respective courts, try Outlander. The show, based on a series of novels from Diana Gabaldon, follows a nurse from 1945 who is magically transported back in time to 18th-century Scotland. Season 2 finds our heroine and her new husband involved in court politics in pre-revolutionary France, which means the most fabulous costumes you’ve seen and a lot of back deals made at brothels. Remind you of any shows you know?\n\nStream Outlander on Starz.

Some have A-list stars (Pacino, Reese Witherspoon, Kerry Washington, Daniel Radcliffe), while others feature young kids you've never heard of before. Some are comedies with elaborate musical numbers, and another focuses on the trauma incurred by the Holocaust.\n\nTheir common theme: Even remakes or adaptations feel like something we haven't seen before. And considering that the new decade will bring us more TV than ever, it's always refreshing to find something that genuinely surprises.\n\n'Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist'\n\nNBC, preview Jan. 7 (10 EST/PST), premiere Feb. 16 (Sundays, 9 EST/PST)\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThis sweet musical comedy has a slightly out-there premise that somehow works. Zoey (Jane Levy, “Suburgatory”) weathers an earthquake in an MRI machine and comes out the other end with the ability to hear other people’s thoughts through song. Someone who needs help? He or she sings The Beatles’ “Help,” complete with coordinating dance moves and instrumentals that only Zoey can see and hear. Levy’s charm – with help from an angelically-voiced supporting cast including Skylar Astin, Mary Steenburgen, Lauren Graham and Peter Gallagher – helps sell the concept, and there’s plenty of potential for the series to grow.\n\n'Sanditon'\n\nPBS, Jan. 12 (Sundays, 9 EST/PST)\n\nJane Austen’s final, unfinished novel is brought to life in this Masterpiece PBS miniseries, created by Andrew Davies, who brought us Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in the 1995 TV version of “Pride and Prejudice.” Based on just a few dozen pages of the author's writing, \"Sanditon\" introduces a new Austen heroine, Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams). Miss Heywood learns her own naïveté after arriving at the burgeoning seaside resort of Sanditon, a place full of capitalist intrigue and romantic scheming. As usual in an Austen story, Charlotte has a male foil worthy of her wits in Sidney Parker (Theo James), and a trusted female confidante, Miss Lambe (Crystal Clarke), Austen’s only black character.\n\n'The Outsider'\n\nHBO, Jan. 12 (Sundays, 9 EST/PST)\n\nStephen King’s 2018 novel is the basis for this horror murder mystery series starring Ben Mendelsohn as a detective investigating the horrific murder of a young boy in a small Georgia town. All signs point to high school baseball coach Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) as the killer, but other evidence indicates he might have been miles away during the attack. The traditional detective/murderer narrative quickly gives way to a much creepier, more layered supernatural story. The cast also features the great Cynthia Erivo (\"Harriet\"), whose character offers a more nuanced take on the case.\n\n'Little America'\n\nApple TV+, Jan. 17\n\nThis episodic anthology series from the husband and wife duo behind “The Big Sick” (Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon) revolves around the lives of American immigrants. Each episode tells a different immigrant story, all based on real people featured in articles in Epic magazine. The short, subtle installments cover issues surrounding immigration, from deportation to undocumented status, but it's not just about political buzzwords. The series paints deeper portraits of its subjects' lives, which include the world of competitive squash, baking chocolate chip cookies and taking an Alaskan cruise. That all the episodes are based on true stories lends the series an emotional punch that only sometimes borders on mawkish.\n\n'Awkwafina is Nora from Queens'\n\nComedy Central, Jan. 22 (Wednesdays, 10:30 EST/PST)\n\nIf you’re missing “Broad City,” Comedy Central has found another millennial-themed series to fill the hole in your heart. Awkwafina, a standout in comedic films like “Crazy Rich Asians” who earned rave reviews for her more dramatic turn in last year’s “The Farewell,” brings her considerable talents to this sitcom about a listless woman in her late 20s living at home. If you’re not a fan of Awkwafina’s comic style, this isn’t the show for you. But her brash, raucous humor feels like a natural fit for Comedy Central.\n\n'Miracle Workers: Dark Ages'\n\nTBS, Jan. 28 (Tuesdays, 10:30 EST/PST)\n\nSwapping a corporate version of heaven for the stink and swords of the Dark Ages, this sequel to last year’s “Miracle Workers” puts the same cast in new roles and a new setting. There’s not much relating “Dark Ages” to the original series other than the sly comedic tone (period and modern jokes about medieval executions, nuns and worthless college education abound). But the actors, including Steve Buscemi, Daniel Radcliffe and Geraldine Viswanathan (“Blockers”), are so good together that it doesn’t matter.\n\n'Locke and Key'\n\nNetflix, Feb. 7\n\nDespite its roots in many different fantasy and horror stories, “Locke and Key” – based on the comic books by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez – is its own distinct beast. Three siblings move to their family’s creepy, ancestral house after their father is murdered, only to find it filled with supernaturally powered keys and a malevolent force. Part haunted house story, part family drama and part murder mystery, “Locke” is instantly gripping, with a downright deliciously cackling villain and compelling kid actors trying to be heroes.\n\n'High Fidelity'\n\nHulu, Feb. 14\n\nJust in time for Valentine's Day, Hulu offers a gender-flipped adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel (previously made into a 2000 movie starring John Cusack) starring Zoë Kravitz as Rob, a New York record-store owner who recounts her top five heartbreaks. The series retains the film's narration, but spins things forward to expand the story. Changing Rob’s gender and making her bisexual also gives the series more relationship dynamics to explore and drama to chew on so it doesn’t feel like simply a rehash of a perfectly good movie.\n\n'Hunters'\n\nAmazon, Feb. 21\n\nAl Pacino comes to the small screen for this hugely ambitious series executive produced by Jordan Peele. “Hunters” follows a diverse group of Nazi hunters in 1970s New York City as they uncover a network of hundreds of the war criminals living in the U.S. who are conspiring to bring about a Fourth Reich. Also starring Logan Lerman, the series is gorgeously and evocatively wrought and devastating to watch. “Hunters” swings between thriller and horror show, and is as gruesomely violent as its concept would indicate. But it also doesn’t get lost in that violence, and finds emotional truths in its depiction of the long tail of trauma from the Holocaust.\n\n'Little Fires Everywhere'\n\nHulu, March 18\n\nReese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington anchor this series based on Celeste Ng’s best-selling novel about two families in 1997 Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, Ohio. Witherspoon is perfectly cast as Elena, the ultimate 1990s-era working mom, with rigid, conservative ideas about what she wants from her kids, her husband (Joshua Jackson) and her seemingly idyllic community. When wandering artist Mia (Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), move into Elena’s rental property, the two women’s lives (and their children's) intertwine. Their cultural values clash instantly, and the audience is left wondering how they might relate to a crime committed in the very first scene. The series brings its picket-fence world to life in excruciating detail, and pits two heavy-hitting actresses against each other, to great effect.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-controversy-blake-cec/index.html", "title": "'Lord of the Rings' TV series: What happens when 'wokeness' comes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrandon Morse has read J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit,” the “Lord of the Rings” series and watched extended editions of Peter Jackson’s ring trilogy so often that “I can almost quote them all line for line.”\n\nBut Morse is dreading a new addition to the Middle-earth canon that he says “perverts and corrupts” Tolkien’s mythical medieval universe because TV showrunners have committed this storytelling crime:\n\nThey are trying to “woke-ify” Amazon’s new series, “The Lord of the Rings: “The Rings of Power.”\n\nMorse is deputy managing editor of RedState, a conservative news site. He says “The Rings of Power” producers have cast non-White actors in a story based on European culture and who look wildly different from how Tolkien originally described them. He says it’s an attempt to embed “social justice politics” into Tolkien’s world.\n\n“If you focus on introducing modern political sentiments, such as the leftist obsession with identity issues that only go skin deep, then you’re no longer focusing on building a good story,” says Morse, who wrote an impassioned essay about his misgivings. “You’re effectively making propaganda, or art meant to fit a message, not a message to fit the art.”\n\nThe makers of “The Rings of Power,” which premiered Friday, promise viewers plenty of epic battles. Yet some of the biggest battles surrounding the Amazon Studios series have erupted offscreen. Middle-earth fans and scholars like Morse have clashed in online forums and dueling op-eds over this question: Does casting non-White actors enhance the new series, or is it a betrayal of Tolkien’s original vision?\n\nAnd because “Lord of the Rings” fans are notoriously opinionated about all things Middle-earth, the debate can get heated. Some fans are even questioning if Tolkien was a racist.\n\nMorfydd Clark plays Galadriel, a role familiar to fans of Tolkien's books or Peter Jackson's films. Amazon Prime\n\nSome say fantasy stories have reinforced the notion that all heroes are White men\n\nTell Rev. Michael Coren, author of “J.R.R. Tolkien: The Man Who Created the Lord of the Rings,” that some people are complaining casting non-White actors in the new series will ruin the medieval world that Tolkien built, and his response is terse.\n\n“My most intelligent response would be, that’s total bulls**t,” he says.\n\nMiddle-earth is not history – it’s fantasy, Coren says. Coren says he grew up in the United Kingdom during an era when it was common for popular shows to offer blatantly racist and antisemitic depictions of Black and Jewish people.\n\nActors Markella Kavenagh (Elanor 'Nori' Brandyfoot), Sara Zwangobani (Marigold Brandyfoot), Dylan Smith (Largo Brandyfoot), and Megan Richards (Poppy Proudfellow) play Harfoots, proto-Hobbit characters. Ben Rothstein/Prime Video\n\n“It’s not being woke to say no, that’s not acceptable anymore,” Coren says. “This is simply being sensible, courteous and empathetic.”\n\nThis clash is part of a larger debate about including non-White, LGBTQ and other nontraditional characters in fantasy and science-fiction stories. Critics say the fantasy and science fiction world has long normalized the notion that only White men can be the hero and in charge.\n\nSteve Toussaint, a Black actor who plays a wealthy naval commander in the current “Game of Thrones” prequel, “House of the Dragon,” spoke to this debate recently when he revealed he’s been criticized by White fans for being cast in the HBO series.\n\n“They are happy with a dragon flying,” Toussaint said. “They’re happy with white hair and violet-colored eyes. But a rich Black guy? That’s beyond the pale.”\n\n“The Rings of Power” producers cast several actors of color as major characters in the show. One is the Latino actor Ismael Cruz Córdova who plays the warrior elf, Arondi. Another is Cynthia Addai-Robinson, whose mother is from Ghana and father is from the US. She plays the Queen Regent Miriel.\n\nThe Latino actor, Ismael Cruz Cordóva, who plays the warrior elf, Arondir, says he never saw people who looked like him in previous films set in Middle-earth. Amazon Prime\n\nCordóva said he didn’t see anyone who looked like him in Middle-earth while growing up in Puerto Rico as a fan of Tolkien’s works.\n\n“And when I said, ‘I want to be an elf,’ people said, ‘Elves don’t look like you,”’ he said in an interview. “When I heard about the character on the show, it felt like a mission.”\n\nCritics say diverse casting betrays Tolkien’s vision\n\nBut critics of casting non-White actors in “Rings of Power” say their objections have nothing to do with racism. It’s about being faithful to Tolkien’s vision.\n\nSome point out they have also condemned the portrayals of White characters in the show, such as the elf Galadriel, who has been criticized for being not feminine enough.\n\nLouis Markos, author of “From A to Z to Middle Earth with J.R.R. Tolkien,” says casting Black and brown actors in “The Rings of Power” threatens story believability. He said Tolkien described elves, for example, as “fair-faced.”\n\nBenjamin Walker plays Gil-galad, a leader among the elves, in the \"The Rings of Power.\" Amazon Prime\n\nCasting a non-White actor to play an elf makes it more difficult for audiences to maintain their willing suspension of belief, he says.\n\n“This is not something organic that’s coming out of Middle-earth,” Markos says of casting brown and Black actors in the show. “This is really an agenda that is being imposed upon it.”\n\nMorse, the RedState editor, said in his essay that “diversity isn’t a bad thing by itself,” but that when it becomes a major focus, the story takes a backseat to an ideological agenda.\n\n“If someone created a story about a great African kingdom of old, but one of the royals was White, people would naturally find this very out of place,” Morse says. “This would especially be an issue if the story was previously established as all characters having black skin.”\n\nOther critics use arguments about political correctness to lodge their objections. They describe Amazon’s casting choices as affirmative action descending upon Middle-earth, using terms such as “forced diversity,” and warning that Amazon will “go woke and go broke.”\n\nThere is even disagreement about what it means to be “woke.”\n\nOrlando Bloom as Legolas, a heroic elf, in the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies of the early 2000s. IMDB\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “woke” as being “aware and actively attentive” to systemic racial injustice and prejudice.\n\nMorse has a different definition. He sees “wokeness” as a hard-left ideology that focuses on “shallow forms of identity to create victims and oppressors” and elevate a person’s race, gender or sexual identity over other issues like character.\n\nSome see racism in the ‘faceless dark hordes’ of Tolkien’s world\n\nAmazon Studios did not make anyone connected to the series available for comment. But the show has plenty of defenders.\n\nMarc Burrows, a critic and comedian, sees it as ironic that some Middle-earth fans have no trouble accepting giant, walking tree people and fire-breathing dragons, but “darker skinned dwarves are a bit far-fetched.”\n\nOthers say the ancient world was not as White as some “Lord of the Rings” fans believe. They say the ancient Europe that inspired Middle Earth was filled with more racial diversity than is commonly understood due to overseas trading, conquest and migration. Science backs them up. The first modern Britons, who lived 10,000 years ago, were not White but had “dark to black” skin with curly hair, scientists recently discovered.\n\nDefenders of the series also say Amazon Studios isn’t being woke – it’s being savvy. All-White casts are no longer acceptable to modern audiences. “The Rings of Power” is being streamed in more than 240 countries.\n\n“They want to have as many people watching as possible,” says Coren, the Tolkien biographer. “So, morally, economically, culturally on every level, it (diverse casting) is the right thing to do.”\n\nOthers say Amazon Studios did a public service by expunging some of the implicit racism in Tolkien’s Middle-earth.\n\nOrcs, as depicted in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\" Critics say there is a racist undercurrent to the depictions of these Middle-earth villians. Ben Rothstein/Prime Video\n\nN.K. Jemisin, an acclaimed Black fantasy and science fiction writer, has criticized Tolkien’s depiction of “orcs,” the dusky-hued, villainous foot soldiers who terrorize hobbits, elves and other pale-faced heroes. She said they are depicted as “faceless savage dark hordes” that exist so the good guys can “gleefully go genocidal on them.”\n\n“Think about that,” Jemisin wrote. “Creatures that look like people, but aren’t really. Kinda-sorta-people, who aren’t worthy of even the most basic moral considerations, like the right to exist. Only way to deal with them is to control them utterly a la slavery, or wipe them all out.”\n\nWhere did Tolkien stand on race?\n\nWithering criticisms like Jemisin’s have been aimed at Tolkien’s works for years. The heroes in his stories tend to be White, while the villains are often depicted as snarling, darker-skinned people. This has naturally led to speculation about the author’s views.\n\nOne essayist asked a question that’s been circulating for years: Was Tolkien really a racist?\n\nSome racists think so, according to John Garth, author of “The Worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien.”\n\n“The extreme right has been misreading Tolkien as a representative of its own race-supremacist views for a long time,” Garth says. “They’ve really come out of the closet in the past few years, with the rise in populism and the breakdown of taboos over what it is acceptable to say.”\n\nTolkien was a White man who lived in a tweedy, virtually all-White world as a professor of Anglo-Saxon in early to mid-20th century England. But just as Tolkien wrote “not all those who wander are lost” about an enigmatic Middle-earth hero, his background could be deceiving. His biographers say he was not a racist.\n\nIn Amazon's new series, Tyroe Muhafidin plays Theo, a poor villager with a father whose disappearance is a mystery. Ben Rothstein/Prime Video\n\nTolkien spoke out publicly against racial and ethnic hatred, Garth says. He rebuked a German publisher who asked him if he was Jewish, saying he regretted not having Jewish ancestors. He detested Nazi Germany, which was built on a foundation of racial and ethnic hatred (Tolkien called Hitler that “ruddy little ignoramus”).\n\nTolkien was also a Roman Catholic in a mid-century England dominated by Protestants, and would have known what it felt like to be treated as a persecuted minority, Garth says.\n\n“He was born in South Africa, and he said, ‘I have the hatred of apartheid in my bones,’ ” Garth says.\n\nTolkien’s embrace of all humanity can be seen in the premise of his beloved fantasy series, says Coren, his biographer.\n\nThe plot is propelled by the ability of different groups — elves, humans, hobbits and dwarves — to band together and see beyond their superficial differences. And two of the most endearing characters in the books are Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf, who become dear friends despite mutual distrust that had divided their groups for thousands of years, he says.\n\n“Tolkien certainly wrote about good and evil, but he never attributed this to race,” Coren says.\n\nSophia Nomvetter, right, plays Princess Disa, the first Black female dwarf in Middle-earth. She is standing next to Prince Durin IV, played by Owain Arthur. Amazon Prime\n\nThis debate casts a shadow over the enchanted world of Middle-earth\n\nAmazon’s “Lord of the Rings” series is reportedly the most expensive TV show ever made.\n\nWhat price, though, will it pay for featuring non-White actors in its main roles? How fans react will be one of its most interesting plot twists in the coming months.\n\nNo matter what happens, though, the debate over diverse casting casts a shadow over this highly anticipated series.\n\nPeople become devotees of fantasy books, movies and TV series in part because they offer an escape from the bitter divisions of our mundane everyday world.\n\nBut the reception to the new Amazon series reveals that even the enchanted world of Middle-earth is no longer immune to political divisions.\n\nThe elves, dwarves and humans in “The Rings of Power” may eventually band together to defeat a common enemy.

The very real phenomenon has been weaponized in the online age (and, just to make things extra-confusing, the term has been co-opted by President Donald Trump and other conservative politicians as a slam against legitimate news coverage that is critical of them).\n\nThe HBO documentary \"After Truth\" promises to delve into the damage done by disinformation campaigns at home and abroad, absurd conspiracy theories and outright lies packaged to resemble credible mainstream news.\n\nThe project is helmed by filmmaker Andrew Rossi, who's known for the journalism documentary \"Page One: Inside the New York Times\" and features Brian Stelter, who is CNN's chief media correspondent, as an executive producer. If ever there was a time to reinforce the life-saving power of facts and science, this is it.\n\n'Top Chef' (premieres 10 p.m. Thursday, Bravo)\n\nWant to enjoy food without having to think about hoarding or supply chains? Bravo's culinary competition is back for season 17 with an \"All Stars L.A.\" edition that reunites \"15 finalists, front-runners and fan favorites,\" as the series alliteratively describes the contestants.\n\nHost Padma Lakshmi is back, along with judges Tom Colicchio and Gail Simmons, to preside over what's being touted as the biggest cash prize — $250,000 — in \"Top Chef\" history. But the real treat will be seeing pros like Bryan Voltaggio and Jennifer Carroll from season six, Eric Adjepong from season 16 and Lee Anne Wong from season one bring their A-game to what definitely is TV's most competitive kitchen.\n\n'Self-Made: Inspired By The Life of Madam C.J. Walker' (arrives Friday, Netflix)\n\nWhether she's tackling history (\"Hidden Figures\") or horror (\"Ma\"), Octavia Spencer is always worth watching. Her latest role concerns the amazing business success and philanthropic impact of American's first self-made millionaire, Madam C.J. Walker.\n\nWalker was an entrepreneur and activist who made a fortune through her hair-care products aimed at women of color. Then she used that money to support the early struggle for civil rights.\n\nAs Spencer told NPR, the entrepreneur and activist is long overdue for a miniseries: \"She was a woman of purpose. I've always known her story. But what's interesting is her legacy is known in African American culture, but not really by the masses.\"\n\nThe cast also includes Tiffany Haddish as Walker's daughter Leila; Carmen Ejogo as her competitor, Addie Monroe, and Blair Underwood as her husband, C.J. Walker.\n\n'The English Game' (arrives Friday, Netflix)\n\nThe leisure vacuum left by the suspension of professional and college sports is huge. But a drama about 19th-century football, the sport that evolved into modern soccer, is ready to fill the void.\n\n\"The English Game\" comes from Julian Fellowes, the mastermind behind \"Downtown Abbey,\" so it's not surprising that there is an upstairs-downstairs dynamic. This time, however, it's a rivalry between the elite players from privileged backgrounds who pioneered Britain's brand of football and the factory men eager to conquer the field. Edward Holcomb (from the \"Kingsman\" movies) represents the upper-crust side, while Kevin Guthrie (the \"Fantastic Beast\" franchise) plays the working-class hero.\n\nThe preview sets up the inherent conflict: \"Only gentlemen have lifted the Cup, men from fine schools, with fine clothes, fine lives,\" says a bearded elder to Guthrie's character. \"Imagine what it would mean to see men like us lift it.\" In other words, game on!\n\n'The Letter for the King' (arrives Friday, Netflix)\n\n\"The Letter for the King\" joins \"The Witcher\" as Netflix's attempt to conquer the fantasy genre. But it's aimed at viewers too young for the sex and gore of \"Game of Thrones,\" but old enough to embrace the intricacies of a medieval adventure plot line.\n\nThe series, based on a 1962 novel by Dutch author Toke Dragt, has elements familiar to fantasy fans: a young knight, a brave quest to save his kingdom, epic dangers, cool armor, yada yada.\n\nAnd, of course, there is magic, both the supernatural kind and the sort that derives from wise casting. Viewers should be charmed by Amir Wilson, who appeared in the 2019 gem \"The Secret Garden,\" as the youthful hero charged with getting a message to that guy with the crown.\n\n'A Life of Speed: The Juan Manuel Fangio Story' (arrives Friday, Netflix)\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" revived the thrill of watching a great motor sports saga. So how about a documentary in the same mode?\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio, an iconic driver from Argentina, was king of the road back when race cars were convertibles, protective gear was mostly nonexistent and suitable safety guidelines were still to come.\n\nFangio was a five-time winner of the World Drivers' Championship who is considered the godfather of Formula One racing. Or you can define him the way Scottish racing great Jackie Stewart does in the film: \"He was the greatest driver of all time\"\n\n'Blow the Man Down' (arrives Friday, Amazon Prime)\n\nCritics have embraced this crime thriller set in Maine and made by first-time screenwriters-directors Danielle Krudy and Bridget Savage Cole. The two have earned comparisons to the Coen brothers for their cinematic flair.\n\n\"Blow the Man Down\" stars newcomers Morgan Saylor and Sophie Lowe as two sisters from Maine who are drawn into a web of deceit. They're supported by some heavy hitters of the character-acting realm: Margo Martindale, Annette O'Toole and June Squibb. If you're not sold yet, consider that the film took home best screenplay honors at the Tribeca Film Festival and earned nominations at festivals in Glasgow, Palm Springs and Philadelphia.\n\n'One Day At A Time' (premieres 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, Pop)\n\nThe reboot of the 1970s sitcom from Norman Lear won rave reviews for its funny yet topical, realistic take on a Cuban-American family. Yet Netflix canceled it in 2019. That set the stage for Pop TV to come to the rescue.\n\nThe network that provided an American home to Canadian hit \"Schitt's Creek\" will debut the new season of \"One Day At A Time\" on Tuesday night — right after the series finale of \"Schitt's Creek,\" which certainly drives home the point that Pop TV remains committed to comedy.\n\nAny move that brings back Justina Machado as the show's single mom, Penelope, and the fabulous Rita Moreno as the vibrant grandmother is a great one. And bonus points to the series for having the audacity to slip a Netflix joke into the season opener.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/01/03/winter-tv-guide-2016/77689234/", "title": "60 shows that are new and returning this winter", "text": "The truth is out there — and so is a new season of The X-Files.

Thus the primeval power of sudden darkness in the daytime could lead to some future hit tunes, action film sequences or fantasy novels.\n\nWith Detroit expecting about 99% coverage of the sun, we’re 100% ready to cover every aspect of eclipse mania, including with this top 10 list of best-known uses of eclipses in popular culture.\n\n1. 'You're So Vain'\n\nThe 1972 break-up anthem “You’re So Vain,” written and performed by Carly Simon, depicts men who’d rather stare into a mirror than evaluate their own behavior. The third verse perfectly captures their obsession with status: “Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga/ And your horse naturally won/ Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia/ To see the total eclipse of the sun.” In 2015, Simon told People that the second verse is about Warren Beatty, but the third verse remains a mystery. Hmm, anyone have flight information for Canada timed to the 1970 eclipse?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n2. '2001: A Space Odyssey'\n\nThe opening of Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 sci-fi masterpiece “2001: A Space Odyssey” begins with the sun emerging from a total eclipse as the majestic notes of “Also Sprach Zarathustra” (aka the “2001”theme) play. But the shot is even more epic than it seems at first glance. As Lisa Yaszek, a former president of the Science Fiction Research Association, told Vox in 2017 (the last time the United States experienced a total solar eclipse): “You see the sun and the moon and the Earth in alignment, but you realize very quickly that you’re not actually seeing that eclipse from the Earth. You’re at some vantage point beyond the Earth, and presumably it’s from the vantage point of the aliens who plant the monolith.” Whoa, our brain just broke!\n\n3. 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'\n\nThe 1983 hit “Total Eclipse of the Heart” was a career high for singer Bonnie Tyler and doubtless will land on various playlists for the upcoming eclipse. Moody, intense and filled with the pain of an unhealthy romance, it casts a long, emotional shadow: “Once upon a time I was falling in love/ Now I’m only falling apart/ There’s nothing I can do/ A total eclipse of the heart.” During last year’s 40th anniversary of the pop classic, Tyler told the Guardian that songwriter Jim Steinman originally began work on it for a possible musical about Nosferatu. Well, Dracula does have bright eyes.\n\n4. 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'\n\nMark Twain’s 1889 novel “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court” follows the adventures of a man who’s magically transported back to medieval England. Sentenced to burn at the stake for his strange modern ways, the time traveler uses his knowledge of an eclipse from the year 528 (conveniently timed to his execution) to convince King Arthur to save his life. The inventive tale has been adapted into a 1949 cinematic musical starring Bing Crosby, a Bugs Bunny special and a two-episode story arc on the original “MacGyver” TV series. Can a Netflix miniseries be far behind?\n\n5. 'Star Trek: Voyager'\n\nThe opening credits of a slightly more humble space opera, the “Star Trek: Voyager” TV series (1995-2001), concludes with Capt. Katherine Janeway’s (Kate Mulgrew) state-of-the-art ship zipping through outer space as a solar eclipse occurs in the background. That particular “Voyager” sequence is among the fan favorites of the various openings for \"Star Trek” TV shows. What makes it special is the CGI depiction of the Intrepid-class U.S.S. Voyager, circa 2371 (thanks, Wikipedia!) as it explores the nooks and crannies of the galaxies.\n\n6. 'The Simpsons'\n\nIn 2009, “The Simpsons” had a storyline in “Gone Maggie Gone” that doubled as a public service announcement on eclipse hazards. In it, Homer, Lisa and Bart view the eclipse indirectly by using homemade \"camera obscura\" pinhole boxes, while Marge —who has given hers to Homer after he broke his — can’t resist looking straight at the sun with unprotected eyes. Bad move, because Marge’s injured eyes must then be covered with bandages for a couple of weeks, during which time baby Maggie goes missing. Optical warning received! (And here's a Freep article on how to view the eclipse safely).\n\n7. 'Little Shop of Horrors'\n\nThe 1986 movie musical “Little Shop of Horrors,” adapted from the off-Broadway version, hinges on the geeky hero, Seymour (Rick Moranis), bringing an exotic plant he names Audrey II to the flower shop where he works. As is explained in the song “Da-Doo,” Seymour purchased the plant during a solar eclipse. Soon, the identity of Audrey II (voiced by Motown great Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops) is revealed to be that of an extraterrestrial being that craves human blood and wants to take over the world. The moral of the story: Maybe don’t make an impulse buy on April 8?\n\n8. 'Heroes'\n\nBC’s 2006-10 series “Heroes” depicted an eclipse on its logo and employed the astronomical event as a recurring theme. The pilot episode involved an eclipse that seemingly triggers the superpowers of the show's characters. In the third season, a two-part episode follows how an eclipse makes all of those special abilities vanish. As Gizmodo noted in 2017, the mysteries of the eclipses were never fully examined. Instead, they “never amounted to being much more than a nifty visual effect used to create a sense of import” in the plot.\n\n9. 'Mad Men'\n\nA real-life 1963 solar eclipse popped up in AMC’s “Mad Men” in the 2009 episode titled “Seven Twenty Three,” where ad executive Don Draper (Jon Hamm) accompanies his daughter, Sally (Kiernan Shipka), to an eclipse party in order to flirt with her attractive teacher (Abigail Spencer). Too suave for precautions, Don winds up looking briefly at the eclipse through his sunglasses, which serve as a mirror to the celestial event. Great image for an iconic series, awful choice for a fictional self-destructive leading man.\n\n10. 'Barabbas'\n\nThe 1961 religious saga “Barabbas,” filmed in Italy, starred Anthony Quinn in the title role of the prisoner who is released instead of Jesus by Pontius Pilate at a crowd’s request. The film’s crucifixion scene employed actual footage from the 1961 eclipse, a rare intersection of real life and movie magic.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/31"}]}

Now the Department of Transportation is investigating what’s going on at the airline.\n\nWhile other U.S. carriers’ operations are more or less back to normal, Delta posted more than 400 cancellations by 9 a.m. ET Tuesday. Since Friday, the airline has canceled more than 5,500 flights overall, with thousands more delayed, according to FlightAware. That’s more than half the number of flights the airline canceled in all of 2023, according to DOT statistics.\n\nThe DOT said it is investigating the airline “following continued widespread flight disruptions and reports of concerning customer service failures.”\n\nFlying Delta this week?Prepare for chaos as airline struggles to recover from IT outage\n\nPassengers have taken to social media saying they airline hasn’t honored its commitments to provide hotel and meal vouchers, or offer rebooking options on other airlines. In some cases, passengers have also said the airline refused to provide cash refunds, instead offering only credits for future flights.\n\n“We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments. This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law, and our department will leverage the full extent of our investigative and enforcement power to ensure the rights of Delta’s passengers are upheld,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.\n\nThe statement also said the DOT’s investigation will continue to evolve as it learns more and processes all the passenger complaints that have come in.\n\nDelta did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nWhat are Delta customers entitled to if their flights are delayed or canceled?\n\nAll passengers are always entitled to a full refund to their method of payment if an airline cancels their flight for any reason, even if they booked a nonrefundable ticket.\n\nIn addition, Delta’s customer service policy guarantees:\n\nMeal or meal vouchers for passengers who are delayed more than 3 hours by a cancellation or interruption\n\nHotel accommodations for delays or cancellations that result in unplanned overnight stays\n\nGround transportation to and from the hotel\n\nDelta acknowledged in a statement that all passengers are entitled to refunds when their flights are canceled. It also said it would reimburse customers for expenses they incur as a result of flight disruptions, including hotel, meal and ground transportation.\n\nBecause of the high volume of flight disruptions, Delta may not be able to organize accommodation for all affected passengers itself, so those reimbursements mean it will cover reasonable expenses for travelers who make their own arrangements instead.\n\nDelta said it will not cover “prepaid expenses, including but not limited to hotel reservations at the customer’s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, concerts or other tickets.”\n\nThe airline is also issuing SkyMiles or travel vouchers as a goodwill gesture to affected passengers. Delta said the value of this compensation will be “an amount based on the customer’s affected travels.”\n\nWill Delta rebook passengers on other airlines?\n\nDelta’s customer commitment does offer rebooking on other airlines for passengers whose flights are significantly delayed or canceled, but that guarantee is not always so straightforward.\n\nSummer is peak travel season, and even when Delta has agreements in place with competitors that allow its agents to make external bookings, it doesn’t magically mean seats will be available.\n\nFlights routinely run at 90% capacity or more – every traveler has heard the announcement that their flight is completely full and no overhead bin space remains – so there’s not a lot of slack in the system to pick up passengers stranded by Delta’s disruptions.\n\nCruising Altitude:Flight delayed or canceled? How to get ahead of it.\n\nAirlines can also be limited in their rebooking capabilities for various reasons, even if people are willing to use different airports than the ones they originally booked from. This adds a layer of complication to agents’ ability to search for alternative flights.\n\nPassengers may be able to find flights on their own, outside of the options Delta offers for rebooking on its website or app, but it’s not totally clear if the airline will cover the cost of new tickets passengers purchase themselves.\n\nDelta’s information about reimbursable expenses does not mention other airline tickets, and DOT guidance focuses on the rebooking options the airline itself offers. Often these situations are handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

The tech outage disrupted operations across industries such as banks, hospitals and 911 call centers, plus grounded flights and hampered public transit systems and. Although a fix was deployed to restore most systems by the afternoon to return to normal, ripple effects may be felt throughout the weekend, experts warn.\n\nCrowdStrike, which advertises being used by over half of Fortune 500 companies, said one of its recent content updates had a defect that impacted Microsoft's Windows Operating System, adding the incident was \"not a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\n\"Earlier today, a CrowdStrike update was responsible for bringing down a number of IT systems globally,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement on Friday afternoon. \"We are actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.\"\n\nThe company's CEO, George Kurtz, apologized for the disruptions in a post on X, noting the issue has been identified and isolated and a fix has been deployed. CrowdStrike is \"working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\" Meanwhile, Microsoft said, \"the underlying cause has been fixed\" and impacted Microsoft 365 apps and services have been recovered, though the company continues to monitor the issue.\n\nKurtz went on to warn in his statement, \"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you’re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\"\n\nIn the U.S., thousands of flights were canceled Friday morning. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were among those who grounded flights less than an hour after Microsoft said it resolved a cloud-services-related outage that impacted several low-cost carriers.\n\n“Every line is long,” said Chance Ortego, 31, whose flight to New York was canceled Friday morning.\n\nPublic transit systems in the U.S. also reported temporary impacts, but for the most part, trains and buses were running as scheduled. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in Washington, D.C., said its \"website and some of our internal systems are currently down,\" but trip-planning applications were later restored. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also said some of its MTA customer information systems were temporarily offline until around 5:30 p.m.\n\nAround the world, the outages disrupted London's Stock Exchange, caused major train delays in the U.K., sent British broadcaster Sky News off air, forced medical facilities in Europe and the U.S. to cancel some services and caused disruptions at airports in Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\n\nWidespread economic impact from the outage is expected to be small, even though many companies were still trying to resume full operations by the time the stock market closed.\n\nTravel disruptions:Over 2,000 US flights canceled amid global IT outage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ More than 5,000 flights were canceled globally as of 3:30 p.m. Eastern, about 4.6% of all scheduled commercial flights for the day, according to aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\n◾ Some U.S. border crossings saw impacts amid the outage: Traffic stalled on the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, Canada, as well as at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, the Detroit Free Press reported. CBP One, the Customs and Border Patrol app, and the agency’s border wait times website, each appeared to experience outages.\n\n◾ U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, in the wake of the outage. CrowdStrike shares closed down 11.1% at $304.96, with analysts predicting the outage would cost the company money to fix and restore trust with its customers. It was the lowest close for the shares since May 2. Microsoft shares fared better, closing down only 0.74% at $437.11.\n\n◾ Krispy Kreme gave away free doughnuts Friday due to the global tech outage.\n\n◾ Some Starbucks locations were reportedly taking only cash Friday, and customers reported being unable to use the coffee chain's mobile app.\n\n◾ Some had a sense of humor through it, with workers who had to muddle through expressing their wishes for a digital snow day from the office − \"Knock Teams out\" − as the outage didn't equate to a work stoppage for all.\n\n◾ Dubai International Airport said on X it was operating normally following \"a global system outage that affected the check-in process for some airlines.\" It added the affected airlines \"promptly switched to an alternate system, allowing normal check-in operations to resume swiftly.\"\n\nCrowdStrike impact:How a global IT outage unraveled the world's tech\n\nHow the CrowdStrike outage played out throughout the day:\n\nPortland issues emergency declaration\n\nPortland, Oregon, Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration Friday over the tech outage, with a statement noting the outages are affecting city servers, employee computers and emergency communications.\n\nMeanwhile, the Maryland Department of Emergency Management increased its state activation level from \"normal\" to \"partial,\" citing the tech outage. A post on X says a \"partial\" activation is for incidents that require \"significant monitoring or resources,\" with additional emergency operations staffing from other agencies, functions and supporting organizations.\n\n- Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a popular cybersecurity software company created in 2012 by CEO George Kurtz, along with Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston.\n\nAccording to its website, CrowdStrike has the \"world's most advanced cloud-native platform that protects and enables the people, processes and technologies that drive modern enterprise.\"\n\nAlperovitch, CrowdStrike's former Chief Technology Officer, is a member of the Biden administration's Homeland Security Advisory Council, which is meant to provide advice and expertise to support decision-making \"across the spectrum of homeland security operations.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat caused the CrowdStrike outage?\n\nAccording to an alert sent by CrowdStrike to its clients and reviewed by Reuters, the company's \"Falcon Sensor\" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the \"Blue Screen of Death.\"\n\nKurtz said \"there was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts\" but customers “remain fully protected,” according to a post on X. He also reiterated that Friday's outage \"was not a security or cyber incident.\"\n\nAnne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said she spoke to Kurtz Friday and confirmed the incident did not appear to be related to a cyber attack.\n\n“At this point, we believe that it is an IT-related patch, an issue with that patch,” she said while speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. \"I think they're determining what went wrong there.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\n‘I’m just hoping to make it onto a flight’\n\nChance Ortego had reached the finish line of a nearly two-week work trip when he saw the news all air travelers dread: his flight was delayed.\n\nOrtego was in the AirTrain en route to his flight from San Francisco International Airport when he heard other travelers discussing the outage. After checking the status of his 7:05 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight to New York – which was pushed back nearly three hours – he rebooked another flight at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHe later learned his original flight had been canceled. Ortego was among the thousands of passengers around the world facing delays, cancellations and problems checking in as airports and airlines were caught up in a massive IT outage that grounded U.S. flights early Friday.\n\n“I was already planning to sleep,” said Ortego, who works in health care. “Now I'm just hoping to make it onto a flight.”\n\nInside the airport, there was more chaos than a typical travel day as airlines recovered from the outage. Many screens were blank except for an error message and airport personnel made announcements directing questions about flights to airlines.\n\nAll U.S. airlines issued travel waivers for those affected to easily rebook their plans. Those who opted to cancel can rest easy knowing the Department of Transportation classified the cancellations and delays as controllable, thus airlines are responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out.\n\n- Nathan Diller\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nThe outage isn’t expected to have any effect on the broader economy unless it persists for days.\n\n“At this point, the IT outage is more a nuisance than an economic event,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “If it drags on into early next week, the economic damage will begin to mount.”\n\nIf the outage is limited to a day or two, canceled flights can be rebooked and banking transactions can be completed later.\n\n“There is plenty of time for activity to be recovered over the remainder of the month,” says Jonathan Miller, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nOutage impacts US public transit websites, ticketing\n\nMajor cities were generally able to keep trains and busses running, but tech issues have been causing problems with ticketing and other tech systems, leading to delays in some cases.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported website and other tech issues, but said trains and buses were running as scheduled.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City reported problems with \"customer information systems\" but said it's buses and trains were unaffected. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was not affected but urged riders who might be using public transit to any area airports to check with their airlines before traveling for updates.\n\nNew Jersey Transit said some of its ticketing machines may have been impacted but its buses and trains were, for the most part, running on time. Some trains were out of operation Friday due to repairs that had to be made because of the intense heat that blanketed the region all week.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Friday morning that commuter rail lines were affected, though it noted traffic is typically lighter on Fridays than other days. Delays on some lines were as long as 45 minutes, the Tribune reported. Chicago Transit bus and rail service was not affected but some CTA customers were unable to add value to their payment cards via the app or machines overnight, but the issue has been resolved.\n\nSome transit systems, including Metro Transit in Minneapolis and Cincinnati Metro reported temporary disruptions to websites, trip planners, social media and other applications but no impact to its bus or trains.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nDespite summer break, schools disrupted by IT issues\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage crashed some computers at colleges Friday and hampered a popular software for enrolling students in K-12 schools for the fall.\n\nThe University of Rochester, a private school in New York, told students to keep rebooting their systems until the problem was fixed. The University of Alabama’s technology office said its campus computers using Microsoft Windows crashed. Rutgers University and the University of Kentucky also reported disruptions.\n\nDespite the summer break, K-12 schools in Maryland and Kansas said they were having problems with PowerSchool, a widely used software for grading and student enrollment. An update posted to the company’s webpage Friday morning said the outage was impacting all its major products, including its enrollment feature.\n\n- Zachary Schermele\n\n911 call centers disrupted\n\nState and local law enforcement agencies across the country reported disruptions to 911 services after the outage hit.\n\nNational reports of 911 outages peaked at more than 100 on Friday just before 3 a.m. according to Downdetector.\n\nAgencies in at least seven states reported temporary outages, including the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office and Faribault Police Department in Minnesota, 911 systems New Hampshire, Fulton County, Indiana, and Middletown, Ohio.\n\nNon-emergency and 911 calls to multiple dispatch centers in Alaska \"were not able to be answered\" for around seven hours overnight, Austin McDaniel, communications director for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\n\"Dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or to partner dispatch centers that were not impacted to continue taking calls,\" he wrote. Systems in the state were back up as of 4:23 a.m. local time.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department was also impacted ‒ 911 call centers could take calls, but had to dispatch officers manually, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in an email to USA TODAY that it was aware of reports of disruptions to 911.\n\n\"We’re closely working with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”\n\n- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden briefed on global outage as federal agencies assess impacts\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with the cybersecurity firm, as well as with impacted companies and agencies, according to the White House. Biden will receive \"sector-by-sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\" the White House added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is working to \"fully assess and address system outages.\"\n\nDHS added it's working alongside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as well as CrowdStrike, Microsoft and federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to get a grasp on the incident and its impacts.\n\nOver 2K US flights canceled amid outage\n\nSeveral U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, issued ground stops for all their flights early on Friday due to communication problems, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA said operations were no longer impacted as of 10:53 a.m. ET, but it continues to monitor the situation and warned the global IT issue could continue to affect flights this weekend.\n\nThere were more than 2,500 U.S. flights canceled and more than 7,900 delays as of 3:25 p.m. EDT, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nMost airlines were able to resume operations as the morning progressed, but many said they expected disruptions to continue throughout the day.\n\nRead more about the outage's travel impacts\n\nHospitals cancel nonemergency services\n\nHospitals across the U.S. and overseas were impacted by the outage, which forced some to cancel elective surgeries and halt visitations as well as outpatient services.\n\nMass General Brigham in Boston canceled previously scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits, according to a statement sent to USA TODAY. In the same area, Tufts Medical Center told media outlet WHDH it’s still assessing the outage’s effect on clinical and surgical operations.\n\nIn Texas, Ben Taub Hospital and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital suspended \"hospital visitation and patient information,\" citing a \"Microsoft Windows failure,\" according to a statement from Harris Health System. Cincinnati Children's Hospital said many of its Microsoft-based computer systems are down because of the outage, which forced the hospital to cancel early morning appointments.\n\n\"We are in touch with the hospital field and the federal government and monitoring the situation closely to better understand its scope and impact,\" said John Riggi, the American Hospital Association's national adviser for cybersecurity and risk.\n\nTwo hospitals in northern German cities canceled elective operations scheduled for Friday but continued to provide patient care and emergency services.\n\nOutages exposes fragility of internet infrastructure\n\nWhile there were reports of companies gradually restoring their services, analysts weighed the potential of what one called the biggest-ever outage in the industry and the broader economy.\n\n\"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world’s core Internet infrastructure,\" Ciaran Martin, Professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, told Reuters.\n\n\"IT security tools are all designed to ensure that companies can continue to operate in the worst-case scenario of a data breach, so to be the root cause of a global IT outage is an unmitigated disaster,\" said Ajay Unni, CEO of StickmanCyber, one of Australia's largest cybersecurity services companies.\n\n– Reuters\n\nOutages ripple far and wide\n\nFrom the United Kingdom to Singapore, the effects of tech outages were far-reaching on Friday.\n\nBritish broadcaster Sky News went off-air and train companies in the U.K. reported long delays. Departure boards at several U.K. airports appeared to freeze, according to passengers who posted reports on social media.\n\nLondon's Stock Exchange reported experiencing disruptions. Some hospitals also reported difficulties processing appointments and several chain retail stores said they couldn't take payments. The soccer club Manchester United said on X that it had to postpone a scheduled release of tickets.\n\nIn Australia, media, banks and telecoms companies suffered outages.\n\nThere was no information to suggest the outage was a cybersecurity incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.\n\nNew York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority said some of its systems were offline due to a worldwide technical outage, but have since been restored. It said MTA train and bus services were unaffected.\n\nSpanish authorities reported a \"computer incident\" at all its airports.\n\nBerlin's main airport said check-ins were delayed because of a \"technical fault.\"\n\nRyanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned passengers of potential disruptions which it said would affect \"all airlines operating across the Network.\" It did not specify the nature of the disruptions.\n\nThere were reports a shipping terminal in Gdansk on Poland's Baltic coast was not operating normally.\n\nNetBlocks, a digital-connectivity watchdog, said that the outage reported by global airlines, corporates and infrastructure services firms and others was having \"minimal\" impact on global Internet connectivity.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-flights-canceled-delayed/74466125007/", "title": "Why are flights canceled, delayed?

How long will flight delays last?\n\nThe FAA will issue ground stops and other precautionary flight control measures as needed, but most of the cancellations and delays Saturday are likely to be caused by airline crews and equipment being out of place.\n\n\"The airline industry is very thinly populated with planes. Once they’re out of place, they can’t run their normal playbook because their planes are not in place to run their route,\" Jon Haass, a professor of cyber intelligence and security at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University-Prescott, told USA TODAY. “It’s not just one piece of software anymore, it’s an entire system.”\n\nTravelers are advised to contact their airlines and monitor the FAA's website for the latest information.\n\nHow to find the reason for flight delay\n\nCustomers can ask airlines why their flight is canceled or delayed, but the Department of Transportation confirmed that it considers the delays and cancellations caused by Friday's IT outage to be \"controllable\" by the airlines. While airlines may say they didn't cause the computer error, it means that the DOT will hold them responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out. Every airline's policy is outlined on the DOT customer service dashboard.\n\nThe Bureau of Transportation Statistics also tracks causes of delays and cancellations.\n\nAirline waivers\n\nAirlines are doing what they can to provide extra flexibility to those affected by the outage.\n\nDelta said in a statement that it was \"continuing its operational recovery Saturday\" and issued a waiver allowing all passengers traveling Friday to rebook their flights.\n\nsaid in a statement that it was \"continuing its operational recovery Saturday\" and issued a waiver allowing all passengers traveling Friday to rebook their flights.

Spirit issued a waiver allowing customers who are booked to fly Friday or Saturday through any airport in its network to change their flights at no additional charge.\n\nWhat happens if my flight is canceled?\n\nDepartment of Transportation rules require all airlines to offer customers a refund if their flights are canceled for any reason, but customers may be entitled to additional compensation if a cancellation is within the airline's control.\n\nWhat should I do if my flight is delayed?\n\nIf your flight is experiencing a long delay, the Transportation Department suggests asking airline staff if they will pay for meals or a hotel room.\n\nThe DOT dashboard reflects airlines' official policies, but many carriers handle compensation for delays on a case-by-case basis and may provide vouchers or other benefits in some situations that are not formally covered.\n\nWhat is considered a significant flight delay?\n\nEach airline defines significant delays differently, but the DOT's dashboard identifies which airlines provide compensation for controllable delays of 3 or more hours.\n\nFor instance, all major U.S. carriers are supposed to provide a meal voucher for flights delayed by at least 3 hours for reasons within their control. Additionally, Alaska, JetBlue and Southwest offer credit or a travel voucher when a controllable delay \"results in passenger waiting for 3 hours or more from the scheduled departure time,\" according to the dashboard.\n\nHow to file compensation for a delayed flight\n\nTravelers seeking monetary compensation for delayed flights should file a claim with their respective airlines. Passengers seeking other types of compensation, like frequent flyer miles, may be able to request those through the airline's customer service.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/07/19/what-is-crowdstrike-outage/74466492007/", "title": "What is Crowdstrike?

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/07/22/delta-air-lines-recovery-chaos/74499227007/", "title": "Passengers frustrated, stranded as Delta Air Lines systems struggle", "text": "Delta Air Lines canceled nearly 4,500 flights between Friday and Sunday.\n\nThe airline says problems with its crew scheduling software is largely to blame.\n\nDelta is required to honor its customer commitments, which include rebooking passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed on other services at no additional cost.\n\nIt’s been a bad few days for Delta Air Lines passengers.\n\nThough much of the global aviation industry was disrupted by Friday’s CrowdStrike outage, Delta seems to be having a uniquely difficult time recovering. According to the airline, the impact on its crew scheduling software is largely to blame.\n\nDelta and its wholly-owned regional subsidiary Endeavor Air together canceled nearly 4,500 flights between Friday and Sunday, and as of Monday morning were already posting more than 1,000 additional delays and cancellations, according to flight tracker FlightAware.\n\nKristi Gatto, a traveler who went to school with the reporter on this story, was one of those affected.\n\nAirlines rely on complex systems:Why the CrowdStrike hiccup could cause days of chaos\n\n“I get it. Things happen. This was probably the worst flying experience that I’ve had,” Gatto said.\n\nHer Saturday flight from Seattle to New York was canceled after Delta said it was unable to fully staff the flight, and ultimately, Gatto paid for another ticket to fly home from Vancouver on JetBlue instead.\n\nThough Delta said it’s working on recovering operations, it’s little comfort to passengers like Gatto, now separated from their luggage and out thousands of dollars in contingency expenses.\n\nWhat’s happening at Delta?\n\nDelta Air Lines' CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement that the carrier's ongoing headaches are largely caused by struggles with its crew scheduling system.\n\n\"Upward of half of Delta’s IT systems worldwide are Windows based. The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other,\" the statement said. \"Delta’s crews are fully staffed and ready to serve our customers, but one of Delta’s most critical systems – which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time – is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize.\"\n\nDelta’s disruptions are reminiscent of Southwest Airlines’ meltdown in December 2022, when winter storms threw a wrench in the carrier’s crew scheduling system, leading to almost 10 days of travel chaos and nearly 17,000 canceled flights. United Airlines had similar disruptions last summer when Federal Aviation Administration issues and United’s own staffing squeeze led to thousands of canceled flights.\n\n“There is no excuse for Delta to have had this problem because they had a huge data center problem in 2017 when they lost power. They have had some other technology problems in the interim,” Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research, a travel industry analytics firm, told USA TODAY. “More importantly, in the past three years, they have seen American, Southwest and United get bogged down by their own technology problems.”\n\nUnited Airlines also took a hit from knock-on effects of the CrowdStrike outage, but its operations were largely recovered by Monday.\n\nWhat are Delta passengers entitled to?\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, which classifies Friday’s IT failures as “controllable” disruptions on the part of the airline, Delta is required to honor its customer commitments. Those include rebooking passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed on other services at no additional cost, as well as providing hotels and meals and ground transportation vouchers for eligible travelers.\n\nThe DOT says it has received hundreds of complaints from Delta customers who did not receive those accommodations and is investigating those claims.\n\n“I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “No one should be stranded at an airport overnight or stuck on hold for hours waiting to talk to a customer service agent. I will ensure that our department supports Delta passengers by enforcing all applicable passenger protections.”\n\nCruising Altitude:Flight delayed or canceled? How to get ahead of it.\n\nDelta said it would reimburse customers for hotel, meal and ground transportation expenses paid out of pocket as a result of the disruptions, but not for “prepaid” costs like hotel reservations at the customer’s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, concerts or other tickets.\n\nTravelers like Gatto, who book their own alternative flights, will be entitled to refunds for their original Delta tickets but may not be able to claim reimbursement for the new flights. Delta does commit to booking travelers on other airlines in the event of these kinds of disruptions under its customer commitments, but they may not have the same access to all available seats or departures from every airport that a self-booking traveler would.\n\nGatto said she still plans to fight for as much compensation as she can get.\n\n“I plan to really lay into them and let my inner New Yorker come out,” she said. “I’m going to try to get them to pay for everything.”\n\nWhere does Delta go from here?\n\nDelta will likely continue to be all hands on deck this week to restore reliability in its operation. But once that immediate hurdle is cleared, experts say, the company will have to do some serious reflection – and make some major investments – as a next step.\n\n“It’s a competitive landscape out there for software, for this exact purpose. Maybe they’ll have to take a look at doing a transition,” Jon Haass, a professor of cyber intelligence and security at Arizona's Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott, told USA TODAY. “This might be the impetus, that might be the good news, the sliver lining that kicks the airlines into saying we have to treat this as a modern problem, let’s use modern tools to resolve it and not be beholden to the old, old tools that become more complicated with every new regulation that comes out.”\n\nAirlines often rely on older technology than many other industries, in part because their sprawling operations make upgrades cumbersome and also because strict regulations can make it difficult to get new systems approved.\n\nHaass said airlines’ tight profit margins mean shareholders often don’t want to see large expenditures made on back-end systems, but this could force their directors and executives to do it anyway.\n\n“As a business, they’re caught in a bind, but that’s why leadership has to have the nerve to say to its shareholders and say to its people: folks, here’s what we’re doing. Follow the flag,” he said. “We’ll see whether their CEO is a leader.”\n\nThe fallout from this week is also likely to tarnish Delta’s premium brand image.\n\n“Clearly, the CrowdStrike Microsoft problem was an extraordinary unanticipated disaster, and it’s not like Delta had an obligation to think what would happen if we lost all of our Microsoft-based computers, but what Delta should have been doing is looking at all of its software,” Harteveldt said. “For an airline that holds itself out as being premium, it’s embarrassing to see it take so long to recover, especially when peer airlines like American and United have been able to do a better job of recovery.”\n\nHe added that the next few days will be “make or break” for the airline.\n\n“My hope is that we start to see meaningful progress from Delta within the next 48 hours. If we don’t see Delta reduce the number of canceled flights by at least half in the next 24-48 hours, there’s a much bigger problem brewing in Atlanta than we realized,” Harteveldt said.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

File a complaint — and get some money back.\n\nMaybe, you think you can't do anything about it. Maybe, you think submitting a complaint is a waste of even more time. A friend shared one comment on social media where a frustrated traveler stated: \"Glad we have zero consumer protection laws on the books to help everyone being psychologically abused by @Delta.\"\n\nBut it's not true. Actually, consumers do have many air travel rights now. Unfortunately, consumers are going to need to file for reimbursements to get what they are owed. And if they're not satisfied, they're going to need to go a step further and file complaints with the Department of Transportation.\n\nCruising Altitude:Why tech keeps holding airlines back when something goes wrong\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Delta CEO Ed Bastian posted a letter to customers on the airline's website as the company continued to recover from the impact of last week's CrowdStrike outage. Delta upgraded its reimbursement efforts, too.\n\nBastian apologized but also noted that \"the worst impacts of the CrowdStrike-caused outage are clearly behind us.\"\n\nDelta, he said, remains \"committed to taking care of those whose flights may still be impacted, with meals, hotel accommodations and ground transportation offered through vouchers and reimbursements. We’re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers as a further gesture of apology.\"\n\nDelta also noted online Wednesday that it is taking steps to reimburse out of pocket expenses. \"We know many customers have incurred unplanned travel expenses, including purchasing tickets on other airlines, rental cars, train tickets and more,\" the airline said on its site.\n\n\"Delta will cover reasonable costs for additional categories of expenses incurred during the duration of the travel waiver (which currently applies for flights between July 19 and July 28).\"\n\nAnother key point: \"Delta is permitting customers with Delta travel booked from July 19-28 who no longer wish to travel to cancel and request a refund of the unflown portion of their trip — regardless of whether their flight has been canceled or significantly delayed.\"\n\nDelta has been offering waivers, which, according to Delta, allow customers hurt by the troubles to make a one-time change to their itinerary or to cancel and receive a refund for the unused portion of their ticket upon request. The waiver applies to customers with travel scheduled for July 19-28. The fare difference for customers will be waived when rebooked travel occurs on or before Aug. 4 in the same cabin of service as originally booked.\n\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg announced an investigation into Delta Air Lines. He noted that the Transportation Department is making sure \"the law is followed and that Delta is 'taking care of its passengers' as the disruptions continue.\"\n\nIn this case, experts say DOT rules require Delta to refund unused flights for those who choose not to travel on alternate flights if their original itinerary was canceled for any reason, even if the original tickets were nonrefundable. That's true as long as you didn’t get on a rebooked flight at no cost to you, experts say. Some people think they can do both — fly and get a refund — but that's not the case.\n\nJane McNamara, of Royal Oak, was to fly out of Detroit on Delta on Friday, heading to Newark to see her sons in New Jersey. She had heard of the CrowdStrike software incident that impacted Microsoft's Windows Operating System earlier on Friday. However, she had no alerts from Delta via the app or email to tell her the Friday flight was canceled.\n\n\"I drove to the airport hoping I might have a flight,\" she said. \"Once there, after parking in the out lot and making my way to McNamara terminal, I learned it was canceled.\"\n\nShe was shocked by the massive lines and chaos. \"You couldn't get near the (Delta) counter, it was just slammed.\"\n\nShe ended up acting quickly and booked a flight on United Airlines on Saturday. She paid $306, and she had no trouble getting out of Detroit on United the next day.\n\nShe kept the return ticket for Tuesday on Delta. \"I thought by Tuesday, everything should be fine.\"\n\nFor a while, it seemed like it would be. She checked in Monday and had a boarding pass, the whole thing.\n\nThen, about 6 a.m. Tuesday she got an alert that her Delta flight out of Newark that day was now canceled.\n\nShe spotted one seat on another Delta flight, but it was quickly gone. Other flights on other airlines that day had fares that were $800 and higher. Some of those flights had layovers from three hours to five hours. Nothing seemed to be doable.\n\nOh, she could sit in New Jersey until Thursday since Delta had rebooked her on another flight on Thursday morning. \"I couldn't hang out there\" that long, she said. \"My only option was to rent a car.\"\n\nMcNamara, who owns Jazzercise Royal Oak, needed to get back to work and ended up renting a car for $152.\n\n\"I literally just had to do a car,\" she said. Driving alone, she left the area about 11 a.m. and got home after 10 p.m. Most of the driving was fine, she said, until she hit the intense storm in metro Detroit. She's now reviewing how to get reimbursed for her expenses.\n\nEven as travel gets back to normal, the shakeout for Delta could be intense in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"There will be hell to pay,\" predicted Teresa Murray, who directs the Consumer Watchdog office for U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit advocacy group that has advocated for more passenger protections.\n\nThe major IT-systems outage disrupted the operations of several major airlines, triggering extensive delays and cancellations at U.S. airports.\n\nThe Department of Transportation said it has determined that the delays and cancellations resulting from the CrowdStrike-related system outage are “controllable\" — which means the flight cancellation or delay is one that is attributable to the airline.\n\nMurray said Delta's response in individual situations seems to have been all over the map. Some consumers, she said, complained about only being offered frequent flier miles when they needed more help getting where they needed to go in a timely manner. One young man she knows, who happens to be a magician from Michigan, had to rent a car to drive to Philadelphia to be on time for his show. Her advice: Make sure to send the bill to Delta.\n\nDaniel Martin, a global touring magician who lives in Jackson, told me his horrific tale that involved two Delta flights vanishing.\n\nOne flight ended up being canceled on Friday when he was trying to leave Hartford, Connecticut, to fly to Detroit to do a show in Michigan; and a second flight was canceled when he needed to fly from Detroit to Philadelphia on Monday to do another show.\n\nHe said the Delta employees he encountered were really trying to help, but it was out of their control.\n\nMartin, who has a summer tour as a magician, had a show last week in New Hampshire and he had planned on driving to the Bradley International Airport in Hartford to catch that flight to Detroit. He travels a great deal but all the regular steps, like going on Delta.com, didn't work Friday for rebooking a flight. \"You couldn't even get on their site to figure out options.\"\n\nTrying to call, even as a preferred customer, meant a six-hour wait. He quickly booked a Friday night flight on Southwest Airlines as a hedge. Then, he headed to the airport and got in line at Delta. After turning down many bad options, he ultimately was able to get on another Delta flight, which sat on the tarmac. That flight faced so many delays that he figured he should hop on Southwest. Ultimately, he was able to get off that flight with help of Delta employees to rush to grab the backup Southwest flight.\n\nAs for his luggage? Well, it was on the Delta flight. He faced a four-hour delay in Detroit at baggage claim to get his magic equipment. \"It was like the zombie apocalypse,\" Martin said.\n\nUltimately, he got home to Jackson at 5 a.m. Saturday, but he had missed his magic show in Michigan on Friday.\n\nMonday morning, another Delta flight delay, this time out of Detroit to Philadelphia. He made that show but only by spending $250 to rent a car.\n\nOverall, Martin estimates he lost more than 35 hours in delays and some $600 or so in expenses. That's not including the thousands of dollars lost when he missed the show in Michigan.\n\nOne headache after another, and, frankly, travelers will need to take their time figuring out what to do next to recoup some of their extra costs.\n\nIn general, PIRG's Murray said, she would not recommend that people accept vouchers or credits or miles as compensation for their hotel, meal, ground transportation, and other expenses.\n\nBut the amount might matter. \"If someone is looking at a refund of $200, but Delta is offering miles or vouchers worth $1,000 to the traveler, then the voucher or credit might make sense, as long as there aren’t restrictions on how or when or where it can be used,\" she said.\n\nBecause the IT debacle is being viewed by the Transportation Department as a controllable cancellation or delay, Murray said, consumers should try to get a hotel and meal and ground transportation accommodations taken care of by the airline. \"They can’t just go out and book a hotel at a 5-star hotel or something.\"\n\nBut in many cases, travelers couldn't even get Delta on the phone. In those circumstances, Murray said her advice would be to \"spend what is reasonable, to take care of yourself and your family, and submit those expenses for reimbursement later.\"\n\nHow do you submit a claim?\n\nCheck with your airline, but typically you'd submit claims online, not by mail.\n\nWhere to go: Delta has an online process. See Delta.com/reimbursement for the form and some instructions.\n\nDelta has an online process. See Delta.com/reimbursement for the form and some instructions.

That would avoid the United States hosting back-to-back Olympics after the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Games.\n\nPicking Salt Lake City a decade in advance would give the IOC a trusted partner amid changing weather patterns and also could keep together people who have worked toward bringing the Olympics back the city that hosted the 2002 Games.\n\nThe double award proposal by the IOC executive board still needs approval by the full membership at the Olympic body's annual meeting, which opens Sunday in Mumbai, India. That should be a formality.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe IOC has declining options for Winter Games hosts. Bach noted that only 15 countries on three continents currently meet the criteria of having at least 80% of existing venues for snow sports and a “climate-reliable” outlook to host events in future decades.\n\n“We need to address very quickly this dramatic impact of climate change on winter sport,” Bach said in Mumbai. “By 2040, there remain practically just 10 NOCs who could host these snow events.”\n\nA likely longer-term project for the IOC is deciding on a rotation policy of a small pool of regular Winter Games hosts.\n\nThe next deadline for the 2030 and 2034 Olympics will come Nov. 28-Dec. 1 at a board meeting in Paris. A single preferred candidate for each is expected to be chosen and then would enter into exclusive negotiations with the IOC.\n\nThat is the new process for selecting Olympic host cities and regions, avoiding the once-traditional campaigns and votes which were at risk of vote-buying schemes.\n\nThe Japanese city of Sapporo, which hosted the 1972 Winter Games, was once favored for the 2030 edition. That bid was officially dropped this week in fallout from criminal investigations and convictions for corruption tied to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\n___\n\nAP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/05/10/all-japan-committee-meets-to-promote-sapporo-olympic-bid/50209477/", "title": "All-Japan committee meets to promote Sapporo Olympic bid", "text": "AP\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Yasuhiro Yamashita, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee, acknowledged the biggest stumbling block to holding the Olympics is the billions in costs.\n\nHowever, in another breath on Tuesday at a so-called “All Japan” meeting to promote Sapporo's bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics, he said that if the northern Japanese city lands the Games, little new construction will be needed — a major expense for every Olympics.\n\n“From both inside and outside our country, there are many views about hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games,” Yamashista said, among politicians and business leaders online — and in Sapporo — talking up the bid. “I realize there are also concerns about the huge costs involved.”\n\nThe official cost for last year's delayed Tokyo Olympics was $13.6 billion, although government audits suggest it may have been much more. At least 60% was public money.\n\nYamashita referred to a new host-selection policy promoted by the International Olympic Committee, which had for decades encouraged building shining new arenas and stadiums that have quickly become white elephants.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\n“It is no longer about building something for the event, but it's about hosting the event to build the city,\" Yamashita said.\n\nSapporo, Salt Lake City, Vancouver, and Barcelona in conjunction with regions in the Pyrenees, are known to be interested in 2030. It's also possible the IOC will award the 2034 Games simultaneously as it did 4 1/2 years ago in naming Paris for the 2024 Olympics and Los Angeles for 2028.\n\nUnder the new, largely opaque process, the IOC does not confirm any candidates at the early stages. Contenders can promote themselves as publicly as they wish — or as little.\n\n“I am very confident that we have an all-Japan approached to our bid,” said Keigo Iwata, who heads the Sapporo committee.\n\nHere's what's known so far.\n\nTechnical teams from the IOC have visited Salt Lake and Vancouver in the last few weeks. The three-person teams have not offered comment. A team is expected to visit Sapporo later this month. No visit to Spain is known to be planned.\n\nSalt Lake and Sapporo will not hold public referendums on the bids. Vancouver also seems unlikely to hold one, while reports in Spain say it's required. Referendums have killed many Olympic bids — particularly in Europe — with the public seldom approving when asked.\n\nSalt Lake and Sapporo have projected similar costs — between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion. Neither Vancouver nor Barcelona has publicly floated cost figures. Olympic costs typically run over budget, and estimating accurate costs almost a decade away is impossible.\n\nSapporo and Salt Lake would appear to be the leaders. Salt Lake has almost all the venues in place from its 2002 Winter Olympics. Fraser Bullock, who heads the bid committee, has said he expects to land 2030 or 2034.\n\nThe only impediment for Salt Lake in 2030 is the fact that Los Angeles is set to hold the 2028 Summer Games. This would put the Olympics in the United States twice within an 18-month period.\n\nSapporo, which held the 1972 Winter Olympics, is likely to also use facilities from the 1998 Nagano Winter Games. Nagano just recently paid off the debt from holding those Games.\n\nSapporo also got high marks from the IOC for holding the marathon and race walks for the one-year delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nVancouver has the attraction of being the first \"Indigenous-led\" bid, headed by Canada's First Nations. It also has many venues in place from the 2010 Winter Games, but seems behind the other two in bid preparations.\n\nThe new bid process was partly made by fallout from vote-buying scandals that sullied the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. The bidding for the 2002 Salt Lake Games was also caught up in a corruption scandal.\n\nThe IOC could pick the 2030 venue in May 2023 during meetings in the western Indian metropolis of Mumbai. IOC members will be expected to give rubber-stamp approval to recommendations of the executive board and IOC President Thomas Bach. A dual award is also possible.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/02/22/2024-paris-olympics-start-schedule/72587544007/", "title": "2024 Paris Olympics: When they start, schedule.

It will also be more convenient for U.S. television viewers, who will be able to watch primetime finals in key sports during the middle of the day.\n\nHere's everything else you need to know about the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWhen do the Olympics start in Paris?\n\nThe first competitions of the 2024 Paris Olympics will be group stage matches in men's soccer and rugby on July 24. The first men's soccer game will kick off at 3 p.m. local time (or 9 a.m. ET). Although a handful of other events in archery, team handball, soccer and rugby will follow the next day, the Games don't formally begin until the opening ceremony, which is slated for July 26.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nWhat is the Olympics 2024 schedule?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics run from the aforementioned opening ceremony on July 26 to the closing ceremony on Aug. 11. As usual, gymnastics and swimming will be among the key sports in the first half of the schedule, with track and field among the most popular sports following in the second half. Here are the dates for just a few of the most high-profile events at the Paris Olympics:\n\nJuly 30: Women's gymnastics (team final)\n\nWomen's gymnastics (team final) August 1: Women's gymnastics (individual all-around final)\n\nWomen's gymnastics (individual all-around final) August 3: Women's swimming (800-meter freestyle); Women's track and field (100-meter final)\n\nWomen's swimming (800-meter freestyle); Women's track and field (100-meter final) August 4: Men's track and field (100-meter final)\n\nMen's track and field (100-meter final) August 10 : Men's basketball (gold-medal game); Women's soccer (gold-medal game)\n\n: Men's basketball (gold-medal game); Women's soccer (gold-medal game) August 11: Women's basketball (gold-medal game)\n\nRead the complete sport-by-sport schedule for the Paris Games here.\n\nHow can I watch the Olympics?\n\nSimilar to other recent editions of the Games, the Paris Olympics will be shown on NBC and its affiliated channels. The network has said it will televise at least nine hours of daytime Olympic coverage on NBC for the duration of the Games, including live broadcasts of key finals. It will also brodcast every sport and every event on streaming service Peacock. The complete broadcasting schedule, including times and TV channels for specific events, has yet to be announced.\n\nWhat are the new sports for Paris 2024?\n\nTechnically, there will only be one: Breaking. The sport, which is more commonly known as breakdancing, will be contested at the Olympic Games for the first time ever in Paris, with men's and women's fields of 20 competitors each.\n\nThree other sports will be back after debuting at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics: Climbing, skateboarding and surfing.\n\nThe next edition of the Summer Games, in Los Angeles in 2028, will mark the debut of cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash.\n\nWhere is the opening ceremony?\n\nAt most editions of the Olympic Games, the opening cermony is held in the city's largest stadium. Paris, however, decided to do things a little bit differently.\n\nThe Paris 2024 opening ceremony will be the first in Summer Olympics history to be staged outside a stadium, with athletes floating down barges on the Seine River rather than marching into a venue. The barges will travel nearly four miles over the course of the ceremony, beginning near the Austerlitz bridge in the eastern part of downtown Paris and ending to the west, near the Trocadéro.\n\nThe opening ceremony promises to be visually striking, but it also poses security challenges. Paris 2024 organizers have recruited thousands of security guards to staff the event, and only 300,000 spectators will be permitted to attend.\n\nHow many times has Paris hosted the Olympics?\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics will be the third iteration of the Games hosted in Paris but the first in exactly a century. The French capital previously hosted the Summer Games in 1924 and 1900. Paris will join London as the only cities to host three editions of the Olympic Games. Los Angeles will become the third when it hosts the subsequent iteration of the Summer Games in 2028.\n\nWhere are the Paris Olympic venues?\n\nMany of the events and competitions for the Paris Games will take place in the heart of Paris − and some will even be held at or near some of the French capital's iconic landmarks.\n\nFencing and taekwondo events, for example, will be held in historic Grand Palais. Equestrian will be among the sports contested at the Palace of Versailles outside the city. And beach volleyball matches might have the most dramatic backdrop of all: They'll take place in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nWill Messi play in the Olympics?\n\nNo. Men's soccer rosters at the Olympics largely consist of under-23 players, but each country is permitted to field three overage players. Lionel Messi, the 2022 World Cup champion and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, could have theoretically filled one of those slots. But Argentina opted against it, instead selecting goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli, defender Nicolas Otamendi and forward Julian Alvarez as its three overage players.\n\nIs Simone Biles competing in Paris?\n\nYes. The four-time Olympic gold medalist took a brief hiatus after the Tokyo Games but returned to form last year, winning four golds at the world championships in Belgium. She remains the most decorated and dominant gymnast on the planet and proved as much with dominant wins at both the U.S. championships in early June and the U.S. Olympic trials a few weeks later.\n\nBiles will be one of several big names expected to represent Team USA in Paris alongside Katie Ledecky (swimming), Noah Lyles (track and field) and Sha'Carri Richardson (track and field). The men's and women's basketball teams are also stacked with stars, from LeBron James and Kevin Durant to A'ja Wilson and Diana Taurasi.\n\nWho is on the Team USA roster?\n\nThe U.S. roster for the 2024 Paris Olympics is just about set, as more than 550 athletes have already secured their spots. Click here for a full list of Team USA qualifiers, courtesy of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\nWhere are the next Olympics?\n\nFollowing Paris, the next edition of the Olympics will come in early 2026, when Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo will host the Winter Games. The next edition of the Summer Games will be held in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nIn fact, the International Olympic Committee has already lined up future Olympic hosts through 2034.

Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nUrging caution just one week after the Sweden Olympic Committee formally announced its interest, Von Uthmann said there is a June target to complete a feasibility study he is overseeing to reboot most of the 2026 plan.\n\nStill, it could be Sweden’s for the taking if it can revive most of the 2026 plan and persuade more lawmakers and voters for support.\n\nIt would certainly solve a problem for the IOC, which already postponed a decision it had wanted to make this year.\n\n“We see clearly the window of opportunity,” Von Uthmann said, though adding “obviously timing in terms of the world around us is difficult.”\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine created local and global issues for a Swedish bid, both in real world politics and inside the Olympic bubble.\n\n“We are humbly aware that we are in the midst of an extremely difficult finance situation in Sweden, not to mention the NATO application,” Von Uthmann said, referring to the government’s diplomatic move to seek greater protection from possible Russian aggression.\n\nVon Uthmann confirmed there will be an approach to Latvia to use its bobsled track at Sigulda that again seems essential for any Swedish bid.\n\nThat sets up an intriguing potential conflict for the IOC’s separate Olympic Games and international relations departments.\n\nSweden and Latvia are among European Olympic bodies taking the toughest stand against the IOC’s push to reintegrate some Russian and Belarusian athletes into qualifying events for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n“It is way too early, we are not there yet. The war is going on,” Von Uthmann said, repeating Sweden’s clear position in the current most heated Olympic debate.\n\n“We feel it is not the time to start to discuss letting Russian and Belarusian athletes or officials into the Olympic family again,” he said.\n\nDomestic issues in Stockholm may yet stop any candidacy moving forward, four years after the IOC clearly noted skepticism at home for the 2026 bid.\n\n“Cost-wise there are many questions and we need to convince and show the Swedish population that this is actually to the advantage of Sweden,” Von Uthmann said.\n\nTwo building projects suggested in 2026 — for biathlon/cross-country skiing and speed skating, the sport of Swedish Olympic champion Nils van der Poel — are unlikely to be included this time.

No political commitments have yet been asked for nor given, and it is unclear if a public vote will be called.\n\nThe IOC has pointed Swedish officials to a July 2024 deadline — at its members’ meeting on the eve of the Paris Olympics — to find a 2030 Winter Games host. At just 5-1/2 years before the opening ceremony, it would be the latest pick of a games host for any modern Olympics.\n\n“We had a very strong concept and very good offer for the 2026 Olympics,” Von Uthmann said, “and we will build on that.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/08/biden-pauses-arms-israel-humanitarian-gaza/73601551007/", "title": "Biden pauses arms shipment to Israel over humanitarian concerns", "text": "WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has paused the shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel over concerns they could be used in a major military operation in Rafah, where more than 1 million refugees have been sheltering, a senior U.S. official said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed the pause at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. \"As we have assessed the situation, we have paused one shipment of high payload munitions,\" he said.\n\n\"We've not made a final determination on how to proceed with that shipment,\" he added.\n\nThe administration began a review of some weapons transfers to Israel last month, a senior U.S. official said. The president then paused a shipment of 1,800 2,000-lb bombs and 1,700 500-lb bombs last week, as Israel ramped up plans for a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city.

The GOP leaders chastised Biden in a Wednesday letter for not informing them sooner and demanded to know when the review would be completed.\n\n\"This news flies in the face of assurances provided regarding the timely delivery of security assistance to Israel,\" they argued.\n\nThe White House reiterated on Tuesday that Biden's support for Israel is ironclad. And the president has himself said there is no red line over which he would cut off all aid to Israel.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari also described coordination between Israel and the U.S. as reaching \"a scope without precedent, I think, in history\" while speaking at a Wednesday conference.\n\n\"We are responsible for the security interests of Israel and we pay attention to the U.S. interests in the arena,” he said.\n\nBut with Israel drawing closer to making a decision on Rafah, the Biden administration says its concerns about humanitarian access have not been fully addressed.

Madeline Dean, D-Pa., was among the 88 Democrats who signed the letter, which argued there is \"sufficient evidence\" that Israel's conduct in Gaza has triggered consideration of a suspension of offensive weapons transfers.\n\n\"We can be two things at one time: we can be a great ally and supporter of Israel, even as we can be critical of how this war has been prosecuted,\" Dean, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told USA TODAY. \"The inability to get adequate humanitarian aid is grave.\"\n\nBiden had a call on Monday with Netanyahu in which the U.S. says he reiterated his opposition to a Rafah invasion that risks civilian lives and pushed Israel to reopen the Kerem Shalom crossing for humanitarian aid following a weekend Hamas attack.\n\nIsraeli's military subsequently launched an operation into Rafah that the U.S. says was limited and designed to cut off Hamas' ability to smuggle weapons into Gaza.\n\nMore:World Food Program director Cindy McCain: parts of Gaza in 'full-blown famine'\n\n\"We have been talking about violations of international law and every single time that we think we're doing something on accountability, we see that Netanyahu has no respect for accountability,\" Rep.

I can't imagine it,\" says Barney Myers, who was about to disband the Madison County (Fla.) High School junior varsity team until Cain walked through the door.\n\n\"So many things had to fall into place, and to be the person he is today, it's like a miracle,\" Myers says.\n\n\"Really unbelievable.\"\n\nUnbelievable that the No. 3 hitter and American League Championship Series MVP for a team in its first postseason in 29 years only plays baseball because he got cut from his high school basketball team.\n\nMiraculous that the center fielder and centerpiece of the Royals' extended defensive highlights this October started out with a plastic glove, football cleats and hitting cross-handed that day in 2002 in Madison, a four-stoplight town about an hour east of Tallahassee.\n\n\"It's definitely been a journey,\" says Cain, who also became a father just in time to carry his son on the field while celebrating the ALCS victory against Baltimore. \"I've had a lot of determination to get where I'm at today. To be in a World Series, I definitely never thought that would happen. All the hugs, all the champagne baths. We're all part of history now. It's a lot of fun.\"\n\nAs Lorenzo carried week-old Kameron Loe Cain amidst an on-field party the kid will need video proof someday to confirm he was there, little Kameron's grandma wandered off with the MVP trophy, high-fiving celebrating Royals fans.\n\n\"I saw her. I was like, 'What is she doing?' She was having a blast,\" Lorenzo says of his mother, Patricia, a single mom since Lorenzo's father died when he was 4, the most important influence among a string of friends, teachers and even a track coach who've helped guide the 28-year-old into position so, as Royals manager Ned Yost says, \"The country is seeing a very exciting player.\"\n\n'I WAS TERRIBLE'\n\nThat national audience Cain says it's so invigorating to play in front of wouldn't have been so impressed 12 years ago.\n\n\"We started from scratch,\" says Jeremy Haynes, the pitcher who brought his best friend since grade school to meet Myers.\n\n\"African Americans, when you grow up, baseball is just not the first thing for some reason,\" Cain says. \"I'm not really sure why. For some reason, it's basketball and football. I tried out for basketball and got cut. My mom wouldn't let me play football so, for me, baseball was about it.\"\n\nThe Madison County JV team had just eight players.\n\nSkills most of Cain's teammates had mastered in Little League were new to him. Haynes, other teammates and coaches started with the basics — how to hold a bat, where to stand in the box, how to put on a uniform. What a fastball, change-up and curveball were and how they were different all had to be explained.\n\nEric Norfleet, another close friend who was a pitcher on the team, remembers a game Madison County was close to ending by the mercy rule. Myers moved him to left field and let Cain pitch.\n\nCain, sticking with a habit he'd formed while learning how to pitch, announced each pitch in advance.\n\n\"He would say curveball right before he throws it,\" says Norfleet. \"He ended up psyching a guy or two out.\"\n\nCain laughs at the memory — and the naïveté.\n\n\"I had been begging to pitch the entire season,\" he says. \"Finally, they let me. I got a few strikeouts, probably throwing about 70 mph. I got it done.\"\n\nHe had a brief stint at third base, one Terry Barrs, then an assistant coach at Madison County and now its head coach, recalled as comical Monday while making the 15-hour drive to Kansas City for the first two games of the World Series. Haynes also will be there.\n\n\"I was terrible,\" Cain says. \"Probably making two or three errors a game, throwing, fielding. I could make the diving catches, but I couldn't make the routine plays. I can't explain it.\"\n\nNo more than he can explain an innate defensive ability in the outfield that's been on display all season, if only the rest of the world had been paying attention.\n\n\"We've been doing it all year long,\" Cain says of the Royals' often spectacular game-changing plays. \"Nothing's changed. To just get recognized for it is fine. It's all about opportunities. I've had a lot of opportunities to make diving catches, laying out. I pride myself on being the best defensive player I can be.\"\n\nLETTER TO A TEACHER\n\nDriving around Madison today, it would be hard to tell a player of Cain's caliber grew up there. There are no signs — not yet, at least — saying it's the home of the Royals' outfielder. No businesses have put up congratulatory messages, though there are signs for the Lions' Club Annual Turkey Shoot and the upcoming Court House Centennial Celebration. There's nary a Royals flag in sight.\n\nAt Madison County High School, the electric sign out front rotates reminders about a teacher work day, homecoming and report cards. No mention of Cain.\n\nBaseball memorabilia marking the success of the early 2000s teams he played on is packed away. The school is under construction.\n\nInside, though, Susanne Griffin has articles and photos of Cain from TheKansas City Star and Sports Illustrated on the table of the media center she runs.\n\nShe taught Cain eighth-grade English and remembers him being a good student, \"Very polite, very well-mannered, always had a smile on his face.\"\n\nFor reasons even she can't explain, Griffin kept a letter he wrote her in 2000. In near perfect cursive, a 13-year-old Cain thanks her for what he's learned, saying, \"Besides all that writing your class is all right.\"\n\n\"That's awesome,\" Cain said when he found out Griffin still has the letter. \"I remember writing that.\n\n\"Teachers definitely impacted my life. She was definitely part of it.\"\n\nGriffin says Cain's work ethic got him where he is today. He always had the raw talent that has made his postseason play electrifying. But it was the constant, daily requests to hit and catch after practice at Madison that started him down this road.\n\nHis athleticism set Cain apart from the beginning. That and his ability to read the ball right off the bat became apparent quickly.\n\nCain and Haynes went on to be teammates at Tallahassee Community College, but when Haynes, who pitched six minor league seasons in the Angels and Braves organizations, next saw Cain the change was apparent.\n\n\"He wasn't that raw kid that didn't understand what was going on anymore,\" says Haynes of their reunion in the 2009 Arizona Fall League. \"You could tell at that point, honestly, those were my words, 'Holy cow. This kid is gonna be a stud.' \"\n\n'HE'S REALLY LEARNED'\n\nYost first saw Cain when Yost managed the Milwaukee Brewers, the team that took him in the 17th round of the 2004 draft.\n\n\"Lorenzo was really raw at the time,\" Yost says of the then-minor leaguer he would later lobby for when the Royals were trading Zack Greinke to the Brewers in 2010, a deal that also brought current Kansas City shortstop Alcides Escobar.\n\n\"You could envision this kid with this skill set that he would turn into one heck of a baseball player. He was always a little more advanced defensively,\" Yost says. \"But he's really learned how to hit at the big league level. His speed is tremendous. His instincts on the bases are tremendous. And it's been fun watching him develop.\"\n\nThat includes Cain being stuck in Class AAA his first season in the Royals system after spending half the previous year in the majors with Milwaukee.\n\n\"It was definitely frustrating,\" Cain says, though he hit .312 and drove in 81 runs for an Omaha team that won the Pacific Coast League championship. \"I wasn't happy at all. It definitely lit a fire under me, too. I felt like I had to go out and prove to them I could play.\"\n\nHe's still finding ways to prove it.\n\nBelieving an unusual running style contributed to injuries that limited him to 176 games combined in 2012-13, Cain has worked with Al Hobson, the Kansas City Kansas Community College track coach who's worked with Olympian Maurice Green among others.\n\n\"I told our trainers and Dayton (Moore, Royals general manager) I was willing to do whatever it took to stay healthy,\" Cain says. \"I ended up coming to K.C. during the offseason, a week or two every month. I was waking up at 5, 6 in the morning, having two-a-day workouts.\"\n\nHe played 133 games this year, but his sleep schedule isn't much better right now.\n\nHe and wife Jenny are living in a hotel with their infant son because their in-season lease ran out Oct. 1. The close quarters are giving Lorenzo a chance to hone some other skills.\n\n\"I'm trying to work and get better at changing diapers,\" he says. \"He's peed on me a few times. I'm still learning.\n\n\"Between not getting any sleep, trying to spend time with my son and making sure I'm prepared to play, it's not easy,\" he says. \"But I feel like I must find any way possible to get it done. I feel like I'm doing a great job of that. I'm going to find a way.\"\n\nIt might not be the conventional way, but history shows he's probably right.\n\nContributing: Jim Henry, Tallahassee Democrat; Axon reported from Madison County, Fla.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/10/27/south-africa-soccer-team-captain-shot-and-killed/17993313/", "title": "South Africa captain Senzo Meyiwa shot and killed", "text": "AP\n\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) — The captain of the South African national soccer team was fatally shot at his girlfriend's house during an attempted robbery Sunday night as he tried to apprehend the intruders, police and an eyewitness said.\n\nGoalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was killed around 8 p.m. after two gunmen entered a house in Vosloorus township near Johannesburg while an accomplice of theirs waited outside.

The reason? To demand the Biden administration call for a cease-fire in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have killed tens of thousands of civilians as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has responded to Hamas' own deadly assault on southern Israel in October.\n\nThe results, at least numerically speaking, appeared impressive: With 99% of the vote tallied statewide as of 4 p.m. Wednesday, \"uncommitted\" won 101,394 votes on Democratic ballots statewide, far more than that option (available on all of the state's primary ballots) had received in any recent primary election other than 2008. That year, nearly 240,000 voted that way with soon-to-be President Barack Obama and former U.S. Sen. John Edwards skipping Michigan's Democratic primary because it ran afoul of national party rules for its scheduling.\n\n\"Michigan residents sent the president a critical message that he cannot continue to ignore: Michiganders want a lasting cease-fire,\" U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, who is the only Palestinian American in Congress and who endorsed the \"uncommitted\" movement, said on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\nShe may be right. But it's not entirely clear what it means going forward politically. As a percentage of the statewide Democratic vote, \"uncommitted\" sat at 13.2%. That's a sliver compared with Biden's 81% and not that far off the 11% that Obama saw when he ran for reelection in 2012, though it was higher in some counties, notably Wayne (including Detroit and Dearborn, the latter being the center of Michigan's Arab American and Muslim communities, where uncommitted actually appeared to score higher than Biden) and Washtenaw, home of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where anti-Israeli sentiment toward the fighting has run high.\n\nTogether, though, it still leaves a lot of questions for the Biden campaign to sort out in a state he won by about 154,000 votes, or just under 3%, in 2020. The president and his allies will have to determine how many of those votes are lost to him in November and how many could return once confronted with the likelihood of Trump, who proposed banning people from some Arab and Muslim majority countries from entering the U.S. when in office, winning another term.\n\nNikki Haley's numbers\n\nBut it wasn't just Biden who should have seen some red lights flashing in the results. True, both he and Trump won their primaries handily, taking the vast majority of delegates available toward their eventual nominations. (Biden was projected by the Associated Press to get at least 115 of the 117 available; Trump projected to get 12 of the 16 being doled out based on the primary result.) But if Biden has to confront the question of a protest vote, Trump has to consider the fact that Nikki Haley, his former ambassador to the United Nations and a former South Carolina governor, won nearly 300,000 votes, or 26.6% of the Republican primary vote (and will get four delegates) to his 68.1%. (She also won four delegates.)\n\nNow, that's clearly a drubbing for Haley, no question, and makes Trump's renomination seem all the more inevitable heading into Super Tuesday next week, when more than a dozen states vote. But consider: Trump had positioned himself virtually as an incumbent, running in a party in which he exercises vast control and was so confident of the outcome he refused to participate in any debates. And Haley, who was concentrating on other states, spent almost no time in Michigan until the last couple of days. If her result is looked at as a protest vote against Trump, it indicates an even-larger part of the electorate unhappy with him as the potential nominee than is looking to send a signal over Israel to Biden. And Trump lagged even more in vote-rich suburban counties including Oakland (61.5%-33.5%), Kent (59.2%-34.4%) and Washtenaw (50.2%-44.5%) which in large part, cost him the election to Biden four years ago. So, yes, while some polls have indicated Trump is leading Biden at this point, this race is far from over.\n\nIt also could be interesting to see how that plays out at a state Republican Party caucus/convention where the majority of the state's 55 delegates to the July nominating convention in Milwaukee will be doled out after a vote based not on Tuesday's primary results but on voting by locally elected GOP representatives from each of the state's 13 congressional districts.\n\nTurnout numbers\n\nAbout 1.9 million people voted in Michigan's presidential primary Tuesday, roughly 400,000 fewer than in 2020. And the share of voting-age residents who cast a ballot was 24% — down six percentage points with 99% of precincts reporting on Wednesday afternoon according to unofficial numbers from the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nMichigan's lowest participation rates for presidential primaries were in 1996 when no Democratic presidential party candidates participated, and in 1980 when no major candidates participated. During Michigan's 2020 primary, 14 Democratic presidential candidates competed with then-former Vice-President Joe Biden, who took a majority of party votes, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nEarly, absentee voting\n\nWhile Michigan's presidential primary date was moved up earlier in the nominating calendar ― by Democrats, specifically ― to give the state's voters more influence over which presidential candidates are chosen, a whopping number of voters decided to go even earlier, casting their ballots before Tuesday itself.\n\nAccording to figures released by the Michigan Secretary of State's Office on Tuesday, more than 934,000 voters had returned their absentee ballots before the election. And more than 78,000 additional voters took advantage of early, in-person voting during the presidential primary, the first statewide election in Michigan where early voting was an option. Compared with the 2020 Michigan presidential primary, 154,000 more voters had submitted their absentee ballots by the day before the primary this year, compared with four years ago.\n\nAnd more absentee ballots likely were returned on Election Day — 1.26 million absentee ballots were distributed to voters across the state for the primary, according to the Secretary of State's Office. If nothing else, it suggests that Michiganders are becoming used to options other than in-person voting on Election Day when it comes to casting their ballots.\n\nOthers votes, some for candidates no longer running\n\nAs with most primaries, Tuesday's included a lot of votes being cast for candidates no longer in the running, none of whom scored highly enough (15% in the Democratic primary, 12.5% in the Republican primary) to garner delegates to the nominating convention. (As a side note, it was expected that two Democratic delegates would be doled out as \"uncommitted\" based on the results in some congressional districts.)\n\nThe reason for this is clear ― primary ballots have to be printed weeks in advance and a lot of candidates tend to drop out during the early part of an election. In Tuesday's balloting, only one remaining candidate other than Haley received votes: U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, of Minnesota, who is running against Biden in the Democratic contests. With 99% of the vote in, he got 20,576 votes or 2.7% of the total. Author Marianne Williamson, who had dropped out of the Democratic primary some weeks ago, got slightly more, 22,793, or 3% of the vote.\n\nApparently, Williamson was bolstered by the support; on Wednesday morning, she said she was \"unsuspending\" her campaign and getting back in.\n\nOn the Republican side, it's worth noting that \"uncommitted\" also trailed Trump and Haley, with 33,530 votes or 3%. Behind that was a string of candidates, all of whom had suspended their campaigns: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 13,422 or 1.2%; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 4,784 or 0.4%; entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, 3,717 or 0.3%; pastor Ryan Binkley, 2,366 or 0.2% and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, 1,088 or 0.1%.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter@tsspangler.

Michigan moved up its presidential primary election as part of a nationwide shake-up of the electoral calendar led by the Democratic National Committee, and the state's presidential primaries going forward will take place on the fourth Tuesday in February.\n\nOn this warm Tuesday − seriously, we might break a temperature record − polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. local time (note that several counties in the Upper Peninsula are on Central Time, while the rest of the state is on Eastern Time.)\n\nMichigan primary 2024:Get all the latest election results here\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Joe Biden is the frontrunner and U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. is also actively campaigning. On the Republican side, former President Donald Trump is the frontrunner, with former ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley running against him. Republican Ryan Binkley suspended his campaign a few hours after Michigan's polls opened. Learn more about the candidates in our voter guide.\n\nHere's what we heard at polling places across the state, from rural Newaygo County on the west side of the state to the heart of Detroit.\n\nMany metro Detroit Jewish residents encourage voting, but seek anonymity for security reasons\n\nThe Free Press sought comments on the presidential primary from more than a dozen Jewish residents of metro Detroit. Many declined to respond, saying they feared an anti-semitic backlash if their names were to be published. About two weeks ago, pro-Palestinian demonstrators blocked the entrance to a Jewish country club in West Bloomfield, where police later found threatening graffiti.\n\nOf those willing to comment, Judy Herman of West Bloomfield said in a text aimed at Democrats: “This is way too important of an election to be uncommitted. That position is misguided on so many levels.” Herman said that Democrats who voted “uncommitted,” hoping to voice a protest against President Joe Biden, “will only help Trump, who is no friend to those in this movement” that seeks a cease-fire and peace in Gaza.\n\nDavid Bloom of Birmingham said: “I actually voted for Nikki Haley. I believe Biden has declining cognitive ability. I think the Democrats need an alternative to Biden, just like the Republicans need an alternative to Trump.”\n\nJacob Seid, of Royal Oak, talked about the primary process: “I guess my two cents on it is, getting out to vote is the most important thing in all of this. People don’t feel their voices are heard. They hear bad things in the news about what might happen. But they need to get out and vote. That’s what America is about.\n\n“I think people need to do their research, and be open to exploring multiple sources of news, and not just limit themselves to one source. Also, people should have a worldly view. You can’t just look at one thing. They shouldn’t just be talking about Israel and Palestine. It’s about the border and the economy and the community. I think people fall into a trap of looking at just one issue.”\n\nAt least one polling location ran out of voter registration applications\n\nDearborn City Clerk George Darany confirmed to USA TODAY that at least one polling location in the city ran out of voter registration applications. Darany said a few people needed to wait until an election worker could deliver some fresh applications to Maples Elementary School.\n\n“We had the applications replenished in 10 or 15 minutes,” Darany said. “We had to have somebody run over there.”\n\nThe group Listen to Michigan, which encouraged Michigan voters to vote uncommitted as a response to Biden’s refusal to call for a ceasefire in the Middle East, took responsibility for the shortage on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“One of our polling locations in Dearborn ran out of voter registration applications so they're waiting for the city to print and bring more,” the group wrote in a post. “Stay in line!”\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nArab American voters sound off on Biden's Gaza policies\n\nIn Dearborn today, some Arab American voters said they were voting “uncommitted” to send a message to the world from the heart of Arab America that the United States government’s military support for Israel is hurting both Palestinians and also America’s stature in the world and its economy. They called for the U.S. to invest more in its people rather than sending money to foreign nations such as Israel.\n\n“We have to tell him to stop killing Palestinian people,” Imad Alsoofi, 47, of Dearborn, who voted uncommitted, said outside the Salina school. “We have to bring the money for the American people. The American people right now they are hungry, they are homeless. Why all the money for overseas? American people first.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n-- Niraj Warikoo\n\nTrump has staying power in rural Michigan\n\nIn the 2024 Michigan presidential primary, Trump appears to still hold the most sway with voters in rural Michigan.\n\nIn Newaygo County, voters leaving the polls Tuesday afternoon weren’t shy about their support for the former president. Joe Williams, 61, wore a camouflage baseball cap with “TRUMP” in bold letters on the front to vote at Newaygo city hall.\n\n“He showed everybody what it’s supposed to be like,” said Williams, of Newaygo. An ardent conservative, Williams said he doesn’t believe President Joe Biden will be the Democratic presidential nominee come November, speculating it could be former First Lady Michelle Obama or California Gov. Gavin Newsom. So far, neither Obama or Newsom has offered any indication they were looking to run, although that hasn't quelled speculation in some circles.\n\nLike Trump, Williams believes the 2020 election was stolen. In the years since Biden won the election, Trump has continued to float unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020, despite numerous audits failing to find any such fraud and a gaggle of lawsuits from Trump and his allies all failing to reverse the election’s results.\n\nStill, Trump’s supporters in this deeply red pocket of Michigan view him as having the best chance to beat Biden in a general election, instead of a new candidate like Haley.\n\nHaving already served a term in the White House, Trump will know how to “clean house” and avoid the pitfalls of his first term, said Christina Deryke, 61, also of Newaygo. She said career politicians made sure Trump “got stabbed in the back a lot.\"\n\nDeryke mentioned security at the U.S. southern border with Mexico as one of her most pressing issues, and hopes a second Trump term means the completed construction of a border wall.\n\n“I think the majority of Americans feel the same way I do,” she said. “And we're patriotic. We're American. And we're going to remain that way.”\n\nFurther north along Highway M-37, through a small swath of the Manistee National Forest, White Cloud resident Charles Smith also cast his Republican primary ballot for Trump Tuesday.\n\n“We have to have a little more conservative behavior coming out of Washington,” said Smith, 69.\n\nLike Williams and Deryke, Smith doesn’t believe Haley poses a better chance of defeating Biden in a general election than Trump, saying “I've seen I've seen what Trump can do. And we did well when he was there.”\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nIn Detroit, two different lanes of Biden support\n\nIn Detroit – a Democratic stronghold where Biden defeated Trump with 94% of the vote in 2020 – those who voted for Biden Tuesday expressed different perspectives on the primary as they headed to vote at Greater Grace Temple on the city’s west side.\n\nFelicia Hogan, 58, of Detroit, said she wouldn’t have liked to see more competition against Biden in the primary. “I just believe in President Biden. He’s great. He’s been doing great things with the economy,” she said. “He’s like a grandfather and he’s knowledgeable.”\n\nBut Gary Kedzierski, 59, of Detroit – who said he also voted for Biden Tuesday – wanted Biden to face a more formidable challenge from within his own party during his reelection campaign. “I’m definitely voting for Biden, but at the same time, I wish there was another candidate on the ballot,” he said. He said he would have liked to see California Gov. Gavin Newsom enter the race.\n\nBoth Detroit voters, however, leveled criticisms about a push to vote “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary to pressure Biden to demand a cease-fire in the war in Gaza. It’s Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war, not Biden’s, said Kedzierski. “I think that they’re putting too much on Biden,” he said of those calling for the protest vote.\n\nHogan, meanwhile, blasted the effort altogether. “I think it’s ridiculous,” she said, characterizing it as divisive.\n\nHeading into the fall, both voters want to see Biden once again emerge as the winner in a likely rematch against Trump. “I think that right now, if it was ran today, he might lose,” said Kedzierski, of Biden. But he predicts that as the general election nears, voters will remember what it was like to live under a Trump presidency. “People don’t want another four years of that,” he said.\n\n-- Clara Hendrickson\n\nTrump trashes Biden, Fain, Whitmer in radio interview\n\nTrump delivered a primary day message of his own to Michiganders, calling in to WFDF-AM (910) in metro Detroit to urge voters to go to the polls and trashing Biden, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and UAW President Shawn Fain.\n\nHe called Fain – who delivered the UAW’s endorsement of Biden last month after the president walked the picket line with striking workers last fall – “absolutely atrocious.” As for Whitmer, he called her “a terrible governor who sold you out.” He also referred to Biden as “pathetic… the worst president we’ve ever had by far.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n-- Todd Spangler\n\nBiden or uncommitted? Whitmer, Tlaib back dueling Democratic ideas in primary\n\nWith Election Day upon us, two Democratic Michigan officials are leading in different directions. U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, posted a video explaining her \"uncommitted\" vote, while Whitmer warned on national media appearances that such votes could give Trump a boost come November.\n\nStill, Whitmer predicted a \"sizable number of votes for uncommitted\" in an interview with NBC News.\n\nGet the full story here.\n\n-- Clara Hendrickson\n\nIn rural Saginaw County, votes for Trump, Haley and Biden\n\nIn the village of Chesaning, in southern Saginaw County, voting was steady early Tuesday morning amid balmy weather at the Chesaning Township hall.\n\nSaginaw County has become a political bellwether in Michigan. Since 1992, the county has voted for the statewide winner in every election.\n\nRural Chesaning Township is a more conservative part of the county, but a range of presidential preferences was evident among those casting their ballots Tuesday.\n\nDoug Moeggenborg, a financial advisor, said he came out to vote for Haley.\n\n“Am I excited? Not really,” Moeggenborg said as he left the township hall. “We all have to vote. It’s our duty to vote. If you don’t vote, you can’t complain.”\n\nThough he’s not enthusiastic about either Biden or Trump, Moeggenborg said that if faced with a Biden-Trump contest in November, as expected, he will back the Republican candidate.\n\nThe main issue for Moeggenborg is securing the border, because he wants his family and American citizens to be safe, he said.\n\nHe said he’s not been pleased with the performance of the last three presidents as the federal deficit has climbed and divisiveness has increased.\n\n“Back in the day, you used to be able to talk about this with people and not get mad. We’ve lost the sight of God in our lives.”\n\nDeb and Bryan Taylor, both retired skilled trade workers from GM, went to the township hall to vote for Trump.\n\n“He’s the only one out there who’s going to get this country back on track,” said Deb Taylor, who said she wants Trump to pick up where he left off four years ago, cleaning out “the swamp” in Washington, D.C. and fighting “the deep state.”\n\nSecuring the border is also a big issue for Bryan Taylor, who said he is fed up with “all the stuff that’s going on in Washington, and all the corrupt politicians.” Trump, he said, is “the only one that’s going to weed this out.” He believes many union members and retired union members, like him, will be voting for Trump in 2024.\n\nAsked whether he is confident the presidential vote will be accurately counted and reported, Bryan Taylor said that “now is not the time to give up,” but that if Trump is not declared the victor in November, “I’ll pretty much think there is still voter fraud.”\n\nDeb Taylor said the news media has been a major disappointment to her. She used to watch Fox News, but “somehow they got compromised,” and “they’re all siding with Biden.”\n\nJoe Henning, a retired GM millwright, said he voted for Biden Tuesday at the Chesaning Township hall in Saginaw County.\n\n“I wish there were more people. More choices on both sides,” Henning said after casting his ballot.\n\nAsked how he feels about Biden, Henning said presidents “don’t do it on their own,” and “they’ve got hurdles to jump through.”\n\nHe said he finds himself in the minority as a Democratic voter in southern Saginaw County and would consider voting for certain Republican candidates, but he does not feel Trump, based on his record, is fit to be president.\n\n-- Paul Egan\n\nMore:Here's who can vote in Michigan's presidential primary\n\nCAIR leader casts 'uncommitted' vote\n\nDawud Walid, 52, of Canton Twp., is the executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) Michigan Chapter. He voted 'uncommitted' at the Village Theater at Cherry Hill Tuesday morning.\n\n“I’m voting to express my discontent with the Biden policy in regarding his support for what the Israeli government is doing to the people of Palestine,” Walid said.\n\nHe's likely not to be alone -- an organized campaign is urging voters to vote uncommitted, seeking at least 10,000 such votes to signal to Biden support for a cease-fire. An EPIC-MRA survey of 600 active and likely Michigan voters conducted Feb. 13-18 found 53% of respondents − including 74% of self-described Democrats − said Israel should declare a cease-fire with Hamas to negotiate the release of hostages and provide humanitarian aid to Gaza rather than continue with the war.\n\nWalid says he is a regular voter, plans to vote in the upcoming election in November and wants the current president to do better.\n\n-- Jalen Williams\n\nIn Grand Rapids, Biden voters eye November\n\nBilly Mia, of Grand Rapids, said he voted for Biden.\n\nStanding outside Seventh Reformed Church on the city’s west side, Mia said he sees Biden as “the lesser of two evils” between the president and his presumed Republican challenger, Trump.\n\n“Trump is a maniac,” Mia said Tuesday morning. “If I were checking boxes, from not necessarily what they do but from what they say, I’m more aligned with Joe Biden.”\n\nStill, Mia credited voters who were voting “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary over Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza, for standing by their convictions.\n\nAnother Biden voter — David Hamel, 60, was also direct in his reasoning, saying “Donny can’t win.”\n\n“Hopefully with this election we’ll be done with him and get back to some normalcy,\" he said.\n\nHamel also said he had no problems with the uncommitted movement, but was critical of some of the messaging around it. He said he received a call from a phone banker Monday which referred to Biden as “genocide Joe.”\n\n“I get that part of it really, they’re just slaughtering them and it breaks my heart. But Joe’s not the one shooting the gun.”\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nTrump voter doesn’t love either presumptive candidate\n\nDavid Montgomery, 57, of Grand Rapids Twp. mentioned security at the U.S. southern border with Mexico and the state of the American economy as reasons he voted for Trump in the Republican primary Tuesday.\n\n“My money is going nowhere near as far as it used to before the current presidency,” he said. “In my opinion, we have to make some change.”\n\nBut Montgomery said he’s not overly excited about the prospects of a Biden-Trump rematch this fall.\n\n“I think there's a lot of people holding their noses right now on this vote, including me,” he said. “I think both options stink, but at this point, I don’t think anybody’s going to take over Trump, and Biden, he’s not going to allow anybody to take his place unless he ends up in the old folks’ home.”\n\nAge has been a question for Biden as he mounts his reelection campaign — at 81, he is already the oldest president to have served in the position. But Trump would be 78 at the time he took office if he were to win back the presidency, and would be older than any other president bar Biden.\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nLooking for more on Michigan’s elections this year?

Awad clarified for the crowd that he was speaking in a personal capacity when he made the electoral threat.\n\n\"No votes for you anywhere if you don’t call for a cease-fire now,\" he said.\n\nAwad's call for an electoral boycott of the Democratic party came one day after progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, released a video making a similar call to action.\n\n“Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people,\" Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, says in the video. \"The American people won’t forget. Biden, support a cease-fire now. Or don’t count on us in 2024.”\n\n'Enough is enough'\n\nSome at the protest, such as Joan Nicholson, 89, of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, were drawn by their longstanding sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Others, like Xochitl Aldama, 25, of Tampa, Florida, said they came to the protest due to their newfound horror at the scale of destruction in Gaza.\n\nOthers were driven by personal loss.\n\n“I came with tens of thousands of others to hold my country accountable for its complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity,” Laila El Haddad, 45, a Palestinian American author, told USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned yesterday that five of my close family members – my aunt, three of my adult cousins, and my cousin’s wife – were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their Gaza City home.”\n\n“I’m here to say enough is enough,” she said.\n\nBig crowd spills beyond Freedom Plaza\n\nBy late Saturday afternoon, it was unclear how many people had participated in the rally. The crowd spilled out of Freedom Plaza and across the adjoining streets.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police said in response to a query that it was “prohibited from providing crowd sizes for any event.” The D.C. Metropolitan Police didn’t respond to calls seeking an estimate of the crowd’s size.\n\nAs the speeches wound down shortly before 5 p.m, a stream of demonstrators two city blocks long left the plaza to march to the White House as Arabic pop music played and participants shared snacks of carrot sticks and crackers. Some marchers carried mock coffins representing the victims of Israeli strikes on Gaza.\n\nThe bulk of the marchers stood outside the White House for about 30 minutes chanting slogans before dispersing.\n\nOne man was arrested for destruction of property during the protest in Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Officer Elizabeth Grannis said. The man is accused of spray painting windows of a business in the 700 block of 17th Street, NW, a police social media post said.\n\nIn a social media post Saturday evening, traffic police said people were gradually dispersing from Lafayette Park, and police are planning to reopen planned road closures.\n\nPolice were still monitoring the protests in front of the White House, Grannis said.\n\nJust before 8 p.m., Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service, told USA TODAY demonstrators remained at the White House complex, but an attempt to trespass at a gate was handled without incident. No arrests had been made by Secret Service personnel, he said.\n\nAnti-Defamation League claims rally had 'zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering'\n\nThe speeches at Freedom Plaza were full of grief over the destruction of Gaza and anger about the war, but no one who took the stage Saturday condemned Hamas or its attack on Israel, Meredith Weisel, capital region director of the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\n\"There was zero acknowledgment of Israeli suffering,\" Weisel said in an interview, \"and a lot of legitimizing and justification for violence against Israelis.\"\n\nOne group of demonstrators carried a banner bearing the hashtag #AlAqsaFlood, the name that Hamas gave to its stunning attack last month.\n\n\"Surely there are people there today who are responding to the humanitarian crisis\" in Gaza, Weisel added. \"But most of the people we have have seen on the stage have been justifying what happened on Oct. 7.\"\n\nProtesters in New York, London and Paris demand an end to the Gaza war\n\nOn Saturday evening, images circulated online showed scores of demonstrators marching through Midtown Manhattan streets toward the United Nations building. The New York City Police Department said there were temporary road closures because of the protest, though no arrests had been made. Mayor Eric Adams was monitoring the protest, a City Hall spokesperson said in a text message.\n\nU.N. press officers didn't immediately respond to emails Saturday evening.\n\nOn Friday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported protesters at the Port of Oakland, in California, scaled a U.S. military vessel believed to be headed to Israel.\n\nIn Europe, at least 11 people were arrested in London on Saturday afternoon as a surge of hundreds of demonstrators shut down the Oxford Circus shopping and tourist district, blocking streets and chanting slogans in support of the Palestinian people.\n\n“This behavior clearly impacts on London’s ability to function normally and we are working quickly to reopen the road,” London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.\n\nIn Paris, thousands marched to demand a cease-fire in the first mass gathering allowed by officials since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. As he marched, Wahid Barek, a 66-year-old retiree, told Reuters he opposed the killing of both Israelis and Palestinians. \"I deplore civilian deaths on both sides. Civilians have nothing to do with these actions. It really is shameful,\" he said.\n\nProtesters also took to the streets in Berlin, Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey to protest the bombardment of Gaza.\n\nToddlers and grandmothers join the crowd at protest in DC\n\nBy 2:30 p.m., Pennsylvania Avenue and other streets around the rally were thick with demonstrators as speakers began addressing the calm but energized assembly. Organizers said that 40 buses carrying attendees couldn't reach the plaza after streets were closed, organizers said. The passengers walked under cloud-streaked skies attempting to get as close as they could to the rally.\n\nThe crowd included participants using wheelchairs, toddlers and people of all races wearing the keffiya, a traditional scarf worn in Arab regions. Many held signs calling for an end to the war in Gaza, with some linking the Palestinian cause with other world events, including a placard that read: \"From Palestine to Mexico, these border walls have got to go.\"\n\nNavy vet among the swelling numbers at Gaza protest\n\nAs demonstrators filled Freedom Plaza, spilling out onto the surrounding streets, chanting \"cease-fire now\" at a deafening volume, James Colbow, a 69-year-old Navy veteran from Ohio, said he drove to the capital to show solidarity with embattled Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“I felt disappointment in my government that they’ve been complicit in these war crimes,” Colbow said.\n\nColbow said a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side-by-side, would be key to peace in the Middle East. \"I believe in the Jewish people’s right to self-determination but also for the Palestinians,” he said.\n\nWho planned the Gaza protest?\n\nThe D.C. demonstration was organized by the ANSWER Coalition, an umbrella group of anti-war and racial justice organizations, which advocates for ending the Israeli siege of Gaza and for the cessation of U.S. aid to Israel.\n\n\"Today is going to be the largest demonstration ever in the history of the United States in support of Palestinian social and civil rights, and for peace,\" Brian Becker, the coalition's executive director said in an interview before the event.\n\n\"We're sending a message to the Biden administration that we profoundly disagree with its position, which has opposed a ceasefire and has instead embraced Israel's genocidal-type assault against civilians in Gaza,\" Becker said. \"We're expecting, minimally, tens of thousands. I wouldn't be surprised if there are 100,000.\"\n\nNetanyahu rejects calls for a 'humanitarian pause'\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu deflected pleas by Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken for a \"humanitarian pause\" in the fighting that would allow food and medical supplies into Gaza.\n\n“I have made clear that we are continuing forcefully, and that Israel refuses a temporary cease-fire that does not include the release of our hostages,” Netanyahu said following a meeting with Blinken in Tel Aviv. “Israel does not allow the entry of fuel to the Gaza Strip and opposes the transfer of funds to Gaza.”\n\nMore:Israeli strikes kill civilians in Gaza at shelter, hospital; Blinken in Jordan: Updates\n\nHamas, the militant Islamist movement that controls Gaza, abducted an estimated 240 people from Israel during its stunning attack last month.\n\nBlinken stresses 'imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilians'\n\nThe U.N., citing figures from the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry, said Friday that 9,257 people had been killed in the coastal enclave by Israeli airstrikes since Oct. 7 including 3,826 children. Fewer than one-third of Gaza's hospitals are operating and the territory has seven days of food stocks remaining, the U.N. said.\n\n“We stand strongly with and behind Israel in its right and obligation to defend itself, defend its people and take the steps necessary to try to ensure that this never happens again,” Blinken told reporters on Friday, while also emphasizing “the imperative of doing everything possible to protect civilians, the imperative of doing everything possible to get assistance to those who need it.”\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/04"}]}

Inside the ancient ritual that lives on.", "text": "The 2024 Summer Olympics are fast approaching. More than 800 athletes will head to Paris to compete as part of Team USA. The Games will include warm-weather sports like swimming and diving as well as fan favorites like football, basketball and tennis.\n\nU.S. athletes will look to add gold, silver and bronze medals to the country’s current record of 3,105, more than double the medal count of any other country.\n\nHere’s a history lesson on the modern Games and their ancient origins.\n\nWhen did the Olympics start?\n\nAn exact date is unknown, but the International Olympic Committee cites 776 BC as the first recorded Olympic Games. Nevertheless, most believe the Games were already 500 years old at that time, according to the History Channel.\n\nThe Games were a five-day religious festival honoring Zeus, according to the IOC. Athletes competed every four years in running, jumping, boxing, throwing, wrestling, pankration (combined boxing and wrestling) as well as chariot racing. Athletes competed naked and, during certain wrestling events, covered in oil.\n\nThe Games were held until 393 AD, when the Roman Christian Emperor Theodosius I banned them. He believed worshipping Zeus through the Games was a \"pagan abomination,\" according to National Geographic.\n\nThe Olympics wouldn’t return until the late 19th century. Pierre de Coubertin, who co-founded the International Olympic Committee, was inspired to reinstitute the Games after seeing what German archaeologists uncovered during an excavation of ancient Olympia when he was a child. Coubertin, seeking to increase sports education in France, presented his proposal to re-establish the Olympics in 1892. It was approved in 1894.\n\nWhen were the first Olympics?\n\nThe IOC hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896 in Athens. The location was chosen as a tribute to the Games' origins. According to the History Channel, 280 male athletes from 13 countries participated in 43 events, including track and field, swimming, gymnastics, cycling, wrestling, weightlifting, fencing, shooting and tennis. The 1896 Olympics also saw the world’s first marathon competition.\n\nBut world fairs largely outshone the early Olympic Games. and it wasn’t until the 1920s that the “first truly successful” Games occurred, the History Channel says. In 1924, over 3,000 athletes – more than 100 of them women – competed in Paris.\n\nThe games have grown in size and the number of events has expanded in the last century. This year, an estimated 10,500 athletes will compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the IOC reports.\n\nHow often are the Olympics?\n\nThe Summer and Winter Olympics occur every four years to “respect the ancient origins of the Olympic Games.” A period of four years was called an “Olympiad,” in ancient Greece.\n\nBecause the two alternate, we watch the Olympics every two years. For example, the 2022 Olympics were Winter Games and the 2024 Paris Olympics are Summer Games. The next Winter Olympics will be in Italy in 2026.\n\nSubscribe to Chasing Gold newsletter:Your guide to everything 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nJust Curious for more?

Rather than focus on her performance in the +87 kg competition – which finished early when she was not able to register a snatch – Hubbard thanked the Japanese hosts of these Games and the sports organizations who supported her.\n\nHubbard, 43, has endured harassment for her participation leading into these Games, and the New Zealand Olympic Committee and IOC have sought to shield her from it here.\n\nIn a mixed zone crowded with about two dozen reporters, Hubbard gave a short statement noting that response while focusing on her appreciation of the IOC, International Weightlifting Federation and the NZOC.\n\n\"They have supported me through what have been quite difficult times,” Hubbard said of her country’s Olympic committee. “I know that my participation at these Games has not been entirely without controversy, but they have been just so wonderful.”\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe IWF, she added, “really demonstrate that weightlifting is an activity that all people can do.”\n\nAnd the IOC “reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the Olympism,” Hubbard said. “They have demonstrated, I think, that sport is something that all people around the world can do. It’s inclusive. It’s accessible.”\n\nHubbard’s participation underscores the IOC’s current effort to revise its guidelines on transgender athletes’ participation. It is expected to release a new framework in the coming months that will guide the international federations on how to include transgender athletes while maintaining fairness in women’s sports.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics mark the first time transgender athletes have competed under the current policy, which mandate hormone therapy for transgender women, among other requirements.\n\nCanadian soccer player Quinn – who helped their team to an upset of the United States to make the women’s gold-medal match – is also transgender.\n\n“It’s definitely unfortunate that there’s blowback. My Instagram – there’s some blowback but I’m also getting support,” Quinn said. “I’ve seen a lot of kids on Instagram who say they’ve never seen a trans athlete competing before.”\n\nOn Monday, they saw two compete.\n\nIn the weightlifting competition, Hubbard struggled. She failed to register a lift, but came closest on her second attempt, getting the bar above her head and appearing to get credit for the 125 kg snatch before it was ruled a no lift.\n\nThe left her with another attempt at 125 kg, but she struggled to stand and dropped the bar behind her. Hubbard walked to the front of the platform, waved to the crowd and a heart with her hands.\n\n“I know that from a sporting perspective, I didn’t really hit the standards that I’ve put on myself and perhaps the standards that my country has expected of me,” she said. “But one of the things for which I am so profoundly grateful is that I have supporters in New Zealand that have given me so much love and encouragement.”\n\nHubbard received a round of applause when she was introduced with the other weightlifters before the competition.\n\nWhile spectators are banned from Olympic events, athletes, officials and others in the Olympic bubble can attend events. The Monday night session had more people in attendance than either of the earlier sessions during the day.\n\nHubbard’s participation, undoubtedly, was a large reason for the draw. After her Olympic competition ended, she focused on those who had helped her get there.\n\n“One of the great misconceptions, I think, of weightlifting is that it’s an individual sport, but it isn’t,” she said. “Behind every weightlifter, there is a team of people who have offered support, encouragement.”\n\nContributing: Nancy Armour", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/olympics-soccer-u23-2024-paris-fifa-kylian-mbappe-usmnt/74519852007/", "title": "Why is men's soccer U23 at 2024 Paris Olympics? Explaining roster ...", "text": "The largest athletic competition in the world fittingly includes the most popular sport in the world.\n\nWith the exception of one year — 1932, in which no tournament was held — men’s soccer has been a part of the Summer Olympics since 1900, just four years after the first modern Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nDuring that time, the sport’s most historically accomplished countries have taken part in the event, as well as some of the best players of their respective eras, from Lionel Messi to Neymar to Samuel Eto’o.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS:Meet all members of Team USA at the Summer Olympics\n\nBut unlike many of the sports that will be contested over the next several weeks at the 2024 Paris Olympics, winning a gold medal at the Games isn’t regarded as the most prestigious, sought-after accomplishment in international soccer.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe reason for that is pretty simple: an overwhelming majority of the world’s best players don’t compete in the Olympics, which now exists, on the men's side, as an under-23 event.\n\nWhy is that the case? Here’s more on Olympic men’s soccer and its history heading into the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nWhy is men’s soccer U23 at the Olympics?\n\nIf viewers are tuning in to men’s soccer games at the 2024 Paris Olympics hoping to see the likes of Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Cristiano Ronaldo, Harry Kane, Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne or most of soccer’s top superstars globally, they’re unfortunately out of luck.\n\nIn some instances, like with Ronaldo, Kane, Haaland and De Bruyne, their countries aren’t in the Olympics for men’s soccer. But beyond that, men’s soccer at the 2024 Paris Olympics and at Olympics for the past 30 years has been an under-23 competition.\n\nThe rule came to be in advance of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. At the time, the Olympics was undergoing fundamental changes, shifting from a strictly amateur event to one that allowed professional athletes to compete (the 1992 Games, perhaps most famously, featured the \"Dream Team\").\n\nGiven that switch, FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, put various barriers in place for players competing in the Olympics, which it didn’t want to possibly usurp the World Cup as the premier international soccer showcase. One of those measures was an age restriction. Additionally, since the Olympics are not a FIFA-sanctioned competition, club teams have the right to deny a player from taking part. Many clubs will forbid their players from competing in the Olympics and the Euros or Copa America in a single summer.\n\nThis reality makes men’s soccer drastically different than women’s soccer at the Olympics, as the women’s side has no such age limits.\n\nNot every men’s soccer player in the Olympics will be under 23 years old. Each country has up to three spots on the roster to grant to overage players.\n\nMost notably, France was potentially going to use one this year on Mbappe — but his new club team, Real Madrid, would not allow him to compete in the Olympics.\n\n\"My club's position was very clear, so from that moment on, I think I [knew] I won't be taking part in the Games,\" Mbappe said to reporters in June at Euro 2024. \"That's just the way it is, and I understand that too. I'm joining a new team in September, so it's not the best way to start an adventure. I'm going to wish this French team all the best. I'm going to watch every game. I hope they'll win the gold medal.\"\n\nREQUIRED READING:Olympic women's soccer bracket: Standings, what to know, what's next at Paris Olympics\n\nOlympic men’s soccer champions\n\nThough men’s soccer made its first appearance all the way back at the 1900 Paris Olympics, here’s a list of the gold-medal-winning countries at the Olympics since the age limit was introduced at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics:\n\n1992 : Spain\n\n: Spain 1996 : Nigeria\n\n: Nigeria 2000 : Cameroon\n\n: Cameroon 2004 : Argentina\n\n: Argentina 2008 : Argentina\n\n: Argentina 2012 : Mexico\n\n: Mexico 2016 : Brazil\n\n: Brazil 2020: Brazil\n\nBrazil, the two-time reigning gold medalist, will not participate in the men’s tournament this year.\n\nUSMNT Olympics schedule\n\nThe United States men’s national soccer team will be competing in the Olympics this year for the first time since 2008.\n\nThe Americans are in Group A of the competition, with the top two teams from the four-team pod advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament.

I am very sad right now, and feeling a bit embarrassed.\"\n\nPearson rebounded in the debut of the mixed relay on Friday. Effort etched on his face, Pearson anchored Team USA to the silver medal.\n\nIn the mixed relay, two men and two women each completed a mini triathlon comprised of a 300-meter swim, 7.4-kilometer bike ride, and two-kilometer run.\n\nA Delbarton graduate from the New Vernon section of Harding, Pearson is the first Jersey-raised athlete to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Former Princeton rower Fred Vystavel and his partner Joachim Sutton earned bronze in the men's pair (6:18.99) for Denmark earlier this week.\n\nPearson finished his leg in 20 minutes and 21 seconds, seven seconds slower than Kevin McDowell, the other American man on the relay.

Rojas, the silver medalist in Rio, is at No. 1 on both lists, at 15.43.\n\nKeturah Orji:4 things to know about Olympic triple jumper from Mount Olive\n\nOrji is the only American in the final. Tori Franklin, who had broke Orji's American record, was 25th (13.68) of 32 competitors.\n\n\"The first time, I felt like I was just happy to make it (to the Olympics),\" Orji said before leaving for Tokyo. \"I didn't have many expectations for myself. I definitely was just happy to be there. It's a fun experience. I was so young, so I was very nervous. ... This year, I want to win a medal. There's more pressure from myself. It's more like a business trip, where I'm going get something done, as opposed to a dream come true. It's more surreal the first time.\"\n\nTaking to the track (and field)\n\n♦ Trenton's Athing Mu won her heat of the 800 meters (2:01.01), as track and field competition got underway early Friday morning, Tokyo time.

He's the lone American to advance past the prelim.\n\n\"Very stoked for him,\" Sam's father and former coach, Marlon Mattis, said via text message. \"Still not 100 percent healthy, but he dug deep.\"\n\nAmerican foilists take on teams\n\nJacqueline Dubrovich of Pompton Lakes, gold-medalist Lee Kiefer and the American foil fencing team competed on July 28 and 29. After defeating host nation Japan in the opening round, due in part to Dubrovich's three individual bout wins, the team lost a semifinal to the top-ranked Russian Olympic Committee, 45-42.\n\nTeam USA later lost the bronze-medal match to Italy, 45-23, and finished fourth. Dubrovich did not compete in that match as she was replaced by the team's alternate, Sabrina Massialas, following the semifinal loss.\n\nMedal moments on the water\n\nAfter two failed attempts to qualify, Nic Fink made the most of his Olympics experience.\n\nFink, a Pingry alumnus from Morristown, finished fifth in the 200-meter breaststroke on Wednesday night, early Thursday morning in Tokyo. He seemed disappointed with his final time of 2:07.93, the fastest of three Olympic swims.\n\nAustralia's Zac Stubblety-Cook (2:06.38) claimed the gold medal.\n\n\"He is the feel-good story, and it's not just with us (at Georgia),\" Bulldogs and Team USA coach Jack Bauerle said of Fink.\n\n\"It's sort of like everybody, every coaching friend of mine wanted him to make the team. He is sort of revered, because of his work ethic and his attitude. He's so highly thought of that everyone was happy when he made it.\"\n\n♦ Former Princeton rower Fred Vystavel and his partner Joachim Sutton earned bronze in the men's pair (6:18.99) for Denmark. Croatia won the gold (6:15.29).\n\n\"Watching Fred on the awards dock receiving his bronze medal brought me to tears,\" Princeton head coach Greg Hughes said in a press release. \"It has been such a long, hard stretch of training over these last four years for him to arrive at this point. Through it all, he stayed true to his goals and never faltered. And, in typical Fred fashion, he's done it with such an incredible attitude and grace. He's been an inspiration to all of us and I am so proud to see him win that medal.\"\n\n♦ Molly Reckford of Short Hills and Michelle Sechser finished fifth in the women's lightweight double sculls, a second behind the winners from Italy.\n\nJersey judoka retires after Olympics\n\nColton Brown of Piscataway opened competition in his second Olympics late Tuesday night.\n\nHe dominated his opening match at 90 kilograms, earning an ippon, 11-0, at 2:03 to defeat Raphael Schwendinger of Liechtenstein.

I won my first match against (Raphael Schwendinger of) Liechtenstein and then ended up losing a tight match in golden score in the round of 16,\" Brown wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Although this isn't what I came for, I left all of myself on that mat yesterday. The amount of support I’ve received from my family and friends has been incredible, and I fought with all of you guys in my heart. ...Dreams really do come true if you’re willing to put the work in and have a solid group of people around you.

Van Brummen won three bouts in Team USA's 33-28 defeat of second seed Poland.\n\n♦ Foilist Mohamed Hamza, a rising junior at Princeton, advanced to a quarterfinal, losing 15-9 to Alexander Choupenich of the Czech Republic. Hamza had defeated Italy's Andrea Cassara, 15-13, in his first match.\n\nWozniak comes up short in sabre\n\nColonia's Dagmara Wozniak advanced to the sabre fencing round of 32, where she fell to Russia's Olga Nikitina, 5-14. Wozniak compete with Team USA in a quarterfinal against France Friday night ET.\n\nAmerican rowers advance\n\nGevvie Stone and Kristi Wagner earned a berth in the double sculls A final. They finished third in the semifinal in 7:11.14, behind the Netherlands and Canada.\n\nStone, a Princeton alumna, won silver in single sculls in 2016.\n\n“One of the guys I row with wrote us an email and said the semifinal is like the Wednesday of the work week,” Stone told the USA TODAY NETWORK. “It's kind of true.

She was called up to the senior national team at 17, helping them win the European Championship earlier this month.\n\nThe Kentucky commit did not compete in her senior season for the Patriots this spring as she prepared to achieve her dream of competing in the Olympics.\n\n\"Growing up, it’s always been that I’m going to play in the SEC and next step I’m going to go to the Olympics or play for a pro team,\" Lacatena said last fall. \"It’s always been a goal of mine and it’s just insane to think that it’s happening.\"\n\nIt is the first year softball is back in the Olympics since it was dropped following the 2008 Games.\n\nLacatena joined snowboarder Danny Kass, formerly a Vernon resident, as the only other Sussex County athlete to compete in the Olympics.

Athletes from around the world, including Team USA flag bearers LeBron James and Coco Gauff, floated on boats for the six-kilometer route that traveled east to west across Paris from the Pont d’Austerlitz to the Trocadero.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought you live updates from Paris, highlights and more throughout the opening ceremony. (Follow NBC's replay of the opening ceremony in prime time.)\n\nWho lit the Olympic Cauldron?\n\nThe Olympic Cauldron was lit by Teddy Riner, a three-time Olympic champion in judo, and Marie-Jose Perec, a three-time Olympic champion in track and field.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nRafael Nadal, Serena Williams carried Olympic torch\n\nIn an Olympics opening ceremony surprise, Rafael Nadal carried the Olympic torch once it reached the Eiffel Tower. Nadal might as well have honorary French residency after winning a record 14 French Opens. He won four in a row from 2005-2008, five in a row from 2010-2014, another four in a row from 2017-2020 and his final one in 2022. He is 112-4 all-time at Roland Garros. A statue of him was erected outside the stadium in 2021. Nadal has 22 Grand Slams total.\n\nNadal then passed the torch to fellow tennis legend Serena Williams. Three of her 23 Grand Slam titles came at the French Open. Carl Lewis, a four-time Olympic champion at the 1984 Games, and Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, who scored the first perfect 10 in Olympic history at the 1976 Games, also were part of the torch’s final journey. — Nancy Armour\n\nAmelie Mauresmo passed Olympic torch to Tony Parker\n\nThe tennis theme in the Olympic torch relay continued when Amelie Mauresmo, the only French player to be No. 1 in the Open era, took the torch after it arrived off the boat. Tony Parker, who paved the way for French players in the NBA and won four titles with the San Antonio Spurs, took the handoff from Mauresmo. Parker and Carter continued running with the torch after they passed it over to a trio of French athletes. — Nancy Armour\n\nCeline Dion at opening ceremony dazzled\n\nThe legendary singer Celine Dion performed at the opening ceremony after the Olympic Cauldron was lit. She also sang at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nEiffel Tower puts on light show at opening ceremony\n\nWatch the iconic Paris landmark sparkle.\n\nWho sang 'Imagine' at the Olympics?\n\nPianist Sofianne Pamart and singer Juliette Armanet performed “Imagine,” the John Lennon and Yoko Ono song.\n\nTeam USA's LeBron James, Coco Gauff not slowed by rain\n\nThe rain wasn’t spoiling the party for LeBron James, Coco Gauff and the rest of the U.S. Olympic team.\n\n“Representing the red, white and blue, there’s no better time,” James said during an interview with NBC’s Maria Taylor during the parade of nations. “We’re here for the USA and ready to go out and compete at a high level.”\n\nThe NBA superstar and the Grand Slam champion were selected as flagbearers by the rest of the U.S. team. Flagbearers held their country’s flags aloft as the team boats floated down the Seine while other athletes waved smaller flags. But Gauff and James also took time to pose for photos with others on the boat – including the captain – and take in the sights of Paris.\n\n“Seeing a lot of water, first off,” Gauff said. “But also some amazing people, a lot of amazing athletes and we’re all excited to represent Team USA.”\n\nAsked if the steady rain put a damper on their special moment, James said no.\n\n“The rain can’t stop us,” he said. — Nancy Armour\n\nAxelle Saint-Cirel performs French national anthem on Grand Palais roof\n\nOn the roof of the Grand-Palais and wearing colors of the French flag, Axelle Saint-Cirel, the Choeur and the Maîtrise de Radio France performed the French national anthem, called The Marseillaise. It was composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, who was an officer for the French Engineers. It was declared the national anthem in 1795. As the national anthem was performed, the Republic Guard raised the flag at the Trocadéro. Composer Victor le Masne musically rearranged the national anthem for the opening ceremony.\n\nSteph Curry, A'ja Wilson at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nWomen's basketball forward A'Ja Wilson looks to have added an extra piece of fashion to her Team USA Ralph Lauren outfit — thanks to the help of Steph Curry. The Golden State Warriors guard — who is making his Olympic debut with USA Basketball in Paris — gifted Wilson Olympics-themed sunglasses for Friday's opening ceremony.\n\nWhich country will host the 2028 Olympics?\n\nThe 2028 Summer Olympics will be in Los Angeles.

But there was a reason for the Aussies being so far out of alphabetical order. Countries that are hosting upcoming Olympics come at the end of the Parade of Nations. Brisbane is hosting the 2032 Summer Games, so Australia was the third-to-last team. The United States was second-to-last, with the Olympics returning to Los Angeles in four years. And France, the host of these Paris Olympics, was the last country in the 85-boat flotilla. — Nancy Armour\n\nOlympics opening ceremony order of countries\n\nThe order of the parade of nations is determined by the French spelling of their country names. Germany is Allemagne in French, for example, so it goes with the As, not the Gs. The only exceptions are the United States, which is Etats-Unis in French but goes second-to-last because it is hosting the next Summer Games, and France, because it’s the host country.\n\nMetal band at Paris Olympics: Who is Gojira?\n\nThe metal band Gojira, who performed at the Olympics opening ceremony, is made up of Joe Duplantier, Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu and Jean-Michel La- badie.

Nakamura mixes elements of R&B, Afropop and Parisian street slang, and her most famous song is “Djadja.” She’s been compared to Rihanna and Cardi B.\n\nWhy Russia, Belarus are banned from 2024 Olympics\n\nOnce again, Russia is technically banned from appearing at the Olympic Games. Yet once again, Russian athletes will compete under a different name − a handful of them, at least.\n\nAt the 2024 Paris Olympics, which begin this week, 15 athletes from Russia − and 18 from neighboring Belarus − are slated to compete as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" or AINs for short, according to the most recent statistics released by the International Olympic Committee on Saturday. The AIN classification means that Russian and Belarusian flags, national anthems and uniforms will be absent from the Paris Games.

Alongside a fleet of dancers, the Grammy favorite performed a French-inspired set alongside the Seine river with a tribute to Zizi Jeanmaire's presentation of \"Mon Truc En Plumes,\" translated to “My Thing with Feathers.” — Jay Stahl\n\nOlympic opening ceremony performers\n\nLady Gaga, metal band Gojira and French pop star Aya Nakamura were among those who have performed at the opening ceremony.\n\nWho made medals for the Paris Olympics?\n\nThe Monnaie de Paris, which has been minting France’s coins since 864. The company also made the medals for the Athens Olympics in 1896, the first modern Olympic Games, and the two previous Summer Games in Paris, in 1900 and 1924.\n\nHow many medals were made for the Paris Olympics?\n\n5,084.\n\nWhy does Greece go first in the Olympics?\n\nGreece goes first at the opening ceremony every Olympics because it is the birthplace of the Olympic Games.\n\nWhy is Peyton Manning wearing an arm band?\n\nNBC opening ceremony co-host Peyton Manning sported an arm band on his right forearm during the opening ceremony broadcast, much like he did during his playing days as an NFL quarterback. He joked he was wearing it because he had notes on all 200-plus countries in the opening ceremomny.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo on being Greece's flag bearer\n\n“That is an honor,” he said. “If I am the flag bearer, great. If I am not, OK. I am just happy that I have a good coaching staff and a good team, I am in the Olympics.\"\n\nWho designed the Olympics flag?\n\nPierre de Coubertin, who is considered the founder of the modern Olympics, designed the rings in July 1913. The Olympics logo was first used on a flag in 1914. That original flag is now at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. The IOC officially adopted the rings logo and flag in 1914.\n\nAmericans in Paris\n\nRachael Raskovich, Amanda Mason-Sekula and Kelly Holmes arrived at the opening ceremony wearing American flag themed hats, red white and blue glasses and sequin USA jackets with \"Proud American\" stitched on the back.\n\n\"Amazon,\" Raskovich said with a smile when asked about the gear.\n\nThe trio of friends met in law school and said they will spend the next week or so hopping around to events around the city. They have tickets to beach volleyball and equestrian, Raskovich said, among other sports. Their group was just one of the many clad in red, white and blue that lined the southern banks of the Seine River on Friday night. Doris Ng of Chicago was among the U.S. spectators who were still searching for a good spot from which to view the ceremony in the hour before it began.\n\n\"We thought we were going to be on time,\" she said. \"I think everybody else beat us to the punch already.\"\n\nFortunately, she also has tickets to the closing ceremony, she said. — Tom Schad\n\nNot every local was in a festive mood\n\nOne man saw my media credential and wanted to make sure — despite barely speaking English — that he was upset over a rumor Celine Dion had been paid 2 million Euros to perform one song at the opening ceremony. Another woman, an American who has lived in Paris for 15 years, said property taxes went up and yet Parisians were not given much access to events or even public spaces to watch the festivities despite the financial and social burden being put on them.\n\nBut even when the rain began falling, people did not scatter to look for shelter. Instead they powered through, trying to get a better look at the bleu, blanc and rouge streaks being left in the sky by an airplane flyover.\n\nRestaurants, which don’t have televisions here, were generally not busy. If you were going out to eat Friday night, it’s because you didn’t care to watch the show live. But inside one of them in a residential area near the Eiffel Tower, you could hear the singing of La Marseillaise, the French National Anthem. For a few minutes, the din of conversation went completely silent. — Dan Wolken\n\nTeam USA opening ceremony outfit\n\nTeam USA’s opening ceremony outfit is a modern take on a tailored look. On top, a tailored single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping is worn over a striped oxford shirt. The bottom is a more casual tapered jean and classic suede buck shoe fit.\n\nRalph Lauren works closely with Team USA and the goal, as always, is to “do something graphic and uniquely American,” chief brand and innovation officer David Lauren said.\n\nTo account for the heat, the company constantly looks at different fabrics and layering systems to keep the athlete’s body temperature in check, Lauren said. All items in both the opening and closing ceremony outfits are manufactured in the United States.\n\nCoco Gauff opens up on being U.S. flag bearer, making Olympic debut\n\nCoco Gauff is making her Olympic debut in Paris and she is one of two U.S. flag bearers. “(Competing) in the Olympics has always been up there with winning a Grand Slam, like top goals,” Gauff told USA TODAY Sports this summer. Read our full feature on Gauff.\n\nOn the opening ceremony red carpet, Serena Williams was asked about Gauff being the flag bearer. \"Isn't that great. I'm so excited to see her tonight. I'm just so happy for her,\" the tennis legend said.\n\nUSA flag bearers 2024\n\nBasketball superstar LeBron James and tennis star Coco Gauff are the flag bearers for the Americans. Gauff is the first tennis player to serve in the role.\n\nWhy is Snoop Dogg at Olympics?\n\nWith his mind on the Olympics and the Olympics on his mind, Snoop Dogg is, indeed, back for the 2024 Paris Olympics. The rapper, who will carry the torch ahead of the opening ceremony, is primed for a bigger role three years after his reactions to the dressage competition with Kevin Hart went viral at the Tokyo Games.\n\nSnoop will appear regularly on “Primetime in Paris,” serving as a “special correspondent” for NBC. During parts of the primetime show, Snoop Dogg will interact with Team USA athletes, their families, or explore Paris and share his experiences and insights with the night's audience. He's also carrying the Olympic torch.\n\nParis Olympics closing ceremony date\n\nThe 2024 Summer Games will hold the closing ceremony on Aug. 11\n\nHow many times has Paris hosted the Olympics?\n\nParis has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: 1900, 1924 and 2024.\n\nAre any U.S. athletes skipping the opening ceremony?\n\nAbout 350 of Team USA’s 592 athletes will march – or rather, float – in today's opening ceremony, according to Nicole Deal, who oversees the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s security operations.\n\nThat means about 40% of the U.S. delegation will be absent, though that is not exactly unusual.\n\nMany athletes and teams – especially those competing early in the Games – choose to pass on the opening ceremony because it often runs late into the night and requires them to spend several hours on their feet. U.S. gymnasts and swimmers, for example, regularly skip the ceremony to rest up for their competitions – which, in some cases, begin the next morning.\n\nU.S. swimming star Katie Ledecky said earlier this week that she never planned on going to the Paris opening ceremony for this very reason. She swims the 400-meter freestyle Saturday morning. — Tom Schad\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Need to brush up on your knowledge of spins and jumps? Have no fear, our event-by-event guide is here to help.\n\nBobsled (February 13 to February 20)\n\nNico Walther, Kevin Kuske, Alexander Roediger and Eric Franke of Germany compete in their final run of the four-man Bobsled Heats at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? A form of transport for centuries, the bobsled was introduced at the first Winter Olympics in 1924 in Chamonix, France, where it started off as a four-man event.\n\nTeams of two or four compete by zooming down an icy track in a curved, cone-like sled, with the fastest total time earning first place. The sport is a bit like Formula 1 on ice because it involves turbulent speeds, consistent pacing and high power, according to the Olympics website.\n\nThe addition of a two-man competition was made at the Winter Games in 1932 in Lake Placid, and progressively a two-woman event at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US. Since then, it’s found a place in popular culture, notably the film “Cool Runnings,” which followed the Jamaican bobsled team as they trained to compete at the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nThis year, there will be 12 medals up for grabs across four events including the two-man, two-woman and the four-man. For the first time, there will also be a women’s monobob event. The track has 16 curves and a maximum gradient of 18%. At 1,615 meters (one mile) in length, it will be the first track of its kind in the world to have a 360-degree turn.\n\nWho are the favorites? Defending Olympic champion Germany will hope to replicate their performance at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, where they won every single bobsled event.\n\nHowever, a contender in the women’s monobob and the two-woman’s bobsled event could be Kaillie Humphries of Team USA, who claimed gold when she was competing for Canada in the Winter Games at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014. US duo Sylvia Hoffman and Elana Meyers Taylor – who has three Olympic medals to her name – could also be in contention for gold.\n\nIn the men’s competition – where last Games’ two-man event resulted in Germany and Canada being crowned joint winners – Francesco Friedrich of Team Germany is a firm favorite, having claimed two gold medals at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nFreestyle skiing (February 5 to February 14)\n\nWhat is it? Featuring balletic techniques and acrobatic skills, the International Ski Federation (FIS) first recognized freestyle skiing as a discipline in 1979.\n\nAthletes ski in a motion that is similar to skating. They perform technically challenging moves during their runs and are scored on different aspects of their performance, depending on the competition they’re participating in.\n\nIn the aerials events, slopestyle, moguls and halfpipe, judges score competitors based on the finesse of their tricks and the form of their runs.\n\nHowever, athletes in the big air are judged by the distance and height of their jumps. As for the ski cross, the competition is a timed event – so the athlete who traverses the finish line first takes gold.\n\nFreestyle skiing made its debut as a demonstration sport at the Winter Games in 1988 in Calgary, Canada, and was given medal status at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.\n\nEvents include the men’s and women’s aerials, moguls, ski cross, halfpipe and slopestyle, as well as the new men’s and women’s freestyle skiing big air and the mixed team freestyle skiing aerials competition.\n\nWho are the favorites? Two-time world champion Sandra Näslund of Sweden is a podium favorite in the women’s ski cross.\n\nHowever, China’s Eileen Gu could be a worthy challenger. The 18-year-old made history at the X Games in 2021, when she became the first rookie to earn medals across three events and the first freeskier to ever win more than one world title in a single year.\n\nIn the men’s moguls event, defending Olympic champion Mikaël Kingsbury of Canada is the name to look out for. The most accomplished mogul skier in history, he has claimed the highest number of medals of any male participant ever at the Freestyle World Championships.\n\nSnowboarding (February 5 to February 15)\n\nEster Ledecká of Czech Republic won gold in the Women's Parallel Giant Slalom at PyeongChang 2018. Laurent Salino/Agence Zoom/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Snowboarding is one of the more recent additions to the Winter Games, having debuted at the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan. Despite its novel status, the sport has fast become a crowd pleaser at the Games.\n\nThe snowboard cross events and the parallel giant slalom are all races. Whereas in the big air, halfpipe and slopestyle, judges score and assess riders based on aspects of their performance including the complexity of their tricks, the form of their run and the landing of their jumps.\n\nThere will be 11 gold medals available across 11 snowboarding events at this year’s Games including the men’s and women’s parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross, halfpipe, slopestyle and big air – as well as a new mixed team snowboard cross competition.\n\nWho are the favorites? With its roots in 1960s America, snowboarding has given rise to accomplished US athletes such as Shaun White, Jamie Anderson and Chloe Kim. They will be looking to add to the 31 medals under Team USA’s belt – making it the most successful nation ever in the Olympic event, ahead of Switzerland.\n\nOther hopefuls in the women’s draw include two-time Olympic medalist Eva Samková of the Czech Republic, Italy’s Michela Moioli and Charlotte Bankes of Team Great Britain.\n\nJapan’s Ayumu Hirano could pose a threat to White’s ambition for Olympic glory at Beijing 2022 in the men’s events.\n\nShort track speed skating (February 5 to February 16)\n\nChina's Li Jinyu (2nd L), PyeongChang 2018 short track speed skating 1,500m silver medalist, competes during a short track speed skating test event for Beijing 2022 in April 2021. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Making its debut on the Olympic program at the Winter Games in 1992 in Albertville, France, short track speed skating dates back to 1905, when athletes in Canada and the United States would compete on oval tracks.\n\nHowever, the scarcity of 400m long tracks in each country meant that a number of North American skaters chose to practice on ice rinks instead.\n\nOne of three skating events at the Winter Olympics, short track speed skating requires tight turns, strategic positioning and high speeds. Athletes compete on an ice track and field without lanes, so they are prone to both crashes and injury.\n\nThe competition at Beijing 2022 will feature nine events: men’s and women’s 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m – as well as the men’s 5,000m team relay and the women’s 3,000m team relay, alongside the new mixed team relay competition. There will be nine gold medals up for grabs in total.\n\nWho are the favorites? South Korea, China and Canada have historically been the most successful teams at Olympic short track speed skating events – with 81 medals between them.\n\nDefending Olympic champion Wu Dajing of China is a favorite for gold in the men’s short track speed skating. Hungarian brothers Liu Shaoang and Shaolin Sándor Liu, who were gold medalists in the men’s 5,000m relay event at PyeongChang 2018, could also be worthy contenders – however, Shaoang tested positive for Covid on January 24 putting his competition hopes in doubt.\n\nIn the women’s events, South Korea will pin their hopes for gold glory on Olympic record holder Choi Min-jeong, who claimed gold medals in the women’s 1,500m, and the women’s 3,000m relay at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nChoi’s main opponent could be eight-time Olympic medalist Arianna Fontana of Italy. If Fonata wins one more medal at Beijing 2022, she would be the most successful athlete ever at the Olympics in the short track event.\n\nCross-country skiing (February 5 to February 20)\n\nMarit Bjoergen of Norway (8) leads the field during the Ladies' 30km Mass Start Classic at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Cross-country skiing is the oldest type of skiing and evolved as a form of travel between remote communities.\n\nCross-country skiers either use the freestyle technique, where they ski side-to-side, or the classic technique, which involves striding forward. The techniques used in each event vary during each edition of the Games, depending on the guidelines set by the FIS.\n\nCross-country skiing was one of the first ever Winter Olympic sports, debuting at the 1924 Games in Chamonix, France, with men’s events. Nearly 30 years later, women’s events were inaugurated at the 1952 Oslo Olympics in Norway.\n\nThere will be 36 medals for the taking across 12 events at this year’s Winter Olympics.\n\nIn the men’s events, there will be the 15km classic, 15km and 15km skiathlon, sprint free, team sprint classic, 4x10km relay and the 50km mass start free. Female competitors will participate in the 10km classic, 7.5km and 7.5km skiathlon, sprint free, team sprint classic, 4x5km relay and the 30km mass start free.\n\nWho are the favorites? Team Norway has been the consistent frontrunner in cross-country skiing at the Olympics, with a whopping 121 medals to its name – that’s 41 medals ahead of runners-up Sweden.\n\nNorwegian athletes Johannes Høsflot Klæbo and Simen Hegstad Krüger will be hoping to repeat their stellar performances at PyeongChang 2018, where they picked up six medals between them.\n\nNonetheless, Team Sweden have a powerful roster in the women’s cross-country events, including three-time Olympic champion Charlotte Kalla, two-time world champion Jonna Sundling and up-and-comer Frida Karlsson.\n\nSki jumping (February 5 to February 14)\n\nWhat is it? Sondre Norheim is said to be the father of modern ski jumping, having won what is considered the world’s first ski jumping competition with awards in 1866 in Høydalsmo, Norway.\n\nThe sport was added to the Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Three decades later, Switzerland’s Andreas Daescher developed the parallel style in the 1950s, where skiers lean forward and brace their arms backwards, close to their body.\n\nCompatriot Jan Bokloev honed the parallel style in 1985, by unfurling the tips of his skis into a V shape – a technique that most ski jumpers use today. Jumps are appraised by the style of the jump and the distance covered.\n\nThere will be five gold medals to win across five events at Beijing 2022. The competitions include the men’s normal hill individual, the women’s normal hill individual, the men’s large hill individual, the men’s team – and for the first time, the mixed team event.\n\nWho are the favorites? Norway, Finland and Austria are in the lead when it comes to Olympic ski jumping, having fetched 82 medals between them.\n\nIn the men’s normal hill competition, Germany’s Andreas Wellinger defense of his 2018 individual gold medal is in doubt as he tested positive for Covid in January. His compatriot Karl Geiger and Piotr Żyła of Poland will look to take advantage of Wellinger’s absence.\n\nIn the women’s draw, Slovenia’s Ema Klinec will be eyeing the podium. Despite finishing 14th at PyeongChang 2018, she recently won the normal hill 2021 World Championships.\n\nAlpine skiing (February 6 to February 19)\n\nWendy Holdener (L) of Switzerland and Hungary's Mariann Mimi Maroty compete during the Alpine Team Event at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Games. Tom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Athletes frequently reach speeds of almost 95 miles per hour in one of the most physically exhausting sports in the Winter Olympics. Athletes can log their fastest times in the downhill and super-G competitions, whereas the slalom and giant slalom events occur over two slower courses.\n\nModern downhill skiing can be traced back to the 1850s, when Sondre Norheim introduced skis with curved flanks, and bindings with rigid, willow heel bands.\n\nWomen’s and men’s alpine skiing events made their debut at the 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen Olympics in Bavaria, with more categories being added up to PyeongChang 2018, when the mixed team event became the newest competition in the alpine skiing roster.\n\nThere will be 33 medals to win across 11 events at Beijing this year, including the men’s and women’s downhill, super-G, slalom and giant slalom, the alpine combine and the mixed team competition.\n\nWho are the favorites? Austria has historically dominated the medal count in alpine skiing, earning 121 medals.\n\nAmerican Mikaela Shiffrin is the one to watch in the women’s draw, having won two gold medals at PyeongChang 2018 and Sochi 2014. Other fierce competitors could include Michelle Gisin of Switzerland and compatriot Lara Gut-Behrami.\n\nFrance’s Mathieu Faivre could use his three Games’ worth of experience to his advantage this year, while current super-G and downhill world champion Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria is also among the favorites for gold.\n\nBiathlon (February 5 to February 19)\n\nWhat is it? The biathlon event is a combination of skiing and shooting. It can be traced back to Scandinavia, where people would hunt using skis and have rifles draped over their shoulders.\n\nAt the Winter Olympics, skiing and shooting take the form of a race, where competitors ski along a trail and the distance is punctuated into shooting rounds. Penalties for missed shots vary with each event and take the form of either additional time, or distance, being added to a participant’s total.\n\nBefore the biathlon was introduced to the Games at the 1960 Winter Olympics in California, an older version of the sport appeared in previous editions of the Olympics. The military patrol involved athletes competing in ski mountaineering, cross-country skiing and rifle shooting.\n\nThere will be 33 medals up for grabs across 11 biathlon events: the women’s 7.5km sprint, 15km individual, 10km pursuit, 12.5km mass start and 4x6km relay. In the men’s draw, events include the 10km sprint, 20km individual, 12.5km pursuit, 15km mass start and 4x7.5km relay. A 4x6km mixed relay event is also scheduled to take place.\n\nWho are the favorites? Germany and Norway have previously collected the most medals in the biathlon event, earning nearly 100 medals combined.\n\nFive-time Olympic medalist Tiril Eckhoff of Norway is a favorite for gold this year, alongside Swedish sisters Hanna Öberg and Elvira Öberg.\n\nIn the men’s draw, Norway’s Johannes Thingnes Bø and compatriot Sturla Holm Lægreid could add to their country’s medal count.\n\nCurling (February 2 to February 20)\n\nWhat is it? Curling is one of the oldest sports at the Winter Olympics. It has origins in 16th century Scotland, where games took place on frozen ponds and lochs.\n\nAthletes use their own brush and a pair of curling shoes – one with a sole that grips the ice, known as the gripper, and another that is slippery, known as the slider, which helps them to pivot while conveying 20-kg (45-pound) granite stones during the match.\n\nThe team that manages to deliver more stones near the center of the scoring area than their opponent wins. It is a sport that requires precise technique and strategy.\n\nAfter it debuted at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France, curling was dropped and temporarily featured as a demonstration sport, before it was reintroduced to the Olympic program at the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.\n\nThere will be nine medals up for grabs across three events at Beijing 2022, including the men’s curling, women’s curling and mixed doubles curling.\n\nWho are the favorites? Canada has been the most successful curling team ever at the Olympics, winning 11 medals – that’s three more than challengers Sweden. Other notable contenders across all three competitions include South Korea, Japan and Switzerland.\n\nTeam USA could repeat their success at PyeongChang 2018, where they claimed gold in the men’s curling event. In the women’s draw, defending Olympic champions Sweden could reclaim their victory, but World Curling Championship winners Switzerland could pose a threat.\n\nIce hockey (February 3 to February 20)\n\nWhat is it? Despite having just two events, ice hockey remains a crowd favorite at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe rules are simple – the winning team must net the puck and score more goals than their opponent.\n\nDuring play, a team can’t have more than six players on the ice. The positions are as follows: goalkeeper, two wings, two defenders and a center. In the event of penalties, there can be fewer players on the ice.\n\nWomen currently compete in a 10-team tournament, while men participate in a 12-team event.\n\nIce hockey was first added to the Olympic program at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and was permanently moved to the Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France.\n\nThere will be two medals available to win at Beijing 2022: the men’s tournament and the women’s tournament, Reuters reported.\n\nWho are the favorites? The National Hockey League (NHL) and its union have decided not to dispatch players to Beijing this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, so the Russian Olympic Committee has become a firm favorite for gold in the men’s draw.\n\nIn the women’s competition, Canada will be chasing gold after losing to the United States in the final at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nSpeed skating (February 5 to February 19)\n\nGermany's Claudia Pechstein competes during the Ladies' Speed Skating Mass Start Final at PyeongChang 2018. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? First debuting at the 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics, speed skating involves athletes racing alongside each other, with each skater hoping to set the fastest time out of all the participants in the field.\n\nAthletes race across a 400m oval-shaped track for individual races, where the fastest places first.\n\nIn the team pursuit, three-person squads representing two different countries compete in an eight-lap race on opposite sides of the track. Each team must race as a group, and their times are determined by the third person who crosses the finish line.\n\nThere are 16 laps in the mass start event, which is a points-based competition. Almost 24 skaters can take part at the start of the event.\n\nThere will be 14 medals for the taking across 14 events at Beijing 2022, including the women’s 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, 5,000m, 10,000m, mass start and team pursuit, and the men’s 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, 3,000m, 5,000m, mass start and team pursuit.\n\nThe number of speed skating events held makes it the largest sport at this year’s Winter Olympics.\n\nWho are the favorites? The Netherlands, the United States and Norway tend to dominate speed skating at the Winter Games, boasting a combined 273 Olympic medals in total.\n\nNine-time Olympic medalist and Team Netherlands star Sven Kramer will be looking to add to his tally at Beijing 2022. The defending world champion in the men’s 5,000m and 10,000m events, Sweden’s Nils van der Poel, is also a favorite for gold.\n\nEleven-time Olympic medalist and Dutch athlete Ireen Wüst and Erin Jackson of Team USA will be the ones to beat at Beijing 2022, although Japan’s Nao Kodaira and Miho Takagi could also be worthy contenders.\n\nThe Nordic combined (February 9 to February 17)\n\nWhat is it? The Nordic combined event is comprised of cross-country skiing and ski jumping. It is one of the few competitions at the Games that’s yet to introduce a women’s draw.\n\nCompetitors win points for the style and distance of their ski jump. The better-scoring jumpers subsequently get a head start in the staggered cross-country skiing element – the conversion of points to time is known as the Gundersen method.\n\nThe Nordic combined was the centerpiece of the Holmenkollen ski festival, which began in Oslo, Norway in 1892. Since then, the sport has garnered an international fanbase and has been an enduring event at the Games since the first Winter Olympics in 1924 in Chamonix.\n\nThere will be three gold medals up for grabs at this year’s Games across three events, Reuters reported: men’s individual Gundersen normal hill / 10km, men’s individual Gundersen large hill / 10km, and men’s team Gundersen large hill / 4x5km.\n\nWho are the favorites? Norway has clinched the most medals for the Nordic combined event in the history of the Games, claiming 31. Finland and Austria are close challengers.\n\nHowever, Eric Frenzel of Germany could bolster his team’s Olympic glory this year, having won a medal in every Nordic combined event at PyeongChang. Japan’s Akito Watabe, who earned a silver medal in Gundersen normal hill / 10km at the Winter Olympics in 2014 and 2018, could also make the podium alongside Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber.\n\nLuge (February 5 to February 10)\n\nPeter Penz and Georg Fischler of Austria celebrate as they finish a run during the Luge Team Relay on day six of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. Quinn Rooney/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? The luge is one of three sliding sports at the Winter Games this year, alongside the bobsled and the skeleton.\n\nCompetitors can reach average speeds of 120 to 145 kilometers per hour (74.56 to 90 mph) when racing the luge. Athletes race on the same track in the singles competition and get four tries across two days. Their aggregate times are counted to the thousandth of a second, with the quickest athlete placing first.\n\nThe doubles event has a similar structure but is set across two days, with each pair getting two runs. Three sledges from different nations – the women’s singles, men’s singles and doubles – compete in the team relay, which debuted at the Games at Sochi 2014.\n\nAll three sliding sports originated in St. Moritz, Switzerland.\n\nThere will be four gold medals to win across four events at the Games this year, including the men’s singles, men’s doubles, women’s singles and the team relay.\n\nWho are the favorites? Germany are usually the frontrunners in the luge, followed by Austria and Italy.\n\nThey could maintain their lead in the event with defending Olympic champion Natalie Geisenberger. Her challengers could be fellow team members Julia Taubitz and Dajana Eitberger.\n\nIn the men’s draw, triple Olympic gold medalist Felix Loch will be looking to reclaim his title at Beijing 2022, having finished fifth in the men’s singles at PyeongChang. Team Austria’s David Gleirscher ended up winning the event that year, and so could prove a worthy challenger.\n\nSkeleton (February 10 to February 12)\n\nWhat is it? With its roots in sleighing, the skeleton is a fan favorite at the Winter Olympics.\n\nAthletes participate on the same track across two days, getting four runs each. The competitor with the fastest combined time wins the event.\n\nAfter British and American holiday goers constructed the first toboggan run in 1882 in Davos, Switzerland, a new steel sledge was built ten years later – which became known as the skeleton. It fell in and out of the Olympic program for a number of years, before it was reintroduced at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nThere will be just six medals available across two events at Beijing 2022, including the men’s singles and the women’s singles.\n\nWho are the favorites? Great Britain and the United States are the two main frontrunners in the skeleton event, having earned 11 medals between them.\n\nTeam GB’s Laura Deas will have her eye on first place this year, having clinched a bronze medal in PyeongChang. Jacqueline Loelling and Tina Hermann of Germany are worthy challengers for Team GB, as well as China’s Zhao Dan and Lin Huiyang.\n\nIn the men’s draw, six-time world champion Martins Dukurs of Latvia will be chasing gold this year, having participated in the event since 1998, but defending Olympic champion Yun Sungbin of South Korea could be a worthy competitor. Geng Wenqiang and Yin Zheng will also be going for gold, hoping to boost the medal count for hosts China.\n\nFigure skating (February 4 to February 20)\n\nScott Moir and Tessa Virtue of Canada perform during the Figure Skating Gala Exhibition at Gangneung Ice Arena on February 25, 2018 in South Korea. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Figure skating is the oldest event at the Winter Olympics. The event first debuted at the London Summer Games in 1908, and again in the 1920 Summer Games in Antwerp, before it was permanently moved to the Winter Olympic program.\n\nEach competition incorporates a long and short routine, within which athletes receive two sets of scores – the program component score and the technical element score. The program component element is mainly determined by presentation, while the technical category assesses the complexity displayed in a routine, for example, spins and jumps.\n\nEven though the Dutch developed figure skating, the sport has been enjoyed by fans the world over, including Marie Antoinette and the 19th century French emperor Napoleon III.\n\nThere will be five medals for the taking across five figure skating events at Beijing 2022. The events are as follows: the men’s singles, women’s singles, pairs, the ice dance and the team event.\n\nWho are the favorites?

Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nElodie Clouvel of France captured silver and Oktawia Nowacka of Poland earned bronze.\n\nEsposito was solid throughout the five events of the pentathlon: seventh after swimming, sixth through fencing, up to fourth following equestrian.\n\nHer best event is the running-shooting combination in the finale, so she knew gold was still within reach.\n\nEsposito charged from the start, making up ground quickly while slowing herself down enough to hit her targets on the shooting range. The 24-year-old from Sydney had the second-fastest time through the four 800-meter segments and missed just one target to make her way to the top of the podium from fourth place.\n\nNot bad for someone who had limited training early in the year because of an Achilles tendon injury.\n\n\"All the hard training the past four years, it's been a tough road, especially this year I had a few injuries,\" Esposito said. \"Nothing was easy.\"\n\nEsposito had been training for this moment all her life.\n\nHer father, Daniel, competed for Australia in modern pentathlon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. He brother, Max, will compete in modern pentathlon on Saturday and her sister, Emily, is a former pentathlete who competed in shooting at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nCompetition was just a part of the Esposito household — especially when it came to fencing with Emily — and helped put her in position to make history for family and country.\n\n\"Since I've been young, I've known I wanted to go to Olympic Games and I was lucky enough to come to my second Olympics and have the support of my family,\" said Esposito, who finished seventh at the 2012 London Games. \"Being able to train with them has been amazing and I couldn't ask for anything more.\"\n\nEsposito wasn't the only one with athletic genes.\n\nClouvel's mother, Annick, was a national distance running champion and her father, Pascal, set a national record in the 5,000 meters.\n\nThe world-record holder in modern pentathlon swimming, Clouvel was solid all day and entered the final events in second, 12 points behind Nowacka. She couldn't catch Esposito, though, finishing nearly a minute off the winning time in running and needed 34 shots to hit 20 targets.\n\nClouvel fell 16 points short of gold, but still earned her country's first Olympic medal in modern pentathlon since 1984, when its men's team took bronze.\n\n\"It was a very good day,\" Clouvel said through a translator. \"My shooting is not so good, so I was just thinking, 'Run fast, run fast.' But I got the medal and it's fantastic.\"\n\nNowacka surged to the lead after winning the one-touch fencing event and remained there after a solid run in equestrian. She was in the lead early during the running-shooting competition, but began to fade over the final 800 meters.\n\nBut, like Clouvel, she was able to break a long modern pentathlon drought for her country; the medal was Poland's first in the sport since the 1992 Barcelona Games.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/25/how-gymnastics-scoring-works-paris-olympics/74051981007/", "title": "Gymnastics at 2024 Paris Olympics: How scoring works, what to know", "text": "Here's what you need to know about artistic gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWhen did artistic gymnastics become an Olympic sport?\n\nArtistic gymnastics, or gymnastics as it’s traditionally known, was part of the first “modern” Olympics in 1896, and has been part of every Summer Games since. It has undergone some changes – rope climbing was once an event, and women weren’t allowed to compete in the Olympics until 1928 – but it has had largely the same format for the last 60 years. Men compete on six apparatuses – floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars and high bar – while women compete on four – vault, uneven bars, balance beam, floor exercise.\n\nHow does Olympic artistic gymnastics work?\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nAdd the D and E scores together, and that’s your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it’s a single skill.)\n\nEvery gymnast goes through qualifying. The top 24 all-around gymnasts, with a limit of two per country, advance to the all-around final, where scoring starts over. The top eight gymnasts on each apparatus, again with a two-per-country limit, advance to the event finals. Scoring starts over there, too.\n\nFor the 12 countries in the team competition, they will put four of their five gymnasts up on each event in qualifying and can drop their lowest score. You’ll sometimes hear this referred to as “5-4-3.” The top eight teams advance to the final where, you guessed it, scoring starts over.\n\nIn the team final, however, countries compete three gymnasts on each event and must count all three scores. Also known as three-up, three-count. Have to count a fall, and your chances at the gold are probably gone. Count two or three, and you can forget about a medal of any color.\n\nWho are the top Team USA athletes in artistic gymnastics?\n\nSimone, Simone and Simone again. Simone Biles returned to competition last year for the first time since the Tokyo Olympics, where she was forced to withdraw from the team final and all but one event final because of “the twisties.” In her return, she looked spectacular, winning her sixth all-around title and becoming the most-decorated gymnast, male or female, with 37 medals at the world championships and Olympics.\n\nSo long as Biles is on her game, she will be favored for golds in the team competition, all-around, vault, balance beam and floor exercise. If she’s healthy, don’t count out reigning Olympic champion Suni Lee.\n\nFred Richard and Asher Hong lead a young but very talented U.S. men’s team. Their bronze at last year’s world championships was their first medal at a worlds or the Olympics since 2014, and the team only gets stronger with the return of two-time national champion Brody Malone, who missed last year with a knee injury.\n\nWhat's the international landscape in Olympic artistic gymnastics?\n\nRussia is the only team that could give the American women and the Japanese and Chinese men a real fight, winning both team golds in Tokyo. But the Russians won’t be in Paris, banned from the Olympics as punishment for their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThat means the gold is the U.S. women’s to lose. Even without Simone Biles, who was taking time off after Tokyo, the Americans won their sixth consecutive team title at the world championships in 2022. With Biles back last year, the U.S. women made it seven in a row, beating Brazil by more than two points. In a sport where medals can come down to hundredths of a point, that’s a big gap.\n\nOn the men’s side, Japan and China are in a class ahead of everyone else.\n\nIn the individual events, the only woman who comes close to Biles is Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who finished second to the American at last year’s world championships. But Andrade would likely have to be perfect and Biles would need to make a couple of mistakes for the Brazilian to deny Biles a second all-around title.\n\nJapan’s Daiki Hashimoto, who has added the last two world titles to his all-around gold from Tokyo, is the one to beat in the men’s all-around. His toughest competition will likely be from teammate Kenta Chiba and Ukraine’s Ilia Kovtun, but Fred Richard has a shot at the podium if they are clean.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/10/20/cricket-new-olympic-sports-2028/71206060007/", "title": "Cricket in the Olympics? 2028 Games will feature sport for the first ...", "text": "When the International Olympic Committee signed off on five new sports for the 2028 Summer Games at a meeting in Mumbai on Monday, much of the attention in the U.S. revolved around the inclusion of flag football, or lacrosse, or the return of baseball and softball.\n\nFor the rest of the world, however, the headliner was a different sport: Cricket.\n\nMore than a century after its only prior Olympic appearance, at the 1900 Summer Games in Paris, the sport is officially back on the program for the Los Angeles Games, with six men's teams and six women's teams set to compete in 2028. For diehard fans in cricket-crazed countries such as India and Pakistan, it's an exciting move that feels long overdue. And for newbies, it may be a reason to finally dip a toe into the intimidating world of wickets and bowling.\n\nA bat-and-ball sport that dates back to the 18th century, cricket doesn't have the American popularity of some of the other new Olympic sports coming in 2028, like lacrosse or baseball. But it still has plenty of domestic fans and recreational athletes − and data suggests that the cricket scene in the U.S. will only continue to grow.\n\nIn the wake of Monday's news, here's everything you need to know about why the sport was added to the Olympic program and what it means for cricket in the U.S.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nWhy did cricket become an Olympic sport?\n\nThomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, called it a \"win-win situation.\"\n\nWith an estimated fanbase of around 2.5 billion people, cricket is considered to be the second-most popular sport in the world behind only soccer. The vast majority of those fans, however, are concentrated in a handful of cricket-loving countries − most notably on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Olympics will give cricket a chance to expand its reach, while also giving the IOC a chance to tap into a dedicated fanbase that might not have otherwise tuned in to the Games.\n\n\"We have seen the growing international importance of cricket,\" Bach said in a news conference. \"The Olympic Games want to represent and want to incorporate the most popular sports worldwide.\"\n\nWhy now?\n\nIt's unlikely that cricket would've returned to the Games without the introduction of a new format called Twenty20 − a condensed, jam-packed version of sport, in which matches generally span three or four hours rather than a full day or more.\n\nThe format debuted in 2003 and gained popularity in 2007 with the creation of the Indian Premier League, which has since blossomed into one of the most lucrative sports leagues in the world; A group of broadcasters paid $6.2 billion for a five-year TV rights deal in 2022, and each of the league's 10 teams are valued at $1 billion or more.\n\nMore international leagues have followed the IPL's lead. A professional T20 league in the U.S. called Major League Cricket just wrapped up its inaugual season earlier this year.\n\n\"For any sport coming into the U.S., a sport that’s played over a day or over five days is probably not viable in this day and age. But the T20 format has really sort of captured eyeballs around the world,\" Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview.\n\n\"Think of baseball, but all the action that happens in terms of home runs and outs and so on − a game of T20 cricket has all of that but in multiples of what you would see in a baseball game. So it’s a very action-packed format.\"\n\nBeyond the emergence of T20, however, there's also a clear financial angle for Olympic organizers that likely contributed to the timing of cricket joining the Games.\n\nIndia has long been the capital of the cricket world, and the country's TV rights for the 2028 Olympics have yet to be sold. The addition of cricket is expected to increase the value of those rights by at least $100 million.\n\n\"Traditionally, the Olympics have not derived massive value from that part of the world in terms of media values,\" said Srinivasan, who also founded Willow TV, which broadcasts cricket in the U.S. \"So adding a sport that’s far and away the most popular one in that region ... (it) makes perfect sense.\"\n\nHow popular is cricket in the U.S.?\n\nAccording to USA Cricket, the national governing body for the sport, participation numbers in the U.S. are relatively modest − roughly 200,000 cricket players competing in more than 400 local leagues. But an estimated 10 to 20 million other Americans watch and follow the sport.\n\nEraj Abidi, the president of 22 Yards Cricket Club based in the Washington D.C. area, said the sport is growing in popularity in the U.S. in part due to immigration trends.\n\n\"There’s a lot of cricket out there, because a lot of immigrants came from (the Indian) subcontinent, as well as from England and Australia,\" Abidi said. \"(They) participated in the sport and have so much passion about it.\"\n\nAbidi counted the D.C. area as one of the country's cricket hotbeds, in addition to parts of Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Illinois and California.\n\nSrinivasan said one of factors that's impacted the growth of cricket in the U.S. is the number of top-tier cricket-specific venues, of which there are few.\n\nMajor League Cricket, which consists of six teams, hosted its games at two such venues − one in Grand Prairie, Texas and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina. The former is also slated to serve as a site for the T20 World Cup when it comes to the U.S. next summer, alongside venues in Lauderhill, Florida and New York.\n\nIs the U.S. national team competitive in cricket?\n\nAccording to the most recent world rankings released by the International Cricket Council, the federation overseeing the sport, the American men are currently ranked No. 22 in the world in T20, while the U.S. women are No. 23.\n\nNeither team qualified for their most recent world cups, which were contested in a one-day international format that differs from T20. (The men's world cup is ongoing.)\n\nThe hope, of course, is that the prospect of competing at the Olympics could provide a boost. Venu Pisike, the chair of the USA Cricket board, called the sport's Olympic inclusion \"a game-changer.\"\n\n\"This marks an exciting chapter in our journey to inspire and unite the cricketing community in the USA,\" he said in a statement. \"We have a lot of work to do as the National Governing Body and a community to ensure we position ourselves to march thru this incredible journey (from the T20 World Cup next summer) to LA28.\"\n\nTraditionally, the host country at each Olympics is given the chance to enter a team in each team sport, though it is unclear whether the U.S. will be automatically awarded a spot, due to the small size of the field. The Olympic qualification process for cricket will not be unveiled until 2025.\n\nHow will Olympic inclusion impact cricket?\n\nCricket's leaders spent several years pushing for the sport to be added to the Olympic program. Greg Barclay, the chairman of the ICC, called it \"a priority\" for the organization.\n\n\"The fact that the IOC confirmation of our selection occurred here in Mumbai, during the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, is truly icing on the cake,\" Barclay said. \"The innings has just begun, and we can't wait to see where this incredible journey leads.\"\n\nSome in the cricket community are especially excited about the inclusion of a women's team event, and what it could do to help grow women's cricket (India's Women's Premier League launched in March). Others are curious to see what sort of impact the Games might have on the broader trajectory of a sport that has been around for hundreds of years and is already among the most popular in the world.\n\n\"I think the Olympics are sort of a bit of a shot in the arm,\" Srinivasan said. \"It has the opportunity to, both in the U.S. and globally, allow cricket to expand its footprint beyond the few countries that really do love the game. Just doing that, I think there’s immense opportunities − both on the men’s and the women’s side of the game.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/19/sport/figure-skating-controversies-timeline-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Timeline of figure skating controversies from 1902 to 2022 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) will hold a vote at its Congress in June on a proposal to raise the minimum age for competitors to 17, the governing body told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe sport has been at the center of attention after 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva was allowed to continue competing at this year’s Winter Games despite failing a drugs test in December 2021.\n\nBut Beijing 2022 isn’t the first time that figure skating has been at the center of controversy.\n\nRussia's Kamila Valieva falls as she competes in the women's single skating free skating of the figure skating event during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing on February 17, 2022.

They were forced to let her skate and Syers earned second place behind Ulrich Salchow.\n\nSoon after, officials banned female athletes, claiming their skirts were too long and the judges couldn’t see their footwork. Syers quickly found a solution: a skirt that ended mid-calf.\n\nShe went on to win the British Nationals in 1903 and 1904 and the women’s World Championships in 1906 and 1907. Figure skating made its debut in the 1908 London Olympics and Syers won gold in the women’s singles and bronze in the mixed pairs, where she skated alongside her husband, making her the first woman to take home two medals in just one Olympic Games.\n\n1988: Modesty and “The Katarina Rule”\n\nAt the 1988 Winter Olympics hosted in Calgary, German figure skater Katerina Witt wore a costume that a male Canadian coach, Peter Dunfield, claimed was “bizarre and indecent … The real provocative side is the back. But in the front, you’ve even got cleavage.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Dunfield also suggested that Witt might be trying to win over the judges with a revealing costume.\n\nWitt defended her choice, saying the costume was appropriate for her music, which was from the Broadway show “Jerry’s Girls.”\n\nThe controversy caused the ISU to adopt a new dress code: all women were required to wear skirts that covered their hips and bottom, as well as cover their midriff.\n\nThis strict rule was relaxed in 2003, but the ISU still requires all clothing to be “modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition.”\n\nKatarina Witt at the Calgary 1988 Winter Olympics.

Kerrigan’s rival Tonya Harding’s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly was involved in the plot.\n\nGillooly was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the attack and Harding received three years of probation and was fined $100,000 for conspiring to hinder prosecution.\n\nKerrigan was still selected for the Olympic team despite her injury and went on to earn a silver medal at the 1994 Olympic in Lillehammer.\n\nHarding maintained her innocence throughout the games, but on March 16, just a few weeks after closing ceremonies, she pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution.\n\nA few months later the US Figure Skating Association revoked her gold medal at the 1994 national championships and banned her from the ice for life.\n\nSubsequently the scandal was immortalized in the 2017 drama, “I, Tonya” starring Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney.\n\nAsked by The Boston Globe if she was bothered by Hollywood’s portrayal of Harding, Kerrigan said “It’s not really part of my life.”\n\n“As you say, I was the victim,” she said. “Like, that’s my role in this whole thing. That’s it.”\n\nUS figure skater Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan take a break during training in 1994. Andreas Altwein/dpa/AP\n\n1998: Surya Bonaly backflips and judges flip out\n\nThe day before Surya Bonaly was set to perform her free skate at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, she pulled a muscle in her right leg, though knowing that these Winter Games were her last, the French star was committed to competing.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Radiolab, Bonaly recounted her performance, saying by the end of the program the pain in her leg was unbearable and she couldn’t perform the two triples she had left in her routine.\n\nBut Bonaly “had a special thing in her back pocket” to wow the crowd, performing an illegal backflip landing on just her left blade.\n\nIt didn’t go down well with judges, who handed Bonaly a score that dropped her from sixth to 11th place.\n\nIn recent years, fans have questioned if race might have played a part in her career, though both Bonaly and former judges deny any bias.\n\n“We are all humans, we all have different styles. And we can create a different personality of character on ice,” Bonaly told CNN’s Amy Woodyatt on Friday.\n\n“You have to find your own style, and you have to save it to give it … When you watch 20 skaters doing the same thing over and over, I mean, what’s about it?\n\n“Skating is called free skating, so supposed to be free, but it’s not really free, entirely free because there’s rules to follow and if you don’t, you’re in big trouble.\n\nBonaly told CNN that her routines were sometimes penalized by judges.\n\n“I remember back in the days I used to like jumps and combos, and if I will do one extra one jump after a combo because I felt like “oh, triple, triple and a double. You actually got in trouble because you did too much of that,” she said.\n\n“I think that judges should be more open minded, to be able to receive and see things coming from different places – a different way of what has been brought on the ice.”\n\nSurya Bonaly performs a backflip in her free skate routine. Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\n1998: Judging scandal exposed\n\nAt the 1998 Olympics, Jean Senft – a Canadian skating judge – surreptitiously recorded a conversation with a fellow Ukrainian judge, Yuri Balkov, where they openly discussed how they would place ice dancers before they had even competed.\n\nSenft had previously approached officials with her concerns about corruption among her colleagues but was told she needed proof.\n\nAfter playing the tape at an ISU hearing, Balkov was banned for one year. Soon after, Senft also suffered a six-month suspension for allegedly favoring a Canadian pair, though she claims the suspension was retaliation against her.\n\n“The athletes are not competing on a fair playing field. This isn’t sport. Somebody had to get proof,” Senft told CBC News in 2000.\n\nAfter the scandal, small reforms were made to judging requirements and deductions.\n\n2002: “Skategate”\n\nAfter Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier produced a flawless free skate at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, the gold medal was awarded to the Russian duo: Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who had enough technical errors in their performance to call the result into question.\n\nWhen the judges met to defend the results, French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne claimed that the French Skating Federation president, Didier Gailhauguet, had directed her to rank the Russian pair first.\n\nSoon evidence emerged of a quid pro quo between Russian and French votes in the pairs figure skating and ice dancing events.\n\nLe Gougne and Gailhauguet were suspended for three years and there was an overhaul of the judging system in figure skating, with strict protocols eliminating the room for subjective judgment.\n\n“Meddling,” a four-part series was released last month on Peacock chronicling the scandal.\n\nElena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia celebrate gold at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Robert Laberge/Getty Images\n\n2010: Russian duo’s performance sparks cultural backlash\n\nReigning world champions in ice dancing, the Russian duo Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin performed a dance inspired by Aboriginal culture at both the Russian and European Championships.\n\nThe pair skated to music that was largely chants and didgeridoos while wearing red loin cloths, body suits with white markings and make up that appeared to be brown face.\n\nTheir performance sparked outrage amongst Aboriginal activists in Australia who claimed the routine was culturally exploitative and inauthentic.\n\n“Accurate or not, you have to be sensitive to the people you are representing,” Jef Billings, a renowned designer of skating costumes, told The New York Times in 2010.\n\n“At the turn of the last century, minstrel shows were acceptable. Times have changed.”\n\nThe Russian duo’s coach, Natalia Linichuk ,was shocked at the outrage, denying any wrongdoing or ill-intent and claiming that the dance was not based on any one Aboriginal culture.\n\nBev Manton, chairwoman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, expressed her anger in the Sydney Morning Herald: “From an Aboriginal perspective, this performance is offensive. It was clearly not meant to mock Aboriginal culture, but that does not make it acceptable to Aboriginal people.”\n\n2014: US Skating Federation team selection questioned\n\nMirai Nagasu took home the bronze medal at the 2014 US national championships but was passed over for the Sochi Olympic team in favor of fourth place finisher, Ashley Wagner.\n\nThe US Skating Federation had only ignored the national championship results four times until then, in all cases because of injuries that prevented the selected athletes from competing.\n\nThe federation defended its choice, citing Wagner’s higher global rankings and Nagasu’s inconsistent record over the past year.\n\nHowever, Jeff Yang of the Wall Street Journal found it hard to ignore the aesthetics of the choice, calling Wagner a “golden girl” with her blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\nHis claims had a ring of truth for some fans, especially when looking at previous treatment of Asian American skaters; including one media headline claiming, “American beats out Kwan.” Kwan being Michelle Kwan of the US team, who was born in Torrance, California.\n\nFour years later Nagasu won a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nNagasu also landed a triple axel – one of the most challenging jumps in figure skating. In doing so she accomplished a feat that made her the first female American figure skater to nail the triple axel at the Olympics.\n\nAt the end of her routine, Nagasu triumphantly threw her hands in the air and a bright, exuberant smile spread across her face.\n\nMirai Nagasu (L) and Ashley Wagner (R) on the podium together. Jared Wickerham/Getty Images\n\n2022: Kamila Valieva’s positive drugs test\n\nIn a sample taken in December, prior to the Olympics, 15-year-old Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine, a drug commonly used to treat angina and which experts say can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart.\n\nHowever, the result was only analyzed and reported to Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) in February. Valieva was then suspended the day after she led the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to gold in the figure skating team event on February 7 when she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in a Winter Olympic Games.\n\nRUSADA lifted her suspension the next day following a hearing. Subsequently the World Anti-Doping Agency, the International Olympic Committee and the ISU filed an appeal against the lifting of the ban.\n\nHowever, the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Valieva for competition, saying she would suffer “irreparable harm” if not allowed to compete, citing the “exceptional circumstances” of her being a minor.\n\nValieva finished in fourth place in the women’s individual figure skating event on Thursday, leaving the ice in tears after falling and faltering during jumps in her routine, despite having previously been the favorite to take gold.\n\nBefore being cleared to take part in the women’s individual figure skating competition, Valieva was suspended by the RUSADA on February 8, although the body lifted her suspension the next day following a hearing.", "authors": ["Kikue Higuchi"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}]}

Christian Coleman, who was banned from the Tokyo Olympics because after missing numerous drug tests, was fourth at 9.93.\n\nLyles is also entered in the 200, and expected to be a key piece of the 4x100 team. The 200 final is scheduled for Saturday, June 29.\n\nKendall Ellis wins 400 to return to Olympics\n\nKendall Ellis won the 400 from lane eight.\n\nEllis sprinted down the home stretch and created a little distance between the competition to win the event with a personal-best time of 49.46.\n\nGeorgia’s Aaliyah Butler took second, running a personal-best 49.71. Alexis Holmes captured the final Olympic spot as she won the battle for third, running a personal-best 49.78.\n\nAt 16 years old, Quincy Wilson is running against adults nearly twice his age at the trials. But the massive age and experience gap isn’t phasing him. The 16-year-old broke his own under-18 world 400-meter record in the semifinal by crossing the line in a personal-best time of 44.59.\n\nWilson finished behind Bryce Deadmon (44.44) and Vernon Norwood (44.50), but his time was good enough to advance to the final.\n\n\"Today I just came out here, gave everything I had. I knew the last 100 was going to be hard,” Wilson told NBC. “I'm competing with them. I'm just thankful to be in this moment.\"\n\nInstead of kicking off the 2028 Los Angeles Games with swimming, track and field will go first and swimming will go at the end. It's the first time since the 1968 Mexico City Games that the schedule has switched.\n\nTrack will take place at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, home of USC football.\n\n“Athletics is our primetime event,” LA 2028 chairman Casey Wasserman said. “We’re starting off with a bang.” —Lindsay Schnell\n\nAthing Mu advances to finals of 800m\n\nAthing Mu won her 800 semifinal heat Sunday evening at Hayward Field, using a tremendous kick to overtake LSU’s Michaela Rose, advancing to the finals, scheduled for 10:32 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nThe defending gold medalist, Mu ran a 1.58.84 in the event’s first heat (her personal best is 1:54.97). Kate Grace finished second at 1.58:97 and Rose, who won the NCAA title earlier this month, finished third at 1:59:00. The top two finishers in each heat, plus the next three fastest times, advance to the finals.\n\n“This is exactly where I thought it would be, especially with who was in my race, specifically,” said Mu, who clocked the fastest semifinal time. “I’m really happy I won it that way because I know the final is going to be that pace or faster.”\n\nNoah Lyles, Fred Kerley, Christian Coleman advance to 100 final\n\nIn a fast first semifinal heat, Courtney Lindsey and Fred Kerley both ran times of sub-10 seconds to advance to the final. Lindsey won with a 9.88 and Kerley was right behind him running a 9.89. Both times were wind-aided.\n\nThe second semifinal heat was even faster. Noah Lyles ran a wind-aided 9.80 to win. Kenny Bednarik got the other automatic qualifying spot with a 9.82.\n\nChristian Coleman won the third semifinal heat, running a 9.86. Brandon Hicklin’s 9.95 was good enough for second.\n\nLyles younger brother, Josephus, didn’t advance past the semifinal.\n\nHow to watch the U.S. Olympic track and field trials on TV\n\nHere is the TV broadcast schedule, according to NBC:\n\nSunday: 8:30-11 p.m. ET - Finals on Peacock, NBC\n\nHow to live stream the Olympic trials\n\nAll events will be streamed on Peacock, NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com and the NBC and NBC Sports apps.\n\nSunday's schedule for U.S. Olympic track and field trials\n\nHere's the schedule for Sunday night and for the rest of the meet:\n\n(All times Eastern)\n\n8 p.m.: Women’s hammer throw final\n\nWomen’s hammer throw final 8:45 p.m.: Men’s pole vault final\n\nMen’s pole vault final 8:48 p.m.: Men's 100-meter semifinals\n\nMen's 100-meter semifinals 9:10 p.m.: Women's heptathlon shot put\n\nWomen's heptathlon shot put 9:11 p.m.: Women's 800-meter semifinals\n\nWomen's 800-meter semifinals 9:35 p.m.: Men's 400-meter semifinals\n\nMen's 400-meter semifinals 9:40 p.m.: Men’s javelin final\n\nMen’s javelin final 9:58 p.m.: Women’s 400 meters final\n\nWomen’s 400 meters final 10:07 p.m.: Men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase final\n\nMen’s 3,000-meter steeplechase final 10:26 p.m.: Women's heptathlon 200 meters\n\nWomen's heptathlon 200 meters 10:49 p.m.: Men’s 100 meters final\n\nUsain Bolt still fastest man ever\n\nNoah Lyles might currently own the fastest man in the world crown, but Usain Bolt remains the fastest man ever.\n\nThe Jamaican superstar still holds the world record in the 100 with a time of 9.58. He set the world record in 2009. It’s the only 100-meter time in history under 9.60. Bolt owns the three fastest 100-meter times ever (9.58, 9.63 and 9.69).\n\nBolt retired from track and field in 2017 with eight Olympic gold medals and 11 world championship golds. — Tyler Dragon\n\nAnna Hall takes early lead in heptathlon\n\nHeptathlon favorite Anna Hall is leading after two events.\n\nHall is on top of the standings with 2,077 points following the 100-meter hurdles and high jump. Chari Hawkins (2,074) and Taliyah Brooks (2,046) are second and third, respectively.\n\nThe women will compete in the shot put at 9:10 p.m. ET and 200 at 10:26 p.m. ET. — Tyler Dragon\n\nJosephus Lyles advances to semis\n\nNoah Lyles will have some company in the 100 semifinals. His younger brother, Josephus.\n\nJosephus finished fourth in his heat and equaled a season-best 10.10 in the opening round of the 100 meters to advance to Sunday evening’s semifinal round. Josephus will be in the first semifinal heat in lane three.\n\nNoah, who had the top qualifying mark in the 100 at 9.92, is in the second heat.\n\nThe 100 semifinals are scheduled for 8:48 p.m. ET. — Tyler Dragon\n\nWho has qualified for U.S. Olympic track and field team for Paris\n\nWith four more finals held Saturday, the roster for Team USA continued to grow. Here's a look at the athletes who have qualified for Paris through Day 2:\n\nMen's 10,000\n\n1. Grant Fisher, 2. Woody Kincaid, 3. Nicolas Young\n\nWomen's triple jump\n\n1. Jasmine Moore, 2.

Biles withdrew from the floor exercise final, leaving just the balance beam final as a possibility.\n\nMyKayla Skinner, competing in Biles' place on the vault, won the silver medal Sunday, and Suni Lee added a bronze for the U.S. on uneven bars.\n\nAmerican Fred Kerley capped off an exciting day of finals in track and field, taking silver in the 100-meter dash. The former 400-meter specialist proved that he is among the best in the world at short sprints as well. U.S. Trials champion Trayvon Bromell failed to qualify for the final, which left the field wide open, and Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs took the gold.\n\nGolfer Xander Schauffele has no previous major victory experience, but he is a gold medal winner. Schauffele survived Rory Sabbatini's Olympic-record round to win by one stroke and become the second men's golfer alive with a gold medal, five years after Justin Rose of Great Britain won it in 2016 at the Rio Games.\n\nIn swimming, Caeleb Dressel added two more gold medals to complete his Tokyo Olympics with five by winning the 50-meter freestyle and then shortly later helping the men's 4x100-meter medley relay team set a world record.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

Sign up for Olympic texts to get exclusive access to the Games\n\nTEAM USA MEDAL COUNT: Full list of every American who has earned hardware in Tokyo\n\nQuarterfinal matchup set for U.S. men's basketball\n\nTOKYO – With the quarterfinals looming on Tuesday, the U.S. men’s basketball team will have to take arguably the toughest path possible to a gold medal.\n\nA blind draw after the conclusion of group play Sunday saw Team USA get matched up with Spain – FIBA’s No. 2-ranked team and the 2019 Basketball World Cup champions – in the first round of the knockout stage. The game will tip off at 1:40 p.m. in the afternoon in Tokyo, which is 12:40 a.m. Eastern.\n\nIf the U.S. gets by that one, they’d play the winner of Australia and Argentina in the semifinals. The Australian team went 3-0 in group play and beat the Americans in an exhibition game in Las Vegas before traveling to Tokyo.\n\nTeam USA is still favored to win the gold medal, but the reason it ended up with a difficult draw was its 83-76 loss to France in the first game here. As winners of the group at 3-0, the French got a much more favorable path, playing Italy in the quarterfinals and either Slovenia or Germany in the semifinals.\n\nAfter the France loss, the U.S. team has regrouped with wins over Iran and the Czech Republic and would relish the opportunity to avenge that performance with a gold medal on the line.\n\n--Dan Wolken\n\nVenezuela's Yulimar Rojas shatters triple jump world record\n\nTOKYO – Venezuelan triple jumper Yulimar Rojas saved her best jump for last.\n\nOn Rojas’ sixth and final jump, she propelled herself 51 feet, 5 inches to break a 26-year-old world record. The previous record of 50 feet, 10¼ inches was held by Ukraine's Inessa Kravets. She set the mark in 1995.\n\nRojas knew it was a great jump when she hit the sand. She immediately got up and started celebrating while eagerly waiting for the scoreboard to display the distance of her jump. When the distance was posted, she was elated with emotion.\n\nThe 25-year-old triple jumper was part of a record-breaking competition. Second-place finisher Patricia Mamona of Portugal set a national record (49 feet, 3 inches) and bronze medalist Ana Peleteiro set a national record (48 feet, 9½ inches) for Spain.\n\nAmerican Keturah Orji placed seventh with a triple jump of 47 feet, 10½ inches.\n\n--Tyler Dragon\n\nFred Kerley wins silver in men's 100 meters behind Italy's Jacobs\n\nTOKYO — For more than a decade, one man reigned supreme in the men's 100-meter dash. He swept Olympic gold medals and world championships, racing at a legendary level that no one else could match.\n\nNow, Usain Bolt is retired, and his absence at the Tokyo Olympics gave way to a deep, determined field, all fighting for his title as the fastest man in the world.\n\nItalian Lamont Marcell Jacobs was the one who took it Sunday.\n\nJacobs took gold in the first Olympic 100-meter final of the post-Bolt era, finishing with a time of 9.80 seconds. American Fred Kerley took the silver in 9.84, and Andre De Grasse of Canada finished third to earn the bronze in 9.89.\n\nTrayvon Bromell, who was considered the favorite in Tokyo, bowed out in the semifinal round. The U.S. has not won gold in the men's 100 since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\n--Tom Schad\n\nU.S. weightlifter Kate Nye wins silver\n\nTOKYO — American weightlifter Kate Nye had to settle for a silver medal in the 76kg division Sunday but not without some controversy.\n\nNye, the 22-year old first-time Olympian from Oakland Township, Michigan, appeared to have successfully cleared 114 kg on her third and final snatch attempt, one of the two components of the competition and a lift that momentarily put her in the lead.\n\nBut just moments after she left the stage hugging her coaching team, the jury called for a video review of the lift. After a long deliberation, they threw out the attempt, judging her to be in violation of a rule by releasing the bar while it was still above her shoulders.\n\nThat bumped Nye back down to her second snatch at 111 kg, leaving her far behind Neisi Dajomes of Ecuador, who created some separation from the field with a 118 kg lift on her third attempt.\n\nNye easily secured second place with a personal best 138-kg lift in the clean-and-jerk but needed Dajomes to stumble to have any chance at the gold. She did not, easily clearing 140 kg on her second attempt to put the competition out of reach. On her third attempt, Dajomes put an exclamation point on her dominance with a 145 kg lift.\n\n--Dan Wolken\n\nTwo record breakers from Kentucky to meet in 100-meter hurdles final\n\nTOKYO -- Puerto Rico’s Jasmine Camacho-Quinn made a massive statement in the third semifinal heat of the women’s 100-meter hurdles.\n\nThe former Kentucky Wildcat ran a 12.26 to break the Olympic record, which was previously held by Sally Pearson of Australia. Pearson ran a 12.35 at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nCamacho-Quinn’s time instantly made her the favorite in the 100-meter hurdles final on Monday in Tokyo.\n\nBefore Camacho-Quinn’s record-breaking performance, world record holder Keni Harrison overcame what she called three “fake false starts” before her heat got going.\n\nHarrison, who also ran track at Kentucky, finished second in her heat with a time of 12.51 to automatically qualify for the final. Britany Anderson won the heat in 12.40.\n\nCamacho-Quinn’s Olympic record means two former Kentucky track stars own the two most prestigious records in the women’s 100-meter hurdles. The two will meet in the finals in what will be a highly-anticipated event.\n\n--Tyler Dragon\n\nWrestling: Gray moves on to gold medal match, Hafizov in repechage\n\nMAKUHARI, Chiba, Japan — Five-time world champion Adeline Gray can add a new achievement to her resume: Olympic medalist.\n\nGray pounded her way into the Tokyo Olympics gold-medal finals with a tight 3-2 victory over Aiperi Medet Kyzy of Kyrgyzstan. Gray will face 2014 World champion Aline Rotter Focken of Germany in Monday’s gold medal match.\n\nThis is Gray’s second Olympic appearance after placing seventh at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. By making the finals, she becomes the sixth U.S. wrestler to earn an Olympic medal in women’s freestyle since the sport joined the Olympic program in 2004. The only U.S. woman wrestler to win an Olympic gold medal was Helen Maroulis in 2016.\n\nIn Greco-Roman, U.S. wrestler Ildar Hafizov was pulled back into Monday’s repechage round at 60 kg, after the athlete who beat him on Sunday morning, Luis Orta Sanchez of Cuba, earned a spot in the gold-medal finals.\n\nHafizov will face 2018 World champion Sergey Emelin of Russia in the repechage round on Monday morning. If Hafizov beats Emelin, he would compete in the bronze-medal match.\n\n--USA Wrestling\n\nSuni Lee wins bronze on uneven bars\n\nSuni Lee now has a medal of every color.\n\nLee won a bronze medal on the uneven bars final Sunday, finishing 0.700 behind gold medalist Nina Derwael of Belgium. This adds to her gold in the all-around and silver in the team competition.\n\nLee is one of the world’s best on uneven bars, with one crazy-difficult routine and one slightly-less-crazy-difficult routine. What makes both of those routines so impressive is that she connects skills together, giving herself not even the slightest break to reset or gather her energy before she does the next hard move.\n\nOn Sunday, however, she missed most of those connections. It was clear from the start of her routine that she was just slightly off, and that’s enough to throw everything out of whack. Her routine wound up with a 6.2 difficulty score, six-tenths lower than her hardest routine – which she did in both the team and all-around finals.\n\nLee still has another chance to add to her medal collection, having qualified for Tuesday’s balance beam final.\n\n--Nancy Armour\n\nTOKYO — Americans Ronnie Baker and Fred Kerley are moving on to the 100-meter final.\n\nBut Trayvon Bromell, who entered as the favorite, is out.\n\nBromell came in third in his semifinal heat, in a photo finish at 10 seconds flat. The top two in each heat qualified for the final, as well as the next two fastest overall.\n\nAn extraordinarily fast third semifinal, in which the top four finishers all ran 9.90 seconds or faster, ensured that Bromell would be left out.\n\nThe 26-year-old won the U.S. Olympic trials by a clear margin and had the two fastest times in the world this year. He battled injuries for several years after the Rio Olympics.\n\nBaker and Su Bingtian of China recorded the fastest semifinal time of 9.83, with Bingtian barely winning the heat.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nTOKYO — Richard Torrez Jr., the American super heavyweight boxer, secured an Olympic medal Sunday night with a victory over Cuba’s Dainier Pero in a quarterfinal bout.\n\nTorrez won by split decision, 4-1, and advanced to the semifinals, which guarantees him at least a bronze medal at the Tokyo Games.\n\nHe will become the first U.S. boxer to win an Olympic medal in the super heavyweight division since Riddick Bowe claimed a silver medal at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\n“I’m not here to be a medalist,’’ Torrez said. “I’m here to be a gold medalist. That’s my goal, that’s my ambition. …I’m not going to be happy unless I do that.’’\n\nThe last U.S. boxer to win a gold medal in the super heavyweight division was Tyrell Biggs in 1984.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 22-year-old Torrez will face 29-year-old Kamshybek Kunkabayev of Kazakhstan in the semifinals at Kokugikan Arena.\n\nKunkabayev, who won the silver medal in the super heavyweight division at the 2017 and 2019 world championships, turned pro in 2020 and has won all three of his pro fights by knockout.\n\nOn Sunday, Torrez, a southpaw, came out aggressive against the Cuban, who was the quicker boxer. But Torrez threw more punches and set the pace.\n\nMidway through the second round, a cut opened near Torrez’s left eye. As blood streamed down his face, an official examined him before allowing the fight to continue.\n\nThe cut did not appear to bother Torrez as he slugged away. He lost the first round on the cards of four of the five judges. He won the second round on the cards of three of the five judges.\n\nThen came Torrez’s strong finish, with all five judges awarding him the third round.\n\n“I firmly believe that I’m the most conditioned super heavyweight there is,’’ he said. “I firmly believe that. I’m not one to toot my own horn much I’m not one to say I’m the best ever, but I can tell you that I’m the best conditioned.’’\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nTOKYO — The U.S. men’s foil team has bronze again.\n\nFour years after ending an 84-year Olympic podium drought in Rio, the Americans finished third in the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe team of Alex Massialas, Race Imboden and Gerek Meinhardt beat Japan 45-31 in the bronze-medal match. The Americans beat Germany in the quarterfinal earlier Sunday before falling to Russia, 45-41, in the semifinals.\n\nNick Itkin fenced in the United States’ first match, but Imboden replaced him on the second rotation.\n\nThe United States’ team bronze in Rio was its first medal since 1932. The same three fencers combined to win the bronze from Tokyo, just the fourth team foil medal in the country’s history\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nTOKYO — Britain’s Max Whitlock now has a six pack.\n\nWhitlock won his sixth Olympic medal, and third gold, on pommel horse Sunday night. It’s his second consecutive gold on his signature event, making him the first man since Zoltan Magyar in 1980 to defend his Olympic title on pommel horse. Whitlock also has bronzes from the all-around in Rio, as well as the team competition and pommel horse in London.\n\nWhitlock was first up on pommel horse. His routine was fluid, his legs a blur as he worked his way back and forth across the pommel horse. He had a form break as he pressed into the handstand on his dismount, one of his legs bending wide. But his routine is packed with so much difficulty — he has a 7.0 D score, two-tenths higher than anyone else — that the error didn’t matter.\n\nStill, he had to wait for seven more competitors to go. When the score of the last, Kohei Kameyama of Japan, posted, Whitlock leaned his head back in relief. He then grabbed a British flag and wrapped it around his shoulders.\n\nLee Chih Kai of Tapei won the silver medal and Japan’s Kazuma Kaya got bronze. American Alec Yoder was sixth.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nMyKayla Skinner wins silver in vault as replacement for Simone Biles\n\nTOKYO — U.S. gymnast MyKayla Skinner, competing in place of Simone Biles, won a silver medal Sunday in women’s vaulting.\n\nOnly four Americans previously medaled in the event, including gold medalist Biles in 2016. Biles dropped out of the Tokyo final for mental health reasons and was replaced by Skinner in the eight-woman final at Ariake Gymnastics Centre.\n\nSkinner, 24, competed first, scoring 14.916 after her Cheng (15.033) and Amanar (14.800) vaults.\n\nBrazil’s Rebeca Andrade won the gold medal at 15.083, adding to her all-around silver. The bronze went to South Korea’s Seojeong Yeo (14.733).\n\n-- Jeff Metcalfe\n\nTitle of world's fastest man to be settled on track\n\nTOKYO — Day 3 in Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium features four finals.\n\nOn the track, the crown for world’s fastest man is available.\n\nCanada’s Andre De Grasse, a USC product, enters the night with the best time (9.91) in the men’s 100 meters through the opening round.\n\nAll three Americans -- Fred Kerley, Ronnie Baker and Trayvon Bromell made it to the semifinal round. However, Bromell narrowly made it to the next stage. Bromell ran a 10.05 and surprisingly didn’t earn a top-three automatic spot. He had to rely on his time to get through to the semifinal.\n\nBromell entered the Olympics with the top 100-meter time (9.77) in the world this year. His 9.77 in June also made him the seventh fastest man in the event’s history. He’s hoping to reignite that speed on the track tonight.\n\nIn the men’s high jump, Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barshim is the favorite. The 2019 world champion is seeking his first ever Olympic gold medal. Russian Olympic Committee’s Mikhail Akimenko figures to be his fiercest rival. Akimenko won the silver medal at the 2019 World Championships.\n\nAmericans JuVaughn Harrison and Shelby McEwen are also competing for a spot on the podium.\n\nIt will be the final night in the women’s triple jump as well. Venezuelan Yulimar Rojas is the No. 1 ranked triple jumper in the world this year. She leaped 48 feet, 5½ inches to advance to the final. The reigning Olympic champion Caterine Ibarguen of Colombia and Jamaica’s Shanieka Ricketts are also serious contenders for gold in the women’s triple jump.\n\nOne final in the field already ended. China’s Lijiao Gong picked a good occasion to establish a new personal best.\n\nThe glide-technique shot putter tossed 67 feet, 6¼ inches to win gold in the women’s shot put. American thrower Raven Saunders, wearing her trademark mask, finished second with a mark of 64 feet, 11¼ inches. New Zealand’s Valerie Adams’ mark of 64 feet, 4½ inches was good enough for third.\n\nGong, the 2019 world champion, had the five best throws of the competition.\n\n-- Tyler Dragon\n\nArtem Dolgopyat gives Israel its first-ever gymnastics gold\n\nTOKYO — Israel’s Artem Dolgopyat gold medal on floor exercise is a historic one.\n\nDolgopyat gave Israel its second gold medal ever at the Summer Olympics on Sunday, and its first medal of any color in gymnastics. When the last gymnast’s score was announced and it was clear Dolgopyat had won, members of the Israeli delegation, who had come prepared with Israeli flags, erupted in cheers. Israeli media members also cheered.\n\nRayderley Zapata of Spain won the silver, and China’s Xiao Ruoteng took bronze. American Yul Moldauer lost his rhythm on a flare sequence and finished sixth.\n\nDolgopyat and Zapata actually finished with the same score, a 14.933. The first tiebreaker is the execution score, and they were tied there, too, with 8.433. But Dolgopyat had 0.100 more in difficulty, and that gave him the gold – as well as a piece of history.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nCT Pan wins seven-player bronze medal golf playoff\n\nAfter the first hole of the bronze-medal playoff in men's golf, Paul Casey and Hideki Matsuyama – second and third, respectively, entering Sunday’s final round – were out after making bogey on 18. The playoff then moved to the par-3 10, with Cheng Tsun Pan (Chinese Tapei), Mito Pereira (Chile), Sebastian Munoz (Colombia), Rory McIlroy (Ireland) and Collin Morikawa (USA) still alive.\n\nAll five remaining players made par on 10 and moved to 11.\n\nPereira had a fine look at birdie that did a 270-degree spin around the cup. Then McIlroy just missed his manageable birdie attempt that also lipped out.\n\nMorikawa’s approach shot reached within a foot of the pin and he tapped his birdie in, as did CT Pan, who also had an attempt within three feet.\n\nMunoz bogeyed to join the elimination party, as Morikawa and Pan headed back to 18 for the fourth playoff hole.\n\nOn the fourth playoff hole, Morikawa’s second shot landed deep in a bunker and he could not recover for a much-needed up-and-down par, while Pan saved par after his second shot also failed to reach the green.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nXander Schauffele wins Olympic men's golf tournament\n\nKAWAGOE, Japan — No previous major victory experience was necessary to win a gold medal at the Olympics. American Xander Schauffele proved it all weekend.\n\nSchauffele, 27, has finished in the top 10 at all four majors in his young career (with top three finishes in every event but the PGA Championship). Now he's the second men's golfer alive with a gold medal, five years after Justin Rose of Great Britain won it in 2016 at the Rio Games, where the sport returned to the Olympic program for the first time in more than a century.\n\nThe sport's inclusion was predicated on the fact the best players in the world would participate. While the 60-man field for these Tokyo Olympics became diluted due to positive COVID-19 tests from top-10 players Bryson DeChambeau (United States) and Jon Rahm (Spain), several notable names vied for a medal.\n\nAnd Schauffele stood on top at the end with a 4-under 67 in Sunday's final round to finish 18-under-par for the tournament.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nAmerican Krysta Palmer wins bronze in 3m springboard diving\n\nTOKYO — U.S. diver Krysta Palmer took bronze in the women’s individual three-meter springboard final, marking the first time the U.S. has medaled in the women’s event since 1988.\n\nIn her first-ever Olympic individual final, Palmer finished with a score of 343.75 points. She was 39.75 points behind first-place Shi Tingmao and five points back from second-place Wang Han, both of China.\n\nPalmer’s best dive of the day came in the third round on a reverse two-and-a-half somersaults pike, which scored 73.50 points ranked second overall.\n\nPalmer, 29, qualified for a spot in the finished when she finished in fifth place with a score of 316.65 points in the semifinal.

The referee determined Aliev had intentionally used his head to clash with British opponent Frazer Clarke, who had significant cuts near both of his eyes.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, Aliev sat down on the canvas just outside the ropes and above the steps leading down to the arena floor. He remained there unmoving, and French team officials came up to speak with him and brought him water.\n\n“This was my way of showing that the decision was so unfair,” Aliev said through a translator. “I wanted to fight against all that injustice, and honestly today, also my teammates had unfair results. I trained my whole life for this, and I came into here, and because of one referee’s decision, I lost. It’s over.”\n\nAfter more than 30 minutes, boxing officials emerged and spoke with Aliev and the French team. Aliev left the apron, and everyone went inside the Kokugikan Arena.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, Aliev returned to the arena and resumed his protest in the same spot for about 15 more minutes. He finally left for good, but not before ripping the referee and the oversight of the temporary Boxing Task Force running the Tokyo tournament.\n\n“I would have won, but it had already been written that I was disqualified,” Aliev said. “I prepared my whole life for this, so getting mad about this result is natural.”\n\nAliev and Clarke were engaged in close fighting throughout their two rounds, and Aliev did appear to lean into his punches zealously. Clarke, who clinched a medal with the win, thought the decision was fair.\n\n“I felt there was a couple of heads going in there,” Clarke said. “Whether it was intentional or not, that’s not for me to say. … I told (Aliev afterward) to calm down. You’re not thinking with your head. You’re thinking with your heart. I know it’s hard, but the best thing to do is go back to the changing room.”\n\nAliev protested vocally and emphatically immediately after the bout, yelling to the mostly empty arena: “Everyone knows I won!” Aliev claimed he hadn’t been warned by the referee about his aggressive, headfirst fighting before his disqualification, although some ringside observers thought he had.\n\nAliev refused Clarke’s attempts to calm him in the ring. Aliev won the first round on three of the five judges’ scorecards in what was a close fight.\n\nAliev’s protest didn’t interrupt the tournament since his bout with Clarke was the final fight of the afternoon session, which meant the next bout wasn’t scheduled for more than three hours.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRaven Saunders wins silver in women's shot put\n\nRaven Saunders of the United States won the silver medal in the women's shot put.\n\nGong Lijiao of China won her first Olympic gold medal with a personal best of 20.58 meters.

She said she fractured the talus bone in her right foot, near the ankle, while throwing last month and the injury prevented her from training for three weeks.\n\n\"Just to make it through, I'm really happy,\" Price said through tears. \"I'm hoping just to put a couple more things together, and represent well.\"\n\nPrice said the injury has been mentally challenging to work through in the leadup to Tokyo, and it remains physically painful. She's been taping the foot but the pain is inevitable, she said, because it's the foot she uses to drive and generate power.\n\n\"It's just like, 'OK, can't do anything about it.' You just grin and bear and it and you just keep pushing through it,\" she said. \"Luckily the pain isn't as bad as what it has been, so to me, it's already a blessing.\"\n\nFellow U.S. hammer throwers Brooke Andersen and Gwen Berry also advanced to the final.

Biles will be replaced in the floor final Britain’s Jennifer Gadirova.\n\nBiles came to Tokyo as the biggest star of these Olympics, projected to win a record five gold medals.

He won gold in the 50-meter freestyle earlier in the day.\n\nThe U.S. men finished in 3:26.78, beating the previous world record by .50 seconds.\n\nThe relay opened with Ryan Murphy on backstroke, followed by Michael Andrew, who finished his breaststroke leg with the Americans in second behind Great Britain. Dressel then regained the lead and Zach Apple closed it out, anchoring the freestyle leg.\n\nThe U.S. has never lost the men's medley relay at the Olympics. The only time it has not won gold was in 1980 when the entire team boycotted the Moscow Games.\n\nThe U.S. finishes the swimming competition with more medals than any other country, including 30 overall and 11 golds.

It’s the first time an American has won Olympic gold in the event in 37 years.\n\nThe 21-year-old University of Florida swimmer won a surprising gold earlier this week in the men’s 800 freestyle.

Brazil's Bruno Fratus won bronze.\n\nDressel, who won the 100 freestyle and 100 butterfly earlier in the week, also won a gold in the men’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay. He had one more event remaining, the men’s 4x100 medley relay, which the United States has never lost at the Olympics.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nAmerican woman wins silver at BMX freestyle\n\nTOKYO — American Hannah Roberts exulted and wept after her spectacular first run Sunday in the women’s BMX Freestyle final at the Tokyo Games.\n\nShe looked golden with a score of 96.10, 10 points higher than the score of any of her competitors after the first runs were complete at the Ariake Urban Sports Park.\n\n“…It might have been one of the best runs I've ever done,’’ Roberts said. “I was obviously super stoked.’’\n\nThen came the second runs.\n\nCharlotte Worthington of Great Britain became the first woman to land a 360 backflip in competition. She scored 97.50, claimed the gold medal and relegated Roberts to the silver medal.\n\nEach rider got two 60-second runs, with only the top score counting. On Roberts’ second run, the final run of the competition, she stopped riding after landing her second trick.\n\nShe limped to the medal ceremony, wore a walking boot to a press conference and explained she’d injured her foot on the second day of practice and hurt it again on her second run. But, no excuses.\n\n“Charlotte did some crazy things,’’ Roberts said.\n\nAmong the crazier things involving Worthington is that in 2018 she was working in the kitchen of a restaurant rather than competing full time. But that year, Worthington said, she attended some BMX contests and learned Great Britain was assembling an Olympic team.\n\nWorthington eventually became part of that team and headed to the Tokyo Games with hopes of landing a 360 backflip. She pulled out of the trick on her first run, which resulted in a score of 38.60.\n\n“To go into the second run, you’re constantly in and out of, ‘Can I do it? Is it the right time? Is it not?’ ” she said. “But I just had to have faith in it being ingrained in my body, the amount of work that we’ve put into it.\n\n“So going out there the second time, I was just ready to give it my all again. And once I landed that trick, I knew I was on. I was pretty much zoned out for the rest of the run.’’\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nCanada knocks out Sponcil, Claes in women's beach volleyball\n\nTOKYO – Sarah Sponcil and Kelly Claes, ranked No. 3 in the world in beach volleyball, lost in the Olympic round of 16 Sunday at Shiokaze Park.\n\nCanadians Heather Bansley and Brandie Wilkerson, ranked No. 16, won 22-24, 21-18, 15-13 after being down a set and 10-4 in the second.\n\n“We made more than enough opportunities for ourselves to win,” Claes said. “Fought through that first, up in the end and we let them back in. Everybody is good out here so letting that door open just a little and here we are, we lost.”\n\nCanada led 12-11 in the third set when a Sponcil serve was called out. The U.S. challenged the call and at first was successful only for a further review to go Canada’s way.\n\nDown 14-11, Sponcil and Claes held off two match points before losing the third on a Wilkerson winner.\n\n“I thought it (Sponcils’ serve) was in,” Claes said. “It sucks, but it shouldn’t have come down to that third set. We did such a good job in the second then just let them back in.”\n\n-- Jeff Metcalfe\n\nAmericans look to add to medal count in track and field\n\nWhile the U.S. has only one medal so far in athletics — a bronze from Saturday's mixed-gender 4x400 relay — finals are just beginning.\n\nIn women's shot put, which has its final at 8:35 p.m. ET, the United States' Raven Saunders is a favorite after finishing atop the rankings in qualifiers. An NCAA star at Mississippi, Saunders threw 19.22 meters to put herself through to the finals and caught the eyes of many on social media for her unique facemask.\n\nSunday morning stateside will also see men's high jump, women's triple jump and men's 100-meter finals.

The U.S. duo lost one match in the prelims against the Netherlands.\n\nAmerican boxer Richard Torrez Jr. has tricks up his sleeve\n\nRun into Richard Torrez Jr. in the Olympic village, and he'll probably show you a magic trick. He's been carrying a deck around with him to spark conversation with other athletes.\n\nThe American super heavyweight boxer, who graduated from high school as valedictorian of his class, comes from a family of boxers. Both his father and grandfather were boxers, and his dad even fought for the U.S. team, though he didn't make it to the Olympics. Torrez Jr. was invited to train at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee training center in 2017.\n\nTyrell Biggs was the last boxer to medal for Team USA in the super heavyweight division back in 1984.

He was also fifth in 2019 and fourth in 2017.\n\nThe 100 has been a tougher race for King, who will turn 30 on July 9.\n\nHe’s only made it out of the semifinals once in the past three years, when he was sixth in 2022.\n\nHe’ll be up against a field that includes world champion Noah Lyles as well as renowned sprinters Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley, defending U.S. champ Cravont Charleston, up-and-coming teenager Christian Miller and former Duck Cravon Gillespie.\n\nStill, King comes back to Hayward Field as confident as he’s ever been.\n\n“I feel good and we’ve been training really well,” King said. “I feel like I have the opportunity to come do what I want to do. I’m happy to be here but I’m here for a purpose. I’m here to do something and get a job done. I’m not here to just be a part of the moment, I’m here to be the moment.”\n\nKing, who left Oregon in 2017 as the then-school record holder in the 100 and 200, has season-bests of 10.02 seconds in the 100 and 20.11 in the 200. His season includes a win in the 100 at the USATF Los Angeles Grand Prix on May 18 and a third-place finish in the 200 at the Pre Classic on May 25. He was also a member of U.S. 4x100 team that won the World Athletics Relays in the Bahamas on May 5.\n\nThere are five preliminary heats in the 100 on Saturday, with the top five in each plus the next two fastest advancing to Sunday’s 5:48 p.m. semifinals. The final will close out Day 3 of the meet on Sunday.\n\n“This is the hardest team to make in the world so when we come in we have to be primed and ready to go,” King said.\n\nHere’s a look a some other events on Saturday’s schedule. Follow along here for live updates.\n\nMen’s long jump qualifying, 4:45 p.m. — The top four Americans in the world this year are all collegians, led by USC’s Johnny Brackins (27 feet) and his teammate JC Stevenson (26-11¾), the NCAA Outdoor Championships winner. Now they’ll have to contend with 2023 U.S. champ Marquis Dendy and runner-up Jarrion Lawson, among others.\n\nWomen’s high jump qualifying, 5 p.m. — Vashti Cunningham has been the best American high jumper since 2017, when she started a run of winning 13 straight U.S. indoor and outdoor titles. Oregon’s Cheyla Scott is also entered.\n\nWomen’s 100 semifinal/final, 6 p.m./7:50 p.m. — Friday’s qualifiers will race twice on Saturday as the U.S. sprint team for Paris begins to emerge.

The 26-year-old hurdler led from start to finish as he posted a meet record and world-leading time of 46.46.\n\nBut U.S. track and field saved perhaps its best athlete for last – and McLaughlin-Levrone delivered.\n\nThe defending Olympic champion and world-record holder in the women’s 400-meter hurdles put on a dazzling display around the track, basically running by herself. When McLaughlin-Levrone crossed the finish line she quickly found out she had broken her previous world record with a time of 50.65.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the only woman in the history of the event to run sub-51 seconds in the 400 hurdles.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

Each ran a personal best in the final.\n\nParis will be Hiltz's first Olympics. They won a silver medal at the Indoor World Championships earlier this year in the 1,500 in Glasgow, Scotland, the first time an American has won a medal in that event in 21 years. −Lindsay Schnell\n\nAlaysha Johnson in postrace interview: 'This is for the hood babies'\n\nEmotions spilled over on the track following the women’s 100-meter hurdle final.\n\nMasai Russell shocked the Hayward Field stadium and the track and field world by winning in an impressive time of 12.25. Alaysha Johnson ran a personal-best 12.31 (12.302) to place second.\n\nJohnson who had what was perhaps the most emotional postrace interview of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials.\n\n“It was all God. Everybody all the time said I wasn’t good enough (and) said that I didn’t deserve. So, I did this my way, my team’s way and the way it was meant to be,” Alaysha Johnson said to Lewis Johnson. “This is for the hood babies, the people who are poor and come from nothing, this is for everybody that looks like me that was ever doubted. And I did it with a Black designer on my chest. This is what I stand for and I’m making a way for everybody in my position.” −Tyler Dragon\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaks her own world record in 400 hurdles\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone continued her dominance in the women’s 400 hurdles, setting (another) world record Sunday at Hayward Field in the U.S. Olympic track and field trials finale. McLaughlin-Levrone crossed the finish line in 50.65 seconds, then covered her mouth in shock upon seeing her time.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone's previous world record, also set at Hayward Field, was 50.68, which she ran at the 2022 World Championships.\n\nAnna Cockrell (52.64) was second and Jasmine Jones (52.77) was third and will join McLaughlin-Levrone in Paris. −Lindsay Schnell\n\nBryce Hoppel sets meet record in 800\n\nHoppel stamped his ticket to Paris in a big way. Hoppel led both laps in the 800 and crossed the finish line running a meet record and personal-best 1:42.77.\n\nHoppel’s training partner, Hobbs Kessler, came in second place with a personal-best time of 1:43.64.\n\nBrandon Miller took the third and final qualifying spot, running a 1:43.97. −Tyler Dragon\n\nGrant Fisher, Abdihamid Nur battle to end in 5,000\n\nFisher and Nur were running stride for stride in the final lap of the men’s 5000.

Rudy Winkler came in second, throwing 258 feet, 10 inches.\n\nHaugh and Winkler were the only two throwers in the competition with the Olympic standard.\n\nShelby McEwen wins men’s high jump\n\nShelby McEwen won the event, leaping 7 feet, 6½ inches. McEwen was the only jumper in the competition with the Olympic standard.\n\nCould Quincy Wilson go to the Olympics?\n\nQuincy Wilson, the 16-year-old sprinting sensation who captivated the Hayward Field crowd when he made the final in the men’s 400, has an outside shot at going to Paris to make the men’s 4x400 relay pool.\n\nHall finished sixth in the 400 final with a time of 44.94. He has the 24th fastest 400 time in the world this year, having clocked a 44.59 on June 23 at the trials semifinals. He said after the final that he wasn’t going to stop training until he knew for sure his season was over, adding that he wasn’t sure if he should expect to make the relay pool because those decisions are “so political.”\n\nThe relay pool is decided by relay coaches Mike Marsh and Mechelle Freeman. They will announce the team no later than July 8, but athletes and their individual coaches will be notified sooner — potentially as soon as late Sunday night — so athletes can start practicing together. −Lindsay Schnell\n\nWill Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone set another record?\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone had the fastest time in the 400-meter hurdles semifinals Saturday, clocking a 52.48 to easily advance to the finals Sunday.\n\nEvery time McLaughlin-Levrone steps on the track there’s a chance she could set a world record, and some expect that to happen Sunday. She is the defending gold medalist and a heavy favorite to repeat in Paris. McLaughlin-Levrone also has a gold in the 4x400 from Tokyo, and is expected to be on that relay team again.\n\nResults for all events of the Olympic trials\n\nIf you missed any of the events this week or last, we have you covered with a list of results for the top 3 finishers in each event who will be get an automatic bid to the Paris Olympics.\n\nWomen's 100-meter hurdles: Breaking ties\n\nChristina Clemons and Keni Harrison took the two automatic qualifying spots in the first heat of the women’s 100-meter hurdles semifinal Saturday. Clemons and Harrison both ran a 12.52. But upon review, Clemons was deemed the winner by a slight margin.\n\nIronically, Alaysha Johnson and Tonea Marshall also crossed the finish line with the exact same time of 12.36 to pace the second semifinal heat. Johnson was named the winner after the review.\n\nMasai Russell also posted a 12.36 to win the third and final semifinal heat.\n\nJohnson, Marshall and Russell have the top qualifying times entering Sunday’s final at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat time do US track and field finals begin Sunday?\n\nThe first final Sunday, the men's hammer throw, begins at 5:50 p.m. ET.

For the most part I think it was pretty smooth. It felt like my first race back so of course the legs were getting a little wake-up, but it was nice.\"\n\nMu, who became the first American to win an 800 gold medal in 53 years at the Olympics in Tokyo, had a disappointing bronze finish at the World Championships in Budapest last fall before bouncing back a month later to reset the American record at the Pre Classic Diamond League final in 1:54.97.\n\nSince then she's been totally focused on her health and her hamstrings.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

She put an exclamation point on that statement at the 2023 track and field world championships Monday in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThe charismatic sprinter is officially the fastest woman in the world. Richardson ran a 10.65 to win her first ever world title in the women’s 100 meters. Her time set a championship record, breaking the mark held by Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce by .02 seconds.\n\nJamaica's Shericka Jackson finished second with a time of 10.72 and Fraser-Pryce placed third, crossing the line in 10.77.\n\nRichardson is the first American woman to win a 100-meter world title since the late Tori Bowie won gold at the 2017 worlds. She joined fellow American Noah Lyles as 2023 100-meter world champions. Lyles won gold in the men's 100 meters in Sunday's final. It's the first time Americans have swept the 100-meter world titles since 2017 when Bowie and Justin Gatlin both topped the podium in the event in London.\n\nRichardson fought hard to even qualify for the women's final. She placed third in her semifinal heat and had to rely on her time (10.84) to advance to the final. After her semifinal race, she had a few minutes to talk to her coach, Dennis Mitchell, about improving her start.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

When she crossed the line, she lifted her arms up in celebration.\n\n“This journey for me, from since I first came on the professional level [in 2019] to now is just knowing that no matter what happens, you never lose sight of yourself,” Richardson said, according to NBC Sports. “Never lose sight of your faith. Always remember why you started.”\n\nRichardson has more races to come in Budapest. Her agent, Renaldo Nehemiah, told NBC Sports that she's chasing three gold medals at these worlds. The 200 starts Wednesday and the 4x100 relay is Saturday.\n\nThe 23-year-old sprinter made headlines in 2021 when she was suspended for one month after testing positive for marijuana at the U.S. Olympic trials. Due to the positive test, which she said came after she was struggling emotionally, Richardson missed the Tokyo Olympics that summer.\n\nTwo years later, Richardson proved that she’s back and better on the track — as the newly crowned world champion.\n\nGrant Holloway wins third world title in 110-meter hurdles\n\nHolloway won his third consecutive world championship gold in the men's 110-meter hurdles.\n\nHolloway ran a season-best 12.96 to win the race.

Officials previously said that the draft would spotlight developments showing Detroit's progress, such as the Michigan Central Station. But the draft is not expected to take place at the historic train depot.\n\n\"It will not be at the train station,\" Duggan said. \"I don't know if I'm letting anything out of the bag. That was an option, but (Chief Operating Officer) Brad Dick didn't want them stepping on his flowers there at Roosevelt Park,\" which has been remade as Ford Motor Co. gets ready to reopen a remade Michigan Central, Duggan said.\n\nHow Detroit will hustle harder to show off for the NFL draft\n\nDetails of the event footprint are being finalized. An update is expected early next year as organizers continue discussions with the NFL. Visit Detroit and the Detroit Sports Commission are raising $10 million among various partners for the event. The NFL will pump \"five to seven times\" that amount for its production needs, said Claude Molinari, co-chair of the NFL draft organizing committee and president and chief executive officer of Visit Detroit, which is spending $2 million on the event.\n\nVisitors can expect a plethora of free experiences and events, such as an interactive football-themed park.\n\n\"We all know Detroit hustles harder ... we are harnessing that energy as we collaborate with our local partners and stakeholders in our draft planning,\" Molinari said.\n\nThe Detroit Experience initiative will involve a neighborhood engagement program with multiple pre-NFL draft events at city parks and recreational facilities.\n\nSeveral businesses within the Metro Detroit Black Business Alliance and the Detroit Economic Growth Corp. will be involved in business opportunities for the event. Officials within the Metro Detroit Black Business Alliance were invited to nominate businesses to the NFL to consider in the bidding process for draft services, such as production needs, said Kai Bowman, chief operating officer of the Metro Detroit Black Business Alliance.\n\n\"We have successfully certified local businesses, making them eligible to potentially secure contracts related to the NFL draft. More importantly, we aim to elevate these businesses in making them eligible to bid on contracts for sports events in Detroit extending beyond the draft,\" Bowman said.\n\nScreens will also be set up throughout the area, including Beacon Park and Capitol Park, for viewers to watch events.\n\nEvent announcements will begin to roll out in the next few months, said Alexis Wiley, co-chair of the NFL draft organizing committee and founder of Moment Strategies.\n\n\"The city of Detroit parks and recreation departments have an done an outstanding job of pulling together some really great programming that is going to engage people of all ages leading up to the draft and even when the draft is here.\"\n\nNetworks, including ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network, will broadcast parts of the event. Anyone interested in a temporary paid role in the NFL Draft Experience can register online.\n\n'Detroit will be ready' for NFL draft, Duggan vows\n\nPrograms, including football clinics and flag football competitions for youths, along with tailgating, are expected, Mayor Mike Duggan said.\n\n\"Detroit will be ready. When the NFL fans come here, we’re going to treat them to a different experience than they had in the last year,\" Duggan said.\n\nW.K. Kellogg Foundation Michigan Director Faye Nelson also announced a $1 million investment from various donors toward an initiative toward youth literacy and youth sports, particularly girls in sports.\n\n\"This community initiative centered around education and action will be seamlessly integrated into all future sporting events secured by the Detroit Sports Commission,\" Nelson said.\n\nDuggan recalled last year's draft in Kansas City being held \"in parks far away from their central business district,\" but Detroit is attempting a \"far more challenging\" initiative for his projection of 300,000 to 400,000 visitors.\n\n\"We are going to hold the NFL draft in the heart of downtown Detroit, so it’ll be in the heart of the city,\" Duggan said. \"We are going to welcome America to the city of Detroit and I can’t wait.\"\n\nSeveral Detroit officials said they anticipate the draft being among the biggest sports events in decades in the city, which has hosted the baseball All Star Game, NCAA basketball's Final Four and the Super Bowl since 2000. Boosters believe the draft could have an even bigger economic impact than the 2006 Super Bowl.\n\n“Only 60,000 people can get tickets to the Super Bowl,” Duggan said. “But for the NFL draft, hundreds of thousands can get in — and they stay for the weekend.”\n\nMolinari also noted that the Tigers are scheduled to play at Comerica Park on Friday through Sunday, with the draft running Thursday-Saturday.\n\n“I know they’re excited. They’re going to have sold-out games because so many sports fans will be like, ‘Well, I’m coming in for the draft. I’ll also go to a Tigers game,’ “ Molinari said.\n\nDetroit improvements ahead to polish up for draft\n\nThe draft is the beginning of a \"reimagination of how people understand and experience the city of Detroit and the state,\" said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist.\n\n\"I can’t overstate, because I’m just too damn excited. What I’m really looking forward to is how every person will have a role to play and something you need to experience for them in this draft,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nDetroit will see some infrastructure upgrades leading up to the draft. Duggan told the Free Press that security will be heightened at similar levels to the Grand Prix event, Taylor Swift concert and the Ford Fireworks.\n\n\"If you've been around downtown, you'd know it's hard to move on the streets but we are getting ready for next year. Everything is ready for next year. Parking lots will look better. Once we took the freeway over from the state of Michigan, we made that look better, we got some more work to do on that. But this city is going to look spectacular next April and it's starting to get there right now,\" Duggan said.\n\nDick said the city will also ensure property owners are compliant with city rules ahead of the event. Officials did not point to whether certain costs or infrastructure upgrades across Detroit were specifically for the draft, but Dick said improvements were previously budgeted \"to build a stronger city itself, not just focused on the draft.\" The NFL's main demand for Detroit is ensuring the city is prepared to deploy enough security and locking down event locations.\n\n\"At this point, it's becoming second nature. We started out, as you know, the first weekend of April with not as good a police plan as we should have had. We had no incidents the rest of the year with all those crowds. I think the Detroit Police Department is just doing an outstanding job,\" Duggan said.\n\nDana Afana is the Detroit city hall reporter for the Free Press.

Taliban won't crush women's ...", "text": "Samira Asghari\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nI began playing basketball at my school in Kabul, Afghanistan, at age 14. Because of the Taliban, I have been a refugee twice. First in Iran as a child, and now a second time, I am outside my country. When my family returned to Afghanistan in 2003, I was in the first generation of girls able to return to school and play many sports.\n\nBut basketball for girls – and indeed all sports – was not widely accepted in Afghan society, and as female athletes, we were frequently threatened by extremists. It was a radical act for me as a girl to hold a basketball or to wear athletic clothes. So, I would wear my Converse All-Star shoes off the court – in public – to make the point that I and all women and girls had the right to play sports.\n\nBefore the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the number of female athletes was growing in Afghanistan. In order to even get to the playing fields and tournaments that other athletes worldwide take for granted, we women had to become human rights advocates, educators and community leaders. Sports became our vehicle for promoting our own rights, including the rights to health and education. Ultimately, millions of Afghan women and girls were able to play sports in school, ride bikes and dream of sports scholarships, competing for our country and even opening gyms or building businesses around sports.\n\nToday, Afghan women and girls have been forced off the courts, away from tracks and out of gyms by the Taliban, who took over the government of my country for a second time in August 2021. In the weeks after Kabul was captured, the Taliban overturned 20 years of progress in women’s rights. Girls were no longer allowed to attend school after the sixth grade, women could not work and female athletes had to burn their jerseys, bury their medals, hide sports equipment or flee the country.\n\nWhere are all the women?Our eyes don't deceive us. The men are fleeing Afghanistan.\n\nParis Olympics give visibility, hope to Afghan women athletes\n\nYet, when the Paris Olympics open this week, three Afghan women athletes will be visibly leading in the parade of nations on the River Seine, along with three Afghan male athletes. The women Olympians had to leave Afghanistan to represent Afghanistan at the Paris Games.\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover, thousands of male and female Afghan athletes sought refuge abroad where they could continue training and competing. This includes past Olympians and Paralympians, national athletes in dozens of sports and members of the Afghan women’s national soccer, basketball and cricket teams.\n\nWho made the cut for Paris Olympics:USA basketball Olympic women's team roster\n\nEven as the Taliban are minimizing and restricting all women’s rights, in Paris, women Olympians will proudly represent our country to an audience of billions on the world stage.\n\nAs a former women’s national basketball team player, I am proud of all the athletes from my country, and that I can represent them as a female International Olympic Committee member.\n\nThe Olympic Charter outlines the principles that guide the work of the IOC, including opposing gender-based discrimination. This is why the IOC recognizes and supports the Afghan women Olympians, even though the Taliban government does not.\n\nAfghan sprinter Kimia Yousofi will compete in her third Olympics in Paris. Kimia says she represents \"the stolen dreams and aspirations” of women and girls in Afghanistan ‒ “those who don't have the authority to make decisions as free human beings.”\n\nAfghan women athletes at the Olympics show progress, but there is still work to be done\n\nKimia and other Afghans competing in Paris are the clearest sign the Taliban have not succeeded in crushing women’s sports nor women’s spirits.\n\nThe Taliban crave international recognition. No country or United Nations body has accepted their legitimacy to govern, chiefly because of their ongoing discrimination against women.\n\nThe IOC has rightly barred Taliban officials from attending these Paris Games, which are the most gender-equal ever.\n\nBut this is not the endgame for Afghan women and girls. There is still an urgent need for governments, the U.N. and other key players to apply pressure to restore Afghan women’s basic human rights.\n\nAs we cheer all athletes at the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics, we should not forget the 20 million Afghan women and girls who are denied their basic rights to access education, work, health – and sports.\n\nSamira Asghari is a former Afghan women’s national basketball team captain who later worked for the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee. She was elected to be a member of the International Olympic Committee in 2018 at the age of 24, becoming the first IOC representative from Afghanistan, and one of the youngest-ever members.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/08/06/2004-olympics-breakdancing-in-baseball-softball-out-paris-games/5494716001/", "title": "2024 Olympics: Breakdancing in, baseball, softball out for Paris ...", "text": "TOKYO – These Olympics wrap up looking younger and more urban than past editions, and they’ll look that way in the future.\n\nWith surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing making their Olympic debuts here, the new sports brought everything organizers hoped for. Two of surfing’s biggest stars took home gold with the United States’ Carissa Moore and Brazil’s Italo Ferreira winning despite modest waves here.\n\nSport climbing’s three disciplines delivered an exciting mix of speed and difficulty.\n\nFour of the six medals in women’s skateboarding went to athletes 13 or younger.\n\nAs American skateboarder Alexis Sablone said, “I think that they are getting cool points because everyone knows that skateboarding is cool.”\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nIt is, and that’s why it’s staying for the foreseeable future.\n\n“It’s been something very deliberate from the start that we wanted to give these incredible young athletes the Olympic stage to perform on,” said Kit McConnell, the International Olympic Committee’s sports director, “but also wanted to celebrate and create a connection with the communities that are out there with these sports.”\n\nAll three will return for the Paris Games in 2024, which will also add breakdancing, or breaking, for its Olympic debut. The event will feature men's and women's competitions with head-to-head matchups in which judges determine the winners.\n\nThose sports are easy to pick up and have active communities on social media, Paris 2024 noted.\n\nSome of the sports added for these Games – baseball/softball and karate – are gone for now.\n\nIOC rules now allow host cities to add sports to their program, so karate made sense in the country it originated. Baseball and softball, which have strong followings here, did too.\n\nBut they’re less of a fit in 2024 and won’t be contested then.\n\nThat has made it difficult, especially for softball. The sport was in the Olympic program from 1996 to 2008 before making its return here. Without it included in the next Games, the athletes who won medals here worry what that will do to their sport in the future.\n\n“You have an entire six teams of people who thought this dream was never going to happen,” said pitcher Cat Osterman, who came back to help the United States to silver here after winning medals in 2004 and 2008. “So every time you do that, there’s younger and younger girls whose dreams get killed from it. Obviously we’ve shown that it’s a competitive sport. There’s other sports that aren’t as competitive and they’re not voted out.”\n\nTeammate Monica Abbott said she has seen the response on social media, that she’s heard from people from India, Slovenia and the Czech Republic who are trying to pitch like she does.\n\n“It hurts our sport that it’s going to be potentially another eight years, if not longer,” Abbott said. “Women thrive in this sport. You can be any age, size, shape, color in this sport. Softball does not discriminate and I think we deserve to be on the Olympic docket on a consistent basis.”\n\nThe IOC is aware of the concerns of those sports and the effects their status in the Olympics can have on funding and development, McConnell said, but offering flexibility to host cities is more important.\n\n“If we don’t do it that way, it means that a sport coming in is effectively committed to being in there and that makes the barrier to coming in even higher,” he said.\n\nSoftball may well get its chance on the Olympic stage again.\n\nLos Angeles is hosting in 2028, and softball – paired with baseball – seems a likely fit for those Games. So too do skateboarding, which originated in Southern California, and surfing.\n\n“The camaraderie between us is unmatched with any other sport,” said American skateboarder Cory Juneau, a bronze medalist in men’s park. “I think it would be crazy if it wasn’t in future Olympic Games.”\n\nOfficials from World Lacrosse, whose CEO is former U.S. Olympic Committee leader Jim Scherr, have said publicly they’d like to get their sport in the Los Angeles Games, and the international federation was granted full recognition in July.\n\nLos Angeles 2028 declined a request to discuss what sports could enter the program.

Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nOnly 17 days after the July 26-Aug. 11 Paris Olympics, the Place de la Concorde will then take center stage for the unprecedented opening ceremony of the Aug. 28-Sept. 8 Paralympics.\n\nInternational Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons predicted a ceremony that will be “a thing of beauty, and a once-in-a-lifetime event that will go down in all our histories.”\n\n“This festival of inclusion all begins with the truly unique experience of thousands of Paralympians parading down the world’s most famous avenue. What an amazing thrill it’s going to be to enter the Champs-Elysées and then make the journey down to Place de la Concorde, all the while being framed by the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre,” he said in remarks distributed by 2024 organizers.\n\nOrganizers said space will be made at the ceremony for 65,000 people — equivalent to the crowd at a large Olympic stadium.\n\nFrench Paralympic and Sports Committee president Marie-Amélie Le Fur said breaking free of stadium confines “is a revolution.”\n\n“Going down the Champs-Elysées to Place de la Concorde and sharing this with nearly 65,000 people, in the heart of the capital, will be a historic moment,\" she said. “It’s unheard of.\"\n\nAbout 30,000 of those in attendance will be able to watch the ceremony for free.\n\nThe venue choice is part of a massive effort by Paris organizers to free the Olympics and Paralympics from the shackles of traditional sports venues and turn the French capital into a giant playground for sport during the Games, with the Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and other landmarks used as competition venues.\n\nThe concept — encapsulated in the official slogan, “Games Wide Open” — is not without risk. The use of city sites as venues poses security, transport and logistical challenges.\n\nThe Olympic opening ceremony will also break with tradition, taking to the waters of the Seine instead of being held in a stadium.\n\nBoats will parade the 10,500 athletes on the waterway from east to west. Organizers are planning for at least 600,000 spectators, most of them ticketless and watching for free, and are billing it as the largest opening ceremony in Olympic history.\n\nThe opening and closing ceremonies for both the Olympics and Paralympics will be directed by prize-winning French theater director Thomas Joly.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/21/tour-de-france-paris-2024-summer-olympics-time-trial/74311023007/", "title": "Why Tour de France won't finish in Paris due to 2024 Summer ...", "text": "For the first time since 1905, the nearly month-long Tour de France will not end in Paris.\n\nThe 21-day race will cover 2,173 miles from its start on June 29 from a new location in Florence, Italy, for the first time.

Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nWhy is Russia banned from Olympics?\n\nThe IOC banned Russia from competition for invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, a \"blatant violation\" of the Olympic Truce, which begins seven days before the start of the Olympics and ends seven days after the conclusion of the Paralympics to ensure safe passage for all athletes. (The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing started Feb. 4 and the Paralympics ran through March 13.) Belarus faced the same penalty for its support of Russia.\n\nThe sanctions, which were placed against Russia and Belarus in February 2022, were confirmed by the Olympic Summit in December 2022 and remain in place today.\n\nRussians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics while serving a two-year suspension for a state-sponsored doping program. But the ROC was suspended in October for breaching the Olympic Charter by violating \"the territorial integrity of the (National Olympic Committee) of Ukraine.\"\n\nCan Russians compete at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nYes and no. Although teams of athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport are not allowed to compete, Russian and Belarusian competitors can participate in individual sports as neutral athletes if they meet \"strict eligibility conditions,\" the IOC announced in December.\n\nIn order to be cleared to compete as an Individual Neutral Athlete, competitors cannot support the war or have been contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military, in addition to meeting all anti-doping requirements. The Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel, which was formed by the IOC in March, determined each athlete's eligibility.\n\nWhat will Russians be called at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nIndividually cleared athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, or AINs, an acronym for the French translation, Athlètes Individuels Neutres.\n\nYou will not see Russia's flag or hear the country's national anthem during the Olympics. \"No flag, anthem, colours or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\" according to the IOC. Instead, AINs will compete under a teal flag inscribed with its acronym and an anthem with no lyrics will be used at medal ceremonies.\n\nHow many Individual Neutral Athletes will compete at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nAs of July 9, 36 individual Russian athletes have been invited to participate at the 2024 Olympics in Paris across seven sports, including cycling, gymnastics, wrestling, tennis, canoe, judo and swimming. Only 16 of those Russian athletes have accepted the invitation to compete as an AINs.

At the time, the Olympics was undergoing fundamental changes, shifting from a strictly amateur event to one that allowed professional athletes to compete (the 1992 Games, perhaps most famously, featured the \"Dream Team\").\n\nGiven that switch, FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, put various barriers in place for players competing in the Olympics, which it didn’t want to possibly usurp the World Cup as the premier international soccer showcase. One of those measures was an age restriction. Additionally, since the Olympics are not a FIFA-sanctioned competition, club teams have the right to deny a player from taking part. Many clubs will forbid their players from competing in the Olympics and the Euros or Copa America in a single summer.\n\nThis reality makes men’s soccer drastically different than women’s soccer at the Olympics, as the women’s side has no such age limits.\n\nNot every men’s soccer player in the Olympics will be under 23 years old. Each country has up to three spots on the roster to grant to overage players.\n\nMost notably, France was potentially going to use one this year on Mbappe — but his new club team, Real Madrid, would not allow him to compete in the Olympics.\n\n\"My club's position was very clear, so from that moment on, I think I [knew] I won't be taking part in the Games,\" Mbappe said to reporters in June at Euro 2024. \"That's just the way it is, and I understand that too. I'm joining a new team in September, so it's not the best way to start an adventure. I'm going to wish this French team all the best. I'm going to watch every game. I hope they'll win the gold medal.\"\n\nREQUIRED READING:Olympic women's soccer bracket: Standings, what to know, what's next at Paris Olympics\n\nOlympic men’s soccer champions\n\nThough men’s soccer made its first appearance all the way back at the 1900 Paris Olympics, here’s a list of the gold-medal-winning countries at the Olympics since the age limit was introduced at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics:\n\n1992 : Spain\n\n: Spain 1996 : Nigeria\n\n: Nigeria 2000 : Cameroon\n\n: Cameroon 2004 : Argentina\n\n: Argentina 2008 : Argentina\n\n: Argentina 2012 : Mexico\n\n: Mexico 2016 : Brazil\n\n: Brazil 2020: Brazil\n\nBrazil, the two-time reigning gold medalist, will not participate in the men’s tournament this year.\n\nUSMNT Olympics schedule\n\nThe United States men’s national soccer team will be competing in the Olympics this year for the first time since 2008.\n\nThe Americans are in Group A of the competition, with the top two teams from the four-team pod advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament. If they win the group, they’ll play the runner-up from Group B, which includes Argentina, Morocco, Iraq and Ukraine. If they finish second, they’ll play the winner of Group B.\n\nHere’s the USMNT’s schedule for the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nWednesday, July 24 : vs. France, 3 p.m. ET\n\n: vs. France, 3 p.m. ET Saturday, July 27 : vs. New Zealand, 1 p.m. ET\n\n: vs. New Zealand, 1 p.m. ET Tuesday, July 30: vs. Guinea, 1 p.m. ET\n\nUSMNT Olympics roster\n\nGiven the age restrictions, the USMNT roster doesn’t feature many of the team’s most familiar names, be it Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna or Weston McKennie.\n\nTwo of the Americans’ exceptions went to players from the current USMNT roster – defenders Walker Zimmerman and Miles Robinson. The third and final exception was used on Djordje Mihailovic, a standout midfielder for the Colorado Rapids of MLS.\n\nHere’s a look at the full 18-player USMNT roster for the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nPatrick Schulte\n\nGaga Slonina\n\nDefenders\n\nMaximilian Dietz\n\nNathan Harriel\n\nMiles Robinson\n\nJohn Tolkin\n\nCaleb Wiley\n\nWalker Zimmerman\n\nMidfielders\n\nGianluca Busio\n\nBenjamin Cremaschi\n\nJack McGlynn\n\nDjordje Mihailovic\n\nTanner Tessmann\n\nForwards", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/us-athletes-2024-paris-olympics/74329338007/", "title": "How many US athletes are competing at 2024 Paris Olympics?", "text": "Editor’s note:FollowOlympics opening ceremony live updates.\n\nThere will be hundreds of Americans competing for gold at 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThousands of athletes qualify for the Olympics every four years, but no country sends more than the United States.

To qualify as \"neutral athletes,\" those with Russian or Belarusian passports will be required to meet a list of conditions, including that they refrain from signaling any support for the war.\n\n“We do not punish or sanction athletes for the acts of their officials or government,\" IOC president Thomas Bach said in October, repeating the organization's long-held stance.\n\nThis will be the fourth consecutive Olympics at which Russia is technically barred, but its athletes are welcomed under a different name. In 2018, it was \"Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR).\" In 2021 and 2022, athletes technically represented the \"Russian Olympic Committee (ROC)\" rather than the nation itself.\n\nThis time, the ROC itself is under suspension after it attempted to incorporate sports organizations from an illegally annexed part of Ukraine.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe IOC's decision drew immediate backlash from Ukraine. Vadym Gutzeit, the president of the country's Olympic committee, said in a statement that the news came one day after he reiterated to Olympic leaders that Ukraine did not believe any Russian or Belarusian athletes should participate in the Games.\n\n\"Together with partner countries, we fought on the diplomatic front so that this decision was not approved,\" Gutzeit said. \"Despite all efforts made, despite the numerous military and civilian casualties, destruction of infrastructure and occupied territories, our voice has not been heard.\"\n\nUkraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken an even stronger stance on the issue, saying in January that \"it is obvious that any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood.\"\n\n\"There is no such thing as neutrality when a war like this is going on,\" Zelenskyy said in a taped speech at the time.\n\nUkrainian leaders have previously left open the possibility that the country could boycott the Paris Games, if Russian athletes were allowed to compete.\n\nThe news also did not receive a warm reception in Russia, where government leaders have said they think their athletes are being unfairly targeted. The country's sports minister, Oleg Matytsin, said Friday that the IOC's decision was detrimental to the Olympic movement but that Russian athletes will still compete and have the nation's support.\n\n\"We always root for ours,\" he said, according to Russian news agency, Tass. \"These are our athletes, members of our sports family, a product of our sports system − no matter how they tried to shred it, to create a split within Russian society, to pit some athletes against others.\"\n\nThe IOC outlined a path earlier this year for Russian athletes to return to elite international competition but repeatedly punted on a final decision for the 2024 Paris Olympics, saying it would only make a determination when \"the time is right.\" That time apparently arrived in the late-afternoon hours in Lausanne, where the organization is based.\n\nThe IOC's decision does come with caveats. Russia and Belarus will not be permitted to field teams in any team sports, and their individual athletes will only be allowed to compete in sports where the international federation has allowed them to compete in qualifying events, like fencing and swimming. The international federations in other sports, like track and field, have maintained a strict ban of Russian and Belarusian athletes since 2022.\n\n\"Only a very limited number of athletes will qualify through the existing qualification systems of the (international federations),\" the IOC said, adding that only eight Russians and three Belarusians have qualified for Paris so far.\n\nAccording to the IOC's requirements, any medals won by \"neutral athletes\" will not be included in official medal tables. Their uniforms must be white or monochromatic, with an \"AIN\" emblem. There will be no Russian or Belarusian flags raised, nor anthems played, nor political or government officials from the two countries in attendance.\n\nThe IOC has also said that Russian or Belarusian athletes who are affiliated with their country's military or \"actively support the war\" will not be eligible to compete in Paris, though there are lingering questions and concerns about how active support can be ascertained; The IOC said it will work with international federations to conduct background checks and reviews of social media activity.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/russia-athletes-competing-paris-olympics/74500145007/", "title": "Is Russia in the Olympics 2024?

Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThough Russia's previous ban was for its state-sponsored doping efforts, this punishment was levied by the International Olympic Committee following its invasion of Ukraine. And it led to a complicated, multi-layered process that would allow for the involvement of some − but not all − Russians who qualified for Paris.\n\nWhich Russian athletes will be competing in Paris in which sports, and why:\n\nHow could Russian athletes qualify for the Paris Olympics?\n\nIn short, the IOC first asked the international federation in each sport to decide whether to permit Russian athletes to compete in their events. Some federations opted for a blanket ban. Others invited Russian (and Belarusian) athletes to continue to compete.\n\nThen, in sports where those athletes were allowed to pursue Olympic qualification, the IOC created a panel to review the social media posts and activity of each athlete. Any athletes with ties to the Russian military or those who were found to have shown public support for the war in Ukraine were excluded.\n\nWill Russia compete in team sports at the Paris Olympics?\n\nNo, Russia is totally excluded from team events in all 32 sports at the 2024 Paris Olympics. This is probably most notable in fencing and gymnastics, where athletes representing \"the Russian Olympic Committee\" won multiple team golds at the previous Summer Games in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nWill Russian athletes compete in gymnastics, swimming or track and field?\n\nThere will be almost no Russian presence in these three sports, which are generally considered to be among the most popular at the Summer Olympics. The only exceptions are Anzhela Bladtceva in women's trampoline and swimmer Evgenii Somov, who is slated to compete in the men's 50-meter freestyle and 100-meter breaststroke.\n\nWhich Russian athletes will compete at the Paris Olympics?\n\nThe full list released by the IOC, as of Saturday:\n\nCanoe/kayak (3): Aleksei Korovashkov, Zakhar Petrov and Olesia Romasenko\n\nAleksei Korovashkov, Zakhar Petrov and Olesia Romasenko Cycling - road (3): Tamara Dronova, Alena Ivanchenko and Gleb Syritsa\n\nTamara Dronova, Alena Ivanchenko and Gleb Syritsa Gymnastics - trampoline (1): Anzhela Bladtceva\n\nAnzhela Bladtceva Swimming (1): Evgenii Somov\n\nEvgenii Somov Tennis (7): Ekaterina Aleksandrova, Mirra Andreeva, Pavel Kotov, Daniil Medvedev, Roman Safiullin, Diana Shnaider and Elena Vesnina\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/02/paris-olympics-gender-parity-competitors/74284825007/", "title": "2024 Paris Olympics will be first Olympics to achieve gender parity ...", "text": "Women were not allowed to compete at the Olympic Games until the 1900 Paris Olympics. Now, 124 years later, female athletes will make history in the same city at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nReflecting over a century of progress, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has allocated its approximately 10,500-athlete quota spaces equally among men and women for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This milestone marks the first time in history an equal number of men and women will compete at the Olympics.\n\n“We are about to celebrate one of the most important moments in the history of women at the Olympic Games, and in sport overall,” said Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n“We will see the results of the enormous efforts made by the Olympic movement and female trailblazers come to life,” Bach added. “This is our contribution to a more gender-equal world.”\n\nThe number of medals available to male and female athletes will also be the most balanced in history following the addition of disciplines once only offered to men, such as the Canoe sprint and the 15,000-meter freestyle swim (one of Katie Ledecky’s most dominant events), at the Tokyo Games. Additionally, 28 of the 32 sports at the Paris Olympics will be fully gender equal.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nHowever, the number of medals awarded to female athletes will still be slightly fewer than those awarded to male athletes. The 2024 Paris Olympics will include 329 medal events — 152 for women, 157 for men, and 20 for mixed-gender teams.\n\nWomen competed in the Olympics for the first time at the 1900 Paris Games, where they represented just 2.2% of the field and were limited to just five events: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrianism and golf. Since then, female participation has steadily increased.\n\nThe 2012 London Olympics marked the first time each National Olympic Committee (NOC) sent a female athlete to the Olympics, as well as the first time women could compete in all sports with the addition of women’s boxing. Still, women comprised only 44% of the athlete field.

What are AINs? Here's what we know:\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nWhy is Russia banned from Olympics?\n\nThe IOC banned Russia from competition for invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, a \"blatant violation\" of the Olympic Truce, which begins seven days before the start of the Olympics and ends seven days after the conclusion of the Paralympics to ensure safe passage for all athletes. (The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing started Feb. 4 and the Paralympics ran through March 13.) Belarus faced the same penalty for its support of Russia.\n\nThe sanctions, which were placed against Russia and Belarus in February 2022, were confirmed by the Olympic Summit in December 2022 and remain in place today.\n\nRussians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics while serving a two-year suspension for a state-sponsored doping program. But the ROC was suspended in October for breaching the Olympic Charter by violating \"the territorial integrity of the (National Olympic Committee) of Ukraine.\"\n\nCan Russians compete at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nYes and no. Although teams of athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport are not allowed to compete, Russian and Belarusian competitors can participate in individual sports as neutral athletes if they meet \"strict eligibility conditions,\" the IOC announced in December.\n\nIn order to be cleared to compete as an Individual Neutral Athlete, competitors cannot support the war or have been contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military, in addition to meeting all anti-doping requirements. The Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel, which was formed by the IOC in March, determined each athlete's eligibility.\n\nWhat will Russians be called at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nIndividually cleared athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, or AINs, an acronym for the French translation, Athlètes Individuels Neutres.\n\nYou will not see Russia's flag or hear the country's national anthem during the Olympics. \"No flag, anthem, colours or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\" according to the IOC. Instead, AINs will compete under a teal flag inscribed with its acronym and an anthem with no lyrics will be used at medal ceremonies.\n\nHow many Individual Neutral Athletes will compete at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nAs of July 9, 36 individual Russian athletes have been invited to participate at the 2024 Olympics in Paris across seven sports, including cycling, gymnastics, wrestling, tennis, canoe, judo and swimming. Only 16 of those Russian athletes have accepted the invitation to compete as an AINs. In comparison, the Russian delegation sent 335 athletes to Tokyo in 2021, while Belarus sent 104.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/01/us-olympic-womens-gymnastics-team-picked/74265360007/", "title": "Inside how US Olympic women's gymnastics team for Paris Games ...", "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — The U.S. gymnastics selection committee had only 25 minutes Sunday night to pick the five members of the women's team that it would send to the Paris Olympics.\n\nIt's seems like a distressingly brief window of time. But Alicia Sacramone Quinn said the committee members ultimately didn't even need all of it.\n\nThe decisions, she said, were made in 10 or maybe 15 minutes.\n\n\"Honestly, it was a pretty cut-and-dry, easy decision,\" said Quinn, the women's strategic lead for USA Gymnastics.\n\nBy easy, of course, Quinn means it was straightforward. Emotionally, as with any decision that could mean crushing an athlete's Olympic dreams, it was taxing.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

So that gets hard,\" Quinn added. \"But I think we went by team scenarios and what we saw in the numbers and it just made sense.\"\n\nAfter weeks and months of prognosticating and number-crunching, two nights of competition at the U.S. Olympic trials in Minneapolis − and, unfortunately, a string of serious injuries that knocked out three of the top contenders − there was one clear answer to the committee's Paris puzzle. The team includes a quartet of veterans who competed at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics − Simone Biles, Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey − plus a 16-year-old newbie, Hezly Rivera. Joscelyn Roberson and Leanne Wong will serve as traveling alternates.\n\nTHE GOAT:Simone Biles earned this US Olympic gymnastics team spot, and she deserves this happiness\n\nQuinn, who is one of three members on the selection committee, said earlier this week that the committee would not automatically take the top-five athletes from the all-around competition. But that's how it worked out, largely because the fifth-place finisher, Rivera, has strengths in events where the rest of the team has weaknesses.\n\n\"That fifth spot kind of came down to what we felt like we were lacking as a team, and that was bars and beam,\" Quinn said. \"Hezly really just delivered tonight, putting up two great scores. And we went back and compared her start value, her execution, and we felt like she'd be a good person to fill that last spot.\"\n\nAt the Paris Games, which begin July 26, the team competition in women's gymnastics consists of two rounds. In qualifying, each country will pick four of its five athletes to compete on each apparatus − vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise − and then drop the lowest score on each. In the final, each country gets only three athletes per apparatus − and every score counts toward the team total.\n\nBecause of that format, the athletes, coaches and selection committee all more or less understood how athletes' performances on certain events would impact the shaping of the team.\n\nCarey, for example, knew she needed to put up big scores on her two best events: Floor exercise and vault. For Rivera, it was about balance beam and uneven bars.\n\n\"Bars and beam are definitely what I think I can contribute to the team,\" said Rivera, who is on track to be the youngest member of Team USA in any sport. \"When I hit bars and beam, I kind of knew, yeah, I have a shot.\"\n\nFor the U.S. men's gymnastics team, which was selected Saturday, U.S. leaders locked in the best team using a computer program that calculated the best possible team scores. The women's team selection, meanwhile, was at the discretion of the committee, which includes Tatiana Perskaia and Jessie DeZiel alongside Quinn.\n\nInjuries to Skye Blakely, Kayla DiCello and Shilese Jones only further muddled the process. Blakely and DiCello, who finished second and third, respectively, at nationals about a month ago, both ruptured an Achilles tendon this week. And Jones technically could have been selected to the team despite sustaining a knee injury in warmups Friday night, though Quinn said the medical staff cautioned Jones against continuing to compete.\n\n\"It would not have been in her best interest, for her health, to do it,\" Quinn said. \"And I know that was one of the questions she asked, she was like, '(What) if I brace up?' And we're like, the medical staff (recommended) yeah, it's not worth your health.\"\n\nThe injuries to three Team USA hopefuls made for a stressful first day of trials, Quinn said, after which the selection committee met for a dry run − trying to see what would happen if they picked them team after Friday's competition. \"We did not make it in 25 minutes,\" Quinn said.\n\nShe and technical lead Chellsie Memmel didn't know specifically what scores they were looking for, and on which events, until Sunday. Quinn said the two women spoke and sent messages to one another constantly as the competition unfolded, ensuring they were on the same page.\n\n\"There were a few moments where we were like, 'Oh well, maybe this could work.' We're just plugging in different scenarios,\" Quinn said. \"Honestly the numbers help, because if this was a projected team, your score would be X, Y, Z. So kind of the judges dictate this for us a little bit.\"\n\nWhen competition ended Sunday night, the athletes were whisked away into a room in the bowels of Target Center, waiting for the word on the committee's decision. Yet as they left the floor, the decision had already more or less been made.\n\n\"I think being prepared helped. Knowing what types of results and sheets we wanted in front of us helped,\" Quinn said.\n\n\"It ended up working out just fine.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/sports-at-2024-paris-olympics/74282616007/", "title": "What sports are at 2024 Paris Olympics?

Russia's absence from Games ...", "text": "Editor’s note: FollowOlympic opening ceremony live updates.\n\nRussian athletes have competed under several different names at the Olympics over the years and they will use another at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nAt the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag as the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) delegation after the country was implicated in a state-sponsored doping program at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency banned Russia from all international sports in 2019 for four years for tampering with drug-testing data. Russia filed an appeal and the Court of Arbitration for Sport subsequently reduced the ban to two years in 2020 and allowed Russians to compete without their country's name and flag. Instead, Russian athletes participated under the acronym ROC at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nBut there won't be a ROC or OAR delegation, or the Russian Federation, at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Russian athletes will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris after Russia and Belarus were banned and the ROC was suspended for Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

We got you covered.\n\nWhat does ROC stand for at Olympics?\n\nROC, which stands for the Russian Olympic Committee, is the National Olympic Committee representing Russia. Stanislav Pozdnyakov, a four-time Olympic Gold medal fencer from Russia, has served as the President of the ROC since 2018 after he was recommended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe ROC flag features the Olympic flames in Russia’s national colors – white, blue and red – over the iconic Olympic Rings. The ROC national anthem, used in Tokyo in 2021 and Being in 2022, is a segment of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's \"Piano Concerto No. 1.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nWhy isn’t ROC being used at Paris Olympics?\n\nThe International Olympic Committee suspended the ROC in October for breaching the Olympic Charter. Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the ROC transferred four Ukraine regions (Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia) into the ROC, violating \"the territorial integrity of the NOC of Ukraine.\" As a result, the ROC cannot operate as a NOC or receive funding from the Olympic movement.\n\nMORE:Why is Russia banned from Paris Olympics? Can Russian athletes compete?\n\nWhat are Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs)?\n\nAthletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport can participate in individual sports as Individual Neutral Athletes, or AINs, an acronym for the French translation, Athlètes Individuels Neutres, if they meet \"strict eligibility conditions.\" Competitors cannot support the war or have been contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military in order to be cleared to compete as AINs. They must also meet all anti-doping requirements.\n\nPARIS OLYMPICS:Pro-war Russian athletes allowed to compete despite ban, group says\n\nCan AINs use Russian flag at Olympics?\n\nNo. Russia's flag and national anthem cannot be used in Paris. \"No flag, anthem, colours or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\" the IOC stated. AINs will compete under a teal flag inscribed with its acronym and an anthem that features no lyrics.\n\nCan AINs attend the opening ceremony?\n\nTeams of athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport are not allowed to compete at the 2024 Olympics. Therefore, AINs are not allowed to participate in the opening ceremony's parade of nations along the Seine River \"since they are individual athletes,\" the IOC stated in March. \"This is the same scenario that was used for the Independent Olympic Participants at the Olympic Games Barcelona 1992 (from former Yugoslavia),\" the IOC added.\n\nAINs will have the opportunity to experience the opening ceremony and a decision about their participation in the closing ceremony will be made at a later date.\n\nWill AINs be on the medal count at the Olympics?\n\nAny medals won by AINs won't be included in the official medal count of nations.\n\nHow many AINs will compete at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nA total of 36 individual Russian athletes have been invited to participate at the 2024 Olympics in Paris across seven sports, including cycling, gymnastics, wrestling, tennis, canoe, judo and swimming, but only 15 accepted the invitation to compete as an AINs.

What ...", "text": "Winning an Olympic gold medal can be life-changing.\n\nDepending on the athlete's nationality, it can also be pretty lucrative.\n\nAthletes who win individual gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics while representing Malaysia, Morocco, or Serbia will receive upward of $200,000 from their country's government or national Olympic committee, according to a survey of medal payouts conducted by USA TODAY Sports. At least six other countries − including Italy, which won 10 golds in Tokyo − are offering payouts north of $100,000. And some offer added perks, like apartments and vacation vouchers, or extra money if an athlete breaks an Olympic record.\n\nParticularly for athletes in less popular Olympic sports, where endorsement and sponsorship deals are harder to come by, the medal money can wind up making a huge difference.\n\n\"If I get first versus fourth in this race, which is a matter of 0.3 seconds, that determines what apartment I live in next year,\" U.S. canoe athlete Nevin Harrison said at a media event earlier this year. \"So it’s an added pressure.

Athletes will earn $37,500 for every gold medal in Paris, $22,500 for every silver and $15,000 for each bronze.\n\nThose figures are slightly below the norm, among the countries surveyed by USA TODAY Sports − though the U.S. usually has to pay out more medal bonuses because it usually wins more medals. Team USA finished atop the Tokyo Olympics medal table, for example, with 39 golds, 41 silvers and 33 bronzes.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports contacted the national Olympic committees of 40 countries to ask about their medal payouts, of which 25 responded. On average, the 25 respondents said they will pay athletes the equivalent of $95,000 for gold, $55,000 for silver and $39,000 for bronze. (The amounts are generally paid in the host country's currency but have been converted into U.S. dollars for consistency.)\n\nWhich countries pay their athletes the most for winning Olympic medals?\n\nThe two known highest-paying countries at the last Summer Olympics − Chinese Taipei and Singapore − did not respond to multiple messages seeking updated information. Singapore said it would pay an athlete $1 million if he or she won gold in Tokyo. Chinese Taipei said it would reward its lone individual gold medalist, weightlifter Hsing-Chun Kuo, with roughly $716,000.\n\nMany countries said they offer separate payout structures for medalists in team events. And some pay their athletes even if they fall shy of the podium. Germany, for example, offers payouts for anyone who finishes in fourth through eighth. Morocco has medal bonuses for gold ($200,525) and silver ($125,328) that are among the highest in USA TODAY Sports' survey, but they also offer bonuses for every placement, all the way down to those who finish 32nd.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting medal payout plan for the 2024 Games comes from Poland, which is going above and beyond as it celebrates the 100th anniversary of its first Olympic performance.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the Polish Olympic Committee, any athlete who wins a medal in Paris will receive between $39,974 (for bronze) and $64,958 (for gold) as well as an investment diamond, a vacation travel voucher for two people valued at roughly $25,000, and \"a painting painted by respected and talented Polish artists.\" (The grades of the diamonds and subjects of the paintings have not been determined.)\n\nGold medalists will also get a major added perk: A free place to live. Each Polish gold medalist will be given a two-bedroom apartment in the Warsaw metropolitan area.\n\n\"The apartments will be handed over to the medalists for use at the end of 2025 or at the beginning of 2026, so we cannot estimate their value today,\" the Polish Olympic Committee spokesperson wrote in an email. \"It will be a newly built Olympic housing estate and all Polish Olympic champions will live in the same housing estate and even in the same building.\"\n\nPoland won four gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics and two at the previous Games in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nContributing: Rachel Axon\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/15"}]}

And, no matter where you're from or what conflicts may exist outside of this moment, you can always appreciate what you're watching.\n\nPlus, you get to see a bit of the host city's culture. Did I mention pageantry and spectacle? This year's ceremony will be on the Seine River and eventually flow into the Trocadero. Visually, it'll be beautiful—and something we've literally never seen before.\n\nI truly cannot wait to watch this. I hope you're just as excited, too. Enough about that, though. Let's get you ready for the Olympics.\n\nMichelle's can't-miss pick of the weekend\n\nPARIS — Bonjour, les gagnants! The official start of the 2024 Paris Olympics is almost here, and swimming is set to kick off Saturday. And you won't want to miss the men's and women's 4x100-meter freestyle relays on Day 1.\n\nThe men’s 4x100 freestyle relay world record is one of swimming’s oldest, and it could go down Saturday.\n\nTeam USA set the record at the 2008 Beijing Olympics when American Jason Lezak became a national hero by swimming the greatest relay leg ever, overtaking the French team at the very end to win gold — one of Michael Phelps’ historic eight from those Games. But after watching the men’s 100 freestyle at U.S. Olympic trials in June, Lezak predicted the 4x100 free relay world record will fall in Paris.\n\nCullen Jones — who swam third on the relay before Lezak’s epic anchor leg — agrees.\n\n“I think this is the year,” Jones told USA TODAY Sports/For The Win about the 16-year-old world record. “I got to see Phelps in trials, and we text from time to time. But I'm like, ‘The 4x100 [freestyle] relay is looking like it's in peril with these four guys.’”\n\nThose four guys are Team USA’s Caeleb Dressel — who was on the gold medal-winning team at the 2021 Tokyo Games — Jack Alexy, Chris Guiliano and Hunter Armstrong, who are expected to compete in the fastest relay in the pool, possibly with the help of Ryan Held and Matt King in prelims.\n\n“We'll see what happens,” Jones added. “I think that they're gonna definitely be a shoe-in for first, but let's see if they can break that record.”\n\n-Michelle Martinelli 🇫🇷\n\nOver the last month or so, we've built up an archive of profiles about the athletes from Team USA you should familiarize yourself with at these Games.\n\nEach profile has five facts about the athletes, including when they begin competing at the Games this year.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nGet to know Team USA\n\nOver the last month or so, we've built up an archive of profiles of athletes from Team USA you should familiarize yourself with at these Games.\n\nEach profile has five facts about the athletes, including when they begin competing at the Games this year.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n— Sha'Carri Richardson is the fastest woman in the world.

Meyers Taylor will still be under close contact protocols, which include undergoing PCR testing every 12 hours for seven days and taking a PCR test six hours before competition.\n\nNBC’s TODAY show was the first to report that Meyers Taylor had been cleared. Monobob, the first women’s bobsled event, begins Feb. 13.\n\nMeyers Taylor is ranked No. 1 in the world in both monobob and two-man, making her a gold-medal contender in both events. But she tested positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 29, two days after she and her family arrived in Beijing.\n\nHer husband Nic Taylor, an alternate on the U.S. men’s team, and their toddler son Nico also tested positive.\n\nMeyers Taylor won silver medals as a driver in 2018 and 2014, and has a bronze medal as a brakeman from 2010.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nUSA women's hockey team routs Russia\n\nBEIJING — For two periods, the Russia Olympic Committee kept the United States women's hockey team mostly in check and entered the third period down 2-0.\n\nThen the floodgates opened.\n\nThe U.S. put three pucks in the net within the first eight minutes, 44 seconds of the third period to defeat the ROC 5-0 on Saturday at Wukesong Sports Centre.\n\nTwo minor scuffles broke out between the teams during the game.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nAmerican curlers lose to Canada\n\nItaly remained undefeated in mixed doubles curling at the Beijing Olympics with a 7-5 victory against Britain while defending gold medalist John Morris of Canada and his new partner, Rachel Homan, beat Chris Plys and Vicky Persinger 7-2 to snap the Americans’ win streak at two games.\n\nItaly’s Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini beat the British pair of Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds to improve to 6-0 in the round robin competition in the 10-team field.

But she allowed two goals on 12 shots, took a delay of game penalty and lacked sharpness.\n\nRooney dealt suffered a partially torn MCL prior to this year’s world championships.

That’s half a skate blade. Hungary earned bronze Saturday night.\n\nQu Chunyu, Fan Kexin and Ren Ziwei joined Wu for the historic victory.

Canada was penalized for pushing from behind and causing contact with Hungary.\n\nChina was the favorite coming in, having led the World Cup standings this season.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nTeam USA's Maame Biney advances in speedskating\n\nBEIJING — American short-track speedskater Maame Biney is through to the quarterfinals in the women's 500.\n\nBiney, 22, finished third in her four-woman preliminary heat Saturday but skated fast enough to advance on time. (The top two in each heat qualify automatically.) She will be joined in the next round by compatriot Kristen Santos, who won her heat by seven hundredths of a second.\n\nElsewhere, in the men's 1000m, 20-year-old Andrew Heo used patience and a late surge to claim his own quarterfinal spot in what was his Olympic debut.\n\nThe quarterfinals in both events will take place Monday.\n\n– Tom Schad\n\nOlympic record in speedskating\n\nThe Netherlands is a speedskating powerhouse and it took gold in the women’s 3,000-meter on Saturday in one of the first medal events of these Games.\n\nIrene Schouten set an Olympic record of 3:56.93, with Francesca Lollobrigida (3:58.06) of Italy taking silver and Canadian Isabelle Weidemann finishing third (3:58.64).\n\nTwo-time event champion, Germany’s Claudia Pechstein, came in last in her eighth Winter Olympics appearance.\n\nThe lone American in the event, Mia Kilburg, finished 19th out of 20 competitors.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nNorway's Therese Johaug gets first gold of Beijing Games; Jessie Diggins finishes sixth\n\nNorway's Therese Johaug won the first gold medal of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, dominating the women’s 15-kilometer skiathlon Saturday.\n\nJohaug finished in 44 minutes, 13.7 seconds Saturday, which was 30 seconds ahead of silver medalist Russia's Natalia Nepryaeva. Teresa Stadlober of Austria took the bronze.\n\nJessie Diggins finished sixth, the top American in the race.\n\nJohaug, who missed the 2018 Olympics due to a doping suspension, won the first individual Olympic gold of her career. She won silver and bronze in individual events in Sochi and a relay gold in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nFour years ago in Pyeongchang, Diggins claimed the first ever U.S. women’s Olympic gold medal in cross country skiing with teammate Kikkan Randall in the team sprint.\n\nDiggins is the most decorated American cross country skier in world championship history and last year she became the first U.S. skier to win the Tour de Ski.\n\nHer next opportunity for a medal could be Tuesday when she competes in the freestyle sprint.\n\nUS defeats China for another big mixed doubles curling win\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. mixed doubles curling team picked up another key win Saturday, defeating host China, 7-5, roughly 24 hours after squeaking out a win over Sweden.\n\nWith those two victories, the team of Vicky Persinger and Chris Plys moved to 3-2 at the midway point of round-robin play. They are now sitting in a tie for fourth place out of 10 teams, with four matches to go.\n\nThe top four teams advance to the semifinal round.\n\nPersinger and Plys' next match against Canada at 7:05 a.m. ET will be particularly pivotal, with the neighboring countries now tied for that fourth and final spot. The U.S. will then face the Czech Republic and Switzerland on Sunday, and Great Britain on Monday.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nMen’s downhill skiing training run canceled due to wind\n\nBEIJING — It’s tough to learn a new downhill course when you can’t ski it.\n\nThe third and final training run for the men’s downhill was canceled after just three skiers Saturday because of wind gusts. The forecast for Sunday’s race is more promising, referee Markus Waldner said.\n\n“Two hours before we started at 11 it was good enough to go -- similar to yesterday. Also, during the forerun -- we had five forerunners -- it was good enough to go. Safe,” Waldner said. \"But then, suddenly, wind gusts were coming. … (We decided) this is dangerous. It's unpredictable. We cannot handle this.”\n\nThe decision was criticized by some skiers, who already felt they were at a disadvantage because no one had been on the course until the first training run Thursday. There also were complaints that the three skiers who did get a run in, one of whom was gold-medal favorite Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, will have an advantage in Sunday’s race.\n\n“Of course I can accept all this criticism coming from the racers, some coaches, that this is an advantage for the three racers,” Waldner said. “But this is force majeure. We're an outdoor sport, force majeure, and we make always decisions in terms of safety.\n\n“Due to safety we made this decision, very simple.\"\n\nNormally, skiers are able to familiarize themselves with the Olympic course at test events ahead of the Games, but those were canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With Thursday the first time they could ski the course, many used their initial training run to simply take mental stock, noting the terrain, turns and jumps on the run. The remaining two runs would then be used to build speed and find areas where they could be aggressive.\n\nBut they’ll have to make do with what they got Thursday and Friday.\n\nBryce Bennett, the top-ranked American in the downhill this season, said he didn’t have a problem with the decision to cancel. In some ways, he said, it worked out better.\n\n“For me, personally, three training runs is difficult. I think it’s too much,” Bennett said. “You kind of get lackadaisical.\n\n“We got some good inspections,” he added. “I got two inspections today, and I think it’ll work out for the better, hopefully, tomorrow. Pray to God I don’t get a headwind. Praying for a tailwind.”\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nCross-country skier Jessie Diggins has a fan in Mikaela Shiffrin\n\nBEIJING — Jessie Diggins has a fan in Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\nAsked Friday if there was another U.S. athlete she’d like to watch, the two-time Olympic champion named Diggins. Shiffrin said she and her parents were captivated four years ago as they sat in their hotel and watched Diggins and Kikkan Randall win gold in the team sprint at the Pyeongchang Olympics.\n\nIt was the first gold medal for the United States in cross-country skiing, and the first medal of any color in the sport since 1976.\n\n\"We watched the, 'Here comes Diggins! Here comes Diggins!’\" Shiffrin recalled, referring to NBC commentator Chad Salmela’s exuberant reaction when Diggins caught and passed Sweden’s Stina Nilsson down the stretch.\"\n\nDiggins begins competition at the Beijing Olympics on Saturday with the skiathlon, which combines classic and freestyle skiing.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nJamie Anderson, two other Americans make women's snowboard slopestyle final\n\nBEIJING — Snowboarder Jamie Anderson is in fifth place after the snowboard slopestyle qualification, leading the way for the U.S. women. The two-time reigning and defending gold medalist scored a 74.35 on her first run, good for a second-place ranking. Her next run was clean until the final moments when she fell.\n\n“I definitely was hoping to get that second run, but I’ll take what I can get,” Anderson told NBC. “I’m excited for tomorrow.”\n\nFellow American Julia Marino redeemed herself on her second run with a score of 71.78 and sixth place. Rounding out the Americans competing in the final is Hailey Langland in ninth after a clean second run that scored a 68.71. The top 12 advance.\n\nTeam USA’s Courtney Rummel finished 18th with a best score of 48.30 and will miss the final.\n\nThe final is scheduled to begin Saturday at 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\n— Alex Ptachick\n\nIOC, Beijing 2022 shrug at Uyghur athlete's inclusion in opening ceremony\n\nBEIJING — Representatives from the International Olympic Committee and 2022 Beijing organizing committee on Saturday downplayed the inclusion of a Uyghur athlete in the opening ceremony for the Games.\n\nChang Yu, the director of Beijing 2022's ceremonies department, said cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang was selected to help light the torch as part of a generational concept involving athletes born in different decades.\n\nYilamujiang, 20, hails from the Xinjiang region, where China has been accused of detaining up to one million people in what the U.S. government has deemed \"genocide.\"\n\nIOC president Thomas Bach has previously declined to answer questions about China's treatment of Uyghurs, characterizing it as a political issue outside of the IOC's scope. When asked Saturday about Yilamujiang's role in lighting the torch, and whether the IOC consulted on the decision, spokesperson Mark Adams demurred.\n\n\"Obviously the opening ceremony is something that the organizing committee put together,\" Adams said. \"We are involved to a certain extent. But I just would go back to what I said earlier, that this is an athlete who is competing here. She has every right – wherever she comes from, whatever her background – to compete. And she has every right – whatever her background, wherever she comes from – to take part in the opening ceremony.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nCan Jessie Diggins take home another cross country skiing medal for Team USA?\n\nAmerican cross country skiing star Jessie Diggins is back for her third Olympics, and her first event is just hours away.\n\nThis time she’s 30 years old, expecting to marry her sweetheart Wade Poplawski, maybe in May. Diggins is a veteran of 240 World Cup races and an Olympic gold medalist. She’s a leader of Team USA and hype girl for her youngest teammates.\n\nShe’s poised, always with an eye on the big picture, and impressive in everything she does, from skiing to speaking to bridging groups and causes with friends and newcomers.\n\nShe’s also something else: Team USA's vulnerable, honest, unfiltered badass. Diggins has written a memoir — \"Brave Enough\" — in which she details her life and career, including her admission and treatment for disordered eating.\n\nDiggins won Olympic gold in the women's team sprint with her teammate Kikkan Randall in the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics and competed in six events there: team sprint, pursuit, individual sprint individual start, mass start and relay.\n\nHer first event in Beijing is Saturday's skiathlon, which will air live on USA.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nIOC calls security guard grabbing TV journalist an 'unfortunate incident'\n\nA Dutch television journalist was confronted by a Chinese security guard while on live TV on Friday, in what the IOC described as an \"unfortunate incident.\"\n\nA clip of the incident shows the journalist, Sjoerd den Daas of NOS Media, being pulled away while trying to deliver a report. IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said the organization had been in communication with NOS Media about the incident.\n\n\"I think someone was being overzealous,\" Adams said. \"(The reporter) was able very quickly afterwards, with the help of officials there, to do his piece to camera, his standup.\n\n\"These things do happen. I think it's a one-off. I hope it's a one-off. We assure you that within the closed loop, you'll be able to carry on your work.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nHow does scoring work in freeskiing and snowboarding?\n\nIn freeskiing and snowboarding, scores mean nothing – well, almost. Rather, the numbers are more of a proxy for athletes’ ranking and less tied to specific tricks in their run, for example, than their overall performance.\n\nJudging for both sports is mostly done by a panel of six international judges, with the highest and lowest scores being dropped.\n\nUnlike other sports, such as gymnastics, there are not component scores. A certain trick does not have a set value. Judges are scoring out of 100 based on overall impression and basically ranking from there.\n\nExecution is critical and can include several things, such as how cleanly athletes are landing tricks, how long they hold their grabs or how long they ride a rail. Difficulty can help an athlete stand out, especially by doing tricks that are harder than their competitors or that have never been done before.\n\nOften runs including tricks with more flips or a higher degree of rotation will be scored higher. Judges will also consider progression, and variety matters too.\n\nFreeskiing and snowboarding have been among the United States’ most successful sports in recent Olympics.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nAnderson seeking third consecutive gold in slopestyle snowboarding\n\nZHANGJIAKOU – Snowboarder Jamie Anderson went back and forth on whether or not to come to these Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nThe pandemic, the restrictions, the COVID testing – it just piled on the pressure of someone who already feels it as the USA’s two-time Olympic gold medalist in women's slopestyle snowboarding.\n\n“It’s definitely a more complicated Olympics. Going to the Olympics is very stressful and you have so much on your plate,” Anderson said at a news conference in the Olympic Village. “And this year it has been an absolute nightmare. Just everything from getting here, I think all of us in the last few months – I was really struggling with everything it took to get here.\n\nBut all it took was the very first day on the snow Wednesday for practice runs to reassure her that she made the right decision.\n\nThe slopestyle course is massive, and Anderson, 31, said it reminds her of her first Olympics in Sochi where everything was gigantic and intimidating.\n\n“It’s pretty gnarly,\" Anderson said. \"What’s cool about the Olympics compared to any other event is it’s always on a completely new mountain and completely new setup.”\n\nAnderson will make her first runs on the slopestyle course when women's qualifying begins at 9:45 p.m. ET (USA Network).\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nBrennan: China continues its political charade at opening ceremony\n\nBEIJING – Neither a raging global pandemic nor worldwide concern over China’s awful human rights abuses could stop Beijing from throwing itself a party Friday night at its “Bird’s Nest” National Stadium.\n\nCompared to the last time Beijing gave us an opening ceremony, 14 years ago for the Summer Olympics, it was a muted effort with far fewer spectators, athletes and diplomats. It also was about 70 degrees colder than that sweltering night in August 2008, when the air was so heavy with Beijing’s gritty smog that black residue could be scraped off the skin. This time, it was just bitter cold.\n\nSo, for the second Olympics in a row, Beijing organizers created a grand illusion. They sure know how to put on a light show on a stadium floor. If only they were as good at things like freedom of speech and avoiding genocide.\n\n— Christine Brennan\n\nWatch the Beijing opening ceremony again ... or for the first time\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony aired lived in the United States early Friday morning, but NBC knows not everyone is an early bird. The network will re-broadcast the Beijing opening ceremony beginning at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nThe ceremony opened with fireworks, a lights show and ended with ice hockey players breaking a block of ice to reveal the Olympic rings. Snowflakes with the names of participating countries were held high in front of the large Olympic Rings.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and IOC President Thomas Bach were in the stands alongside a smaller-than-usual crowd restricted due to COVID-19 regulations.\n\nAs is tradition, home country dignitaries and Games organizers will give speeches prior to The Delegations Parade. The first nation to enter the stadium will be Greece, followed by all other delegations in the IOC Protocol order, alphabetically by the language of the host country. Italy (as the next Winter Olympic Games host nation) and the host country China will enter last. The U.S. delegation is No. 56, after Bulgaria.\n\nSkiing star Mikaela Shiffrin relishes the racing as much as the results\n\nMake no mistake: Mikaela Shiffrin wants to win.\n\nFor Shiffrin, though, winning is the byproduct. Like the student who relishes the grind more than the grade, she is more interested in the things that go into making her one of the best ski racers of all time.\n\nThat that painstaking attention to the details – what others might consider drudgery -- has resulted in Winter Olympic gold medals, world titles and international commercial appeal is just a bonus.\n\n“The overarching thing that allows me to ski fast and be one of the best racers in the world and get all the titles and all of these things that feel really great and make you feel like you’re a hero and you're on top of the world and all that, the thing that lets me do it is skiing well. And that's the thing that I actually enjoy doing,” Shiffrin told USA TODAY.\n\nShiffrin will be making her Beijing Olympics debut on Monday, Feb. 7, in the women's giant slalom, where she will seek to defend her 2018 gold medal.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nU.S. snowboarders, freeskiers get new threads\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – The U.S. freeski and snowboard teams will have a different look for the Beijing Olympics thanks to new uniform providers.\n\nSince the 2018 Games, the teams have switched to Spyder and Volcom, respectively, from their longtime partners The North Face and Burton.\n\nThis year’s uniforms come with distinct looks for each, offering edgier patterns and multiple layering options that lean less into Americana themes than recent uniforms.\n\nThe freeskiing uniforms feature large white and blue color blocks with red accents. The uniforms include jackets, hoodies and reversible vests that allow the athletes to tailor their looks. Uniforms for both teams are created with tech fabrics designed to help athletes keep warm and perform in competition.\n\nThe snowboarding uniforms feature five different kits that allow for a layering and a variety of looks. They include a collage print that Volcom intends as a tribute “to the storied history of the legends who have made the Volcom brand what it is today,” and each includes a lucky faux rabbit foot for good luck.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nNBC is walking a tightrope at the Beijing Games. The network is covering sports on ice and snow — and news on human rights and genocide.\n\nOne of the athletes to light the flame at the opening ceremony is Uyghur, China’s Muslim ethnic minority who are victims of genocide, according to the United States; that is one of the reasons that the U.S. is boycotting these Games diplomatically.\n\nMike Tirico, NBC’s Olympics host, quickly noted the significance of the flame lighting during the live broadcast of the opening ceremony, which aired on Friday morning in the U.S., and which will repeat Friday evening. “Of course, those are the people from the region of Northwest China that have attracted so much attention in the conversation of human rights,” Tirico said, reporting from the scene.\n\n– Erik Brady\n\nWhat to know about the 2022 Olympics\n\nLess than six months after the Summer Games in Tokyo ended, the Winter Games in Beijing open. Getting underway in full on Saturday, there's a lot of questions surrounding these Olympics.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Nancy Armour broke down everything you need to know, from \"why Beijing?\" to all the must-watch Team USA stars:\n\nQ: Are there new sports or events?\n\nA: Yes! Seven of them. Monobob has been added for women’s bobsled, and there is men’s and women’s Big Air in freestyle skiing. There are four new mixed-team events, in snowboard cross, aerials, short-track speedskating and ski jumping.\n\nU.S. figure skaters off to good start\n\nThe United States won the men's short program and rhythm dance and are in first place after the day's team competition. Nathan Chen hit a new personal record of 111.71 in the short program to pace the Americans. The Russian Olympic Committee sits in second place, and China is in third.

The Belgian fencer who took the Olympic oath to compete “in a spirit of chivalry, for the honor of our country and for the glory of sport” was Victor Boin, an air force pilot, flanked by two soldiers.\n\nMany Olympians from the last games in 1912 had been killed or wounded during the war, when amateur gentleman athletes flocked to serve as military officers. Yet more athletes were killed by the Spanish Flu pandemic that ravaged the world soon after.\n\nIn Antwerp a new generation of athletes came to the fore. The Olympics were still very much centered on white, male athletes from privileged backgrounds, but times were slowly changing.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nFemale athletes overcame social disapproval and resistance from some Olympic officials to compete, and Japan won the first medals for an independent Asian nation.\n\nLENGLEN CHUNK\n\nOf the approximately 2,600 athletes, only about 60 were women. But French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen transcended the Olympics as an international star.\n\nNicknamed “La Divine,” she was a national hero and a household name around the world. The women's trophy at the French Open and the second-largest court both bear her name.\n\nIn Antwerp, Lenglen didn't drop a game in her first three singles matches and didn't drop a set all tournament in her run to the gold medal. She added gold in the mixed doubles and bronze in the women's doubles.\n\nIllness meant Lenglen couldn't defend her title on home soil at the next Olympics in Paris in 1924, the last time the sport would be on the program until 1988.\n\nTennis in Antwerp was also a breakthrough for diversity, as Japan won its first medals. Ichiya Kumagae won silver in men's singles and added a doubles silver with Seiichiro Kashio. No independent Asian country had won a medal before, though India had won two silvers in 1900 under British rule.\n\nICELAND ON ICE\n\nThe Winter Olympics were yet to be invented, so ice hockey joined the Games in a program otherwise packed with summer sports. Canada won the inaugural men's hockey gold medal, but it was a Canadian team with a twist.\n\nTeam Canada was actually the Winnipeg Falcons, an amateur team set up by Icelandic immigrants. Their name was taken from a falcon on Iceland's old coat of arms at a time when it was still part of Denmark.\n\nWith future two-time Stanley Cup winner Frank Fredrickson as captain, the Falcons demolished the opposition in Antwerp, beating Czechoslovakia 15-0, the United States 2-0. The Falcons' shutout run ended in the gold-medal game against Sweden but they still won 12-1.\n\nHockey and figure skating were held a full four months before the other sports in an Antwerp rink called the Ice Palace. The International Olympic Committee drew on that experience when it created an “international winter sports week” in Chamonix, France, in 1924. That was later officially recognized as the first Winter Olympics.\n\nFLYING FINNS\n\nThese days Finland is best known for its hockey players and cross-country skiers, but in 1920 it was the undisputed distance-running superpower.\n\nHannes Kolehmainen had won three gold medals in 1912 and cemented his place in history by winning the 1920 marathon in world record time despite heavy rain making the course muddy. Antwerp was the year when Kolehmainen metaphorically passed the torch to another all-time great, his fellow Finn Paavo Nurmi. Aged 23, Nurmi won three gold medals in Antwerp and would later win six more.\n\nWhen Finland held the Olympics in 1952, Nurmi passed the torch back — literally. Nurmi carried the Olympic torch into the stadium in Helsinki during the opening ceremony and handed it over for Kolehmainen to light the flame.\n\nALONE ON THE WATER\n\nMost Olympic champions need training, determination and luck to win the gold. In 1920 it was enough just to turn up.\n\nNorwegian sailors won five gold medals in Antwerp completely unopposed after no other crews entered their events. They still had to sail out alone on the water, round the buoys and cross the line without sinking to earn a gold medal.\n\nOut of 13 different sailing competitions, only one featured more than three boats, meaning almost everyone went home with a medal. One event was a shootout between two Dutch crews, who were allowed to finish off the contest back home in the Netherlands.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/07/22/ned-gourdin-record-long-jump-highlights-jacksonville-olympics-legacy-track/7076562002/", "title": "Ned Gourdin's record long jump highlights Jacksonville's Olympic ...", "text": "Before there was Caeleb Dressel and before there was Ryan Murphy, swimming to the pinnacle of their sport...\n\nBefore even Bob Hayes raced to the title of world's fastest man in 1964...\n\nBefore all of them, there was Ned Gourdin, a graduate of Stanton who rewrote the record book with a track and field feat once thought impossible.\n\nFriday's Olympic opening ceremony in Tokyo marks the 100-year mark of a milestone on the track, a day when Jacksonville made its mark on the athletic stage before an international audience.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Gourdin made his name as the greatest to date in the long jump, becoming the first man to surpass 25 feet.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

About 18,000 died in the tragedy,\n\nThe first runner with the torch was Azusa Iwashimizu, a key player in the Japan team that won the Women’s World Cup in 2011.\n\nWearing a white track suit, she carried the torch out of the J-Village indoor soccer training center and was surrounded by 14 other members of that 2011 World Cup squad and coach Norio Sasaki at the rear. They were also decked out in white track suits.\n\nThe ceremony was closed to the public because of the fear of spreading COVID-19 but was streamed live.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\n“The torch of Tokyo 2020 will become a bright light for hope for Japanese citizens and citizens in the world and a light at the end of the tunnel,” said Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the local organizing committee and a former Olympian herself.\n\nHomare Sawa, the biggest star on the 2011 team, missed the ceremony. She is being treated for a condition affecting her inner ear and had to withdraw from the event.\n\nFans were told to social-distance along the roadside as the torch passes, and they were to refrain from loud cheering. Organizers have said they will stop or reroute the relay if crowding becomes a problem during the four-month parade.\n\nSpectators cooperated in Naraha Town, just down the road from where the torch started its trip. A few hundred people stood on the roadside and were safely spread out.\n\n“At first I didn’t think much of it,\" said 20-year-old Takumu Kimura. “But when I actually saw it, it felt like: — yes, it’s the Olympics.”\n\nSetsuko Hashimoto, a 63-year-old local resident, was emotional as the torch passed.\n\n“Ten years ago there was a nuclear accident so (seeing the torch) it felt like I could really look forward to something and live,” she said. \"When you become my age, this is the last Tokyo Olympics and it’s here. It was very touching.”\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga chimed in from Tokyo with a statement.\n\n\"The Olympic torch relay starting from today is a valuable opportunity for the people to get a real sense of the Olympics and Paralympics that are approaching,” Suga told reporters.\n\nLocal organizers and the International Olympic Committee hope the relay will turn public opinion in Japan in favor of the Olympics. Sentiments expressed in polls in Japan so far are overwhelmingly negative with about 80% suggesting another delay or cancellation.\n\nThe relay and the Olympics both stir fear that the events could spread the virus. There is also opposition to the soaring cost of staging the Olympics, now put officially at $15.4 billion. Several audits suggest it’s twice that much and a University of Oxford study says these are the most expensive Olympics on record.\n\nThe relay is a big test for the upcoming Olympics with fear among the public that the event could spread the virus to rural and more isolated parts of the country. Vaccinations have not been rolled out yet in Japan to the general public. About 9,000 deaths in the country have been attributed to COVID-19.\n\nAbout 10,000 runners are expected to take part, with the relay touching Japan's 47 prefectures.\n\nAfter the postponement a year ago, there was early talk of eliminating the relay to save money. However, that idea was quickly dropped with the relay heavily sponsored by Coca-Cola and Toyota.\n\nThe relay is a prelude to the difficulties the Olympics and Paralympics will present with 15,400 athletes entering Japan, along with thousands of other officials, judges, VIPs, media, and broadcasters.\n\nAthletes will be kept in a “bubble” like atmosphere in Tokyo and will be limited to the Athletes Village on Tokyo Bay, the competition venues and training areas. Most others will be outside the bubble and will be kept at a distance from the athletes.\n\nOrganizers announced a few days ago that fans from abroad will be banned from attending the Olympics and Paralympics. Most volunteers from abroad have also been ruled out.\n\nOrganizers are to announce the venue capacities in April. Ticket revenue for the Olympics was to be $800 million but will be severely reduced by the lack of fans. Japanese government entities will have to make up the shortfall.\n\n___\n\nAP video journalist Haruka Nuga contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/07/29/atlantas-olympic-venues-meet-varying-fates-since-1996/87696030/", "title": "Atlanta's Olympic venues meet varying fates since 1996", "text": "AP\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Twenty years after the Olympics were held in Atlanta, some remnants of that improbable summer remain a highly visible part of the city's landscape, while others quickly faded away.\n\nCentennial Olympic Park and Turner Field — known as Centennial Olympic Stadium in 1996 — were the greatest legacy of those games, though the latter faces an uncertain future after just 20 seasons as home of baseball's Atlanta Braves, who are moving to a new suburban stadium next year.\n\nOther venues barely outlasted the extinguishing of the Olympic flame, while still more failed to live up to their intended purpose.\n\nA look at Atlanta's Olympic facilities two decades later:\n\nCENTENNIAL OLYMPIC STADIUM: The 85,000-seat main stadium was site of athletics (Michael Johnson's world record, Carl Lewis' farewell) and both the opening and closing ceremonies (Muhammad Ali's poignant lighting of the torch). Afterward, the arena was converted into a 50,000-seat baseball park and renamed after the longtime owner of the Braves, Ted Turner. It hosted both the World Series and the All-Star Game during its early years, but the Braves have fallen on hard times and are moving to SunTrust Park in 2017. Georgia State is exploring the possibility of another conversion, which would downsize Turner Field into a 30,000-seat football stadium.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nGEORGIA DOME: A divider transformed this 70,000-seat football stadium into two separate arenas — one the site of second Olympic Dream Team winning gold in men's basketball, the other where the Magnificent Seven captured America's first victory in women's team gymnastics. Just 25 years after its opening, the dome is slated for demolition after $1.4 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium opens next door in 2017.\n\nCENTENNIAL OLYMPIC PARK: This was the hub of the games, a gathering spot for sponsor tents and nightly concerts. Tragedy struck midway through the Olympics when a deadly bombing ripped through the park, but it emerged afterward as a catalyst of downtown development, now surrounded by the hugely popular Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, College Football Hall of Fame, National Center for Civil and Human Rights, and a giant Ferris wheel.\n\nGEORGIA TECH AQUATIC CENTER: Temporary seating was used during the Olympics, providing a 14,600-seat main pool for swimming, diving and synchronized swimming. There also was a 4,000-seat temporary pool for water polo. After the games, Georgia Tech enclosed the facility and reduced capacity to just under 2,000. This year, it hosted the NCAA swimming championships as well as a pre-Olympic camp for the U.S. swim team before it departed for the Rio Olympics.\n\nGEORGIA WORLD CONGRESS CENTER: One of the world's largest convention centers (and even more sprawling today after a post-Games expansion), it was divided into five separate arenas during the Olympics, reducing the need for wasteful new venues for fencing, handball, judo, table tennis, weightlifting and wrestling. That became a model for future Olympics.\n\nATLANTA-FULTON COUNTY STADIUM: Site of baseball during the Olympics, the former home of the Atlanta Braves served out the 1996 season, then was imploded the following summer to make way for a parking lot serving adjacent Turner Field.\n\nOMNI COLISEUM: Just a week before Atlanta Stadium came down, this facility used for volleyball during the Olympics met the same fate. Philips Arena now occupies the site.\n\nGEORGIA INTERNATIONAL HORSE PARK: Equestrian, modern pentathlon and the first Olympic mountain bike competition were held at the park about 30 miles east of Atlanta. It remains an equestrian and events center, with horse and mountain bike trails plus an Arnold Palmer-designed golf course open to the public.\n\nSTONE MOUNTAIN PARK ARCHERY CENTER AND VELODROME: Temporary facilities for archery and track cycling came down shortly after the Olympics. The site is now part of a songbird and habitat trail.\n\nSTONE MOUNTAIN TENNIS CENTER: A permanent tennis facility built in a corner of Stone Mountain Park quickly became a money loser and now sits idle, weeds growing through the outer courts and the scoreboard in disrepair.\n\nSANFORD STADIUM (Athens, Georgia): The home of the Georgia Bulldogs football team hosted soccer finals, including the U.S. memorably winning the first women's gold. The stadium known for its famous hedges (which were taken down during the Olympics and then re-planted) has been expanded to hold more than 92,000.\n\nALEXANDER MEMORIAL COLISEUM: Site of boxing in 1996, Georgia Tech's basketball arena underwent a massive renovation that completely gutted the interior of the building. It reopened in 2012 as gleaming McCamish Pavilion.\n\nHERNDON STADIUM: Perhaps the saddest legacy of the games, this 15,000-seat stadium was used during the filming of the movie \"We Are Marshall\" but was abandoned after Morris Brown College ran into financial difficulties. Gutted by vandals, it is now covered in graffiti and piles of trash.\n\nLAKE LANIER (Gainesville, Georgia): This man-made lake still has its rowing facilities, which have been used for major competitions over the last two decades. This year, it hosted an Olympic qualifier for Rio.\n\nWOLF CREEK SHOOTING COMPLEX: Some facilities remain at this suburban venue now known as the Tom Lowe Shooting Grounds, but it no longer holds major international events.\n\nATLANTA BEACH: Located south of the city, this venue was site of the first Olympic beach volleyball tournament. It was renamed Clayton County International Park, with the main stadium now used for concerts and other events though the park still includes several beach volleyball courts, as well as a water park, lake and biking trails.\n\nGOLDEN PARK (Columbus, Georgia): The 5,000-seat stadium, about a two-hour drive from Atlanta, was used for the first Olympic softball competition. It served for years as home to minor league baseball, but the last of those teams, the Columbus Catfish, left after the 2008 season. The stadium remains but no longer has a major tenant.\n\nOTHER VENUES: Georgia's Stegeman Coliseum (volleyball preliminaries), Georgia State's GSU Sports Arena (badminton), Clark-Atlanta's Panther Stadium (field hockey) and Morehouse's Forbes Arena (basketball preliminaries) are still used by their respective colleges. In fact, Panther Stadium now holds the athletics track used during the Olympics. The Ocoee Whitewater Center in Tennessee (whitewater canoeing) and Wassaw Sound near coastal Savannah, Georgia (sailing) were temporary venues. Preliminary soccer matches were held in four stadiums outside Atlanta. Birmingham's Legion Field, Orlando's Citrus Bowl and Washington's RFK Stadium are still in use, while Miami's Orange Bowl was torn down to make way for a new baseball stadium.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

He joked that \"you never know (what to expect) with USATF,\" pointing out that \"this is all new to me.\"\n\n\"They could take somebody from the 100, the 200, the 800. They can take anyone they want to take,\" Wilson said. \"They could take a long jumper as far as I know.\"\n\nTo be safe, he's not going to hang up his spikes for the summer just yet.\n\n“I don’t know if my season is over yet, I don’t want to go eat ice cream too soon,” said Wilson, who prefers cookies and cream. “I could be getting that call and have to regroup. I’m just gonna keep my head down and keep praying on it and hope I make the team.”\n\nDespite running against competitors twice his age (and size) and not even having a driver’s license yet, Wilson has put the track world on notice. He drew praise on social media from Snoop Dogg and Deion Sanders. Norman called the teenager’s performance “spectacular” after the semifinals.\n\n\"A 16-year-old coming out here, competing like a true competitor, not letting the moment get too big but living in the moment,\" Norman said about Wilson following Sunday's semifinals. \"It’s great to see young talents like him elevate and push us to run a little faster, and take us out of our comfort zone. I think he has a bright future.\"\n\nWilson joked after the semis that he was “just running for my life out there.” He said after the final that he didn't execute quite as well as he hoped, but gushed about his experience nonetheless.\n\n\"I wasn’t even thinking about making it to the biggest final in America,\" Wilson said. \"I’m so thankful.\"\n\n'I really am here'\n\nHigh school track phenoms are rare at the Olympic track and field trials, but not entirely unheard of: In 2016, 16-year-old Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone finished third in the 400 hurdles and qualified for the Rio Games, becoming the youngest athlete to make Team USA’s Olympic roster in 36 years. (McLaughlin-Levrone is favored to win the 400 hurdles later this week). McLaughlin-Levrone was the youngest athlete to make Team USA’s Olympic track roster in 36 years.\n\nThe last high schooler to make the men’s Olympic team was Erriyon Knighton, who ran the 200 at the Tokyo Games as a 17-year-old. He finished fourth there, but won bronze in the event at the 2022 World Championships.\n\nEight years ago, Wilson was 8 and competing at the Junior Olympics in Humble, Texas. Starstruck by the professional runners he saw on TV, he asked his mom, \"How do I get like that?\"\n\nWilson finished fourth that meet, running the Under-8 400 in 1:06.44. His mom told him if he worked hard, ran hard and allowed himself to live in the moment, \"You'll be that kid one day.\"\n\nMonday when Wilson was introduced, the Hayward Field crowd of 12,000-plus roared loudest for him, a boost that he said, \"pumped me up a lot. Even though I was in Lane 2, the fans made me forget about that.\"\n\nAfter he crossed the finish line, little kids swarmed him for his autograph. The moment wasn’t lost on him.\n\n\"When I was signing somebody’s shirt today, I was like, 'I really am here,'\" he said. \"It's crazy.\"\n\nAnd it's likely only the beginning.\n\nEmail Lindsay Schnell at lschnell@usatoday.com and follow her on social media @Lindsay_Schnell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/23/2024-olympic-track-trials-16-year-old-qualifies-400-final/74189379007/", "title": "Quincy Wilson, 16, in men's 400 final tonight at Olympic track trials", "text": "EUGENE, Oregon — A Hayward Field fan favorite has blossomed in the form of 16-year-old sensation Quincy Wilson.\n\nRunning against competitors nearly twice his age at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials, Wilson’s captured the support and attention from spectators at the stadium and watching from home as he raced into Monday night’s 400 meters final.

I’m in the world’s biggest final coming up. At 16 years old, I’m ecstatic right now. ...It’s one of the happiest days of my life.\"\n\nOlympic hopeful doesn't yet have driver's license\n\nIn some ways, Wilson is like his fellow competitors: He’s repped by a major apparel company after signing an NIL deal with New Balance last September.\n\nIn other ways, he’s extremely different. He gets straight As, for example … because he’s still juggling full-time school with training. Also of note: He does not yet have his driver’s license, and isn't sure when he'll get it. He doesn't have time to study or practice driving, what with trying to make the Olympic team and all.\n\nWilson is coached at Bullis by Joe Lee, a former youth pastor who’s been at the Potomac, Maryland, private school for 11 years. Before Wilson, Lee coached Wilson’s cousin, Shaniya Hall, a sprinter who starred at college track powerhouse Oregon the last four years, where she helped the Ducks to two Pac-12 relay championships.\n\nAfter his blistering opening round Friday, Wilson was asked if he held back at all considering it was just a heat. He smiled.\n\n“It’s a different game,\" he said. \"I’m not in high school anymore, I’m running with the big dogs now, so I gotta give it my all.”\n\nHe brushed off concerns about if he’d be able to recover fully.\n\n“I know my training and my coaching,” he said. “They have me in the right position.”\n\nThat goes for the mental side, too. Asked what his nerves were on a scale of 1-10 after his first race, he again gave off his megawatt smile before declaring, “Probably like a 2.”\n\n“I’m just racing against bigger people,” Wilson said, a nod to both his competitors' physical stature and brand names. “But to me everybody puts their spikes on the same way I do, and I train just as hard as they do.”\n\nHe made it clear he’s not just here to enjoy the experience, either. He wants to win.\n\nCould Wilson make the Olympic team?\n\nNorman, who ran in his first trials at 18, seemed somewhat skeptical that the 16-year-old would claim a spot on the Olympic team in the 400.\n\nAsked if he viewed Wilson as a contender, Norman was blunt.\n\n“It’s tough,” he said. “There’s people out there fighting for money right now. He made the final. It’s very hard to say. This is probably his first time running three rounds. I remember (my first trials), running three rounds in the 200, I was cooked.”\n\nBut he wasn’t ready to write Wilson off entirely.\n\n“Kids are different now, so it’s definitely possible,” Norman said. “He could definitely sneak into a relay spot for sure.”\n\nHigh school track phenoms are rare at the Olympic Track & Field Trials, but not entirely unheard of: In 2016, 16-year-old Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone finished third in the 400 hurdles, and qualified for the Rio Games. She did not make the final in Rio. (McLaughlin-Levrone is favored to win the 400 hurdles later this week). McLaughlin-Levrone was the youngest athlete to make Team USA’s Olympic roster in 36 years.\n\nErriyon Knighton, one of the world’s top 200 runners, made the Tokyo roster as a high school junior, finishing fourth in Japan. Knighton won bronze at the 2022 World Championships. He’s entered in the 200 later this week.\n\nShould Wilson qualify for Paris, he would be the youngest-ever male member of the American Olympic track team.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on X @TheTylerDragon.\n\nEmail Lindsay Schnell at lschnell@usatoday.com and follow her on social media @Lindsay_Schnell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/quincy-wilson-16-year-old-track-star-us-olympic-trials/74191091007/", "title": "Meet Quincy Wilson, 16-year-old track star and 400m Olympic hopeful", "text": "One of the breakout stars of this year's Olympic Track and Field Trials is 16-year-old sprinter Quincy Wilson, who's holding his own against more experienced runners almost twice his age.\n\nAnd on Monday night, he'll have a chance to achieve his dream of making the U.S. team in the men's 400 meters.\n\nAlready the world under-18 record holder in the event after running 44.66 seconds in the opening round to break the 42-year-old record, Wilson set a new mark in Sunday's semifinal heat, crossing the finish line in a personal-best 44.59 seconds to finish third and advance to Monday night's final.\n\n\"It’s spectacular.

She is a sophomore at James Madison University, where she is a sprinter and long jumper. In 2023, she was named to the All Sun Belt Conference third team in the 4x400 meter relay.\n\nWhere does Quincy Wilson go to high school?\n\nWilson attends Bullis School in Potomac, Maryland, where he is a rising junior.\n\nHe is a five-time AAU Junior Olympic Games champion.\n\nHe is a two-time defending indoor champion in the 400 meters at the New Balance Nationals. He is also the reigning New Balance Nationals outdoor 400-meter champion, after finishing second in the event in 2023.\n\nWilson attends the same school where his cousin, Shaniya Hall, graduated before going on to run track at the University of Oregon.\n\nDoes Quincy Wilson have an NIL deal?\n\nWilson became one of the youngest American athletes to sign an NIL contract with a major sports brand last September when he reached an agreement with New Balance.\n\nWhen is the men's 400 meter final?\n\nThe men's 400 final at the U.S. Olympic Trials will be run Monday at 9:59 p.m. ET on NBC.\n\nShould Wilson qualify for Paris, he would be the youngest-ever male member of the American Olympic track team.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/11/24/who-is-youngest-olympian/10380713002/", "title": "Who is the youngest Olympian?

The oldest Olympian to ever compete was Oscar Swahn of Sweden who was 72 years old when he competed in shooting at the 1920 Olympics. This year, 16-year-old Quincy Wilson will compete as the youngest male U.S. track and field Olympian ever.\n\nHere are more of the youngest athletes to compete in the Olympic Games.\n\nWho is the youngest Olympian?\n\nDimitros Loundras is the youngest athlete to ever compete in the Olympic Games, taking part in the 1896 Athens Olympics at 10 years, 216 days old. Loundras is also the youngest medal winner, having won the bronze medal in the team competition, according to Olympics.com.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe young athlete participated only in the 1896 Olympics but has held this record since.\n\nWho is the youngest Olympic gold winner?\n\nKim Yun-Mi of South Korea is the youngest Olympic gold winner in history, winning her medal at 13 years and 85 days old during the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics, according to Guinness World Records. Kim competed in the 3,000 meter short-track speed skating relay event.\n\nMarjorie Gestring is the youngest Summer Olympic gold medalist in history, having received the top prize for springboard diving at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Gestring of the U.S. competed at 13 years, 268 days old.\n\nKlaus Zerta is the the youngest male Summer Olympic gold medal winner, participating at age 13 years and 283 days old. Zerta won gold during the 1960 Rome Olympics for Germany in coxed pairs rowing.\n\nToni Nieminen is the youngest male Winter Olympic gold medalist, winning at 16 years and 259 days old, which beat the previous record holder by one day. Nieminen brought home the gold for Finland during the 1992 Albertville Olympics in the team large hill ski jump and the individual large hill ski jump.\n\nIs there an age minimum for the Olympics?\n\nAccording to the Olympics, \"there is no specific age limit for taking part in the Olympic Games.\" Instead, the minimum age for eligibility depends on each individual international sports federation and the rules it sets for its sport.\n\nFor instance, in order for gymnasts to be eligible for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, their birthday must have been before Jan. 1, 2005, according to the 1997 regulation outlining the minimum age of 16 years old to compete in senior-level events.\n\nMeanwhile, in June of 2022, figure skating increased its minimum age for senior competition eligibility from 15 to 17 years old by the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. The International Skating Union said in a news release the change is intended to protect \"the physical and mental health, and emotional well-being of the Skaters.\"\n\nIn the end, age of eligibility depends on what sport the athlete wishes to compete in and the specific regulations the federation has laid out.\n\nWhen do the Olympics start?:Schedule for the 2024 Paris Summer Games\n\nJust Curious for more?

Track and field at the 2024 Games is scheduled for Aug. 2-10. Dozens of Americans are expected to contend for medals. Here’s what to know about Team USA on the track.\n\nWho is the oldest track and field Olympian?\n\nThe oldest track and field Olympian scheduled to compete at the 2024 Paris Games was marathoner Leonard Korir, who was 37 years, 204 days when he was named to the team on June 6.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nBut then, on June 30, Kara Winger qualified for her fifth Games at the age of 38 years, 81 days.\n\nNeither have earned an Olympic medal. Korir did not compete at the Tokyo Games, but he finished 14th at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Winger’s best finish also came in Rio when she placed 13th.\n\nWho is the youngest track and field Olympian?\n\nErriyon Knighton, who made his second Olympic team after finishing third in the men’s 200, was the youngest American track Olympian when the finals ended Sunday. Knighton was 20 years, 154 days old when he qualified in the 200, less than a year younger than 1,500-meter runner Hobbs Kessler, who was 21 years, 94 days old on June 24 when he finished third in his event.\n\nBut late Sunday 16-year-old Quincy Wilson was told he was being added to the 4x400 relay pool. In the men's 400 final, the 16-year-old from Bullis High School in Maryland missed out on the three automatic qualifying spots when he finished in sixth, running a 44.94.\n\nWho’s been to the most Olympics?\n\nKara Winger will make her fifth Olympic appearance in Paris, having qualified for every Games since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWinger, 38, is also the oldest track Olympian on Team USA, edging outmarathoner Leonard Korir.\n\nIs anyone surprising missing Paris Olympics?\n\nThe most shocking result of the 2024 track and field trials involves Mu, a dominant 800 runner who is the reigning Olympic gold medalist.\n\nIn her 800 semifinal on June 24, Mu, a 22-year-old with a long, loping stride — a hazard of her 5-foot-10 frame — tripped as runners moved to the inside curve, falling all the way down. She recovered and finished the race but she was last, more than 22 seconds behind the winner, Nia Akins. Mu's team appealed the race decision, but it was denied.\n\nMu is a strong contender to be named to the 4x400 relay pool.\n\nRyan Crouser going for Olympic record/milestone\n\nRyan Crouser, the best shot putter in the history of the event, is trying to become the first shot putter ever to win three consecutive gold medals.\n\nCrouser, 31, owns 11 of the top 20 throws of all time. He won gold in Tokyo and Rio, but his best throw came May 27, 2023, when he tossed the shot 77 feet, 3 3/4 inches at the LA Grand Prix.\n\nHe is the heavy favorite going into Paris, but has had some epic back-and-forth battles over the years with U.S. teammate Joe Kovacs, who finished second at the trials with a throw of 73 feet, 7 1/4 inches.\n\nBefore the 2022 World Championships, Crouser told USA TODAY Sports that he plans to switch to discus after the Paris Games.\n\nHome (Hayward) field advantage\n\nOregon track and field athletes who competed at the trials had a unique advantage in that Hayward Field is their home stadium. While all of America’s top track and field athletes compete regularly in Eugene and speak often of the “Hayward Magic” that tends to show up during big meets here, only Jaida Ross practices in this stadium regularly.\n\nRoss, who just finished her junior year at the University of Oregon, qualified for Paris in women’s shot put, finishing third after throwing 64 feet, 3 3/4 inches. Ross won the NCAA title in early June, another meet where she got to throw in her home stadium.\n\nCollege stars (probably) headed for Paris\n\nA handful of college athletes who still have eligibility left are (likely) headed to Paris, too.

But Monday in her final she tripped as the runner pack narrowed and fell to the ground. She recovered as quickly as possible, but couldn’t make up lost time, finishing in last place. Sobbing as soon as she crossed the finish line, she declined to speak with media.\n\nElsewhere on the track, America’s new favorite sprinter, 16-year-old Quincy Wilson, finished sixth in the men’s 400. He will not go to Paris in his individual event but there is a chance he could be put in the 4x400 relay pool. Wilson said he and his coach are awaiting word on if his season is over or not.\n\nOther winners Monday included Anna Hall (heptathlon), Elle St. Pierre (women’s 5,000), Cole Hocker (men's 1,500) and Jeremiah Davis (long jump), among others.\n\nThe Trials now break for two days, with no competition scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday.

She recovered quickly but had lost too much ground. She crossed the line with tears in her eyes.\n\nIt’s likely that Mu will be named to the 4x400 relay team. −Lindsay Schnell\n\n16-year-old Quincy Wilson comes in sixth in 400 final\n\nHigh school sensation Quincy Wilson's opportunity for an automatic bid for Paris came up just short.\n\nThe Bullis High School sophomore placed sixth in the 400 final, running a 44.94. He does have a chance to be in the 4x400 relay pool for Team USA.\n\nThe 16-year-old ran out of lane two. He had the fourth fastest time entering Monday’s final at 44.59.\n\nQuincy Hall won gold, running a personal-best of 44.17. Michael Norman’s 44.41 was good enough for second and Chris Bailey ran a 44.42 to place third. −Tyler Dragon\n\nAnna Hall wins heptathlon, pulls away with strong 800\n\nAnna Hall is exhausted — and headed to Paris.\n\nHall, who had a slim, six-point lead going into the 800, the final event of the heptathlon, won her heat in in 2:04.39, easily beating Cheri Hawkins, who finished seventh at 2:14.76, giving Hall the victory and a ticket to the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nHall collapsed at the finish line, instantly emotional about winning gold. She was crying throughout her NBC interview. She finished the competition with 6,614 points. Hawkins was second at 6,456. Taliyah Brooks finished third at 6,408.\n\nOf the three, Hall is the only one with the Olympic standard, which means she could be the only American heptathlete in Paris. −Lindsay Schnell\n\nVashti Cunningham places third in women’s high jump\n\nVashti Cunningham won’t be a U.S. high jump champion for the first time since 2016, but she is on her way to Paris.\n\nCunningham, whose father Randall played quarterback in the NFL, placed third in the women’s high jump with a jump of 6 feet, 3¼ inches. Kentucky’s Charity Hufnagel won the event with a personal-best jump of 6 feet, 4¼ inches. Rachel Glenn placed second, leaping over a height of 6 feet, 4¼ inches. Hufnagel won the tiebreaker. −Lindsay Schnell\n\nCole Hocker breaks Olympic trials record, wins 1,500\n\nRunning in his home stadium, Cole Hocker used a tremendous kick the last 200 meters to win the men’s 1,500, finishing in a personal-best 3:30.59. A former standout at the University of Oregon who raced to the finish behind a roar from the Hayward Field crowd, Hocker will compete in his second Olympics in Paris. He finished sixth in Tokyo.\n\nHocker’s time in the final was also an Olympic trials record.\n\n“I’ve never been able to excel at that pace before,” Hocker said. “I’ve run that race 1,000 times in my head. For it to finally happen like that was incredible. I heard the crowd getting louder and louder and I thought, somebody must be gaining on me. But they helped me go through the line as hard as I could.”\n\nYared Nuguse (second, 3:30.86) and Hobbs Kessler (third, 3:31.53) are also headed to the 2024 Games. −Lindsay Schnell\n\nLaulauga Tausaga-Collins scratches all three attempts in discus\n\nReigning world discus champion Laulauga Tausaga-Collins fouled all three attempts in the first round of the women’s discus and was unable to advance to the next round. The 26-year-old won the 2023 world championships with a personal-best throw of 228 feet.\n\nTausaga-Collins entered the competition as one of the three discus throwers with the Olympic standard. −Tyler Dragon\n\nAnna Hall has slim lead in heptathlon heading into 800\n\nHeading into the final event of the heptathlon (the 800), former Florida standout Anna Hall is in the lead — but just barely.\n\nHall has 5,566 points, while Chari Hawkins is right on her heels at 5,560. Taliyah Brooks is currently in third at 5,492. The final event, which will be run in two heats, is scheduled for, 8:37 p.m. and 8:48 p.m.\n\nHall has a World Championship silver medal and a bronze. The 23-year-old is looking to make her first Olympic team. −Lindsay Schnell\n\n16-year-old Quincy Wilson to run men's 400m final tonight\n\nA Hayward Field fan favorite has blossomed in the form of 16-year-old sensation Quincy Wilson.\n\nRunning against competitors nearly twice his age, Wilson has a chance to race his way onto the U.S. Olympic team in the men's 400 meters.\n\nWilson broke the under-18 world record when he ran a 44.66 in the first round of the 400 meters on Friday. Then he broke the record again Sunday by running a 44.59 to advance to Monday’s final, which is scheduled for 9:59 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock.\n\nWilson, who will be running out of Lane 2 Monday night, is entering the 400 final with the fourth fastest qualifying time. He is behind Quincy Hall (44.42), Bryce Deadmon (44.44) and Vernon Norwood (44.50).\n\nWho is 16-year-old track phenom Quincy Wilson?\n\nOne of the breakout stars of this year's Olympic track and field trials is 16-year-old Quincy Wilson, who will race in the men's 400 meter final Monday night.\n\nWilson, who was born was born on Jan. 8, 2008 and hails from Gaithersburg, Maryland, became one of the youngest American athletes to sign an NIL contract with a major sports brand last September when he reached an agreement with New Balance.\n\nRead more about about the young track sensation here.\n\nTokyo Olympic gold and bronze medalists will race in women's 800 meter final\n\nDefending Olympic gold medalist Athing Mu won her 800 meter semifinal heat Sunday evening at Hayward Field, using a tremendous kick to overtake LSU’s Michaela Rose, who won an NCAA title earlier this month. Veteran Kate Grace also passed Rose at the line to finish second, but all three qualified for Monday's final.\n\nRaevyn Rogers, who won the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics behind Mu, also advanced to the 800 meter final, scheduled for 10:32 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nWhat you missed Sunday night: Fastest man in America\n\nNoah Lyles is headed back to the Olympics.\n\nThe American sprinter, maybe the most charismatic track athlete in the world, won the men’s 100 meter final Sunday evening. The defending world champion, Lyles is looking to earn his first Olympic gold medal. Kenny Bednarek (9.87) and Fred Kerley (9.88) finished second and third, respectively, and will join Lyles in Paris next month.\n\nLyles is also entered in the 200, and expected to be a key piece of the 4x100 team. The 200 final is scheduled for Saturday, June 29.\n\nHow to watch the U.S. Olympic track and field trials on TV\n\nHere is the TV broadcast schedule, according to NBC:\n\nMonday: 8-11 p.m. ET on Peacock, NBC\n\nHow to live stream the Olympic trials\n\nAll events will be streamed on Peacock, NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com and the NBC and NBC Sports apps.\n\nMonday's schedule for U.S. Olympic track and field trials\n\nHere's the schedule for Monday night and for the rest of the meet:\n\n(All times Eastern)\n\n8 p.m.: Women's discus throw (qualifying)\n\n8:05 p.m.: Men's 110m hurdles (Round 1)\n\n8:15 p.m.: Women's high jump (final)\n\n8:25 p.m.: Men's long jump (final)\n\n8:47 p.m.: Men's 1500m (final)\n\n8:59 p.m.: Women's 3000m steeplechase (Round 1)\n\n9:37 p.m.: Women's heptathlon 800m heats\n\n9:59 p.m.: Men's 400m (final)\n\n10:09 p.m.: Women's 5000m (final)\n\n10:32 p.m.: Women's 800m (final)\n\nWho has qualified for U.S. Olympic track and field team for Paris\n\nWith six more finals held Sunday, the roster for Team USA continued to grow.

French Olympic planners plot to end the invasion ...", "text": "Paris CNN —\n\nWhen Paris clinched the race to host the 2024 Olympic Games, it may have been in part thanks to a slogan that embodied the Olympic spirit: “Made for sharing.”\n\nBut for French officials, that generosity doesn’t extend to the Games’ official languages.\n\n“The official languages of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are French and English – in that order,” said l’Académie Française, the pre-eminent council for matters pertaining to the French language.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics continues a tradition of an evolving roster of sports, with surfing, breakdancing and sport climbing among the recent additions. With them come a flock of terms that are foreign to the French language.\n\nFor some French-language purists, it’s too much to bear to revert to English to compliment surfers on their ‘noseriding’ – standing on the front of the board – or to mention a breakdancer’s ‘cypher’ – the circle that athletes dance in. They’ve decided they need a solution ‘à la française.’\n\nFrom left front row center: French Delegate Minister of Sports Roxana Maracineanu, President of the French National Olympic Committee Brigitte Henriques, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and President of the Paris Organizing Committee of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games Tony Estanguet hoist the Olympic flag marking the handover from Japan to the next Games in Paris 2024. Stephane De Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe French government has created a college of experts devoted to promoting the national language, in conjunction with several Olympic federations.\n\n“The translation of tricks will be crucial,” said Daniel Zielinski, a high-ranking official for the French language in sport and spokesperson of the committee. “Because when you are a [French] athlete or a viewer, watching rollerblading or skateboarding, you don’t understand anything the specialists are saying.”\n\nDuring their first meeting last January, the college agreed to start working on its first two terms: ‘breakdancing’ and when dancers ‘freeze.’ Various translations have been suggested so far, including ‘le breaking’ and ‘la frise.’\n\n“Once a term is made official, it becomes mandatory,” said Zielinski.\n\nThe organization, composed of experts and intellectuals from different fields, will meet periodically over the next couple of years to identify and define new sports terms.\n\nThe IOC, whose role is to supervise and monitor the organization of the Games, is not involved in the project.\n\n“It is not for the IOC to comment on a governmental initiative but we applaud the objective of trying to make sport as accessible to as many people as possible through language,” the committee told CNN.\n\nPresident of the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee Tony Estanguet (L) and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (C) wave the Olympic flag to mark the handover. Stephane De Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe invasion of Franglais\n\nThe French battle against the influence of other languages isn’t new.\n\nIn 1994, the Toubon law was passed, mandating the use of French in all government publications, contracts and advertisements. Yet it contained several loopholes, which allow brands and companies to extensively use English.\n\nAs a result, anglicisms are becoming more prominent, including made-up words such as ‘footing’ for ‘running’ and ‘baskets’ for ‘sneakers.’\n\nJulie Neveux, linguistics professor at Sorbonne University in Paris, said anglicisms are “sometimes estimated at just under 5% of the current lexicon, but they are disturbing because they show that we follow an economic and cultural model other than our own.”\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo (C) speaks past French President Emmanuel Macron (second L) during a visit of the building site of the Olympic Village in Saint-Ouen on October 14, 2021. Sarah Meyssonnier/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThey are particularly present in sports competitions and events, during which athletes from around the world are used to communicating in English.\n\n“Sport was one of the first areas to be globalized,” said sports historian Michael Attali. “This phenomenon has imposed English as the official language.”\n\nAttali added the media and sports federations are also to blame, as they relay anglicisms by not “making the effort of translating them.”\n\nA pointless battle?\n\nDespite their best efforts, no committee has successfully prevented English from infiltrating everyday language. By the time French officials have agreed on a translation and its definition, the English version has already spread throughout the nation.\n\n“Similar assemblies have been put in place in the past, but nothing has changed so far,” said Attali. “In soccer, we still use terms such as ‘corner’ for corner kick, instead of its official translation, and that will not stop anytime soon.”\n\nOnce the sole official language of the Olympics, the language of Proust and Dumas has taken a back seat as the use of English has soared in recent decades.\n\nIn protest, the French government has sent a delegate to each Olympics since the 1996 Atlanta Games, tasked with assessing the place of the French language at the event.\n\nHowever, athletes and commentators alike have continued using English terminology.\n\nA crowd during the Olympic Games handover ceremony on August 8, 2021 in Paris. Siegfried Modola/Getty Images\n\nIn her report on the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Games, former delegate Fleur Pellerin noted “the presence of the French language (had) been insufficient on the competition field.”\n\n“The growing importance of English as an international language of communication and work, the preponderant influence of English-speaking funders and elected officials in international sport and in the Olympic Games, and the insufficient coordination of the French-speaking sport community contribute to explaining this evolution,” read the report.\n\nSpokesperson Daniel Zielinski says he is not “dogmatic” when it comes to this new committee’s potential. He only hopes their initiatives will “encourage watching and practicing those sports, for those who want to do them.”\n\nThe French exit\n\nIf English is now the preferred language of athletes and commentators, French has had a long-lasting influence on the world of sport.\n\nBallet remains flooded with French words, such as ‘pas de bourré,’ ‘arabesque’ and ‘chassé.’ At the beginning of every fencing match, the French imperative ‘Allez’ – meaning ‘Go’ – is used by referees.\n\nEven the term ‘sport’ originates from the Old French word ‘desport,’ meaning ‘leisure.’\n\n“There are far fewer anglicisms in French than there are French words in English,” said Neveux, adding these exchanges should not be seen “as a threat.”\n\n“All living languages exist by borrowing from each other, it is an asset. Languages only exist thanks to their impurity.”\n\nBut, for some, this impurity is perceived as a danger to the French identity.\n\nFrench Elite acrobatic team Patrouille de France flies over the Eiffel Tower during the Olympic Games handover ceremony. Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images\n\nAs the official guardian of the French language, the Académie Française continues to closely keep track of the number of English words that have crossed the border.\n\nTheir website has a section dedicated to “Neologisms and Anglicisms,” in which they advise against improper English terms like ‘trials’ as major competitions approach.\n\n“The French language conveys the French soul,” Jean-Marie Rouart, author and member of the Académie Française, told CNN. “It conveys at the same time French universalism, tolerance and a concern of beauty and aesthetics.”\n\nThe Académie is a key member of the Olympic language committee. But whether the project ultimately succeeds – or fails – its mission of eradicating English words in the French sporting arena, Rouart has little hope for the language he has spent decades defending.\n\n“In twenty years, French will be a dead language and will be studied the way Latin and Greek are now,” he said.", "authors": ["Anaëlle Jonah"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/05/23/when-do-olympics-start-2024/73414350007/", "title": "When do the Olympics start?

They have been made with one clear goal.\n\nRecords.\n\nAfter three world records and 12 Olympic marks were set on the track in Tokyo three years ago, expect more records to fall at the Stade de France.\n\nThat’s why Mondo, the company that has provided the track at every Summer Games since Montreal in 1976, went back to the drawing board after Tokyo.\n\nWith the help of athlete feedback and extensive testing, new generation granules that are more elastic and cohesive are being used to produce the upper layer of rubber for the Paris track.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nMultiple algorithms were explored before finding a more optimal shape and dimension for the air cells inside the track, which have been designed to minimize energy loss and enhance performance.\n\nIn other words, the innovations are meant to enable Olympians to run faster, jump higher and leap further. Kind of like the Olympic motto: “Faster, higher, stronger — together.”\n\n“The athletes will find this track to be more reactive and better suited for their competition,” Maurizio Stroppiana, vice president of Mondo’s sport division, said during a press tour at the company’s factory in Alba, near Turin.\n\nProduced in portions over two days this week and then rolled up for transport to France, the track will be installed at the Stade de France next week, weather permitting.\n\nIt will mark the third time that Mondo has installed a new track at the Stade de France, which hosted the athletics world championships in 2003.\n\n“It’s laid on the asphalt base and it’s glued in place,” Stroppiana said. “It’s a fairly quick process. We’re going to work 24 hours and overnight because of the limited time available and the weather.”\n\nAnother novelty for Paris is the color of the track, which will be purple for the first time at an Olympics.\n\n“The color was a courageous decision of the local organizing committee,” Stroppiana said. “We have never done this color before. It’s a light mauve and darker violet. It sort of recalls the landscape of France.”\n\nA three-hour drive across the country is the headquarters of another Italian company and supplier for big-time Olympic sports, Myrtha Pools.\n\nIncluding training facilities, Myrtha is making 24 pools for swimming, diving, water polo and artistic swimming in Paris.\n\nIt's the sixth Olympics that Myrtha will be providing pools for.\n\nFor the swimming races at La Defense Arena, Myrtha is installing two temporary pools inside the rugby stadium — one for competition and one for warmups and training.\n\nStainless steel modules being produced at the Myrtha factory in Castiglione delle Stiviere near Verona will be transported to France and bolted together to form the pool walls and floors.\n\n“(Building temporary pools) is a big advantage because this allows us to reinstall the pools after the event,” Myrtha CEO Roberto Colletto said.\n\nFor example, the pools used at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 — when six world records were set in swimming — were reused for the world championships in Fukuoka last year and reinstalled again at local schools in Japan.\n\nBeyond the pool walls and floors, water treatment has added significance for Olympic pools.\n\n“Transparency of water is very important because of the underwater (TV) cameras, especially now with the high definition, they need extreme transparency,” Colletto said.\n\n“In order to achieve this we have developed a specific filtration and water treatment system. And we also have a variable speed bump system that will accelerate or reduce the speed of the water, depending on the competition mode or non-competition mode.”\n\nThere's also a new system designed to reduce the effects of chlorine in the water and the air that will be implemented for Paris.\n\nSo how much water does it take to fill an Olympic pool? Depending on the depth of the pools, which can range from two to three meters for swimming, between 2.5 and 4 million liters of water are needed.\n\n“So there’s a lot of water,\" Colletto said, \"that needs to be poured into these pools.\"\n\n___\n\nDampf reported from Rome.

Inside the ancient ritual that lives on.", "text": "The 2024 Summer Olympics are fast approaching. More than 800 athletes will head to Paris to compete as part of Team USA. The Games will include warm-weather sports like swimming and diving as well as fan favorites like football, basketball and tennis.\n\nU.S. athletes will look to add gold, silver and bronze medals to the country’s current record of 3,105, more than double the medal count of any other country.\n\nHere’s a history lesson on the modern Games and their ancient origins.\n\nWhen did the Olympics start?\n\nAn exact date is unknown, but the International Olympic Committee cites 776 BC as the first recorded Olympic Games. Nevertheless, most believe the Games were already 500 years old at that time, according to the History Channel.\n\nThe Games were a five-day religious festival honoring Zeus, according to the IOC. Athletes competed every four years in running, jumping, boxing, throwing, wrestling, pankration (combined boxing and wrestling) as well as chariot racing. Athletes competed naked and, during certain wrestling events, covered in oil.\n\nThe Games were held until 393 AD, when the Roman Christian Emperor Theodosius I banned them. He believed worshipping Zeus through the Games was a \"pagan abomination,\" according to National Geographic.\n\nThe Olympics wouldn’t return until the late 19th century. Pierre de Coubertin, who co-founded the International Olympic Committee, was inspired to reinstitute the Games after seeing what German archaeologists uncovered during an excavation of ancient Olympia when he was a child. Coubertin, seeking to increase sports education in France, presented his proposal to re-establish the Olympics in 1892. It was approved in 1894.\n\nWhen were the first Olympics?\n\nThe IOC hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896 in Athens. The location was chosen as a tribute to the Games' origins. According to the History Channel, 280 male athletes from 13 countries participated in 43 events, including track and field, swimming, gymnastics, cycling, wrestling, weightlifting, fencing, shooting and tennis. The 1896 Olympics also saw the world’s first marathon competition.\n\nBut world fairs largely outshone the early Olympic Games. and it wasn’t until the 1920s that the “first truly successful” Games occurred, the History Channel says. In 1924, over 3,000 athletes – more than 100 of them women – competed in Paris.\n\nThe games have grown in size and the number of events has expanded in the last century. This year, an estimated 10,500 athletes will compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the IOC reports.\n\nHow often are the Olympics?\n\nThe Summer and Winter Olympics occur every four years to “respect the ancient origins of the Olympic Games.” A period of four years was called an “Olympiad,” in ancient Greece.\n\nBecause the two alternate, we watch the Olympics every two years. For example, the 2022 Olympics were Winter Games and the 2024 Paris Olympics are Summer Games. The next Winter Olympics will be in Italy in 2026.\n\nSubscribe to Chasing Gold newsletter:Your guide to everything 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nJust Curious for more?

What an amazing thrill it’s going to be to enter the Champs-Elysées and then make the journey down to Place de la Concorde, all the while being framed by the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre,” he said in remarks distributed by 2024 organizers.\n\nOrganizers said space will be made at the ceremony for 65,000 people — equivalent to the crowd at a large Olympic stadium.\n\nFrench Paralympic and Sports Committee president Marie-Amélie Le Fur said breaking free of stadium confines “is a revolution.”\n\n“Going down the Champs-Elysées to Place de la Concorde and sharing this with nearly 65,000 people, in the heart of the capital, will be a historic moment,\" she said. “It’s unheard of.\"\n\nAbout 30,000 of those in attendance will be able to watch the ceremony for free.\n\nThe venue choice is part of a massive effort by Paris organizers to free the Olympics and Paralympics from the shackles of traditional sports venues and turn the French capital into a giant playground for sport during the Games, with the Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and other landmarks used as competition venues.\n\nThe concept — encapsulated in the official slogan, “Games Wide Open” — is not without risk. The use of city sites as venues poses security, transport and logistical challenges.\n\nThe Olympic opening ceremony will also break with tradition, taking to the waters of the Seine instead of being held in a stadium.\n\nBoats will parade the 10,500 athletes on the waterway from east to west.

Free access will be invitation-only instead.\n\nOrganizers had planned a grandiose opening ceremony July 26 for as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns — and an outcry from booksellers along the city’s picturesque quays — have led the government to progressively scale back ambitions.\n\nEarlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000. On Tuesday, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said that 104,000 of them will be paying ticket holders with spots along the lower riverbanks, with another 222,000 watching for free from the upper banks.\n\nBut he said that the free tickets will not be available to the public via open registration as earlier envisaged, and will be invitation-only.\n\n“To manage crowd movement, we can’t tell everyone to come,” Darmanin said. “For security reasons that everyone understands, notably the terrorist threat of recent weeks, we are obliged to make it free but contained.\"\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThis means that tourists from France or elsewhere, as well as ordinary Parisians, won't be able to sign up for free access. Instead, access to the ceremony will be allocated via quotas to select residents of towns or regions hosting Olympic events, local sports federations and others chosen by organizers or their partners, said two Interior Ministry officials. The officials weren't authorized to be publicly named according to ministry policy.\n\nThose invited will then need to undergo security checks and will receive QR codes to pass security barriers.\n\nLocal town councils can invite “their employees, kids from local soccer clubs and their parents,” for example, Darmanin said. One of the Interior Ministry officials said that sports federations could invite foreigners as part of their quotas, and towns could offer spots to people with disabilities or in a situation of need, to ’’diversify″ access.\n\nThe official said the change was not aimed at punishing tourists, and that the Games remain more open than any Olympics in several years. Another 200,000 people are expected to watch the opening from inside apartments or buildings overlooking the river, and about 50,000 from fan zones, Darmanin said.\n\nParis 2024 organizers would not comment on the shift, deferring questions to the government. Darmanin said the decision was made under the authority of President Emmanuel Macron, in conjunction with local officials and the organizing committee.\n\nWith France on high alert, Darmanin said that intelligence services haven’t identified a specific plot targeting the Olympics. But he said that there are multiple potential threats, including from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists and ultra-right groups, as well as cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.\n\nFrance was hit by a wave of deadly attacks linked to the Islamic State group in 2015-16 that targeted the Bataclan concert hall and other public venues, and the country has seen occasional extremist violence in the years since.\n\nIntelligence services are conducting checks of about 1 million people slated to participate in, work for or have access to Paris 2024. Of 89,000 checks already carried out, 280 people have been rejected because of police records or other security problems, Darmanin said.\n\nIt’s the first time an Olympics opening ceremony will be held outside a stadium setting, in line with the Paris organizers' motto: “Games Wide Open.” About 10,500 athletes will parade through the heart of the French capital on boats on the Seine along a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) route.\n\nAbout 160 heads of state are expected to attend, and the government will close all airports and airspace within a 150-kilometer (90-mile) radius around Paris before, during and after the 3½-hour ceremony.\n\nAround 2,500 foreign police will be among the 45,000 security force members deployed around Paris for the event, Darmanin said. Discussion is underway on whether the foreign forces can board the boats with their countries’ athletes, and what arms they can carry.\n\nHiring and training enough security personnel for the Olympics, held from July 26-Aug. 11 and the subsequent Paralympics has proved challenging. About 10% of the private security personnel the government requested have yet to be hired, Darmanin said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2017/02/17/french-language-groups-protest-english-only-olympic-slogan/98038046/", "title": "French language groups protest English-only Olympic slogan", "text": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) — Groups defending the French language are lodging legal protests over the English-only slogan used for Paris' 2024 Olympic bid.\n\nLawyer Emmanuel Ludot submitted a request with the government's rights defense authority to suspend use of the slogan \"Made for Sharing.\" He also submitted a warning to the bid committee that the slogan could violate a law on protecting the French language.\n\nLudot said Friday that the language groups want the slogan to be in both French and English — or in French only — because \"we want them to communicate in the language that is ours.\"\n\nThe Paris bid responded by saying it is \"astonished by certain reactions\" and maintained its right to \"communicate on an international level.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Paris bid's international campaign was projected onto the Eiffel Tower, in English and in French.

But there's ...", "text": "Danette Leighton and Scout Bassett\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nWomen athletes have come a long way since the 1900 Paris Olympics, where they were first allowed to compete on the world’s greatest sport stage. They accounted for only 2.2% of all competitors then. Starting Friday, in the same city, women athletes are expected to have the same number of participants as the men. The 50-50 split means that this will be the first-ever Olympics to reach gender parity.\n\nReaching this significant milestone is no small feat, and it has taken investment at all levels of the sports ecosystem to achieve.\n\nTuning into the Summer Games and seeing women fiercely compete for podium positions is witnessing the impact of Title IX play out in live action. It is no surprise that since the landmark law’s passage in 1972, we have seen women’s participation at the Games grow steadily, as generations of athletes continue to benefit from its 37 words that changed the trajectory of women’s sports across the globe.\n\nHow Title IX helps move Olympics toward equality\n\nResearch by our Women’s Sports Foundation has shown that 1,000 athletes (women and men) from more than 100 countries who competed in the 2020 Tokyo Games attended American colleges and universities. The same research also found that Canada’s entire women’s soccer roster that competed in the last Summer Games had attended American institutions.\n\nTitle IX’s impact on the Olympics has moved the needle forward on parity, and a few strategic moves by the International Olympic Committee are also helping close the gender gap. In 2018, the IOC approved a Gender Equality Review Project that specifically called out the need to work with international sports federations to reach 50% women athlete participation, which was a goal echoed in the Olympic Agenda 2020+5.\n\nWe were delighted to see these moves because setting goals allows governing bodies to pave a pathway to progress for girls and women in sport.\n\nAfghans competing at Paris Olympics:Taliban have not succeeded in crushing women's sport nor women's spirits\n\nLet us be clear, the 2024 Summer Olympics reaching gender parity will be an extraordinary accomplishment, but it should not overshadow the persistent inequities still at play for women throughout the Games, particularly for para-athletes and coaches.\n\nAlthough there have been notable strides toward parity in the Paralympics, women athletes continually lag behind their Olympic counterparts. During the 2020 Tokyo Games, women athlete participation compared with men hovered around 42%, while women in the Olympics neared 48%.\n\nToo few women compete in Paralympics\n\nIt is disappointing that four years later, women athlete participation in the Paralympics is expected to remain stagnant. Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee has not set clear goals on how to achieve equality among athletes, and its program overview for Paris shows that women athlete participation will stay put at 42%.\n\nThe importance of investing in and actively promoting women athletes with disabilities is critical and cannot be overstated. Staggering data shows that 90% of women with disabilities are not active in sport, and boys with disabilities consistently participate in sport at higher rates than girls with disabilities.\n\nObserving women athletes play, compete and thrive on a global platform, like the Paralympics, can help encourage girls and women with disabilities to come off the sidelines and experience the lifelong benefits of sport participation.\n\nOlympian Simone Biles:My life could have been very different. That's why I'm a voice for others.\n\nFurther, the state of play for women in coaching roles throughout the Olympics and Paralympics is woefully lagging. In Tokyo, only 13% of coaches were women. As for the U.S. roster, the percentage is only slightly higher at 21.1%. Of the five Paralympic team sports in which the U.S. women competed, all five were coached by men.\n\nThis trend mirrors what is being seen throughout collegiate sports, where there has been a drastic decline of women in head coaching roles – an unfortunate trend following the passage of Title IX as men saw the profitability of coaching women’s sports and over time secured the majority of coaching positions.\n\nGrowing the pipeline for women coaches at all levels is vital to ensuring that women make it onto the Olympic Games’ coaching rosters. Gender bias is a systemic issue in collegiate women’s sports and among collegiate women coaches; 80% believe it is easier for men to secure high-level coaching jobs, salary increases and multiyear contracts.\n\nSports is one of the most powerful ways to advance women in society because girls who play go on to become women who lead. To the millions of Americans expected to tune into the Paris Games, there is more that you can do besides cheer.\n\nIt is estimated that it will take more than a century for women to achieve equality with men throughout society. But we can help speed up the clock by addressing the inequities on the field of play, in the front office and beyond, and find tangible ways to invest in the ever-evolving world of women’s sports.\n\nDanette Leighton is CEO of the Women’s Sports Foundation.

Michael Kappeler/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Summer Games are often heralded as a melting pot – 11,417 athletes from 206 countries and regions across 33 sports participated in Tokyo 2020 – the Winter Games are nowhere near as diverse, with 91 delegations taking part at Beijing 2022.\n\nThat’s five times more than the number of teams represented in the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France in 1924.\n\nBut athletes from Africa, South Asia, as well as those from smaller island nations still find themselves struggling to qualify for competition in the Winter Olympics due to warmer climates, the prohibitively high cost of equipment, lack of infrastructure and limited opportunities to practice and compete.\n\nAnd one athlete and his coaches that CNN interviewed for this story warn that continental quota systems that allowed countries and regions with smaller Winter Olympic delegations the opportunity to establish and expand in sliding sports in PyeongChang 2018 were scrapped ahead of Beijing, with a knock-on effect on African countries.\n\nA push for diversity, with limited success\n\nMore countries are making their debut in the Winter Olympics.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Haiti each sent an alpine skier to Beijing while Nigeria and Eritrea competed in the Winter Games for the second time after making their debut in PyeongChang 2018. In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number.\n\nBut just five African countries participated in this year’s Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nEuropean and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.\n\nBut climate isn’t the only factor affecting Olympic participation – when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations.\n\nAt PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway – one of the world’s wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million – topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it “aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone.”\n\nIt allocates a “substantial portion” of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help “athletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need.”\n\nSome 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to “support qualification efforts,” according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships.\n\nOnly NOCs “whose athletes had a proven winter sports track record” had access to the program, the IOC said.\n\nMeanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.\n\nAthletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000.\n\nScholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds – derived from Olympic revenue – towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.\n\nCNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding.\n\nRacial diversity not reflected\n\nOn a national level, the composition of delegations often isn’t very racially diverse.\n\n“There have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don’t know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries,” Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport.\n\nBlack athletes have proven crucial to Team USA’s Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.\n\nBut even as Black athletes won medals at Beijing – speedskater Erin Jackson brought home gold, while bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor became the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history – White athletes still made up the majority of Team USA at the Games this year.\n\nPrior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.\n\nIn 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA’s first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies’ figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002.\n\nHockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US.\n\nFour years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy.\n\nOverall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level. Though she demonstrated technical excellence in her routines, Black French skater Surya Bonaly never won an Olympic medal.\n\nSurya Bonaly of France performs a backflip in her free skate routine in the women's Olympic figure skating in Nagano on February 20, 1998. Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBonaly performed a one-bladed backflip at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics – an illegal move that was perceived as an act of defiance to the judges – which she landed on one foot.\n\nThat move is still illegal and has never been tried since in an Olympic competition.\n\n“They want to keep the girls pretty, in a special way,” Bonaly told CNN Sport as she reflected on her career. Though now, according to Bonaly, “people are changing and trying to challenge themselves, and try to have more personality in their own style. And that’s good. And it’s more accepted.”\n\nBonaly added: “Now, back then … you only came from one mold, one way.”\n\nBlack athletes are now prevalent in sliding sports: African American women comprise a majority of America’s Olympic bobsled team.\n\nNathan Chen skates during the Men's Free Skating program at Beijing 2022 on February 10, 2022.

Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women’s hockey player in US team history.\n\nPay to play economics\n\nExperts say that economics – not just talent – plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics.\n\n“That notion of economics is very key because we’re looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating – and that equipment alone costs so much,” Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.\n\n“Pay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money,” Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN.\n\n“It becomes not just a racialized issue, it’s a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody’s going to be a working-class hero,” she said.\n\nWith stories of parents remortgaging their homes, working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children’s Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.\n\nGhana’s first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.\n\n“This does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay,” he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season.\n\nJamaica’s first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: “I’m competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young.”\n\n“And now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement,” he said.\n\nIn 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes’ rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable.\n\nThe athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.\n\nShiva Keshavan, a six-time Olympian and India’s only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.\n\n“Athletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don’t have the systems in place that enable a successful career.\n\n“Often, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach,” he added.\n\nMany elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they’re growing up.\n\nBode Miller – the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals – attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he “wouldn’t have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia.”\n\nParents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has “earned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries.”\n\nPrivately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.\n\nThe study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.\n\n“If your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski,” Alexander told CNN.\n\n“If we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don’t have as much disposable income as their White counterparts,” Alexander said.\n\nAdding that he doesn’t think” winter sports are racist at all,” Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports.\n\n“I just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology … then I believe the tide will turn.”\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it “fully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games.”\n\n“We have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality,” it added.\n\n“Some sports in all reality are more accessible,” James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.\n\n“But you can’t sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you’ve got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there’s factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven,” he said.\n\n“And that’s not something that us at the IOC are going to change.\n\n“All sports have different levels of access,” Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport “tries to look at.”\n\nThe IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations “to ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports’ structures and priorities.”\n\n“Collectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport,” it added.\n\nInfrastructure challenges\n\nWinter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia – notably in Japan, South Korea and China. But it remains an “unexplored market” in India, Keshavan said.\n\n“For India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.\n\n“We don’t really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities,” he said.\n\nThis year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India’s nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.\n\nKhan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport.\n\nShiva Keshavan of India reacts following run 3 during the Luge Men's Singles on day two of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images\n\n“Of course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment,” he said.\n\n“Skiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training,” he added.\n\nAthletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come.\n\nFrimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don’t necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow.\n\n“But that doesn’t matter,” he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said.\n\n“You can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I’ll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It’s not like it’s impossible,” he said.\n\n“Infrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in,” Macleod told CNN adding: “That’s within the remit of the national government.”\n\n“Often, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure,” Macleod said.\n\n“We as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa – that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs,” he added.\n\n“Each of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, ‘Actually, we’re not going to invest in winter sports because that’s not a priority for us.’\n\n“‘We’re going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.’ And they will always have to make that choice of where they’re going to put their funding and what programs from our side they’re going to apply for,” he said.\n\n“We put at the disposal of our stakeholders – whether it’s NOCs or the IFs (international federations) – a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities,” he said.\n\nRepresentation matters\n\nCarter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations’ final offerings.\n\n“For many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself,” she added.\n\nIn winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique.\n\n“If you don’t see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do,” she added.\n\nSome sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said.\n\n“But the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility – and have the bobsled – is very limited in general,” she added.\n\nAhmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.\n\n“We see a general trend in … Summer Games – you’ve got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You’ve got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes,” Ahmed added.\n\nDitching continental quotas a step backwards for inclusion\n\nFrimpong and Nigeria’s Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation’s (IBSF) continental quota system.\n\nBut the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games – something coaches had warned would deliver a “crushing blow” to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.\n\nCoaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that “inequitable quotas that didn’t take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.\n\n“The dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport,” they wrote.\n\nAkwasi Frimpong of Ghana starts his men's skeleton training session at the Olympic Sliding Centre, during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 12, 2018.

Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\n“An exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible,” they added in the email.\n\nThe quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing – a decision which directly affected Frimpong.\n\n“Giving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system,” an IOC representative told Frimpong’s coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN.\n\n“I qualified as Ghana’s first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa,” Frimpong told CNN.\n\nFrimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.\n\n“Now, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games – to be able to qualify outright,” he told CNN.\n\nOn December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics.\n\nFrimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant “I could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good – maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever – but I’m good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners.”\n\nFrimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports “for qualified African athletes who can safely compete.”\n\n“We’re not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we’re not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card.\n\n“But if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there’s enough African athletes,” he added.\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.\n\n“To address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nNo athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal.\n\n“We were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it’s less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it’s disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority,” Frimpong added.\n\nBut there is hope – even if only for a select few athletes.\n\nAmerican bobsledder Meyers Taylor’s bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis’ four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.\n\nWhen asked about passing Davis’ record saying, she said: “That is overwhelming. It’s so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I’m part of a legacy that’s bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody.\n\n“We want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be.\n\n“So, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.”\n\nUPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the IOC’s most recent individual Olympic Solidarity scholarship data.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt Marco Chacon", "Amy Woodyatt", "Marco Chacon"], "publish_date": "2022/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/02/05/winter-olympics-jazmine-fenlator-jamaica-bobsled/301619002/", "title": "Winter Olympics: Wayne's Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian to make history", "text": "Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian had just been in the Olympics. Now she couldn't get out of bed.\n\nThe Wayne native returned from the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, where she and Lolo Jones finished 11th competing for the United States in the two-man bobsled, and she was drained.\n\nShe was emotionally and physically exhausted. Almost as soon as she landed back in New Jersey, she fell ill. She could barely move.\n\nEven after recovering, she still wasn't herself. Fatigued, unmotivated.\n\nYet Fenlator-Victorian's competitiveness never dimmed completely.\n\n\"I always had a spark in me and urge to continue, but there was this looming dark cloud for a little bit that took some time for me to work through,\" Fenlator-Victorian said in an email interview with The Record and NorthJersey.com.\n\nFour years later, the Wayne Valley graduate is headed back to the Olympics.\n\nAnd it's a historic return.\n\nWith the goal of promoting diversity and inclusion, Fenlator-Victorian switched from competing for the United States to Jamaica in 2015 and began the daunting task of qualifying for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, which begin on Friday.\n\nNot only did Fenlator-Victorian help build Jamaica's bobsled team from scratch, but she earned that qualification and will pilot Jamaica's first Olympic women's bobsled team in history.\n\nThe story continues below the embed.\n\n\"I am a dual citizen for Jamaica and the U.S.A.,\" said Fenlator-Victorian, whose father is from Jamaica. \"It was always a dream of mine to compete in the Olympic Games, and I achieved that in 2014 as a member of the U.S.A. Olympic Team. But I have always wanted to represent both my nations, all my diversity, all my cultures, and inspire the future generations across by ensuring I represent all of myself. It is an amazing feeling and truly humbling to be able to compete for Jamaica but also build a legacy with creating history in the process.\"\n\nFenlator-Victorian said her decision to switch from competing for the U.S. to Jamaica had nothing to do with simply changing teams or trying to find an easier way to qualify.\n\nIt had everything to do with shining a light on diversity.\n\n\"My passion for culture, my heritage, my representation, my voice but most importantly a platform for expansion of diversity and inclusion is what drove this decision home,\" Fenlator-Victorian said. \"I hope this historic Olympic first and my team's participation will open doors of discussion and action for other nations to take the plunge to participate.\"\n\nStill, the challenge was enormous.\n\nFenlator-Victorian was attempting to qualify as Jamaica's first women's bobsled team, meaning she and her teammates had to essentially build the program from scratch. Equipment, travel — all of it was costly.\n\nFunding it came with sacrifices.\n\n\"In fact at one point my teammates and I were on food rations. We cleaned out the fridge and made soup to last us; as the soup ran low we added water to stretch it, because we had no funds for gas and food left and needed to get by for one more week,\" Fenlator-Victorian said. \"There are a lot of low points in the process — they make you stronger, they truly test your will, your desire/passion, your adaptability, your mental stability and strength, ultimately helping prepare you to be your best.\"\n\nThrough it all, she has looked to her mother, Susan, for inspiration. Susan has courageously fought a long battle with lupus, showing a level of resiliency that amazes her daughter.\n\n\"As I have watched her grow and revolutionize her situation to become a better and better person even in her older adult life, I am continuously in awe,\" Fenlator-Victorian said. \"She is my hero, always has been.\"\n\nNews:Special Olympics bowlers enjoy the thrill of competition at Wayne event\n\nNew Jersey's Greg Olsen:Pro Football Hall of Fame something I dream about\n\nWayne:Ice House celebrates 20 years, skaters bound for the Olympics\n\nFour years ago, achieving this goal didn't seem likely.\n\nFenlator-Victorian barely had enough energy to get out of bed, let alone qualify for another Olympics.\n\nYet the Wayne native did just that.\n\nShe'll be competing this time around with a whole new perspective.\n\n\"Experience is always beneficial.

But ski jumping and Nordic combined contribute to the gap\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – To hear the International Olympic Committee tell it, gender equity is just around the corner.\n\nUshered in by the organization’s addition of mixed team events over the past three Winter Olympics, the most gender equal Games are happening here in Beijing, organizers declare.\n\nDespite that, the Games are hardly equal and contrary to the IOC’s proclamations, the mixed team events have done little to make them so.\n\nA USA TODAY Sports analysis of mixed team events in these Games found that rather than improve the place of women at the Olympics, those mixed team competitions draw few new athletes in and favor men both in participation and medals.\n\nRather than helping women catch up to the men, they leave them behind in the name of equity.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\n“Adding mixed events sounds good on paper but in reality, it doesn't benefit the number of women one would assume it would,” said Nicole LaVoi, director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport.\n\n“It is one step but one at the bottom of a very long staircase where gender equity resides at top landing.”\n\nSince 2014, the IOC has added mixed events in nine sports, including with the addition of mixed team aerials, ski jumping, snowboardcross and short track speedskating here. It has also added several in the Summer Olympics. With the addition of monobob for women and men’s and women’s big air for freeskiers, the IOC asserts these Games as the most gender equal.\n\nThat’s true – but largely because of its lackluster history on the issue. As recently as Torino in 2006, women made up less than 40% of Games participants. It has taken four Games to get to 45% in Beijing.\n\n“These are actually very, very important because it sends a signal from the IOC to the national Olympic committees that the mixed events are important, that they need to build up the capacity of their women’s teams and invest in their women athletes,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said, adding that the progression will also occur in individual events.\n\nFour years ago, the IOC commissioned a gender equality review, which resulted in 25 recommendations related to participation, funding, governance and portrayal in media. It set a goal for equal numbers of athlete quotas — a total number of slots available per sport that it allocates in coordination with the international federations — and medal events for men and women by the Paris Summer Games in 2024 and Milan Cortina Winter Games in 2026.\n\nBut big gaps remain – everything from total participants to inequality in distances of races and outright exclusion of women in one discipline.\n\nAnd the IOC’s primary solution – mixed team events – isn’t solving the problem.\n\n“These may be a great idea, but the only statistic that matters is overall participation numbers,” said Roger Pielke Jr., a professor who studies sport governance at the University of Colorado.\n\n“Equity is measured in terms of individuals, not sports, not disciplines, not team competitions.”\n\nMixed team events don't close the gap\n\nFor U.S. aerials skier Ashley Caldwell, a mixed team event helped her get her first Olympic medal.\n\nThe veteran paired with Christopher Lillis and Justin Schoenfeld to win the event in its debut.\n\n“This is my fourth Games, and I’ve been in the hunt for a gold medal my entire career,” she said. “To do it with these guys is incredible.”\n\nUndoubtedly, the presence of women in mixed team events does give them more medal chances. But it does the same for men and does nothing to close the gap between the two.\n\nAccording to Olympic historian Bill Mallon, Beijing has 51 events for men, 46 for women and 12 mixed or open events. Adding those 12 to each gender still leaves a gap.\n\nBut it does allow the IOC to tout that women are competing in 53% of events in Beijing. What it avoids saying is men are competing in 58% of events as a result of the mixed events.\n\n“If mixed events are added, that means men are also being added which does not address equity or equality issues,” LaVoi said. “Simply adding mixed events does not solve systemic gender equity issues that are embedded in the IOC.”\n\nIndeed, it exacerbates them.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports analyzed the eight mixed team events that have been contested so far. Alpine’s mixed team parallel is not until Saturday and start lists were not available.\n\nOf the 361 athletes who competed in them, more than 94% were already here competing in other events. In other words, the mixed team events overwhelmingly didn’t draw new athletes to the Games but instead relied on an existing pool of Olympians.\n\nMore than that, the athletes who did come here for mixed team events did little to create gender equity. A total of 21 athletes participated just in the mixed team event – 12 of them were women and nine were men, meaning women netted at total of three spots.\n\nRather than just giving more women medal opportunities, the mixed team events stunningly give the advantage to men.\n\nTake aerials, for example. Though teams are required to have one man and one woman, they can choose either for the third athlete on the team. All six teams selected just one woman, meaning twice as many men competed in the event and twice as many men medaled.\n\nIn luge, the contrast is worse. Teams are made up of a one man, one woman and a doubles team – but the doubles team all consisted of two men.\n\nThose inequities led to men having 35 more spots than women on mixed teams. And because of those inequities, 51 of the medalists from those events are men while 41 are women.\n\nThe IOC did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Sports about mixed team events and the inequities they create.\n\nU.S. female bobsledders make a push for more opportunities\n\nMixed team events have not been the only ones the Olympics have added for women. But the new ones here help show the continuing problem with closing the gap.\n\nMonobob was contested here for the first time, giving women two bobsled events to be on par with the men. And it did draw in six pilots who were not here driving a 2-woman sled, the women’s other event.\n\nBut it’s not actually what the athletes wanted.\n\nLed by Americans Kaillie Humphries and Elana Meyers Taylor, women pushed for the addition of a 4-person sled – like the men have.\n\n“Me and Kaillie fought for four-person, the women before us fought for four-person,” Meyers Taylor said. “But the first thing was getting two opportunities. … I think four-woman was the better option just because it gives the brakemen more choice, more options.”\n\nThe International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation opted for monobob, a move that largely benefits women who are already here piloting 2-person sleds. Indeed, before Humphries and Meyers Taylor took gold and silver, respectively, this week, each had three Olympic medals.\n\n“What I would love to see, not only for women’s bobsled but bobsled in general, is that eventually women get four-man and that men can do monobob,” Humphries said. “Three events for all athletes, regardless of gender, would really push the needle and move the sport forward.\n\n“It would allow for more small nations within men’s bobsled, more participation for women if we can get women’s four-man going, and just greater opportunity for more athletes worldwide.”\n\nThe IOC touted that it has reached an equal number of athlete quotas in 10 of the 15 disciplines. Bobsleigh is not one of them.\n\nRaces not equal in distance or duration\n\nIndeed, participation for women lags behind.\n\nAccording to the IOC’s statistics, 1,315 women are competing here compared to 1,587 men. All athletes compete in one of those two categories, though all might not identify with them. American figure skater Timothy LeDuc is the first openly nonbinary Winter Olympian.\n\nTwo sports contribute disproportionately to that gap.\n\nIn ski jumping, which was added for women in 2014 – 90 years after the men started competing in it in the Olympics – women are still restricted to the normal hill. There is no women’s individual event on the large hill nor a team event, as there is for the men.\n\nThat’s only slightly better than Nordic combined, which men have competed in at the Olympics since the start of the modern Games. Though the International Ski Federation held world championships for women in that event – which combines ski jumping and cross country skiing – it remains the only event in Summer or Winter Olympics that women do not compete in.\n\nThe IOC’s gender equity report calls for competitions to be equal in distance or duration. Biathlon and cross country skiing abound with races that are longer lengths for men and shorter lengths for women. In cross country, some are double the distance.\n\nTo be sure, the IOC is not alone in creating these problems. It works with the international federations for each sport to try to address these issues.\n\nBut the events in the Olympic program are the IOC’s responsibility.\n\n“We have made good progress here, going from 41% female participation in Pyeongchang to 45% here in Beijing, at the same time increasing the number of events,” IOC President Thomas Bach said earlier in the Games.\n\nThe IOC has increased events, but largely they have been mixed team ones that do not actually contribute to gender equity.\n\nTo many, that’s no longer acceptable.\n\n“The Olympics have indeed made progress,” Pielke Jr. said. “But we should always remember that progress is measured against a baseline where women were not allowed to compete at all. Progress is no longer enough.\n\n“This should be the last unequal Olympic Games.”\n\nContributing: Nancy Armour", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/sport/olympic-artistic-swimming-men-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Men to compete in Olympic Artistic Swimming for first time at Paris ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMale athletes will be allowed to compete in Olympic Artistic Swimming events for the first time at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the aquatic sports’ global governing body FINA said on Thursday.\n\nThe news comes after the International Olympic Committee approved World Aquatics’ request to permit the inclusion of men at the Games.

Michael Dalder/Reuters\n\nAmerican athlete Bill May, who became the inaugural winner of the mixed duet technical event alongside Christina Jones in 2015, hailed the landmark announcement.\n\n“The inclusion of men in Olympic Artistic Swimming was once considered the impossible dream,” May said.\n\n“This proves that we should all dream big. The male athletes have endured. Now, through their perseverance and the help and support of so many, all athletes may stand alongside each other equally, reaching for Olympic glory,” May added.", "authors": ["Matt Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/06/15/nordic-combined-winter-olympics-2026-milan-cortina/7638731001/", "title": "Winter Olympics may not include Nordic combined for first time at ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNordic combined, which uniquely tests skiers on jaw-dropping jumps and heart-pounding trails, has been a part of the Winter Olympics since 1924. Its time might be up.\n\nIt is the only Olympic sport without women and the International Olympic Committee is due to make a decision later this month about whether to allow women to compete in Nordic combined at the 2026 Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo Games.\n\nThere is the possibility, however, that Nordic combined is dropped entirely from the Olympics, according to athletes and advocates.\n\n“What I heard loud and clear in back channels is that the solution to take care of the gender equity dirty secret is to take men out of the program for 2026,\" said Billy Demong, a five-time Olympian in Nordic combined and member of USA Nordic’s board of directors. “To take away one of the original sports from the first Winter Olympics would be tragic, short-sighted and misguided.\"\n\nThe IOC said final decisions on the 2026 Olympics program of medal events are scheduled to be decided at a June 24 meeting of its executive board, chaired by president Thomas Bach.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nCHASING GOLD: Get the lastest Olympics news straight to your Inbox\n\n“We're seeing sports such as ski mountaineering added and I'm hearing the IOC does not want to increase the number of athletes and the solution is take men out of Nordic combined,\" Demong said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMen in the Nordic combined have been publicly pushing on social media and elsewhere for women to be included, adding a mixed team format as another Olympic medal event, and are now bracing for their future as athletes on the world's stage.\n\nJasper Good, who competed for the U.S. earlier this year at the Beijing Olympics, said he was “blindsided” by the possibility.\n\n“Information is trickling to us from athlete groups from around the world and national governing bodies, and most of us didn't realize the sport is in jeopardy,\" he said.\n\nInternational Ski Federation Nordic combined race director Lasse Ottesen said he has not heard officially from the IOC about men potentially being eliminated from the Olympic program.\n\n“We do hear speculation from different sides,\" Ottesen said Wednesday. “If the IOC, for some reason, would make a decision not to include women for the ‘26 events, what would happen with the men's? Would that be sort of a signal to say you're on for the ‘26 events, but for ‘30, we are thinking gender equality and then the men are out.\"\n\nNordic combined skiers must have finesse and fearlessness for ski jumping while training to have the strength and stamina necessary for a 10-kilometer cross-country course. The athlete who wins the ski jumping stage starts the cross-country race in the front of the pack, followed by the rest of the competition in their order of finish and then they race to the line for gold.\n\nWhile Nordic combined is a fringe sport in the United States, it is very popular in parts of Europe and Japan.\n\n“It’s really big in countries like Norway, Germany and Austria,” U.S. Olympic Nordic combined skier Jared Shumate said. “Those three countries usually dominate the world cup podiums, and Olympic podiums. And obviously, we don’t have quite the same fame.”\n\nAnnika Malacinski is one of dozens of women around the world who have sacrificed a lot of time and money to go for Olympic gold. The 21-year-old Malacinski, who has American-Finnish dual citizenship and competes for the U.S., had high hopes of competing in China dashed in 2018.\n\nThe IOC executive board considered denied an application then that would have allowed her and other women to compete in Nordic combined at the Beijing Games. IOC sports director Kit McConnell said then that development in terms of the universality, competitiveness,and following was needed.\n\nDuring the 2022 season, nearly 40 women competed at the highest level of the sport in a successful follow to the debut World Cup season for women a year ago.\n\n“There's no reason that we shouldn’t be in the Olympics,” said Norway’s Ida Marie Hagen, who finished No. 2 in the World Cup standings. “The level is getting higher. There's also a lot of athletes from different continents.”\n\nThe IOC is proud to point to improvements made toward gender equality, saying the Beijing Games set new marks for female competitors by increasing participation to 45% from 41% in 2018. The 2024 Paris Games are expected to be the first Olympics with as many women as men competing.\n\nAlas, the Olympics' Instagram post to point that out led to another round a flurry of responses calling for women to be included in Nordic combined.\n\n“It makes it just so much more intense, especially when the decision is only a week away,\" Malacinski told the AP.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/01/23/its-men-only-in-nordic-combined-at-the-olympics-for-now/49689157/", "title": "It's men only in Nordic combined at the Olympics for now", "text": "AP\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — Like her brother, Annika Malacinski dreams of going to the Olympics in Nordic combined.\n\nAs wintry weather settled in at the Olympic Jumping Complex and Mount Van Hoevenberg last fall, she and Niklas trained together in this tiny town that hosted the 1980 and 1932 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe siblings fearlessly took flight off a ski jump and relentlessly pushed themselves on paved paths in roller skis alongside other Olympic hopefuls. Through it all, 20-year-old Annika knew she had no shot at competing in China in February.\n\nNordic combined, which combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing, is the only Olympic sport without gender equity: There is no women's competition at the Games.\n\n“I think it’s absurd that one person can fulfill his dreams this upcoming year and one just has to keep pushing for it to be in 2026,\" she said.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nNiklas Malacinski, who like his sister holds US-Finnish dual citizenship, agreed.\n\n“It isn't right,\" he said. “Even though we're both in the same sport, it's hard to talk about goals with her because I don't want to make it sound like I'm bragging about what I have a chance to do, and she does not.\"\n\nThe 18-year old Malacinski finished sixth at the U.S. trials and just missed being one of five Americans competing in Nordic combined in China. Perhaps at the Milan-Cortina Games in 2026, the sister and brother from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, will both have a chance to go for gold.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee executive board considered an application in 2018 that would have allowed women to compete in Nordic combined at the Beijing Games. After discussions with the International Ski Federation, the application was denied.\n\n“The inclusion of any women’s events in the Olympic Games are really important in promoting gender equality, but they also need to be at a level appropriate to be included in the Olympic Games and contesting an Olympic medal,\" IOC sports director Kit McConnell said in 2018. “We have seen developments in that regard. But I think there was a general feeling that further development in terms of the universality, the competitiveness of the event, and the attractiveness and following of it needed to needed to be seen before that discussion could happen again for 2026.\"\n\nTalks will resume later this year. In June, the IOC executive board is expected to decide on an application to give women access to Olympic gold in Nordic combined in 2026.\n\nWomen in the sport, and advocates for their participation in the Olympics, are optimistic about the chances for inclusion in Italy. More than 30 female athletes are competing this winter at the highest level of the sport after the debut World Cup season for women a year ago.\n\n“I’ll be surprised if we’re not able to bring them in, although you never know,\" FIS Nordic combined race director Lasse Ottesen said recently in an interview with The Associated Press. “We've seen fantastic development the last two years. We have more and more nations taking part, and the athletes have developed in very fast to get to a good level. All the boxes have been checked from our point of view.\n\n“Gender equity is important for the IOC, and FIS, and by bringing Nordic combined in that would complete the program in the Olympics.\"\n\nWhile the IOC will likely face another round of questions and criticism when the Games begin with women shut out in Nordic combined, the governing body is proud to point to improvements made toward gender equality.\n\nThe IOC said the Beijing Games will set new marks for female competitors and women's sports based on decisions its executive board made in 2018, increasing participation to 45% from 41% four years ago.\n\nMixed team formats, such as one in ski jumping, were added to provide women with more opportunities, and sports such as speed skating now have as many women as men competing for the first time at the Olympics.\n\nTara Gerhaghty-Moats isn't in the mood to celebrate.\n\nGerhaghty-Moats won the first World Cup Nordic combined competition for women in December 2020 after being a two-time champion of the second-tier Continental Cup. She was disheartened that the rest of the debut season's events were canceled during the pandemic and were not rescheduled as some of the men's competitions were.\n\nLast spring, she switched to biathlon.\n\n“Being in Nordic combined showed me the underbelly of what the Olympics is all about, which is not a pristine image,\" Gerhaghty-Moats told AP. “FIS does not have a lot of power over the IOC, and no one holds the IOC accountable.\"\n\nEarlier this month, women and men competed together in the first World Cup mixed team event in Nordic combined. Annika Malacinski teamed up with Alexa Brabec, Taylor Fletcher and Jared Shumate to put the Americans sixth of eight nations in Italy.\n\nShe lamented the gender inequity that will force her and other women to wait and hope they will have a chance to live their dreams in four years.\n\n“I think it’s insane that we are living in the 20th century and we are still experiencing inequality not only in our daily lives, but over a sport that we put our souls into,” she said. “Doesn’t feel good at all. As much as I love Nordic combined, it’s absolutely awful having to fight with other girls on my side to get it out to the world how we are the only Olympic sport that doesn’t have both men and women in the games for no reason at all.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage at https://twitter.com/larrylage\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/02/12/winter-olympics-2022-sunday-live-updates/6761895001/", "title": "Winter Olympics recap: Erin Jackson makes speedskating history", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nEditor's note: This page is a recap of the Sunday action in Beijing.

The United States’ +11 goal differential also leads the tournament.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nErin Jackson makes speedskating history\n\nBEIJING — The 29-year-old former inline skater won the women's 500 meters at the National Speed Skating Oval with a time of 37.04, earning her first Olympic medal in what has been her best event. She also makes history as the first Black woman to win an Olympic medal in speedskating, according to The Associated Press.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nTeam USA men's hockey holds lead entering third period\n\nBEIJING — Nick Abruzzese’s falling, wraparound pass to Matt Knies that set up the United States’ second goal gave the U.S. a 2-1 lead in the second period.\n\nGermany challenged the play for goaltender interference, but the goal stood. The U.S. penalty kill was key again. Germany is now 0-for-5 with the man advantage.\n\nThe Americans will start the final period on their own power play. Goaltender Drew Commesso has 15 saves.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nU.S. men's hockey team tied up after one period\n\nBEIJING — For the second straight game, the U.S. men’s hockey team went down early.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Americans refused to stay down for long.\n\nGermany scored two minutes into Sunday’s preliminary round contest on a power play. The U.S. gained its own one-skater advantage 1 minute and 14 seconds later, and Steven Kamper’s blast from the left point breezed by German goaltender Danny aus den Birken to equalize 4:26 into the game.\n\nThe rest of the period was highlighted by German defender Korbinian Holzer’s outburst from the bench after his teammate Marcel Brandt took a shot to the groin. In a mostly quiet arena, Holzer’s profanity was quite audible – and the bad blood between the two teams lasted until refs had to escort both teams off the ice after the first 20 minutes.\n\nThe U.S. took three penalties, including a double-minor high-stick call on Kenny Agostino, while the Germans took two. Germany has a slight lead in shots on goal 9-8 and faceoffs are even at nine apiece.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nU.S. men's speedskating team easily advances to semifinals\n\nBEIJING — The United States men's speedskating team advanced to the semifinals in the team pursuit Sunday — and came less than half a second within the Olympic record in the process.\n\nThe team of Ethan Cepuran, Casey Dawson and Emery Lehman finished just four-hundredths of a second behind Norway in the opening round of competition, in which teams of three race eight laps in a single-file line.\n\nRussia and the Netherlands are the other two teams that advanced to the semis, which are Tuesday. The final will take place later that night.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nDecision looms on Kamila Valieva's doping case\n\nBEIJING — The news of Kamila Valieva's failed drug test has become one of the defining subplots of the Games – casting a pall over the figure skating competition in Beijing, and drawing attention away from what's happening on the ice.\n\nAll eyes will be on the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which is expected to announce a ruling on Valieva's eligibility later Monday afternoon.\n\n\"The conversation is unfortunate, because we're at the Olympics, right?\" American figure skater Mariah Bell said Saturday, when asked about Valieva.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nNorway’s Marte Olsbu Roeiseland wins 3rd Olympic gold in 10K pursuit\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Marte Olsbu Roeiseland earned her third gold medal of the Beijing Olympics, and fourth medal overall, by winning the women’s biathlon 10-kilometer pursuit race Sunday.\n\nThe Norwegian started the race with a lead because of her win in the sprint race and hit 19 of her 20 targets. Despite strong winds and blowing snow, Roeiseland held her focus and shot cleanly in the last standing stop to win in 34 minutes, 46.9 seconds.\n\nElvira Oeberg, who was second in the sprint race and started 31 seconds behind Roeiseland, had three misses in her second and third shooting bouts, but cleaned the last standing to finish 1:36.5 behind for silver.\n\nTiril Eckhoff of Norway also missed three targets but came in 1:48.7 behind her teammate for the bronze medal.\n\nRoeiseland previously won gold in the mixed relay as well as the sprint. She also won bronze in the individual race.\n\nIn her first Olympic appearance, Oeberg has won two silver medals. Eckhoff earned her first medal of the Beijing Games.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nU.S. men's hockey team can punch ticket to quarterfinals vs. Germany\n\nBEIJING — The goal-differential math will likely work out for the U.S. men’s hockey team, but the Americans can punch their ticket to the Olympic quarterfinals for certain with a victory over Germany on Sunday.\n\nTeam USA enters the final game of preliminary play with the best differential (+10) in the tournament, thanks to an 8-0 victory over China on Thursday.\n\nDrew Commesso, the Boston University sophomore, will start again for the U.S. in net. He posted a shutout against China in the opener.\n\nAgainst Germany, Team USA will be without defender Jake Sanderson, though. After missing the first game of the tournament – he was traveling to Beijing, as a positive COVID-19 test delayed his arrival – Sanderson was injured in the first period in a 4-2 win against Canada. He finished the game but won’t be available Sunday.\n\nGermany is the defending silver-medalists from Pyeongchang. The quarterfinals begin Wednesday.\n\nBrendan Brisson (University of Michigan) has scored in both games and Sean Farrell (Harvard University) leads the team in points with six – five came against China.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhile you were sleeping\n\nTeam USA did not pick up any medals in Beijing on Sunday – skier River Radamus was awfully close – but there were still a few notable happenings while you were sleeping:\n\nQualifiers for women's freestyle skiing aerials postponed due to snowstorm\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – The women’s aerials qualification round at Genting Snow Park A&M Stadium was postponed Sunday night because of a snowstorm that has settled over the area.\n\nQualifying was pushed back to Monday and the final to Tuesday. The switch avoids putting the gold-medal round directly against the Super Bowl, which is also being televised by NBC.\n\nThe men’s slopestyle qualification also was switched from Monday to Tuesday, with its final now set for Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. has four women in the field of 25 freestyle skiers:\n\nMegan Nick, 25, of Shelburne, Vermont, who took 15th place at a recent World Cup event in Deer Valley, Utah. This is her first Olympics.\n\nKaila Kuhn, 18, of Boyne City, Michigan, is currently ranked 13th in the world. She grew up near Boyne USA ski resort and at the age of 14, won the Nor-Am series – the youngest to do so.\n\nAshley Caldwell, 28, of Ashburn, Virginia, is a four-time Olympian who took 10th in Sochi in 2014 as well as Vancouver in 2010, and 17th in Pyeongchang. She just helped Team USA take the gold in the debut of mixed aerials two days ago.\n\nWinter Vinecki, 23, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, is ranked 14th overall in the world this season. The triathlete-turned-aerial skier began racing at the age of 5 and completed her first Olympic distance triathlons at 9. She’s the youngest person ever to complete a marathon in Antarctica, at just 14, where she finished 11th overall in the Antarctica Marathon and was the third female to finish with a time of 4 hours, 49 minutes.\n\nSnow began falling on Saturday and continued all day Sunday, with accumulation canceling or postponing several events and training sessions.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nKaillie Humphries: 'It's very motivating and inspiring for me' to be competing for Team USA at Olympics\n\nBEIJING — Kaillie Humphries feels like an Olympic rookie again.\n\nThese are the fourth Games for the two-time bobsled gold medalist but her first with the United States. She wasn’t even sure she’d be able to compete at the Beijing Olympics until Dec. 2, when she became a U.S. citizen.\n\n“I know how to go through an Olympics, but obviously I haven’t done it for Team USA. Even walking in the halls and being right next door to Mikaela Shiffrin, I’m like, 'Ahh!’ ” Humphries said Sunday after taking a commanding lead midway through the monobob competition.\n\n“It’s very motivating and inspiring for me to be on the same team as Shaun White, Mikaela Shiffrin. Chloe Kim was on my flight over,” Humphries said. “I want to be able to put my best foot forward as they do. I want to be able to represent the Stars and Stripes to the best of my ability, and give back to a country that has adopted me, that has given me a longer career and has given me a safe place to compete.”\n\nHumphries represented Canada, where she was born, at the Vancouver, Sochi and Pyeongchang Games, winning golds in 2010 and 2014 and a bronze in 2018. But she asked for her release in 2019 after filing a complaint alleging verbal and emotional abuse by Todd Hays, the Canadian bobsled coach.\n\nHays has denied the allegations. The investigation into the case is ongoing.\n\nHumphries has lived in the United States since 2016 and married her husband, former U.S. bobsledder Travis Armbruster, in 2019. Though she represented the United States internationally the previous two seasons, she had to be an American citizen to compete at the Olympics – and becoming a citizen is a laborious process.\n\nBut she’s a full-fledged American now, with the U.S. flag painted on her helmet and her long, blonde hair tied back with a red, white and blue scarf.\n\n“I’m very honored the U.S. has backed me the way it has,” Humphries said.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nU.S. skier River Radamus just misses out on medal in men's giant slalom\n\nBEIJING – Marco Odermatt has owned the giant slalom this season, and now he owns an Olympic gold medal in the event.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swiss skier plowed through snow and poor visibility Sunday to win the men’s giant slalom at the Beijing Games.\n\n“I really risked everything in the second run because I wanted not just the medal, I wanted the gold medal,” Odermatt said. ”It’s difficult because you can lose everything but today it paid off.”\n\nIt was the first time snow fell during an Alpine skiing race at this year’s Olympics and the bad weather conditions caused the second run to be postponed by 1 hour, 15 minutes.\n\nOdermatt coped with the conditions and the delay — and a first-run mistake — to post an unofficial combined time of 2 minutes, 09.35 seconds.\n\nZan Kranjec of Slovenia took silver, 0.19 seconds behind, and world champion Mathieu Faivre of France earned bronze, 1.34 behind.\n\nTeam USA's River Radamus just missed out on a medal as he was knocked off the podium late and finished fourth. Radamus, who turned 24 on Saturday, finished 1.6 behind Odermatt and just .26 back of Faivre.\n\nThe skiers had been racing and training on artificial snow until the real thing started to fall on Saturday at the Yanqing Alpine Skiing Center. A second women’s downhill training run was canceled because of the conditions on Sunday.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nWinter weather appears to have extinguished Olympic flame\n\nBEIJING — A rare snowstorm in Beijing on Sunday brought a distinct winter vibe to the 2022 Winter Olympics. But it also might have extinguished the Olympic flame at the Bird's Nest.\n\nPhotos taken by a USA TODAY photographer early Sunday afternoon show no visible flame in the Olympic cauldron at the medals plaza outside the stadium, where it was lit during the opening ceremony on Feb. 4. The flame traditionally remains lit for the entire duration of the Olympics.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee referred questions about the flame to the Beijing 2022 organizing committee, whose spokespeople did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe Olympic flame is one of the most recognizable symbols of the Games, beyond perhaps the Olympic rings. It is lit before every edition of the Olympics at a special ceremony in Olympia, Greece, using \"the ancient method of the sun's rays in the parabolic mirror,\" according to an IOC document.\n\nThe flame is then transported to the host city through the ballyhooed torch relay, which can take several months and involve thousands of torch bearers.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nFreeskier Maggie Voisin pushes through the pain of losing her brother\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – When American freestyle skier Maggie Voisin takes to the slopestyle course at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, she will do so with a heavy heart.\n\nAfter coming back from shredded knee ligaments and a broken ankle to make it to these Games, the physical pain that she endured will not be at the forefront of her mind. Instead it will be the emotional pain.\n\nVoisin, now a 23-year-old veteran of three Olympic Games, lives with heartbreak every day that will never go away or get any better, it will only take time and practice to cope with, the best she can.\n\n“A little over a year ago I lost my brother to suicide,” said Voisin during her first week in China. “He was in the Army, so I wear his dog tag. I don’t usually wear it every day.\n\n“But I wear it when I compete and it hangs at my heart.”\n\nThis tragedy doesn’t – and shouldn’t – define 5-foot-3, 115-pound Voisin, who grew up in Whitefish, Montana, not far from Glacier National Park, an opportunistic place for all kinds of winter sports with a big family that participated in all of them.\n\nShe got so good so fast at freeski slopestyle and big air that she qualified for the 2014 Olympics and was one place away from a podium finish in slopestyle at the 2018 Games.\n\nBut in the last year, after her older brother Michael’s death on Jan. 23, 2021, Voisin tried to push through, preparing and showing up for competitions, and being unable to snap the bindings in place in this dangerous sport that requires complete concentration.\n\n\"Obviously that was just the most devastating thing that's ever happened to my family,\" Voisin told MTN Sports. \"Never in my life obviously have I experienced anything like that, or death that close to me, especially in that way and it rocked my world more than I think I ever let people know.\n\n\"I just I felt it in my performance, and I ended up only competing once last year, just because, I'll be honest, I tried to go to multiple events and just had a breakdown.\"\n\nThis, right here in China, right now, is the comeback of her life so far in a career full of them.\n\nThe question is, will she be rewarded with her first Olympic medal?\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nHumphries helped create then won first world championship trophy\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. – When Kaillie Humphries won her first world championship in bobsled, there was no trophy. There were for the winners of the two men’s events, however. Large, gleaming silver cups engraved with the names of previous champions, a celebration of both the sport’s present and its rich past.\n\nThis was in 2012, mind you, a dozen years after the women’s two-man race had made its debut at the world championships.\n\n“I grew up in a household where you could do whatever you wanted, and gender didn't play a factor at all. So when I came into bobsled, I thought, `Well, this isn't right,” Humphries said.\n\nAgain, it wasn’t about the trophy. Humphries already had her signature piece of hardware, having won the first of her two (so far) Olympic gold medals in the event two years earlier while representing Canada. But it symbolized the dismissiveness the sport has for women, seeing them as afterthoughts or interlopers rather than full and equal participants.\n\nWith an assist from her parents, Cheryl and Ray Simundson, Humphries offered to purchase a trophy that could be given to future women’s world champions. Chastened, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation took care of it, and Humphries was its first recipient the following year.\n\nThe trophy still lacked the Stanley Cup-like recognition of previous champions, however. Humphries and her parents took it upon themselves to modify it, adding the names of past winners and giving it a new base so there was room for future champions.\n\n“I hit a different part in my career where it wasn't so much about me anymore, it was about making a difference. It was about changing the game,” Humphries told USA TODAY Sports. “I'm able to stand on the shoulders of all the women that were before me. I have the opportunity to even be at an Olympics because of the women in the ‘80s and the ‘90s and the early 2000s that competed when the Olympics weren't even an option.\n\n“And I want to make sure that the women after me also have greater opportunity.”\n\nHumphries has a huge lead after the first two heats of the monobob, which is making its debut in Beijing. The final two heats are Monday.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nSwiss skier leads after first run as poor visibility mars men's giant slalom\n\nSwitzerland's Marco Odermatt skied through poor visibility amid falling snow and took the lead after the first run of the men's giant slalom on Sunday at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nOdermatt, 24, has won four of the five giant slalom races this season on the World Cup circuit and he leads the discipline standings as well as the overall standings.\n\nAfter finishing his run, the Swiss skier waved his hand in front of his face to indicate difficulty in seeing the course clearly.\n\nIt's the first time snow has fallen during an Alpine skiing race at this year's Olympics.\n\nStefan Brennsteiner of Austria was 0.04 seconds behind in second and world champion Mathieu Faivre of France was 0.08 behind in third.\n\nThe second run is scheduled for later Sunday.\n\nSnow has been falling since Saturday at the Yanqing Alpine Skiing Center, where athletes had been racing and training on artificial snow until then. A second women’s downhill training run scheduled for Sunday was canceled.\n\nMore than a third of the field failed to finish on the course known as The Ice River. After one fall, the race was slightly delayed while course workers searched for a loose ski that had become buried in the snow.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nKaillie Humphries races to huge lead after two runs of women's monobob\n\nBEIJING — Kaillie Humphries is halfway to a third Olympic gold medal.\n\nHumphries, who won gold as a driver in two-man in 2014 and 2010, has a full second lead after the first two heats of monobob Sunday. U.S. teammate Elana Meyers Taylor is in fourth, 1.32 seconds back, going into the last two heats on Monday.\n\nHumphries set the pace with her first run, establishing a track record as monobob made its Olympic debut. She was a touch slower on the second, but is still clearly the person to beat, finishing the two runs in a combined 2:09.10.\n\nChristine de Bruin of Canada, who finished fourth in the World Cup monobob standings this season, is second, 1.04 seconds behind Humphries. Laura Nolte of Germany, bronze medalists in last year’s world championships, is third, 1.22 behind Humphries.\n\nThis is the first Olympics as an American for Humphries, who represented Canada in Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014 — winning gold both times — and Pyeongchang, where she was the bronze medalist.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nRough weather postpones women's freeski slopestyle qualifying\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Qualifying in women’s freeski slopestyle was postponed on Sunday as wind and low visibility made for difficult conditions on the start.\n\nThe postponement pushed the entire freeskiing slopestyle competition back a day. Women will now have qualifying on Monday and a final on Tuesday. The men, who were originally scheduled to compete Monday, will have qualifying on Tuesday and a final on Wednesday.\n\nThe competition was originally set to start at 10 a.m. local time before organizers delayed for at least two hours. In that time, workers tried to clean snow off the top rail sections and painted lines on the course.\n\nIt continued snowing throughout the delay, and wind and visibility didn’t improve. From the base of the course, it was difficult to see beyond the last jump.\n\nBoth conditions would have made it difficult if not dangerous for athletes to compete. The course features three large jumps at the end, and not being able to see landings or, potentially worse, getting blown around in the air could easily lead to injury.\n\nBy postponing, organizers avoided the type of disaster the female snowboarders faced in Pyeongchang four years ago when the final was held in windy, adverse conditions.\n\nOrganizers expected to determine when the competition would be rescheduled later Sunday. Regardless of timing, it will make for a hectic few days for the athletes.\n\nThe women’s final and men’s qualifying had originally been scheduled for Monday, followed by the men’s final on Tuesday.\n\nThere had been a break in the freeskiing schedule set for Wednesday, but some athletes competing in the halfpipe will now have competitions on back-to-back days.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nKaillie Humphries leads after first run as women's monobob debuts\n\nBEIJING — Kaillie Humphries’ first competitive run at the Olympics as an American was a historic one.\n\nHumphries had the top time in the first heat of monobob Sunday, which is making its Olympic debut at the Beijing Games. Humphries trailed U.S. teammate Elana Meyers Taylor after the start, but picked up speed in the second half of her run and finished in 1:04.44.\n\nLaura Nolte of Germany was second, 0.30 seconds behind, and Meyers Taylor and Christine de Bruin of Canada are 0.68 back. The second run is later Sunday, and the third and fourth runs are Monday.\n\nHumphries and Meyers Taylor were instrumental in getting a second medal opportunity for women bobsledders, who have only been allowed to compete at the Olympics, in a two-man race, since 2002. Men’s four-men was part of the first Winter Olympics, in 1924, and the two-man was added eight years later.\n\nHumphries and Meyers Taylor had pushed for a four-man race, like the men have, but were rebuffed by international bobsled officials, who say there aren’t enough countries that could field teams. As part of its effort to improve gender equity, the International Olympic Committee agreed to add monobob, beginning in Beijing.\n\n“It's not what the men have … but at least we (both) have two opportunities to compete so we are equal in medal opportunities,” Humphries told USA TODAY Sports in November.\n\nAnd both Humphries and Meyers Taylor are favorites to win medals in both races. Humphries is the reigning world champion in both monobob and two-man, while Meyers Taylor won the overall monobob title this World Cup season.\n\nBoth are previous Olympic medalists, too. Meyers Taylor has won silvers at the last two Olympics as a driver, and also has a bronze as a brakeman in 2010. Humphries won gold medals for Canada in two-man in 2010 and 2014, as well as a bronze in 2018.\n\nHumphries asked Canada for her release in 2019, revealing that she had filed a formal complaint a year earlier alleging verbal and emotional abuse by Todd Hays, Team Canada’s bobsled coach. The case is ongoing, with the findings of one investigation tossed out and Hays suing Humphries for defamation.\n\nHumphries has lived in the United States since 2016, and married Travis Armbruster, a former U.S. bobsledder in 2019. But she feared as late as last fall that she wouldn’t get her U.S. citizenship in time to compete in Beijing.\n\nShe was sworn in Dec. 2, and is wearing a helmet painted like a U.S. flag. She also had her long, blonde hair tied back with a red, white and blue scarf.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nUS ice dance teams third and fourth after rhythm portion\n\nBEIJING — Two U.S. ice dance teams are in medal contention after the first half of the event Saturday.\n\nMadison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue placed third in the rhythm dance portion of the event, with a score of 87.13 while skating to a compilation of music from Janet Jackson.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates, the reigning national champions, are in fourth — but trailing their compatriots by almost 3 full points (84.14).\n\nGabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron of France are in first after turning in a world-record rhythm dance score of 90.83. And Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of Russia are in line for the silver.\n\nCompetition continues Monday with the free dance.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nMeyers Taylor ready to grab more medals after Beijing quarantine\n\nIt's already been an eventful stay on Beijing for American bobsled star Elana Meyers Taylor, who tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival on Jan. 29 and spent time in quarantine. Meyers Taylor was scheduled to carry the flag for the USA in the opening ceremony but had to pass up the honor with speedskater Brittany Bowe filling in.\n\nThese Olympics mark Elana Meyers Taylor's fourth Olympic Games, but it will be her first as a mother. Meyers Taylor took off during the 2019-20 bobsled season to welcome son Nico in February 2020 with husband Nic Taylor, a fellow bobsledder she married in 2014.\n\nMeyers Taylor enters the 2022 Beijing games with three Olympic medals – two silvers (in 2014 and 2018) one bronze (2010).\n\nShe begins her quest for two more medals with the debut of women's monobob Sunday followed by the two-man competition next week.\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nTeam USA gets gold medal boost from snowboarders\n\nThe U.S. sits sixth in the overall medals table heading into Sunday's events after adding gold Saturday in the debut of mixed-gender team snowboardcross.\n\nLindsey Jacobellis, who on Wednesday won the USA's first gold medal of these Games, added a second one, pairing with partner Nick Baumgartner, who finally captured his first medal in his fourth Olympic Games.\n\nTheir gold medal bumped the U.S. tally to five, tied with Sweden and the Netherlands and three behind Norway and Germany. Norway leads in total medals with 17, followed by Germany and Austria with 14.\n\nDaughter of Valieva’s controversial coach dodges media questions\n\nBEIJING – The Kamila Valieva controversy is taking its toll on the patience of Russian skaters.\n\nThe ice dancing partner of the daughter of Valieva’s controversial coach tried to shut down questions about the Olympic doping scandal four times in a 1½ minute interview with journalists Saturday night – after ending an interview with the wire services a few minutes earlier.\n\nROC skater Gleb Smolkin did his best to shield his 19-year-old partner Diana Davis, the Detroit-based daughter of Russian coach Eteri Tutberidze, from any scrutiny in the wake of Valieva’s positive drug test.\n\n– Christine Brennan\n\nSpeedskating gold medal favorite began on online skates\n\nSpeedskater Erin Jackson, one of the few Black competitors in an overwhelmingly white sport, is favored to win a gold medal at the Beijing Olympics. Five years ago, she switched from inline skating to ice, and now the 29-year-old enters the Olympics as the No. 1-ranked skater in the world at 500 meters.\n\nThat's a lot of pressure to bear, sure. But Jackson relishes it.\n\n\"When there's not enough pressure, I feel like I get a little too relaxed,\" she said. \"The more pressure we can put on me, the better.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nU.S. men's hockey has first place on the line\n\nThe U.S. men’s hockey team, which improved to 2-0 by beating archrival Canada, takes on defending silver medalist Germany (1-1) in the final preliminary-round game. First place in the pool is on the line, and if the USA wins or loses in overtime, it will get a bye to the quarterfinals. It still has a chance at a bye even with a regulation loss. The Americans have the top two scorers in Beijing in college forwards Sean Ferrell (six points) and Ben Meyers (four).\n\nMoney for medals: How much are Olympians paid?\n\nMoments of Olympic glory aren’t just paybacks for years of hard work. In many countries, they are a payday.\n\nUSA TODAY surveyed nearly 60 national Olympic committees and received responses from 20.\n\nA look at how much money 20 countries are paying their athletes for medals won at the Beijing Olympics.\n\n– Rachel Axon", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/08/12/nbc-olympics-female-athletes-majority-tv-coverage-inequities-remain/8112569002/", "title": "NBC Olympics broadcast centered women's sports, but inequities ...", "text": "Correction: A previous version of this story stated that the 2016 Olympics previously had the highest primetime representation of women athletes. That report only reflected the first half of the 2016 Olympics, and the story has been updated to reflect that the 2012 Olympics had the previous high.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were a milestone moment for the women of Team USA. They made up nearly 54% of the team and won 58.4% of the medals, including 23 golds.\n\nThey also set a record on television screens, taking up 59.1% of NBC’s primetime coverage of the Games .\n\nIt is the highest percentage of time that athletes in women's sports have ever received on NBC’s Olympic broadcasts, breaking the previous high of approximately 55% set at the 2012 Olympics in London. This was the third consecutive Summer Games where women's sports garnered more primetime space than men's.\n\nA study from three communications professors reported that this was also the first time since the group began its research in 1996 that every sporting discipline was highlighted at some point during a primetime Summer Olympic broadcast, including the five new events added to the Tokyo Games.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe Representation Project’s Respect Her Game Report found that the quantity of coverage was overall equitable between women’s and men’s sports. Primetime Olympic coverage was just as likely to feature athletes’ in-depth backstories and profiles regardless of gender.\n\nTOKYO OLYMPICS:US tops medal count, thanks in part to women's dominance\n\n'IT'S ALL SHIFTING':Women's sports pays for those who are now investing\n\nThe report found no difference between genders in how profile segments emphasized athletes’ romantic relationships or parenthood. In competition, athletes were equally likely to have commentators discuss their physical appearance regardless of gender. It also did not find any bias in the adjectives used to describe athletes.\n\n“I was thrilled to see that women athletes were receiving equal coverage, and the Olympics has done a good job of that over the last couple of Games as well,\" said Rebecca Cooper, the director of research at The Representation Project. \"To be clear, women really did deserve that coverage; they dominated the medal count, they won 60% of all medals, so that was awesome. But it’s not enough to just include and feature women athletes.”\n\nNBC’s broadcast was not without gender inequities. The report found that camera angles were a dramatic difference between coverage of men’s and women’s sports. Athletes competing in women’s sports were nearly 10 times more likely to be sexualized through camera angles, which the report defines as “a camera panning an athlete’s body and/or focusing on specific body parts in a sexualizing way.”\n\nThough the broadcast is not necessarily at fault for this, the report also stated that athletes in women’s sports were shown in revealing clothing 69.6% of time, while athletes in men’s sports were shown in revealing clothing 53.5% of the time.\n\n“It’s time that women, men and gender non-conforming athletes are actually allowed to wear the clothing of their choice instead of being made to wear sexually revealing outfits,” Cooper said. “It’s just ridiculous that there’s a disparity there, especially when teams are asking not to wear revealing outfits. It’s time that women athletes get to choose what they compete in.\"\n\nEXPLAINED:Why are some women still wearing skimpy uniforms at Olympics?\n\nMORE:How female stars of Tokyo Olympics are inspiring women around the world\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, the German women’s gymnastics team protested sexualization by wearing full-length bodysuits rather than the traditional leotards. Prior to the Games, there was also controversy surrounding the Norwegian beach handball team, which was fined for wearing longer-length shorts in competition.\n\nGendered language was another notable inequity. Women were referred to using a gendered modifier — female athlete, female swimmer, etc. — 14.6% of the time, whereas men were referred to with a gendered modifier only 2% of the time. Women’s sports were also far more likely to be referred to in diminutive terms, using terms like girl, lady or chick. The report recorded 29 instances of this in primetime, but only four instances of athletes in men’s sports being referred to as “boys.”\n\n“There are trends across all coverage in representation for women,” Cooper said. “Women in media face sexism all the time. In this case, women are showing up and getting coverage, but it’s more looking at the quality of that representation that matters too.”\n\nCooper said the Representation Project is calling on media executives to prioritize gender equity among anchors and commentators. The organization’s study found that 82% of NBC’s primetime broadcasters were male, which Cooper said could contribute to the use of gendered language and sexualization around women’s sports.\n\n“That just needs to change,” she said. “We can’t expect to eradicate sexist sports coverage in the Olympics if we don’t have women commentators and women experts out there framing what they’re seeing.”\n\nContact Emily Adams at eaadams@gannett.com or on Twitter @eaadams6.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/12"}]}

Sarah McBride, the country’s highest-ranking transgender elected official, announced her candidacy Monday, June 26, to become Delaware’s next sole congresswoman.\n\nMcBride, if elected, would become the first trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage. She would also be the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\n“It's clear that diversity in government is necessary for us to not just ensure we have a healthy democracy but also to truly deliver for people,” she said in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nREAD:Sarah McBride announces run for US House seat to become first trans member of Congress\n\nRetired U.S. colonel to run for lieutenant governor\n\nDebbie Harrington, a retired U.

He officially filed his candidacy on March 27.\n\nMeyer, who has been county executive since 2016, previously worked as a school teacher, attorney, entrepreneur and economic development adviser for the U.S. State Department in Iraq. He didn’t have much government experience before leading the state’s largest municipal government, which has an annual budget of about $300 million.\n\nREAD:New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer becomes first to enter 2024 governor's race\n\nHe signaled in his announcement that health care, affordable housing and education will be key issues in his campaign, noting the state “needs to move with greater urgency to tackle” these problems.

Purzycki captured 42.9% of the total vote, compared to Jones-Potter’s 35.6%. Former City Councilperson Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently.

Margaret Rose Henry, began his campaign for county executive in April of last year.\n\nHenry has over 20 years of experience in public service and has worked for the past three county executive administrations, including as the general manager of the county Department of Community Services under current executive Matt Meyer and a brief stint as the county’s economic development director.\n\nHe has publicly stated his intention to bring transparency to the position and ensure that the county remains “a safe and flourishing home for residents, and an attractive destination for visitors.”\n\nThe Marcus Henry campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment.\n\nKaren Hartley-Nagle, current New Castle County Council President, announced her candidacy on March 24 of this year. She has served as council president for the past six years, with two left in her current term.\n\nHartley-Nagle previously served as a board member of Delaware Common Cause and the Coalition for Open Government and was a member of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment. She has publicly stated that as County Executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As Council President she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nCandidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, launched his campaign for insurance commissioner.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016.

Biden is expected to address the nation later this week about his decision to bow out of the presidential election.\n\n“I watching you, kid. I’m watching you, kid. I love ya,” Biden told Harris by phone before she took the podium and addressed her campaign staff – which was previously Biden’s campaign staff – in Wilmington.\n\nWhile in Delaware Monday, Harris met with members of the Delaware delegation and visited the campaign headquarters that had already begun a transformation to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign. In the 24 hours since she annouced her intent to run, she raised a record $81 million.\n\nIn remarks that lasted about 20 minutes, Harris praised Biden’s accomplishments as “unmatched in modern history.”\n\n“I know it's been a rollercoaster, and we're all filled with so many mixed emotions about this,” Harris said. “I just have to say: I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden.”\n\nThen, the former prosecutor began to lay out her case against former President Donald Trump and how she plans to beat the Republican nominee.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for,” Harris said.\n\nShe ended her remarks saying, \"God bless you all and God bless the United States of America -- and Joe Biden.”\n\nAs those gathered outside watched Harris’ speech from their phones, they smiled and cheered. Many came from nearby office buildings, towns and even states away to try and catch a glimpse of the vice president after it was announced she'd be making the trip to Wilmington Monday.\n\n“She’s killing it,” one man said.\n\n“Are you ready for this?” a woman said to him excitedly, expecting the answer to be “yes.”\n\nHe replied in the affirmative, laughing that she must have fired her former speech writer because Monday’s speech was invigorating.\n\nHer address unsurprisingly brought many of Delaware's political leaders to the once-Biden headquarters, with Harris calling out many by name, including Delaware's Governor John Carney, Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki, state Attorney General Kathy Jennings and the entire Delaware delegation. It similarly roused a large swath of media, who were stationed on either side of Tatnall Street and along North West Street near entrances to the Wilmington downtown building well before she and her motorcade arrived.\n\nDelaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings was all smiles as she left the Nemours Building in Wilmington.“There was so much energy, and so many young people in that crowd who were loving what Kamala Harris had to say,” Jennings said. “She is going to bring a tremendous amount of energy to this campaign.”She added that Biden was on the phone for Harris’ speech, calling him “ the kindest, most decent human being. We love Joe.”She paused, then added: “I have to tell ya, Kamala was on fire.”\n\nDelaware community, including delegates, comes out for Kamala Harris\n\nAfter hearing Kamala Harris was visiting Wilmington Monday afternoon, Dwayne Bensing and several co-workers left their offices in the Community Service Building and walked over to the Brandywine Building in hopes of seeing the vice president.\n\n“We learned on X that she was going to visit campaign headquarters and so we were like, ‘this is an amazing historic moment to come support Vice President Harris,’“ the Wilmington resident said.\n\nBensing, a Delaware delegate to the Democratic National Convention, said he’d already pledged to Biden but is excited about the latest developments.\n\n“I was really excited that he passed the torch because I'm very enthusiastic about Vice President Harris,” he said.\n\n“This is such a historic moment,” he added. “You know, every time we turn, it's just exciting that Delaware is still kind of the center of it all and so we just wanted to show our enthusiasm.\n\n“Even in the President's home state for passing the torch and fighting for our democracy.”\n\nTears over President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of race\n\nLeslie Richeson sported a Biden-Harris t-shirt that had been modified to reflect just Harris’ name. She said she came out Monday afternoon in hopes of seeing the vice president.\n\n“She’s a good person — she’s as good as he is, and he’s perfect,” she said with a smile.\n\nRicheson, who was in Biden’s class at the University of Delaware, called his decision “really sad.”\n\n“I cried when he pulled out,” she said. “But I think it’s the way to go, to elevate Kamala.”\n\nShe added that as a lifelong Delaware resident, she wasn’t surprised that Biden was back in the First State when he announced his withdrawal.\n\nWHERE IT HAPPENED:Joe Biden makes historic decision in 'Nation's Summer Capital,' Rehoboth Beach\n\n“He came home to make the decision, to have some quiet,” she said.\n\nPeople traveled to try and catch views of vice president\n\nAt hearing Harris was coming to Wilmington, Jacquelyn King and her two friends, sisters Dara and Isabelle Fishman, traveled from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania to Wilmington to try and get a glimpse of the vice president.\n\n“We had nothing else going on today and then we saw a tweet that said that she was coming down here so like why not try and see the vice president,” 20-year-old King said.\n\nKing, who is visiting from Michigan, said Harris is not her top pick.\n\n“But no one is at this point,” yet she said she will vote for Harris and hopes she is successful.\n\nDara Fishman, 19, said this will be her first time voting and she is expecting to vote for Harris. “I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” she said. “And it's cool to check out the scenes here. See what one of our presidential candidates has to offer.”\n\nWhen asked if they’d ever traveled to Delaware to see Biden, they gave a hard no.\n\n“I wouldn’t come out for him,” King said, especially after watching Biden’s performance in the debate.\n\n“I was gonna vote for him,” she said. “And when you watch the debate, like it's kind of sad that we got to the point like where I had to, like, mute him because I was getting secondhand embarrassment.”\n\nKing added it would have been easier to vote for Biden if she’d not seen his debate performance.\n\nKamala Harris endorsements so far\n\nREQUIRED READING:Who has endorsed Kamala Harris for president?

John Carney, who is running for governor.\n\nReigle is an aviation instructor and former military pilot and mayor of Wyoming.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This is the fifth in a series of profiles on candidates running for Delaware's at-large congressional seat.\n\nThe year and a half Hans Reigle has spent campaigning for Congress has seen the race change significantly. But now, he says, it's entered the toughest stretch.\n\nThe Republican entered the campaign for Delaware's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives when Rep. John Carney still was expected to compete, but that Democrat now wants to be governor. The contest filled up fast with contenders, then the man Reigle believed was his most challenging rival, state Rep. Bryon Short, D-Highland Woods, dropped out.\n\nSince then, Reigle has earned the endorsement of the state GOP. Another Republican candidate, Rose Izzo, is on the ballot without much party support.\n\nStatewide Delaware politics almost always favor Democrats, but the list of registered Republicans got a shot in the arm this year thanks in part to Donald Trump's presidential bid.\n\n\"I got out there early and I had to do exactly what I did, which was get my name out there through signs, social media, some recognition in the papers, attending events, and all that lead me to that position where I was strong going into the state convention,\" Reigle said. \"It's so intense. My calendar between now and Nov. 8 is almost filled up already.\"\n\nReigle is the most likely candidate to compete in November's general election against a Democrat chosen in September from a field including state Sen. Bryan Townsend, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Sean Barney, accountant Mike Miller and businessman Scott Walker. Each, Reigle said, offers their own challenge, but he thinks he can win — and that the state would benefit from his victory.\n\n\"Right now, the entire federal delegation is Democrats. Our governor's seat is Democrat. Our state House and our state Senate are Democratic. That's just lopsided. It's just not balanced, and adding some balance would be healthy for our state,\" Reigle said. \"There's no way that those folks represent everyone in our state, and me winning gives the unheard voices a shot.\"\n\nReigle worked for United Airlines starting in 1997 and was an active pilot with the company until 2009. For the last seven years, he's been a professor of aviation at Delaware State University, four of which he served as the school's assistant director of that program and in the last year was the director. He retired from teaching in May to focus on the campaign.\n\nHe joined the U.S. Air Force Reserve at 18 and served for 20 years, retiring with the rank of major, and earned his political chops in Wyoming, Delaware, where he's served as a councilman and as mayor.\n\n\"There was never anything I went to Hans with we couldn't work out,\" said Frankie Dale Rife, Wyoming's current mayor who served as vice mayor before and during Reigle's stint. \"We had a lot of Democrats in government too, and they always put their differences aside. We all worked together, and that's what this country needs.\"\n\nSTORY: Short drops out of congressional race, cites money\n\nSTORY: Congressional candidates stake ground on gun rights\n\nGoing to Washington\n\nGetting to Congress is, for any candidate, just the first step. But campaigning and legislating aren't the same battles, and Reigle said he understands his role as a junior congressman would first be a matter of getting his feet wet.\n\n\"By all account, the House is going to remain in Republican hands in D.C. It would be wise for Delawareans to choose somebody who has a seat at the table in Washington,\" Reigle said. \"I would join in on causes I thought were important to Delawareans right out of the gate. But I would want to learn the process. I'm not going to be an embarrassment to the citizens of Delaware.\"\n\nThat said, Reigle has a few thoughts about even his earliest days at the Capitol.\n\n\"I want to hit the ground running as far as supporting legislation that creates more jobs for Delawareans,\" Reigle said. \"Let's face it, I'm not going to go over there and be the head of the committee right out of the gate. That's reality. But can I be part of leadership teams that get things done in a positive way? Yes.\"\n\nThe pilot pointed first to aviation, saying he'd have supported the Pilot's Bill of Rights legislation working through Congress, designed to give pilots firmer footing when dealing with punitive action from the Federal Aviation Administration and reducing the strictures on medical requirements general aviation proponents say are a drag on pilots' time and expenses.\n\nBut he pointed especially to manufacturing in Sussex County and noted he's part of a Delaware Department of Transportation task force looking at how Delaware can become a leader in the unmanned aerial vehicle industry.\n\nAccording to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study released last year based on 2013 data, the state ranks 26th nationally for an aviation industry generating $316 million in terms of total per capita gross domestic product impact and employs only about 0.5 percent of the total workforce\n\nReigle rails against the national debt — now $19 trillion — as a fiscal and moral crisis. He said he wants to cut spending by at least 2 percent, allowing individual agencies to determine where those reductions should be made.\n\n\"There is a systemic problem with the way we budget on a national level. It's the whole 'use it or lose it' at the end of the fiscal year. We've got to have incentives for different governmental departments to save money so if a department doesn't spend its full budget it doesn't lose that amount next year,\" Reigle said. \"That debt is immoral, and it's either going to cause America to have a slow fissile or it could all just come tumbling down in the markets.\"\n\nHe promotes decisions on educational curriculum being made at the state and local level, and though he believes the idea of tuition-free college for Americans is a noble one he doesn't support it because resources are too limited, partly because the Affordable Care Act is drawing away monies that could go to public universities.\n\nMore firm safeguards on national borders with respect paid to legal immigration, a right-sized military for facing modern threats and correcting the nation's mishandling of veterans issues all are points on Reigle's push card.\n\n\"He comes across as more of a mainstream Republican,\" said Delaware State University professor of political science Samuel Hoff. \"That doesn't automatically assume he's going to take the moderate position, but it makes it easier for some of the people in the state party to get behind him.\"\n\nThat won't be enough by itself, however, as Hoff believes Reigle will need to win over a majority of the state's independent voters just to stay in the game against a state with nearly half its voters registered as Democrats. Hoff said Reigle might even have had a better chance against Carney because, in general, the field of Democrats now in the race hold relatively moderate positions themselves.\n\nBut Hoff agrees with Reigle there's a good chance the Republican can eat up some support left over from Short's base and that voters might be more inclined to send someone to Washington who'll sit in with the majority party — Hoff said the U.S. House of Representatives won't go back to the Democrats — and get a voice in their decisions.\n\nIf Reigle manages to claim victory, he said voters shouldn't expect to see him riding the train every day.\n\n\"You actually have to form bonds when you're in D.C, and I think you're going to have to spend a lot of your time over there because you're going to be dealing with people from other places. I'm not planning on coming home every night and taking the train,\" Reigle said. \"You have to be there all the time.\"\n\nA glimpse of the Gipper\n\nReigle wasn't in his normal classes at Caesar Rodney High School on Jan. 20, 1981.\n\n\"I skipped school to see Ronald Reagan get inaugurated, which was a pretty amazing day. We're standing along the line and you can hear this cheering going on. This guy comes walking down the line holding up a notebook and it just said, 'The hostages have been freed,'\" Reigle said, referring to the 52 American hostages held by Iran after more than 400 days. \"People were cheering, going mad. That was on day one. That was really inspirational to me, and as soon as I could register to vote I registered as a Republican.\"\n\nThat inspiration stuck around through his life, so much so the Gipper sometimes was the subject of bedtime stories for son Derek Reigle.\n\n\"It was a way for us to connect. I could always talk to him about politics,\" Derek Reigle said. \"It wasn't ever pushing political ideas on me. It was pushing respect for the military, respect for my country, respect for my flag.\"\n\nNow his son helps out with the campaign for Congress, and Derek Reigle said they even agree about politics 80 percent of the time. It's not his favorite thing to do, he said, but he does it gladly.\n\n\"My dad was pretty much my inspiration. He was a role model, a friend, a father. He coached my little league teams. He taught me how to shave. He taught me the importance of money. He taught me to hold the door open for ladies,\" Derek Reigle said. \"I feel a responsibility to him.\"\n\nSince that day in 1981, Reigle has flown commercially or militarily in at least 40 countries and on six continents, accumulating 12,000 recorded flight hours. He's served as a board member of the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base.\n\nHe still lives right outside Wyoming with his wife of 19 years, Anne, with whom he has three children. That's how Rife speaks of him — as a man of his family and his community.\n\nShe recalled the death of Mike Brown, a police officer with the Wyoming Police Department who died in a motorcycle crash after only 18 months on the job. Hans Reigle, she said, had been mayor for only about a month and was still flying as a pilot at the time.\n\n\"He's a real person. He's not a politician,\" Rife said. \"He came back instantly.\"\n\nThe mayor, she said, didn't know the officer personally but put his civic responsibility over his personal ones.\n\n\"Running for this position is the culmination of my life's work as a pilot, as a mayor, as a professor, as a veteran, and I really think I can make a difference for the people of Delaware,\" Reigle said. \"I feel I can be their voice in Washington.\"\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com\n\nSTORY: Sean Barney hangs congressional run on military service\n\nSTORY: Running for Congress, Rochester draws on experience\n\nSTORY: Rose Izzo is one of few taking her House bid seriously\n\nSTORY: Mike Miller: It's time for a change in leadership\n\nU.S. House race\n\nName: Hans Reigle\n\nAffiliation: Republican\n\nBorn: Biloxi, Mississippi\n\nAge: 52\n\nEducation: Excelsior College in Albany, New York, bachelor of science (1989); Delaware State University, master of business administration (2010)\n\nPrior service: U.S. Air Force Reserve (1982-2002), town of Wyoming councilman (2002-2004), Wyoming mayor (2005-2007)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/delaware-democrats-politics-2024-election-tom-carper-retiring/70255843007/", "title": "Delaware Democrats eye 'generational shift' in 2024 election", "text": "Democratic campaign consultants, organizers and party observers believe the 2024 election will be one of the state’s most important election cycles in decades.\n\nFor the first time in about half a century, Tom Carper will not be in elected office in 2025.\n\nThe election will also likely feature several competitive Democratic primary races – a rarity for the state party.\n\nIt did not take long for the phone lines to begin burning up after U.S. Sen.

As council president she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nVal Gould pursues run for New Castle County Council president\n\nFormer policy analyst Val Gould, a New Jersey native and University of Delaware alum, announced intentions to run for county council president.\n\nGould currently teaches music at George Read Middle School. Before teaching, they worked as a legislative fellow for the State House Majority Caucus during the 2021 legislative session and as a policy analyst for the Delaware State Senate Majority Caucus during the 2023 legislative session.\n\nGould plans to run on the promises of advocating for sustainable development, creating more affordable housing and ensuring that land use decisions are designed to benefit historically neglected communities.\n\nIf elected, Gould would be the County Council’s first queer and nonbinary member.\n\n“I hope to make my family, friends, community, coworkers and neighbors proud by leveraging my privilege to encourage responsible development and positive, impactful change for those who need it most,” Gould said. “I truly believe that, if we strive to uplift everyone, our communities and businesses will thrive.”\n\nWilmington mayoral races take shape\n\nFormer city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter was the first to announce a run for Wilmington mayor in March 2023.\n\nJones-Potter unsuccessfully ran for the city seat in 2020, trailing incumbent Mayor Mike Purzycki by just over 1,000 votes in the Democratic Primary. Purzycki captured 42.9% of the total vote, compared to Jones-Potter’s 35.6%. Former City Councilmember Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nIn October, Purzycki announced he would not seek a third term, citing his age and desire to spend more time with family. That opened the door for Delaware Gov. John Carney to consider a run for office.\n\nCarney is unable to seek a third term as Delaware governor due to term limits. City mayor has a limit of three terms.\n\nThe governor has not said whether he’s officially running for Wilmington mayor, but year-end campaign finance reports show Carney’s mayoral campaign fundraising outpaced those of Jones-Potter.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently.\n\nMORE:Carney expresses interest in Wilmington mayor after Purzycki announces he won't run in 2024\n\n3 Democrats, 2 Republicans vie for Delaware governor\n\nThree Democrats and two Republicans are running in Delaware’s gubernatorial race.\n\nMeyer, who has been county executive since 2016; Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, who has spent two decades in public office; and Collin O’Mara, a former Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary and current CEO of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, are all running on the Democratic line in September.\n\nO’Mara was the first democrat to file his candidacy in the race for governor on March 13. Meyer filed two weeks later. Hall-Long filed for candidacy April 16 and, if elected, she would be the state’s second female governor, following Ruth Ann Minner, who served in the early 2000s.\n\nLongtime police officer Jerrold Price filed his candidacy for Delaware governor on the Republican line in December, and remains the only Republican gubernatorial who has officially filed.\n\nCAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING:Meyer leads among Democratic gubernatorial candidates, raising over $675K in donations\n\nPrice is a retired New York Police Department officer, who moved to Delaware’s coast about 20 years ago and resides in Lewes. According to his campaign website, he later joined the Rehoboth Beach Police Department and has an extensive career in law enforcement.\n\nDelaware GOP chair Julianne Murray and current House Minority Leader Mike Ramone recently said they also intend to run for governor on the Republican line. But Murray changed her mind on Monday, May 6, saying that she wouldn't run for governor since Ramone filed for candidacy.\n\nLATEST:State Rep. Mike Ramone won't seek reelection. He plans to run for Delaware governor\n\nThree spar for lieutenant governor\n\nThree candidates familiar to Delaware politics are seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor.\n\nState Sen. Kyle Evans Gay, who represents North Wilmington; state Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker, who represents the city of Wilmington; and Debbie Harrington, a retired U. S. Army colonel and state Democratic Party vice-chair, are running for Delaware lieutenant governor.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\nThe representative ran for the seat in 2016, coming second to now Lt. Gov. Hall-Long in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\n“As Lt. Gov. I will continue to be a boots-on-the-ground advocate for all Delaware citizens,” Dorsey Walker said in her announcement last year. “My decision to announce on Juneteenth is symbolic of the advancements made by people of color, women, and those who seek the freedom that comes with change for the advancement of all mankind.”\n\nHarrington, a Middletown resident who served in the Army for 25 years, became an advocate for children with disabilities in her retirement. Her daughter is visually impaired.\n\nHarrington has run unsuccessfully for other elected offices. She is a vice chair of the state Democratic Party, vice chair of the Middletown Police Advisory Board and part of Delaware State University's Board of Trustees, according to her website.\n\nDorsey Walker or Harrington could become the state’s first Black woman to serve in the role if elected.\n\nRepublican challenger enters U.S. Senate race\n\nWilmington resident and businessman Eric Hansen is the latest candidate for Delaware's soon-to-be-vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nHansen, who built his career at Proctor and Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Walmart, is seeking the Republican nomination for the post, which is being vacated by U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat, who has decided to retire.\n\nBlunt Rochester, if elected, would become the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the fourth Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nREAD:Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole congresswoman, will run to fill Carper's Senate seat\n\nBlunt Rochester announced her intentions to run shortly after Carper announced his retirement plans in May last year. Carper publicly called on the congresswoman to run — admitting she probably should have done so years ago. She officially filed for candidacy on June 18.\n\nDr. Mike Katz, an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator, has filed to run as an Independent in the U.S. Senate race. Katz, a former Democrat, created the Brandywine Valley National Scenic Byway Advisory Board, according to his campaign website, and helped restructure the Delaware Health Information Network.\n\nKatz is running on a platform of dismantling partisan politics and what he calls \"America's two party problem.\" If elected, Katz would be Delaware's first Independent U.S. Senator.\n\nWith candidates on three different party lines, they all will face off in the general election Nov. 5.\n\nU.S. House race down to one Democrat, one Republican\n\nThe race for Delaware's at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat has narrowed down to two contenders after all but one Democratic nominee dropped out of the race.\n\nRepublican Donyale Hall, a veteran, Dover resident and small business owner, is the sole Republican nominee running for the seat formerly held by Blunt Rochester, and is guaranteed a spot in the general election.\n\nHall, who is biracial, has run for political office before. She said she brings a “unique” perspective to the seat having served in the U.S. Air Force in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm; being a survivor of domestic violence; and overall understanding others who feel as though they have been forgotten or overlooked.\n\nState Sen. Sarah McBride earned the Democratic nomination — and endorsements from political leaders like Blunt Rochester and Nancy Pelosi — after former Delaware State Housing Authority Director Eugene Young withdrew from the race on June 12.\n\nYoung was McBride's sole challenger in the Democratic Primary after state treasurer Colleen Davis withdrew from the race in February, citing personal and family health concerns.\n\nIf McBride — the country's highest-ranking transgender elected official — were elected to the Congressional seat, she would become the first trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage. She would also be the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nRELATED:Democratic primary for US House seat down to 2 candidates after Davis drops out\n\nThe race got slightly less crowded in February when state Treasurer Colleen Davis, who had intentions to run for the U.S. House seat, dropped out of the race due to health issues and family obligations.\n\nFirst candidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, is the first candidate to officially file as a candidate in the insurance commissioner's race.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016. The two will likely face off again in the primary, though Navarro has not yet filed his candidacy with the Department of Elections. In his announcement, Abegunde said would \"bring more insurance products\" to Delaware and provide more options to veterans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/29"}]}

O’Neill was named state Player of the Year that basketball season, not his much-trumpeted junior teammate Dante DiVincenzo, who would capture it the following season while leading Sallies to another state crown on his way to Villanova.\n\nBLUE HENS: New Bears coach Nagy was record-smashing UD quarterback\n\nNFL: No. 1-seeded Eagles are playoff underdogs\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nAfter playing tight end while redshirting as a Pitt true freshman in 2014, O’Neill, with a new coaching staff in town, was invited to move to offensive tackle the following season. He sought feedback from various former coaches, including those at Salesianum, and agreed to make the move.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 305-pound O'Neill would go on to play in all of Pitt's 38 games, starting the last 37, in 2015, 2016 and 2017, earning first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference in 2017 at left tackle after shifting over from right tackle.\n\nLast month, despite having a year of eligibility left, O’Neill announced he would forego his final season and make himself available for April’s NFL draft. He has already graduated from Pitt with a finance degree.\n\n“It’s the best decision I ever made to switch to offensive tackle,” O’Neill said by phone from Irvine, California, where he is stationed while training with Rep 1 Sports. “I absolutely love every second of it and hopefully will continue to.”\n\nOf that position change, he added, “I always thought it was kind of possible” when he went off to college.\n\nAnd that’s where the irony comes in.\n\nO’Neill was a first-team All-State defensive end at Salesianum his senior season, when he had 43 tackles, including five sacks, and, using that considerable height to his advantage, batted down 16 passes.\n\nCertainly, football’s gritty demands were to his liking on defense.\n\nBut on the offensive side of the ball, he had played tight end as a sophomore and junior and, Sallies coach Bill DiNardo recalled, not been particularly enamored.\n\n“I didn’t think he couldn’t block,” DiNardo said. “He didn’t want to block.”\n\nWhat O’Neill wanted to do was catch passes, and his ability to do just that played a key role in the Sals’ state championship win over Middletown in 2013. The Cavaliers had their own dynamic passing duo in quarterback Darius Wade, who would go on to start at Boston College, and wideout Chris Goodwin, who just completed a successful rookie season with the Tampa Bay Bucs after a stellar career at Penn State.\n\n“He’ll become a big target out there,” DiNardo said he knew of O’Neill’s senior-season move to wide receiver. “He’ll become a mismatch, which he was.”\n\nAs a senior, O’Neill had 33 catches for 614 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nO’Neill, admitting that blocking wasn’t his favorite thing to do in high school, finds obvious humor in how things transpired and enjoys that DiNardo and Sallies offensive line coach Robert McConaghy still razz him. He saw what Middletown had at the time with Wade and Godwin and, with Sallies quarterback Matt Sgro, wanted to be able to counter that, which they did.\n\nThen he got to Pitt and, after joining the offensive line, quickly developed a liking and appreciation for that position, its technical demands and the unity forged from it. No other position area requires or fosters togetherness like the offensive line, and O’Neill quickly bought in its \"bunker mentality,\" he said.\n\n“Once I got to college and did make the position switch my mindset really changed,” he said. “Being with the other offensive linemen at Pitt every day helped me see the game from a different perspective. I learned so much from the upperclassmen in my first year at tackle. They made it a super fun environment to work every day and I came to respect the heck out of the work they did. By the time the season came around I was 110 percent committed to being an offensive lineman and loved everything about being in that group.\n\n“Then it became, ‘Wow, I really can’t let these guys next to me down,’ once I was named a starter in August.”\n\nHe never did.\n\nIn addition, Pitt utilized those athletic skills that were so apparent back in Delaware. O’Neill carried the football three times for 39 yards, including 24- and 5-yard touchdowns in his career.\n\n“It just made sense,” DiNardo said of O’Neill’s move to offensive tackle. “He’s got the height and if they could put 20 or 30 pounds on him he was gonna be an NFL prospect because of his athleticism.\n\n“He just took off from there. It was just so cool to watch him on national TV, to watch him at right tackle and then this year at left tackle. That’s Brian O’Neill!”\n\nOn to the NFL\n\nAnd, beginning next year, he’ll very likely be showing up on NFL fields.\n\nO’Neill elected to declare for the NFL draft only after many discussions with Pitt’s coaches and others with NFL ties.\n\n“The main thing was the feedback [Pitt] coach [Pat] Narduzzi and I were able to get through the NFL Advisory Committee,” O’Neill said of an organization that helps players gauge their pro value. “We put in for a grade and sifted through that information and did some research through different teams through my coach, where they think you stand.\n\n“I’m not gonna say I was content with where they said I was at right now, but I’m content with the general feeling of where I was starting the process and kind of where I would be able to go forward and potentially move myself up to be drafted in the slot that I wanted to be drafted.”\n\nWhat O’Neill aspires, he said, is “to have a chance to compete with a group of seven or eight tackles that are all kind of vying to shift up or down with each other and be able to compete against each other.”\n\nLast year, there were nine offensive tackles chosen in the first five rounds. In 2016, however, nine offensive tackles were taken in the first three rounds.\n\n“I feel pretty comfortable I’ll be able to be in the mix and put a good feeling forth and hopefully land in one of those top four or five tackles drafted,” O’Neill said. “I understand there are a lot of variables and a lot of guys are really talented and come from really good systems and I’m not naive to that.”\n\nO’Neill’s next chance to impress pro scouts comes in the Senior Bowl Jan. 27 in Mobile, Alabama (2:30 p.m. on the NFL Network). He’ll also have his Pro Day at Pitt and the NFL Combine before the draft April 26-28.\n\nIn between, he’ll train at Rep 1 Sports Academy, where O’Neill is represented by Rep 1 agent Ryan Tollner. Nima Zarrahi, Rep 1’s vice president of media and public relations, said the company was interested in representing O’Neill after getting to know him through representing the Pittsburgh Steelers running back James Conner, O’Neill’s former Pitt teammate and close friend.\n\n“He’s a perfect fit for us from a character standpoint and a talent standpoint,” Zarrahi said of O’Neill.\n\nPitt teammate and A.I. du Pont graduate Quadree Henderson, a wide receiver and All-American returnman, has also declared for the NFL draft after his junior season.\n\nO’Neill’s days now begin at 6:30 a.m. with a nutritious breakfast followed by drills aimed at improving his speed. At 9:30 a.m. come position drills aimed specifically to benefit him at the Senior Bowl, the Combine and at Pro Day.\n\nThere, O’Neill’s coach is none other than Pro Football Hall-of-Famer Jackie Slater, who spent his entire 20-year career with the Rams.\n\n“He’s the best of the best in terms of playing at that level,” said O’Neill, who is one of eight offensive linemen training together. “He knows what it takes.”\n\nIn the afternoon there is strength training followed by film work.\n\nO’Neill, who did a lot of pulling and edge blocking in college, said he’d like to improve as a point-of-attack run blocker.\n\nDiNardo has no doubt that O’Neill will succeed. In fact, he offers a unique comparison to Lane Johnson, the Philadelphia Eagles' All-Pro offensive tackle.\n\n“Lane Johnson was a quarterback when he went to college and then a tight end and tackle,” DiNardo said, chronicling Johnson’s ascent from Groveton (Texas) High to Kilgore (Texas) Junior College to Oklahoma, where he also initially played defensive end before excelling at offensive tackle his last two seasons and becoming a first-round draft pick.\n\n“He only played offensive line for a year or two but the upside of him was his skill set and Brian definitely has the skill set. I think it’s a very similar situation. I had said that to people afterward. Brian never lacked in confidence. He’s just a very confident young man in a very good athletic way. There’s nobody he’s afraid of. There’s no situation he’s going to be afraid of.’’\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Jeremy Ake’s two-run eighth-inning single and Jordan Glover’s two-run ninth-inning single delivered.\n\n“I think we just wanted to keep this thing going,” said Delaware outfielder Calvin Scott, the junior out of St. Mark’s High, “because we have a good team. We think we can compete with anyone in this tournament. We just realized it was coming to a close and we’re a good late-inning team and we can get the bats going whenever we can.

That game included a 90-minute weather delay. Arizona, ranked 16th nationally, was defeated later by Sam Houston State 5-4, dropping the Wildcats into the losers’ bracket with Delaware.\n\nWildcats starter Cameron Ming, a junior left-hander, allowed four hits and walked five over 7 2/3 innings.\n\nDelaware scored twice with two outs in the eighth when two walks sandwiched Scott’s double and Ake greeted reliever Michael Flynn with a first-pitch drive into the left-fielder corner. But left-fielder Ryan Haug threw out Ake at second base, where he would have been the tying run, to end the inning.\n\n“That was maybe the biggest play in the game when he cut that guy down at second,” Arizona coach Jay Johnson said.\n\nDoug Trimble opened the Delaware ninth with a single. Flynn got two outs before, an out away from winning, he plunked Brian Mayer with a pitch. He was relieved by Tylor Megill, and Delaware leadoff hitter Kevin Mohollen grounded to second and just barely beat out the throw for an infield single that loaded the bases.\n\nGlover, the Hens’ two-time first-team All-CAA left fielder, then singled to center field to tie the game. Nick Patten flied out to center to end the threat.\n\n“We just got the bats going a little too late but we battled and we just came up short this time,” said Glover, who, like Scott, had two of Delaware’s nine hits.\n\nJames Meeker pitched shutout relief in the eighth and ninth innings for Delaware, before closer FitzPatrick took over in the 10th.\n\nAfter the 10th inning, the game was halted because of lightning in the area. During the delay the two teams squared off in a race matching one player from each squad sprinting to center field and a bowling competition.\n\nFitzPatrick (2-1) then returned to the mound.\n\n“He wanted it and he’s got a resilient arm and his arm was live as you could see,” Sherman said. “Give their kid credit [on the homer]. He just got a good pitch and stayed behind it and drove it to left field.”\n\nThe Wildcats broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh inning with a four-run, bat-around rally against UD relievers Colman Vila and Kyle Hinton.\n\nNick Quintana’s single and RBI doubles by Kyle Lewis and Cal Stevenson made it 3-1. With two outs and after a pair of walks, Cesar Salazar hit a liner that ricocheted off pitcher’s mound into center field. Two more runs scored.\n\nDelaware starter Nick Spadafino, the junior out of Dover High, allowed four hits and walked two over 5 1/3 innings. J.J. Matijevic had opened the Arizona sixth with a single. After he was bunted to second, the left-handed Vila came on to face a pair of Wildcat lefties. The second, Salazar, lined a single to center field to score the game’s first run.\n\n“I couldn’t ask for a better performance,” Sherman said of Spadafino’s start.\n\nThe Hens tied it 1-1 in the sixth, which Glover opened with a single. Glover was bunted to second by Scott and scored when Patten dropped a single in front of center-fielder Jared Oliva. But Patten was thrown out at first base when he wandered too far off the bag after a pitch bounced away from catcher Salazar.\n\nDelaware stranded two runners in each of the second and third innings and didn’t have another baserunner until Glover’s single led off the sixth.\n\n“Playing well is the feather in the hat, at least,” Sherman said. “You wanted to win, but . . . Premier names, it’s fun to play them. I think we showed that we can play with them.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

This percentage was determined by the difference between one’s adjusted gross income and an income that falls into 225% of the federal poverty line, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFor example, if you make exactly or less than $32,800 per year, your estimated payment will be $0 per month. Or, if you are a single borrower and make $50,000 per year, your payment will be close to $143 per month.\n\nWho's eligible for a SAVE plan?\n\nThis new rate will apply to those currently enrolled in a SAVE plan and with undergraduate and/or graduate student loans.\n\nIn general, SAVE plans are accessible for federal student borrowers with direct student loan debts. This can include direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, among others.\n\nMore:Who's getting student loan forgiveness after $7.7 billion in relief? Here's a breakdown\n\nHow much will you save?\n\nEarlier this year, the Biden administration continued to expand benefits. This included giving student loan borrowers who owe $12,000 or less the chance to have charges cleared after 10 years of payment.\n\nThen, last May, Biden’s administration declared that an additional total of $7.7 billion in loan forgiveness had been approved for over 160,000 eligible borrowers. This included those enrolled in a SAVE plan, as well as those receiving Public Service Loan Forgiveness and in similar income-driven repayment programs.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, this approval raised the total amount of loan forgiveness to roughly $167 billion for 4.75 million residents in the U.S. – including those living in Delaware.\n\nA recent Department of Education report found that 3,030 borrowers in the First State were approved for student loan forgiveness under a PSLF plan; 1,460 under SAVE; 3,170 under an IDR adjustment; and 4,630 borrowers for both IDR and SAVE from October 2021 to May 2024.\n\nAs of this April, close to 8 million borrowers have been enrolled in a SAVE plan – a little over 4 million of whom now have $0 payments.\n\nWhat to know:Biden's latest student-loan forgiveness plan brings questions for borrowers\n\nRelated:Biden promises student loan relief as early as this fall through new plan\n\nHow do you apply for a SAVE plan or IDR plan?\n\nBorrowers interested in enrolling in a SAVE or an IDR plan can do so online at studentaid.gov/idr/.\n\nWhile there is no set income restriction to be eligible for a SAVE plan, a more in-depth list of requirements is available on the Federal Student Aid website.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2019/02/06/convicted-inmate-admits-lying-stand-during-first-vaughn-prison-trial/2770495002/", "title": "Convicted inmate admits to lying on the stand during first Vaughn ...", "text": "Jarreau Ayers, found guilty of all charges except murder in the first round of the Vaughn prison riot criminal trials, admitted Wednesday that he lied on the stand in his own defense.\n\nAyers testified Wednesday that he was part of the planning from the very beginning, including whether or not the uprising would involve violence. He said during conversations involving himself and inmates Royal Downs and Dwayne Staats, they coordinated the plan to get everyone to stay in the yard in protest – and a “contingency plan” if that didn’t work.\n\nHe also named Kelly Gibbs, who hanged himself in prison after pleading guilty to multiple charges involving the Feb. 1, 2017 riot, as one of Lt. Steven Floyd’s attackers.\n\nFloyd died during the 18-hour standoff at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center two years ago, and Gibbs recently took responsibility for his role in the riot in a one-page letter found in his cell after his suicide.\n\nInmate's suicide note points to state's star witness as Vaughn uprising mastermind\n\n“I absolutely left stuff out of my first trial,” Ayers said under questioning from Deputy Attorney General Brian Robertson.\n\nAyers later went on to explain why he made this decision, one that he said will ensure he never gets out of prison.\n\n\"In this moment right here, I gotta deal with the fact that it’s people on trial that had nothing to do with what we was trying to do,” Ayers said. “So I’m not going to sit here and watch innocent people go to jail for something I believed in.\"\n\nAyers willingly took the stand on behalf of the defense after he received counsel about the jeopardy he could place himself in given that he has not yet been sentenced for his role in the riot.\n\nDuring his direct examination, Judge William C. Carpenter Jr. called an additional sidebar to again direct defense attorney Patrick Collins to counsel Ayers on the problems his testimony could create.\n\n“He’s not testifying consistent with his own trial,\" Carpenter said when the jury was taken out of the courtroom and Ayers was also removed. He stressed that this could create problems, but did not elaborate on what may come as a result of this new testimony.\n\n“It could be an interesting day,” he said before Ayers retook the stand.\n\nVaughn defendant testifies he doesn't know why he is on trial\n\nAbednego Baynes, Kevin Berry, John Bramble and Obadiah Miller are on trial for charges of murder, assault, riot, kidnapping and conspiracy in the riot.\n\nAyers said none of those four defendants were a part of the uprising.\n\nMiller served as a tier man – a job chosen by a prison sergeant that comes with more freedom within the building – which made him untrustworthy and made Ayers \"have no dealings with him.\"\n\nBramble is white, and no white men were recruited as part of these efforts, Ayers said.\n\nAnd both Berry and Baynes were not involved nor did Ayers see them participate in the riot or vandalize property, he said.\n\nStaats, who was the only inmate found guilty of first-degree murder and rioting charges in the first trial, confirmed Ayers' assertions.\n\nHe, too, said the four defendants were not involved in the uprising and were not recruited by him for the uprising. Staats said he was responsible for developing the group of men who would carry out the attacks, though he refused to name those involved.\n\n\"You know why people followed me? Because of my credibility,\" Staats said, adding that he wouldn't break \"code\" and name the men who participated, even if they named him.\n\nRobertson then countered for the state as to the validity of what Staats was saying — if what he said was true and he wasn't willing to name the men involved, then he wouldn't name the four men sitting at the defense tables in front of him.\n\nStaats disagreed.\n\nHe had already said Miller was not to be trusted since he conferred with correctional officers. As for Berry, Staats saw the man get pushed by a correctional officer once and not do anything about it so he determined Berry \"didn't have the potential\" to be a good participant in the riot, he said.\n\nStaats said he didn't know Bramble or Baynes.\n\nMost of the defendants in this trial have echoed similar thoughts.\n\nBoth Miller and Baynes took the stand in their own defense Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMiller detailed to the jury how he is slated to leave prison on Oct. 30 of this year after serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter and a weapons charge. With \"good time\" building and a job inside the prison, he said he didn't want to do anything that would jeopardize his ability to get home sooner.\n\nHe was also three months away from earning his high school diploma when the uprising took place.\n\n\"As soon as I got to C Building, I wanted to stay away from the BS because in prison, it's a lot of politics,\" Miller said, explaining that he had just come from solitary confinement and was ready to finish out his sentence quickly and quietly.\n\n\"I got a lot of things going on for me out in the streets – productive, that is,\" he added. I don't got time to be entertaining any trivial matters.\"\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2017, Miller said he came in from the recreation yard and went directly to his cell. On the way, he came across five or six masked inmates swinging brooms and mop wringers. But Miller said he wanted to no part it in and returned to his cell where he stayed for the duration of the riot.\n\nHis defense attorney rested their case following Miller's testimony.\n\nBaynes also took the stand in his own defense, explaining that he was watching the Rachel Ray show on a TV in his cell with headphones in so he could simultaneously listen to music when the riot broke out.\n\nHe said he never went out to the recreation yard, choosing instead to stay inside, shower and attempt to talk on the phone. When water pooling underneath his cell door interrupted his TV show, Baynes thought someone pulled the fire alarm and activated the sprinkler system.\n\nBut he was proven wrong when the cell doors unlocked and his cellmate stood in front of him with a look on his face \"like he seen a ghost.\"\n\nBaynes, who is serving an 18-year sentence for second degree murder he committed at the age of 17, then cooperated with masked inmates who directed him to empty his locker box, cover the window and \"lock in\" to his cell.\n\nLater, he said he helped clear water from the main hallway in his tier and left the prison in the final wave of inmates who were released from Building C.\n\nHe didn't ask questions of those who had taken over the building because he didn't want them to put his own life in jeopardy, Baynes said.\n\n\"I’m not dying over not covering my window,\" Baynes told one of the state's prosecutors, Robertson.\n\nBaynes also asserted that he played no role in the riot.\n\nDELAWARE'S DEADLY PRISON RIOT\n\nConflicting testimony complicates second Vaughn prison trial\n\nVaughn uprising defendants sue Department of Corrections claiming abuse\n\nInmate's suicide note points to state's star witness as Vaughn uprising mastermind\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, that would push back the promotion requirement from the 2021-22 school year to the 2023-24 school year. If she does not sign the bill, it will die by what is known as a pocket veto. Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said Wednesday that the bill is under review. The promotion requirement is set to take effect at the end of next year, but supporters argued it would be unfair to force the requirement on students who were out of the traditional classroom for long stretches during the pandemic. Opponents have argued that it would be a disservice to students to delay the requirement – a part of a broader state program to boost literacy – or that the state should wait until latest test scores are available to decide. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, who sponsored the original measure in 2019, has argued lawmakers should wait and see the latest test scores before deciding if a delay is needed.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: About 60% of applications for a pandemic rent relief program are still awaiting processing, nearly three months after the application deadline. The pending applications are among 25,257 that cleared initial income and documentation hurdles for the program administered by the Alaska Housing Finance Corp, KTOO Public Media reports. The program is aimed at helping people who qualify by covering up to a year of rent and utility payments. The application deadline closed in early March. Given the high level of interest in a different relief program last year, the corporation built its paperwork and review process with speed in mind, officials said. Daniel Delfino, who directs the corporation’s planning and program development department, said stopwatch tests were used to determine how quickly workers processed different versions of paperwork. Nonetheless, Delfino said it’s no consolation for those awaiting the help “that we’re one of the fastest states in the country to get the money out the door if they can’t pay their rent or their utility bill.” The program receives about 600 to 800 phone calls daily, mostly from people asking about the status of their applications, Delfino said. A website status checker shows about 800 unique user visits a day.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s standards for allocating scarce medical resources during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic have been revised to resolve a months-old federal complaint. The updated Crisis Standards of Care now reflect “legal requirements and best practices regarding the needs of people with disabilities and older adults,” according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Civil Rights released Tuesday. The complaint, filed July 17 by several advocacy groups, argued that the state’s crisis standards, allowed because of COVID-19, discriminated against older Arizonans, people of color and those with disabilities. “We’re very glad that we have standards that would now ensure that all patients, including those with disabilities, would receive equitable treatment,” said Maya Abela, a supervisory attorney with the Arizona Center for Disability Law. The federal Office of Civil Rights provided technical assistance and used a “collaborative process” to revise the guidelines, the federal statement says. “This is a significant step forward for all residents of our state,” Jon Meyers, executive director for The Arc of Arizona, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The American Civil Liberties Union asked a federal judge Tuesday to strike down a new law that made the state the first to ban gender-confirming treatments or surgery for transgender youth. The ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the new prohibition, set to take effect July 28. It prohibits doctors from providing gender-confirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18 years old, or from referring them to other providers for the treatment. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of four transgender youth and their families, as well as two doctors who provide gender-confirming treatments. The lawsuit argues the prohibition will severely harm transgender youth in the state and violate their constitutional rights. “If the health care ban goes into effect, it will have devastating consequences for transgender youth in Arkansas,” the lawsuit said. “These young people will be unable to obtain medical care that their doctors and parents agree they need – and those already receiving care will have their treatment abruptly halted – which could have serious and potentially life-threatening consequences.” Republican lawmakers enacted the ban in April, overriding a veto by GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: When the coronavirus hit, the environmentally friendly city closed more than 45 miles of streets to automobiles so people could exercise and socialize safely. Now, pedestrian advocates want to keep some of San Francisco’s most prominent streets off-limits, like the main road into Golden Gate Park. Others are pushing back, saying they need to drive to work, drop off kids and get around. The debate has been marked by dueling rallies and strident arguments over safety and climate change in the densely packed city. On social media, customers threatened to boycott a bakery whose owner expressed support for reopening the main oceanside thoroughfare known as the Great Highway to cars; others came to her defense. The president of San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors was mocked for likening the closure of John F. Kennedy Drive in Golden Gate Park to the Jim Crow South, including by fellow African Americans. The city’s streets are scheduled to reopen 120 days after Mayor London Breed lifts the COVID-19 emergency declaration, which could come next month, and officials are studying which corridor closures could become permanent. The Board of Supervisors will have the final say, said Tamara Aparton, a city parks spokeswoman.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The popular outdoor swimming pool at City Park will open Saturday for the first time in nearly two years, and neighborhood pools throughout Fort Collins are opening on time this year without the COVID-19 restrictions that limited their use last summer. Officials kept City Park Pool closed throughout 2020 in response to public health orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It’s slated to remain open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily through Aug. 21. “We’re anticipating a very packed pool this summer with pent-up demand to do things and get outside of the house,” said Aaron Harris, interim recreation director for the city of Fort Collins. All the neighborhood pools that Splash Pool Services operates within Poudre School District boundaries were scheduled to open Wednesday – the first day of summer vacation for PSD students – with most dropping the reservation requirements, capacity limits and other COVID-19 restrictions that were in place when they finally were able to open in late June and early July last year, Splash co-owner Amy Casady said Tuesday. “I won’t say its 100% back to normal,” Casady said, “but we are definitely on our way.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation requiring employers to recall certain workers who were laid off at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and afterward in order of seniority. The bill, which passed on a 19-15 vote, now awaits action in the House. Under the proposal, private-sector employers with at least 15 employers must notify laid-off employees in the janitorial and maintenance, food service and hospitality industries in writing about positions they’re qualified to fill that become available. Workers with the most seniority would get preference for the open job and would have no less than five days to accept or decline the offer. Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, co-chair of the General Assembly’s Labor and Public Employees Committee, said the legislation will help ensure that businesses don’t try to “save the bottom line a bit” as they emerge from the pandemic and hire less-senior employees to fill open jobs. Sen. Paul Formica, R-East Lyme, a restaurant owner, said while he understands the thought behind the bill, it’s too intrusive on small businesses. He also noted the legislation applies to people laid off after March 10, 2020, and before Dec. 31, 2024, which is more than three years away.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The Hugging Mayor had empty arms around this time last year. Vance Funk still walked Main Street, where he can be found almost every early morning, but social distancing and COVID-19 meant no more hugs for the gregarious 78-year-old. But as vaccination rates rise, mask rules are loosened, and capacity restrictions are abolished, the Hugging Mayor is back, as are his fans. “It’s a real nice feeling, and it’s good to be back,” he said. Many Delawareans are upbeat and brimming with hope as crowds begin to form again at restaurants, concert venues and sporting events. Over the weekend, shoulder-to-shoulder crowds returned to spots like the Bottle & Cork in Dewey Beach for its weekly “Jam Session” concert filled with cover bands, beer and dancing – the latter of which had been banned, but now the “Footloose” jokes can be retired. Dr. David Tam, president and CEO of Beebe Healthcare, has seen the shift in mood from a unique vantage point, having begun the job March 17, 2020. “It was like parachuting into combat,” he said. Tam said it’s important not only to use this time to reconnect with people after an extended isolation but also to talk about pandemic experiences with friends and family. He also suggests using this time to tackle other important things that were paused, such as seeing a doctor for a regular check-up.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Black residents make up more than 80% of the city’s coronavirus cases, according to new data analyzed by the Washington Post. Although Black and white residents each represent 46% of D.C.’s total population, according to 2019 U.S. census data, white people account for less than 10% of cases in recent days. The spike displays the nation’s racial divide and reflects issues of accessibility when it comes to disseminating COVID-19 vaccines. The Post’s tracker reports 44.5% of the city’s population has received a vaccine. For the roughly 70% of vaccinations with racial data, the city estimates about 19.8% of Black residents are fully vaccinated, compared to 28.8% of white residents. “There’s a disparity in who’s getting vaccinated,” Neil Sehgal, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of Maryland, told the Post. “And if those cases that we’re seeing are concentrated among unvaccinated people, and fewer Black residents of D.C. are getting vaccinated, it seems to reason that our Black neighbors are at a greater risk of contracting COVID today than at any point in recent memory.” According to Sehgal, barriers that may be keeping people from getting vaccinated include limited transportation, difficulties getting time off work to get a shot, and complicated sign-up systems.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Residents and visitors to the Sunshine State are expected to have increased protections against pandemic-related fraud and scams under a bill signed Tuesday. The measure went to the desk of Gov. Ron DeSantis after the Florida House and Senate both passed the legislation unanimously during the normal session this past spring. The new law prohibits someone from trying to profit by lying about the authenticity, effectiveness or availability of personal protective equipment. It also prohibits someone from making money by offering access to a vaccine for COVID-19 or any other pandemic disease. The new law allows the state’s attorney general to shut down websites or other media platforms disseminating false information about vaccines or fraudulently selling PPE.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: As the number of COVID-19 patients in the city’s hospitals has dwindled along with new cases across the nation, a new normal may be settling in, health officials said. University Hospital dropped into the single digits in COVID-19 inpatients Monday, its lowest level since last June, spokeswoman Rebecca Sylvester said. The eight patients admitted to the hospital last week were the lowest in a quite a while, said Reyne Gallup, University’s chief operating officer for acute care services. The Georgia average for daily cases as of Sunday was 450.71, a 52.85% decrease from April 23. In light of the lower demand, University has closed its COVID-19 cohort units, negative-pressure units where those patients were concentrated and could be cared for by a dedicated team, and is now relying on a series of roughly two dozen negative-air pressure rooms for those patients when they come in, Gallup said. “We’ve moved away from the cohort of an entire wing or area to putting them in rooms that have the capability to manage that airflow,” she said. The hospital has the ability to quickly transition back if there is a surge, Gallup said. “We definitely have through all of this transition been able to figure out a path moving forward, either to expand or decrease the ability to care for the COVID population,” she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Tuesday that people will no longer have to wear masks outdoors as the number of COVID-19 cases drops and as more people get vaccinated. The Democratic governor said he would maintain a requirement that people wear masks indoors. The same rules will apply regardless of whether someone is vaccinated against COVID-19. Still, Ige said he would encourage those who are in large groups outside to continue to wear masks. “The virus is still circulating in our community, and unvaccinated people are particularly at risk. And until more are vaccinated, we must continue to take precautions indoors and in large groups because those actions are important to slow the spread of COVID-19,” Ige said at a news conference. He also said that starting June 1, he would allow ocean sports competitions like surfing contests and canoe paddling races to take place. Ige said 57% of Hawaii’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while just under half of the population has been fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nPreston: A state Department of Health and Welfare office that helped people apply for Medicaid, food stamps, child care assistance and other benefits will close next month. The state’s lease for the small-town space expires at the end of June. The office hasn’t been open to the public for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The three Preston employees will keep working for the department, and officials said people would still be able to apply for self-reliance benefits by phone, fax machine or online. The next closest office – about 70 miles north in the city of Pocatello – will remain open to the public. “While closing an office is not without some impact, we want to assure individuals and families that services are still available,” department director Dave Jeppesen said in a statement. “The department enjoyed a long-standing and close partnership with the building owner for many years, but the need for face-to-face services has diminished and most of the work can be completed virtually.” The department will still provide in-person services to people in the region for some programs like behavioral health and child protection services. There are 18 other department offices open to the public across the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state has officially crossed the 40% threshold of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19, another important milestone as the state moves closer to normalcy with Memorial Day approaching. The Illinois Department of Public Health said Tuesday that 5,112,262 people had been fully vaccinated through either two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, representing 40.12% of the population. IDPH also said 65% of adult residents had received at least one dose, with 49% being fully vaccinated. Overall, the state has provided 10,990,171 vaccines since the vaccination program began in December, with 49,402 being reported Tuesday. The seven-day average remains steady at 79,485 vaccinations per day, the highest since May 11. The success of the vaccination program has allowed for a significant decline in caseloads, with Tuesday marking the third consecutive day of fewer than 1,000 cases reported. IDPH said 808 new cases were reported, with 17 new deaths. The statewide coronavirus test positivity rate remained steady at 2.7%, with the rate as a percentage of total tests ticking down to 2.1%, the lowest since March 13.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Nearly 20 state legislators are protesting Indiana University’s decision to require all students and employees to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, and they want the governor to block the move. A letter dated Tuesday to Gov. Eric Holcomb calls on him to prohibit any state university from mandating vaccines that don’t have full U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. The letter follows IU’s announcement Friday that COVID-19 shots will be required for the fall semester on all of its campuses. “Enforcing a mandate that students and faculty accept a vaccine that does not have full FDA approval is unconscionable,” said the letter written by Rep. Jim Lucas of Seymour and signed by 18 fellow Republican House members. No high-ranking Republican leaders, however, signed the letter. The governor’s office said Holcomb would review the letter after he returns Thursday from a trip to Israel. IU spokesman Chuck Carney said university officials are prioritizing the safety of students and employees. “IU’s vaccine policy is a clear path forward that will ensure a higher rate of immunity and the opportunity to give our students, faculty and staff a more typical university experience,” Carney said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A group representing pork producers urged the federal government Tuesday to let them continue an effort to speed up the processing of pigs into bacon and ham despite a union’s claim that the increased volume endangers workers. The National Pork Producers Council, an industry trade group, sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture calling on the agency to appeal a ruling by a federal judge that it argued would needlessly slow production and hurt farmers still recovering from problems associated with the coronavirus pandemic. “The U.S. pork production system, the most advanced in the world, is characterized by robust competition, innovation and efficiency. With the stroke of a judge’s pen, the lives of many hog farmers will be upended if this misguided ruling takes effect,” said NPPC President Jen Sorenson, communications director for Iowa Select Farms, the state’s largest pork producer based in West Des Moines. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents 33,000 pork slaughterhouse workers, said the judge’s ruling recognized that the USDA failed to consider worker safety when it finalized the faster production speeds. UFCW International President Marc Perrone said the USDA must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of increased line speeds on worker safety.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s COVID-19 emergency declaration is set to expire Friday. It may end on Friday, period, without being renewed, depending on what legislative leaders do with it. The feeling is that it’s time to be done. Under a new law passed this year, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has less power to take executive action regarding disaster emergencies such as COVID-19. Whereas before such requests for emergency extensions happened under the State Finance Council, in which the governor chaired over GOP legislative leaders, they now will happen solely under the jurisdiction of the Legislative Coordinating Council, comprised of only legislative leaders. If the LCC does extend the declaration, it’ll be at most an extension of 30 days. Tussles over extending the emergency declaration have reached peak moments throughout the pandemic, when the executive and legislative branches argued over matters ranging from mask mandates to forced business closures. For the most part, though, such extensions have been relatively drama-free. But this time, lawmakers may actually lean against an extension, as the pandemic subsides, vaccinations rise, and guidance for face coverings loosens. Kelly will still be requesting an extension of the emergency declaration, the governor’s office confirmed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state will reopen its prisons to visitors starting next month, as the COVID-19 vaccination rate has risen among inmates, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Visitations will resume the week of June 20 at Department of Corrections and Juvenile Justice facilities, the governor announced Tuesday. More than 75% of adult inmates in state custody have been vaccinated, he said. The state halted in-person visits more than a year ago in response to the pandemic. Visitors must be vaccinated and will be expected to wear a mask and practice social distancing, the Democratic governor said. Each inmate will be allowed two visitors at a time. “Remember, this is a setting where if there is a COVID outbreak, we have seen that it can be devastating, how quickly it can be spread,” Beshear said. Several coronavirus outbreaks were reported at Kentucky prisons and jails during the pandemic. The new visitation guidelines don’t apply to county jails.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday that he’s scrapping nearly every remaining coronavirus restriction in Louisiana and lifting the statewide requirement that students must wear a mask in the classroom and at school events. The Democratic governor will keep his public health emergency declaration in place, but the state will have almost none of the rules governing businesses and behavior that were enacted over the past nearly 15 months of the pandemic. “There’s no doubt we are in a better place today than we’ve been at any point thus far in the pandemic,” Edwards said. “And that is because of medical science.” Edwards cited the wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in Louisiana, saying anyone who wants the protection offered by a shot can receive one. But many people aren’t bothering, with only 31% of the state’s 4.6 million residents fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The final vestiges of the restrictions that Edwards had left in place over the past month – including limits on bars, live music venues, athletic events and large gatherings – all will be removed under the new executive order to take effect Wednesday. Masks still will be required on public transit, in health care facilities, and in prisons and jails, as suggested by federal officials. School district and university leaders can choose to require masks.\n\nMaine\n\nAuburn: The bicentennial parade that will celebrate 200 years of Maine statehood will finally take place in August after a long delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Maine Bicentennial Commission said Tuesday that the parade will be held Aug. 21 in downtown Auburn and Lewiston. The event was originally slated for spring 2020. The delay means Maine will actually be 201 years old during the event. Event planners “are very excited that the pandemic response has progressed to a point that will now allow us to share the excitement of this event with people throughout Maine,” said the bicentennial commission chairman, Democratic state Sen. William Diamond. The parade is among numerous bicentennial events that were postponed by the pandemic. The commission said more details about the plans for the event will be released when the parade date nears. More than 70% of eligible Maine residents have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Tuesday. That means the state has far surpassed President Joe Biden’s goal of getting 70% of American adults a shot by July 4, she said. “We are getting shots into arms at a nation-leading pace, seeing our case counts trend downward and getting back to normal,” Mills said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s chief judge is updating COVID-19 health measures for courthouses and judicial facilities to enable vaccinated people to enter them without face coverings next week. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera issued the orders Tuesday in response to modified protocols from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They will be effective June 1. The new orders will allow all judicial employees and court visitors over the age of 2 who are fully vaccinated to enter judiciary facilities without masks, unless the administrative judge or state court administrator determines there are certain settings that may require them. In jurisdictions that may require certain additional health measures, the administrative judges of the circuit court and district court must determine together whether to maintain restrictions. The administrative orders stipulate that those who have not been vaccinated must continue to wear masks. However, if they are participating in a court proceeding, a judge may require them to remove their mask and use a provided face shield.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 150-year-old agricultural fair canceled last year because of the pandemic is returning this summer, organizers said. The 154th Marshfield Fair is scheduled for Aug. 20-29, the fair’s board of directors announced Tuesday on Facebook. Vendors and exhibitors have already been contacted. “We already reached out to see who would still be interested in returning even with restrictions, and a good portion of them said they would,” said Leonard LaForest, president of the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society. The fair, held almost entirely outdoors, will likely not still be subject to many COVID-19 guidelines by August, he said. It draws farmers who show off their brightest flowers, largest vegetables and best-bred livestock and offers entertainment, arts and crafts exhibits, carnival rides and games, and food stalls. The fair typically draws about 160,000 people over its 10-day run. Meanwhile, this week the Boston Symphony Orchestra is bringing back its “rolling recitals” – a series of free, pop-up shows around the city. The performances began Wednesday and will continue Thursday in conjunction with Old Town Trolley Tour and Boston Duck Tours. The orchestra performed a similar series of pop-up shows in the fall.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Canned cocktails will be less expensive and can have a higher alcohol content starting this summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a package of bills at a distillery Monday. Under the legislation signed at Long Road Distillers, private wholesalers such as distilleries can sell canned cocktails with up to 13.5% alcohol, up from 10%, starting in August. The legislation also decreases the tax on mixed spirits from 48 cents to 30 cents per liter. “This is a great example of bipartisan legislation that will create jobs and help our small businesses grow, and shows what we can do when we work together,” Whitmer said in a news release. “Distillers are a growing industry in Michigan, and these bill make it easier for distillers to distribute their products.” The pandemic has sparked greater interest in canned cocktails, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. “Ready-to-drink cocktails saw a huge increase in 2020 and show no signs of slowing down,” David Wojnar, council senior vice president, said in a news release. Many distillers revamped their operations to produce hand sanitizer at the peak of the pandemic, including Long Road Distillers, Whitmer said during the signing. Michigan will come back from the pandemic stronger than ever “because of small businesses like this one,” she said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Housing officials are urging legislators to proceed carefully in negotiating an end to a moratorium on rental property evictions. While other state coronavirus restrictions are being lifted, lawmakers have failed to reach a compromise on ending the eviction moratorium. Housing commissioner Jennifer Ho said the anxiety of both owners and renters is real. “Why would the Legislature want to inflict unnecessary harm that creates a chaotic environment when we’re all tired from what we’ve been through with the pandemic and the economy?” Ho asked. Because of COVID-19, landlords dealing with unpaid rent, loud parties, police calls and threatening behavior haven’t been able to evict tenants, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “We have people that are behaving badly in our properties, and we need to bring some relief to their neighbors who have put up with their nonsense for far too long,” said Cecil Smith, president of the Minnesota Multi Housing Association. Democrats want landlords to hold off on most evictions for financial reasons for a year after the moratorium lifts, then provide at least 30 days’ notice before canceling a lease or moving to evict a person for failing to pay rent or otherwise breaking a lease. Gov. Tim Walz wants legislators to reach an agreement instead of him rescinding the order.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: People protested Tuesday near the Mississippi Capitol and the state Supreme Court building to demand Gov. Tate Reeves call legislators into special session to restore a medical marijuana initiative that voters approved in November and that justices recently overturned. In the 6-3 ruling May 14, the high court also invalidated the entire initiative process that allows citizens to petition to bring issues to a statewide vote. Justices said the process is outdated, so the medical marijuana proposal was not properly on the ballot. About 1.3 million Mississippians voted in November, and more than 766,000 voted in favor of the medical marijuana proposal – about 10,000 more than voted for then-President Donald Trump, who easily won in Mississippi despite losing his race for a second term. One handwritten sign Tuesday said: “New Math: 6 > 766K.” Brandon Allen, 35, a military veteran from Pearl, sat holding a sign with the slogan: “Special Session Now Tater Tot.” Allen said he knows veterans who have post traumatic stress syndrome, and marijuana could help them. “I don’t think the government should tell people how they should and shouldn’t live,” he said, moments before a band at the event started playing the Willie Nelson song “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: After a year off due to the coronavirus pandemic, fireworks will return to the St. Louis riverfront on Independence Day, but Fair St. Louis will have to wait another year. Organizers of Fair St. Louis announced Wednesday that the Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular will begin around 9:40 p.m. July 4. The fireworks will be launched from barges on the Mississippi River. Organizers also plan a parade that will begin at 10 a.m. July 3. But Fair St. Louis won’t return to the Gateway Arch National Park until 2022. The event is traditionally one of the nation’s largest Fourth of July festivals, drawing tens of thousands of people.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state Department of Corrections has reported about half of the people in custody are choosing not to get vaccinated against COVID-19, despite being held in communal living situations that increase the risk of infection. Department spokesperson Alexandria Klapmeier said there is a 50% vaccination refusal rate across the state, The Billings Gazette reports. So far, 1,405 inmates in state prisons have been fully vaccinated. The Montana State Prison has vaccinated 51% of its facility population, or 820 of 1,453 people, officials said. The Montana Women’s Prison vaccinated 49% of its facility population, or 102 of 206 people. Some locations are doing better than others, with the Great Falls Regional Prison reporting it vaccinated more inmates than it currently has in custody. “The DOC continues to provide information to inmates about the benefits of vaccination and offer vaccine to inmates who have declined previously,” Klapmeier said. She noted that everyone booked into department-run facilities is offered COVID-19 vaccine, but not everyone accepts the offer. Officials said the state’s two largest jails – Yellowstone County jail and Missoula County jail – are seeing lower rates of vaccination.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts urged lawmakers Tuesday to uphold his veto of a bill that would let more residents collect food-assistance benefits, arguing that it would slow the state’s recovery from the pandemic. The Republican governor said in his veto letter that the measure would create a disincentive for recipients to seek better-paying jobs at a time when many businesses are desperate for workers. “We should remove any incentives that would slow reopening, regrowth, re-employment and reconnecting,” he said in his letter to lawmakers. “Whether intended or not, (the bill) discourages Nebraskans from returning to work.” The veto issued Monday drew swift condemnation from advocates for the poor, who argued that many recipients are working families with children who are still struggling because of the pandemic. They also pointed out that the expansion would be paid with existing money and have no impact on the state budget. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps, is paid with federal money. Supporters also noted that the measure was temporary, with an expiration date of Oct. 1, 2023, although Ricketts countered that government benefits are almost never revoked once they’ve been offered.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: A year after being canceled due to the pandemic, Fourth of July festivities are returning to downtown this summer. The Nugget Casino Resort will host its 21st Star Spangled Sparks fireworks show July 4. Food and craft vendors will set up on Victorian Square, with fireworks going off around 9:40 p.m., weather permitting. The Nugget parking garage is expected to fill quickly. Shuttle service to Victorian Square will be available. Event information and music during the fireworks will be broadcast live on KKOH News Talk 780 AM radio. Dogs, barbecues, tents and glass bottles are not permitted on Victorian Square during special events, according to Sparks City Ordinance. The Reno Aces also announced a fireworks show July 4 at Greater Nevada Field. There are not any fireworks shows planned around Lake Tahoe this year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A state House committee split evenly along party lines Tuesday on a proposal to prohibit most businesses from asking customers or employees whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The committee on executive departments and administration voted 9-9 on amending a Senate-passed bill to add several vaccine-related provisions favored by Republicans. It reached the same outcome on a Democrat-backed amendment, meaning both versions will go to the full House next month with no committee recommendation. Under the GOP-led amendment, businesses could not inquire about someone’s vaccine status or require employees to be vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, with some exceptions for hospitals and long-term care facilities. It also would give the Legislature control over whether schools could require students to receive any future vaccines. Democrats argued that public health officials, not lawmakers, should decide which vaccines should be required for school enrollment and that businesses should be allowed to make decisions based on public safety. “For God’s sake, this is a respiratory disease,” said Rep. Peter Schmidt, D-Dover. “If there’s anything human beings need to do, it is to breathe on a very, very frequent basis.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: From sensory rooms to sign language interpreters and in-car service, the state is offering accommodations at its vaccine sites to help people with disabilities get their free COVID-19 shots. The state has six mega-sites where it assures residents adjustments can be made: the Meadowlands Racetrack in Bergen County, Rockaway Townsquare mall in Morris County, the New Jersey Convention and Expo Center in Middlesex County, Rowan College in Gloucester County, Moorestown Mall in Burlington County and the Atlantic City Convention Center. “I came away very impressed with the thought and sensitivity that went into planning with respect to accommodations,” said Paul Aronsohn, the state’s ombudsman for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, after a recent tour of the locations. “You could tell a lot of thought went into it. It wasn’t just making sure that people with mobility challenges had wheelchairs.” A hodgepodge of agencies, including the National Guard, the Office of Emergency Management, the state Department of Health and county officials, shape the experience from the start. The sites had workers walking the registration and vaccination lines “to make sure people didn’t seem agitated or uncomfortable in any way,” said Aronsohn, a former Ridgewood mayor.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The superintendent of the state’s largest school district has backtracked on a promise to channel federal relief of at least $6 million toward staff bonuses after state auditors warned that it would probably violate state constitutional provisions against giving away taxpayer dollars. Scott Elder, superintendent of Albuquerque Public Schools, last week announced $1,000 each to full-time teachers and staff and $500 bonuses to part-timers as a “one-time additional payment for COVID-related work” through the pandemic. But in an online video Tuesday, Elder said the payments had been flagged as a potential violation of the anti-donation clause of the New Mexico Constitution. “I have some extremely difficult news to share, and I ask that you not lose faith,” Elder said. “I just don’t want you to plan for money that may not arrive.” State Auditor Brian Colon said the clause prohibits retroactive compensation after services are rendered. “It’s very disappointing that Albuquerque Public Schools didn’t do its homework and follow the rules,” he said. “Unfortunately, I know that education professionals have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, and there are going to be a lot of disappointed folks out there, including my wife,” who is a teacher at Van Buren Middle School in Albuquerque.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Vaccinated kids ages 12 to 17 will have a chance to win a full ride to a public university or college in the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. The governor said the state will raffle off 50 scholarships, which would cover four years of tuition, room and board, books, and supplies. New York will hold weekly drawings on Wednesdays to randomly select 10 winners. Parents or guardians can enter children who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine since May 12. Schools across the country are using mascots, food trucks and prize giveaways to try to get kids vaccinated before school lets out for the summer. Cuomo said children who get vaccinated earlier will have the best chance at winning. It’s unclear when applications for the lottery will open up, but people can sign up for notifications on a state website. “If you get the vaccine earlier, you’ll have more chances to win because you’ll be in the first-week pool, the second-week pool, the third-week pool, the fourth-week pool, etc.,” Cuomo said at a Wednesday press conference. Since Monday, New York has been offering scratch tickets for a $5 million lottery for people who get vaccinated at ten of roughly 30 state-run vaccination sites. That pilot program runs through Friday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: With employers struggling to fill positions as post-pandemic restrictions end, state senators advanced a proposal Wednesday giving $1,500 bonuses to unemployment benefit recipients who return to work this summer. The Senate Commerce Committee gave bipartisan support to the measure, which would offer bonuses – but only if federal labor officials allow the state to use money coming from Washington that’s made unemployment benefits more generous during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill also would place additional requirements upon current beneficiaries to respond to job interview requests, or they could ultimately see benefits cut off. “It’s a good first step to helping us address the workforce shortages that we have in North Carolina right now,” Sen. Chuck Edwards, R-Henderson County, told the committee. The additional $300-a-week federal benefit is proving to be a disincentive to some displaced workers, according to bill supporters. Several senators say they’ve been told by local employers that they can’t find enough people to hire, even while increasing wages. “This crisis is widespread; it’s impacting all industries, all sizes all across North Carolina,” said Nicole Hendren with Catapult, a North Carolina-based employer consultant on personnel and other issues.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two Republican legislators are asking state health officials to stop calling residents to offer information on COVID-19 vaccines. Sens. Jessica Bell and Nicole Poolman sent a letter to State Health Officer Dr. Nizar Wehbi expressing concern about the role of government in “personal health choices” and patient privacy. Both lawmakers said they had heard from constituents who were called and given vaccine information. Poolman said the people to whom she talked wanted to know how state government knew they hadn’t been vaccinated, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Health officials say the callers are state employees who are trained in privacy laws. In a letter responding to Bell and Poolman, Wehbi said since COVID-19 is still “circulating in our communities,” people who aren’t vaccinated are at the highest risk of contracting the disease, and vaccine reminders are not unusual. “Reminder/recall outreach is a well-established, effective tool that has been used to increase immunization coverage rates for years,” he wrote. Letters also were sent to people 65 and older who did not have a recorded COVID-19 vaccine. The patient information is in a secure database owned by the state Health Department, according to Wehbi.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Public entities and private employers would be prohibited from requiring vaccinations, and workers could not be fired for refusing, under GOP legislation pending in a state House panel. The bill before the House Health Committee also strengthens the notices schools must provide parents about exemptions they can seek against having children vaccinated. It would repeal a law requiring college students to disclose whether they’ve been vaccinated against hepatitis B and meningococcal meningitis. The legislation never mentions COVID-19 or the coronavirus, but in testimony, sponsoring Rep. Jennifer Gross referred to employers including hospitals requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Gross, R-West Chester, is a nurse practitioner who said she believes in vaccinations and in personal choice and hasn’t gotten a COVID-19 shot. The bill is strongly opposed by the Ohio Vaccine Coalition, a newly formed group representing numerous hospitals, state associations of doctors and nurses, other health care groups, and major business entities including the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. “This legislation has the potential to reverse decades of immunity from life-threatening, but vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, hepatitis, meningitis and tuberculosis,” the group said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: OU Health will close its public coronavirus testing site in the city at the end of the month, as cases and demand for the tests have declined. At one point, OU Health was conducting more than 800 tests a day. “As COVID-19 cases continue to decline in Oklahoma, our community testing numbers have gone down to less than 50 a day,” said Erin Walker, assistant vice president of Operations at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health. With testing offered at physicians’ offices and through the Oklahoma City-County Health Department, Walker said a public testing site on the campus is no longer necessary. OU Health-Tulsa’s public testing location closed a month ago. Virus testing has declined across the state, data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health shows. According to the state’s most recent epidemiology report, there were 19,161 tests performed across the state the week of May 9, and 1,043 were positive. In comparison, weekly testing numbers in January were often above 100,000, with positivity rates between 15% and 20%. Since August 2020 through the end of April, more than 71,000 people were tested through OU Health in Oklahoma City. OU Health will still perform pre-procedure coronavirus tests for patients.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: For the first time in months, restaurants in Multnomah County – the state’s most populous and home to Portland – will open for 50% capacity for indoor dining after meeting COVID-19 vaccination goals. Gov. Kate Brown announced Tuesday that half of Oregon’s counties will move to the “lower risk” level Thursday. That category allows a county to significantly reduce its COVID-19 restrictions – 50% capacity for indoor dining, theaters, gyms and other indoor entertainment spaces. It also expands indoor gatherings to 10 people and retail store capacity to 75%. “The science is clear: Vaccines are very effective in keeping people safe from COVID-19, and they are the key to returning to normal life and lifting health and safety restrictions statewide,” Brown said. Earlier this month, the Democratic governor set statewide and county COVID-19 vaccination targets, with the hope of reopening the state’s economy. Brown said most statewide coronavirus-related restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents 16 and up have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Currently, more than half of Oregon’s eligible population 16 and up have received at least a first dose. In Multnomah County, at least 67% of people in that age group have received at least one dose.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Department of Health has dropped its legal action against more than 40 restaurants that were accused of defying orders to close indoor dining and maintain social distancing protocols. The Health Department had filed two separate complaints alleging that restaurants were violating pandemic restrictions that Gov. Tom Wolf imposed in December in response to a winter surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The state had sought an order to shut down in-person dining, as well as damages. Department officials said that most restaurants came into compliance and that the pandemic has since eased. “The majority of restaurants have come into compliance with the secretary of health’s orders to protect their customers from the spread of COVID-19 within their communities,” said Health Department spokesperson Maggi Barton. She said that with the pandemic in retreat, nearly all of the state’s remaining restrictions are slated to be lifted on Memorial Day. The Health Department petitioned Commonwealth Court last week to discontinue the matter, and the court granted the request Tuesday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A factory once praised by former President Donald Trump for ramping up production of N95 face masks in the early days of the pandemic is laying off nearly 500 workers as the coronavirus threat eases and demand for the face coverings wanes. A spokesperson for Honeywell International told WPRI-TV on Wednesday that about 470 jobs at the Smithfield facility are being cut. Employees are being urged to apply for other jobs at the company, and some eligible workers will receive severance, he said. “We are now seeing a dramatic reduction in demand for N95s in the U.S. as many states are ending or scaling back mask mandates and vaccinations are being widely distributed,” Eric Krantz said in a statement. “For these reasons, Honeywell is adjusting its N95 operations and ceasing manual production of N95s at our facility in Smithfield.” The company is shifting production of N95s to “more efficient, automated production lines” that were created during the pandemic, he said. The disposable respirators are critical safety equipment for health care workers and others. “We appreciate the hard work and dedication these employees displayed in helping to protect American frontline workers battling the pandemic,” Krantz said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster has signed into law a bill clarifying that beach towns can’t eliminate free parking along state roads without permission from state officials. The new law is the latest face-off in the longtime struggle between people who can afford to live at the beach and those who want to visit. The law requires state permission to change parking along a state road. It also requires that any fees charged by beach towns for parking only offset the amount spent to provide services to visitors. Most of those provisions were already in state law. Supporters felt they needed to be clarified after towns, mostly close to Charleston like Isle of Palms and Folly Beach, first closed the roads to their islands when the COVID-19 pandemic began last year and later banned free parking after the governor ordered beaches to reopen in late spring 2020. Those barrier islands have a long tradition of allowing people to park on the side of state-owned roads, pop open the hatchback or truck tailgate, pull out some towels and coolers, and head for the waves and sand. But in the past few decades, beach bungalows have given way to million-dollar mansions, and traffic snarls are constant on sunny, summer weekends. State law says once public access is allowed to the beach, it must always be maintained.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Both the state Department of Education and South Dakota Board of Regents said Monday that COVID-19 vaccines won’t be required for students or staff to return to public schools and universities this fall. Regents spokeswoman Tracy Mercer said such a requirement would not be a “campus-by-campus” decision but a board decision or a legislative matter. For example, state law mandates that college students have their a variety of immunizations, such as against measles, mumps and rubella, Mercer noted. There was no effort by lawmakers this spring to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations, and the Regents don’t plan to mandate the immunizations either, Mercer said. The board’s decision follows its repeal of mask mandates on campus earlier this month. The DOE and Department of Health don’t have plans to add COVID-19 shots to the list of required vaccinations for school entry, DOE deputy secretary Mary Stadick Smith said. “We remain confident in parents taking responsibility for their children and ensuring they are properly protected with immunizations,” Daniel Bucheli, the health department’s communications director, said in December about the DOH’s decision.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: As FedEx is hiring more, employee turnover is increasing, too. The rate of new hires and turnover at the Memphis-based logistics giant have both been steadily climbing for years, according to its 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance report. FedEx’s new hire rate and turnover rate were 43% and 38%, respectively, in fiscal year 2016. Those rates climbed to 71% and 65% in 2020. FedEx fiscal years run from June 1 to May 31. The company has needed more employees to handle record package volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It sought to hire 70,000 people for its holiday peak season, and FedEx Ground alone was recently hiring 8,000 employees weekly heading into the holidays. At its vital World Hub in Memphis, FedEx Express has installed multiple temporary pay raises to attract and retain more hourly employees. In a statement addressing the higher turnover rate, FedEx said it’s “constantly evaluating and enhancing our pay, benefits and hiring incentive programs to ensure they remain highly competitive.” People often leave front-line positions due to the work being physically taxing, having challenging hours or providing little warning in terms of shift scheduling, said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The University of Texas at El Paso has not seen a positive coronavirus test among students, faculty or staff in three weeks. The university’s Environmental Health and Safety department was not aware of any UTEP employees or students who were sick with COVID-19 as of Monday morning – the first instance of a COVID-19-free campus since March 13, 2020, according to a UTEP news release Monday signed off by UTEP President Heather Wilson. “It isn’t over yet, but today was a milestone and I just wanted to let you know,” the release said. For the fall and spring semesters, as well as the latter part of last spring, the university provided distance learning. Since March 2020, the university has conducted more than 59,000 tests for the virus. The school finished administering a final round of second doses of COVID-19 vaccines Friday. UTEP’s vaccination program has provided more than 30,000 vaccines to El Pasoans. As of Monday, 52% of El Pasoans 12 and older were fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and 66.4% were partially vaccinated, according to El Paso’s COVID-19 data tracker. The university is still encouraging the public to get a vaccine if able and to wear masks until fully vaccinated.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: There’s a new way to explore the state this Memorial Day weekend. The Utah Natural History Museum has kicked off the Explorer Corps, a scavenger hunt for markers recognizing iconic natural or cultural history in each of the state’s 29 counties. “People should experience not just the Mighty Five but all of the beautiful places off the beaten paths,” Utah Office of Tourism Director Vicki Varella said at the kickoff event Tuesday. Locals and visitors can find the markers through the Explorer Corp app or through a paper passport found online or at a local library. “The program promotes travel and tourism throughout our state and is another avenue for Utah counties to build back better,” Brandy Grace, CEO of the Utah Association of Counties said in a video. The challenge runs from this Friday through Labor Day and includes giveaways through natural history-themed summer programming for all ages, a press release said. Each marker was designed and fabricated by O.C. Tanner and was placed in collaboration with the support of several organizations and state officials, including Gov. Spencer Cox, who virtually spoke at Tuesday’s event. The Explorer Corp program has been in the works for a few years with pandemic setbacks but came to fruition this year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine is reminding Vermonters who got a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to ensure they get their second dose. “It really is key to your health. Getting both doses gives you the highest level of protection from COVID-19,” he said Tuesday during the governor’s twice-weekly virus briefing, adding that the full vaccine series also offers better protection against coronavirus variants. “We know that these are still circulating. We know that the vaccine is doing a great job with them, and we need to keep doing everything we can to keep them at bay. This means getting as many Vermonters fully vaccinated as we can,” Levine said. About 76.9% of the state’s eligible population has had at least one dose, and 88.8% of people ages 65 and older are fully vaccinated, according to Mike Pieciak, commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, who has been following the COVID-19 trends for Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A federal judge has approved a settlement in a lawsuit focused on a beleaguered part of the state’s unemployment system in an effort to speed up benefits for people who are out of work. U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson approved the settlement Tuesday in a suit filed last month on behalf of five women who alleged “gross failures” to provide needed help as required by law amid the coronavirus pandemic. Virginia has done well in quickly processing simple unemployment benefits for eligible individuals as applications surged amid the pandemic, but the state has recently been dead last for timely processing of certain claims that require additional adjudication, data show. The judge’s order directs the Virginia Employment Commission to increase the number of unemployment insurance claims adjudicated each week. It also says the agency shall “substantially resolve” at least 95% of unpaid claims awaiting adjudication by Labor Day. And it directs the commission to improve communication with applicants and recipients and begin planning for a process to automatically provide information to each claimant about how to apply for other government assistance programs.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People can now get a COVID-19 vaccination on a ferry. The state Department of Transportation and Peninsula Community Health Services are offering shots aboard Seattle-Bremerton ferry runs this week, through Thursday. Another round of shots will be given next week, from June 1 to 3. KOMO reports interested passengers can get a shot on sailings departing from mid-morning until late afternoon. Among those getting vaccinated onboard the ferry from Bremerton to Seattle on Tuesday was Gavin Davis, who was taking the ferry to his job in Seattle working a night shift in security and loss-prevention. Davis said because he works nights and sleeps during the day, he had not yet found time to get vaccinated, but when he boarded the ferry and was told he could get the shot on his way to work, he accepted and got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: People who have received all their COVID-19 vaccinations no longer will be required to wear a mask outdoors on West Virginia University campuses, the university said Tuesday. The school will continue to require masks indoors in most situations, WVU said in a news release. Vaccinated individuals in groups of fewer than 10 indoors on campus may decide as an entire group to remove masks. Masks in spaces such as personal vehicles and private offices are not required for vaccinated or unvaccinated people, the statement said. On June 1, the university will ease requirements for out-of-state travel for vaccinated people, who do not need to get tested for the coronavirus or quarantine for five days following out-of-state domestic travel. Such travelers who are not vaccinated must continue to quarantine and are recommended to be tested for the virus, the statement said. The university said vaccinated international travelers do not need to quarantine upon return but should get a test afterward and self-monitor for symptoms. Unvaccinated individuals are strongly discouraged from traveling internationally and will be required to quarantine for seven calendar days after travel and get tested.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday announced changes to policies for fans at American Family Field, effective for games beginning Tuesday, June 1. The Brewers previously announced attendance would go from its current maximum of 50% capacity to 100% capacity June 25. “As we move toward 100% capacity, we look forward to the return of policies that will enhance the fan experience throughout American Family Field,” said Rick Schlesinger, the Brewers’ president of business operations. Fans who are fully vaccinated will not be required to wear masks in the stands during games. Following U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the Brewers ask that fans who are not vaccinated continue to wear masks when not actively eating or drinking. Cash will be accepted at a limited number of concession stands. The majority of concession stands, as well as portable kiosks and retail locations, will remain cashless, with credit cards accepted as well as contactless payment such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: COVID-19-related hospitalizations are at their highest level since January across the state, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The 58 patients in hospitals with the coronavirus remain far below November’s peak of 247, according to the paper, but are “very concerning” to medical officials.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/24/amusement-parks-2021-covid-changes-six-flags-hersheypark-legoland/7208087002/", "title": "COVID changed amusement parks.

Attendance at the park is down due to COVID-19. JACK HANRAHAN FILE PHOTO/ERIE TIMES-NEWS\n\nIn Erie, Pennsylvania, management of family-owned Waldameer makes an effort to add something new each offseason. Sometimes it's a ride. Sometimes it's an expansion of its water park. Sometimes it's both.\n\nNew for 2020 was a family-oriented spinning roller coaster called Whirlwind. The park also continued to expand its water park, adding a six-lane racing waterslide, the construction of which was delayed by a statewide shutdown on construction.\n\n\"It was very popular for the people who did come in the park,\" said Steve Gorman, the park's president.\n\nThe problem was that not enough people came to the park.\n\n“Our attendance is much lower than we had anticipated and hoped for,” Gorman said when he was interviewed in late July. “I was optimistic that most people were willing to get out and resume life and have fun. I appear to have been mistaken.”\n\nGorman's hoping this year will be different. He's hoping that the desire to do something fun after a year spent mostly at home will bring the crowds. And he's hoping last year's crop of new rides — still unseen and unridden by most of the park's fans — will still offer the glimmer of something new.\n\nGet the latest on Pennsylvania's amusement parks Read more From Waldameer and Idlewild's classic rides to new thrill machines at Hersheypark and Dorney Park, see what Pennsylvania has to offer.\n\nA visit to Steelers Country\n\nAt Kennywood Park, near Pittsburgh, park fans will be able to renew acquaintances with the Steel Curtain, a giant roller coaster that's part of Kennywood's Steelers Country, a themed section of the amusement park.\n\nThe Steel Curtain, an inversion coaster that flips riders upside-down a record nine times and was named Best New Roller Coaster by Amusement Today magazine, drew crowds when it opened in July 2019.\n\nThe Steel Curtain roller coaster at Kennywood, near Pittsburgh, made its debut in the middle of 2019, but never opened during the 2020 season.

The Rev. Mike Lewis of the Selma Bridge Lights Project gave an update on the timeline last week. Lewis had proposed the idea in 2017 as a way of attracting more people to visit the city, The Selma Times-Journal reports. About 600 protesters marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a day in 1965 that became known as Bloody Sunday. The late civil rights leader John Lewis, leading the demonstrators across the bridge in a protest for voting rights, was knocked to the ground and beaten by law enforcement officers. The violence on the bridge focused the nation’s attention on racial oppression in the South. “When people think of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, they think of Selma. The lighting of the Edmund Pettus Bridge will honor the foot soldiers and civil rights,” the Rev. Mike Lewis said. There are plans to have different lights for various occasions, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Rental rates across the state have risen during the pandemic, and it’s more difficult to find an apartment, a new study indicates. The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development survey shows a median adjusted rent for all unit types in Alaska at $1,179 a month in 2021, a 2% increase from spring 2020, Alaska Public Media reports. Sitka had the highest median rental rate at $1,323, the survey shows, while Wrangell and Petersburg were the lowest at $950. In Anchorage, the state’s largest city, the rent was $1,172, up 2.8% over 2020. The largest increase came in Ketchikan, where the average rent rose nearly 10% to $1,230 this year. However, the survey notes that electricity and water rates had just been approved at the time of the survey, and that anticipated increase might have been a factor. Vacancy rates dropped almost everywhere across the state. State economist Rob Krieger said that amid the pandemic, fewer people moved to a new rental, and there were fewer people shifting from renting to buying their first home. Rising home purchase prices and low interest rates are also making it difficult for first-time buyers in a competitive housing market, “especially when you consider that an average mortgage payment is now significantly higher than the average rent,” Krieger said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Political wonks and interested citizens can help draw the state’s new congressional and legislative districts. Mapping software made available by the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission will allow computer users to examine new rough drafts of the districts combined with the latest census data. More tech-savvy folks can tinker with the software, at tiny.cc/arizmap, to create new district boundaries based on population and demographics, then submit their handiwork to the commission, which may use some of the ideas in the commission’s final maps. The five-member commission conducted 15 “listening tour” events around the state in July and August and is scheduled to discuss and adopt grid maps at its Tuesday meeting. Those maps look nothing like the final redistricting maps, displaying contiguous boxes that contain roughly equal portions of Arizona’s more than 7 million inhabitants, as based on the 2020 census. The maps split the population evenly among the nine congressional and 30 legislative districts. With this raw clay, plus the ideas heard and yet to be heard from the public in the coming weeks, the commissioners will redraw the boundaries for the next 10 years. Hearings on the draft maps will continue through November, with the final product coming out the next month.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 31 more COVID-19 deaths and 646 new cases Monday. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the coronavirus since the pandemic began rose to 7,298. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 12 of the newly reported deaths Monday were delayed reports from before the previous 24 hours. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dipped slightly, by five, to 1,113. Arkansas ranks 15th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. There are 443 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state and 246 on ventilators. The department said 40 ICU beds are available in the state, though it’s unclear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLivermore: About 3,100 acres of open space in the San Francisco Bay Area could soon be preserved as a state park under a $31 million deal struck by Bay Area lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deal would keep the area from becoming part of a neighboring off-road vehicle park. The agreement has been cast as a way to safeguard the ecological and cultural significance of the land east of Livermore, Democratic Sen. Steve Glazer of Orinda, who has advocated for the land’s preservation since 2018, said in a statement. The land known as the Tesla parcel borders the Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area, which had planned to expand into the land, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Scientists say the land is a “biologically unique habitat,” and Native Americans consider it a “sensitive historical site,” Glazer’s office said in a statement. Under the agreement, the state would reimburse the Off-Highway Vehicle Trust Fund for the land and other costs and pay for development of a new off-roading park elsewhere. The land, home to several threatened and endangered wildlife species, is designated a California Native Plant Society Botanical Priority Protection Area and has been deemed an Audubon Important Bird Area. It is named after the historic town and Tesla coal mine established on the site in the 19th century.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers violated a man’s constitutional rights when they installed a video camera on a utility pole near his home and spied on him for months without getting a search warrant. The justices said the 24-hour-a-day, 3-month-long surveillance of the Colorado Springs man’s front yard, house, driveway and part of his backyard violated his Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, The Denver Post reports. His conviction and 15-year-prison sentence for drug trafficking were overturned. The unanimous decision differentiates between police officers personally watching suspects and officers using technology to record a person’s every move for extended periods of time. The man had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his yard, even though parts of the area were visible to the public, the court found. And the Colorado Springs Police Department should have received a search warrant before setting up the camera, which could pan and zoom to see over the man’s 6-foot-tall fence. The justices also rejected the state’s argument that the surveillance wasn’t as intrusive as GPS tracking or the use of cellphone data, noting that constant surveillance “shares many of the troubling attributes of GPS tracking.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: For years, many Native American tribes have felt their history has not been given its due by schools in Connecticut, a state that takes its name from an Algonquian word meaning “land on the long tidal river.” Soon, however, schools will be required to teach Native American studies, with an emphasis on local tribes, under a law passed this year at the urging of tribes including the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, best known today for its Foxwoods Resort Casino. “When you’re in Connecticut, to not learn about the Eastern woodland tribes, the tribes that Connecticut was founded on, (that) was the issue that we were pressing,” said Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots. The legislation makes it mandatory for schools to teach Native American studies starting with the 2023-2024 school year. It passed despite concerns raised by teachers unions and state Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona. Now the U.S. education secretary, Cardona had said it is important to teach about Native Americans, but he was wary of unfunded mandates for school districts that are still working to implement other courses that lawmakers and the governor have required them to teach.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Beebe Healthcare and Tidal Health will temporarily pause elective surgeries due to spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations, officials said Monday. Beebe’s announcement, which went into effect Tuesday, is “out of an abundance of caution,” officials said. In the early weeks of the pandemic, nearly all Delaware hospitals paused elective procedures, but they resumed them months later. TidalHealth also announced Monday that its hospitals would temporarily stop “elective, non-emergency surgeries that require an overnight stay for at least a two-week period,” according to a news release. “Several factors have combined recently to put stress on hospital staffing levels and hospital bed capacity at both TidalHealth hospitals,” officials said. Since August, Delaware has seen an explosion of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. As of Monday, 266 people were hospitalized in the state – heights Delaware has not seen since the winter. Nearly all of the people being hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, health officials say.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police have taken several steps to prepare their departments and the city as a whole in advance of a rally planned at the Capitol on Saturday in support of Jan. 6 defendants, WUSA-TV reports. USCP officers were seen installing surveillance cameras around the area of the U.S. Capitol on Monday morning. Some areas near the home of the legislative branch have already been boarded up, and several robotic cameras were placed at different locations. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. “We are here to protect everyone’s First Amendment right to peacefully protest,” USCP Chief Tom Manger said in a statement. “I urge anyone who is thinking about causing trouble to stay home. We will enforce the law and not tolerate violence.” Manger said a fence will go up around the Capitol again a few days before the rally and come down soon after if everything is peaceful. The Metropolitan Police Department has also activated its entire force and postponed vacation days for its officers. The full activation alert assigned specific notice to MPD civil disturbance units trained for First Amendment demonstrations.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: Attorney Mike Freed has left his mark locally cultivating an annual series of marathons raising money for Jacksonville Area Legal Aid. Now he’s asking lawyers around the country to donate their time to help to prevent a deluge of evictions rooted in the pandemic’s effect on jobs and incomes. “Sometimes you have to give up your time without compensation for the greater good,” said Freed, who is president of the National Conference of Bar Presidents, an organization involving Bar associations in 53 states and U.S. territories. Freed, an attorney at the Gunster law firm who organizes a yearly six-day series of six marathons called Freed to Run, used online messages to highlight a letter signed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking lawyers to prevent an eviction tsunami, writing that “no matter where you live, lawyers and law students like you can apply your legal training and skills to help your community.” Coming days after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a federal moratorium on evictions during the pandemic, the pleas reacted to a situation that is growing more dire for many tenants. In Duval County, judges hearing eviction lawsuits last month issued 530 orders for police to serve writs of possession and take homes back from renters. Landlords filed another 737 eviction lawsuits last month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCalhoun: A northwest Georgia county is negotiating an agreement for its employees to work extra at the local hospital, which is over capacity due to COVID-19 patients. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports Gordon County commissioners are near a deal to let county employees assist at AdventHealth Gordon when not working for the county. The hospital would pay the employees. County Administrator Jim Ledbetter said a number of firefighters and law enforcement personnel are interested. People who volunteer to work extra hours must be vaccinated against COVID-19 before their first shifts. “With the hospital being licensed for 69 patients and having more than 100, the labor force is stretched pretty thin, and staff are pretty tired,” Ledbetter said. “The hospital came to us for help, and we decided to do what we can.” Ledbetter said the county will require employees have at least 12 hours’ rest between their county shifts and hospital work. He said hospital doctors and nurses will supervise county employees. He said duties might include stocking supplies and making sure people are wearing masks before coming in. “They would help with security. People’s nerves have been frayed with the pandemic, and they don’t always want to mask. Some people have been getting testy about that,” Ledbetter said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The median sale price for a single-family home on the island of Oahu has surpassed $1 million. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the median price in August reached $1,050,000, according to Honolulu Board of Realtors data. “Market conditions have been pointing to a $1M median single-family home price this year for some time,” Jason Lazzerini, president and CEO of the brokerage firm Locations, wrote in a report last month. The Honolulu Board of Realtors said the record was up 25% from $839,000 in the same month last year. The August peak for single-family homes was the seventh monthly record set this year. The islands of Kauai and Maui hit the million-dollar mark in January and May, respectively. Hawaii economist Paul Brewbaker said that “this is not a bubble” and that he expects the demand will eventually ease. “This is transitory,” Brewbaker said. “We need to put that in perspective.” He said demand has been driven in part by stay-at-home workers during the pandemic. Honolulu Board of Realtors President Shannon Heaven said the August spike was driven by a tripling of homes sold for more than $2 million. “Those really begin to push that median price up,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An arrest warrant has been issued for a former state lawmaker who resigned in disgrace after a 19-year-old intern reported that he brought her to his apartment on false pretenses and raped her. The Ada County arrest warrant on charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object came nearly five months after Aaron von Ehlinger, R-Lewiston, resigned from the Idaho House of Representatives after an ethics committee found he should be formally censured for his behavior. The investigation into von Ehlinger began in March after the young staffer reported he raped her after the two had dinner at a Boise restaurant. Von Ehlinger has denied all wrongdoing and maintains he had consensual sexual contact with the young woman. A legislative ethics committee unanimously found that he engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and said it would support a vote to remove him from the Statehouse. The woman informed legislative leadership and the police about the rape allegations on her first day at work after the incident. She also testified before the legislative ethics committee, despite facing harassment from von Ehlinger’s supporters and some fellow lawmakers. Earlier this month attorney Erika Birch reportedly filed a tort claim with the state on the woman’s behalf, which is the first step in filing a lawsuit.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two nuclear plants would be saved from closure and carbon-emitting coal plants closed during the next quarter-century as part of a clean-energy package the state Senate approved Monday, sending it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has pushed for a carbon-free Illinois by 2045. With just one vote over the minimum necessary, the 37-17 tally in the chamber controlled by Democrats came on the same day energy company Exelon had threatened to begin shutting down its nuclear-power generating station in Byron as unprofitable, with the Dresden generating site in Morris to follow this fall. But the Clean Energy Jobs Act provides a $700 million subsidy to Exelon with the idea of saving jobs and the large amount of carbon-free energy the plants already produce. “The state of Illinois is making history by setting aggressive standards for a 100% clean energy future,” Pritzker said in a post-vote statement. In addition to the nuclear-power subsidy, the legislation includes provisions for closing coal-burning plants in central and southwest Illinois, investing in renewable energy such as wind and solar, and offering $4,000 rebates on electric-vehicle purchases. Pritzker wants 1 million electric cars on Illinois roads by 2030. Plants producing greenhouse gases by burning coal must cut those emissions by 45% by 2035 and close permanently by 2045.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Republican redistricting plan shores up a suburban Indianapolis district for the GOP while leaving a potentially targeted Democratic district in northwestern Indiana intact. The proposal for new congressional districts released Tuesday shifts the northern tier of Democratic-leaning Marion County from the district now held by Republican Rep. Victora Spartz to that of Indianapolis Democratic Rep. Andre Carson. That move will boost Spartz, who lost badly in Marion County in last year’s election even as she won by an overall 50%-46% margin over Democratic candidate Christina Hale. Other changes among Indiana’s nine congressional districts to account for population shifts don’t appear likely to shift the 7-2 control that Republicans now hold on those seats. The Republican plan leaves intact the northwestern Indiana district that includes industry-heavy Lake County and has long been a Democratic stronghold. The proposed district along Lake Michigan wouldn’t change much from the one Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan won last year. Republicans have full control Indiana’s redistricting process through their dominance of the state Legislature.\n\nIowa\n\nMount Ayr: A woman whose husband died from a breakthrough COVID-19 infection is blaming Americans who refuse to wear masks or get vaccinated. “It’s that kind of attitude that killed my husband,” said Ardith Keplinger, whose husband, Gary Keplinger, of Mount Ayr, was buried this month. In his obituary, the family wrote that his life was “unnecessarily cut short.” They described the retired school superintendent as “one of several victims recently infected from an unmasked, unvaccinated person.” His widow said he had a chronic autoimmune, neuromuscular condition called myasthenia gravis, which may have made him particularly susceptible when he attended a gathering of 50 to 75 extended family members in a rented hall in July. The couple had been avoiding crowds, but they mingled unmasked at the event, along with relatives, several of whom were unvaccinated, Ardith Keplinger said. “Within a week, 11 members of our family had COVID,” she said, adding that she was among them but recovered. But her husband and a cousin who also attended the party both died of the disease Aug. 11. The Iowa Department of Public Health reports vaccinated people make up just 10% of those being treated for the disease in the state’s intensive care units, even though 64% of Iowa adults have received the shots.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Hundreds of people chanted and held signs outside a University of Kansas fraternity house where a member is accused of sexually assaulting another student. The Kansas City Star reports the Monday night protest outside the Phi Kappa Psi house came after the fraternity officials reported the allegations over the weekend. “The university takes seriously all allegations of sexual violence and has robust processes to investigate such allegations,” university spokeswoman Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said in an email Tuesday. “We encourage anyone who has experienced sexual violence to contact law enforcement or the university’s Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to initiate an investigation.” The university has multiple resources to assist individuals who have experienced sexual violence, she said. A spokesman for the fraternity said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. “Phi Kappa Psi takes these allegations very seriously and will fully cooperate with law enforcement,” the statement said. “Due to the recent nature of these allegations and the need for a full and complete investigation, Phi Kappa Psi cannot provide further comments at this time.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Union workers, upset over the prospect of expanded weekend shifts, have manned picket lines at bottling and warehouse operations of Heaven Hill Distillery, one of the world’s largest bourbon producers. The walkout involves about 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D. They voted overwhelmingly last week to reject a new five-year contract offer and formed picket lines Saturday at Heaven Hill’s operations in Bardstown. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons, and others including Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection. As the bourbon industry tries to keep up with increasing global demand, Heaven Hill signaled it wanted to assign new hires to nontraditional schedules that would include weekend work, Local 23D President Matt Aubrey said. The company was vague about how widespread weekend shifts would be and how it would affect existing workers, he said, raising a “red flag” with union workers. “They tell these workers, ‘You’re family, just like us. You’re our family,’ ” Aubrey said, adding that most workers have their own families. “If they get pushed on this nontraditional schedule, then that’s going to take them away from their loved ones.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSlidell: A 12-foot-long alligator believed to have attacked a man in Hurricane Ida floodwaters two weeks ago was captured and killed Monday, and authorities found human remains in its stomach. The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office said the parish coroner’s office was working with investigators to determine if the remains were those of Timothy Satterlee, 71, who has been missing since the Aug. 30 attack. Ida had caused widespread flooding and knocked out electricity and phone service in parts of south Louisiana when it came ashore Aug. 29. Satterlee was attacked outside his home, which was surrounded by floodwaters, in the New Orleans suburb of Slidell on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Authorities said Satterlee’s wife heard a splash and walked outside their home to see the alligator attacking her husband. She managed to pull him, severely injured in the attack, to the steps of their home and used a small boat to reach higher ground to get help. But when she and deputies returned to the house, Satterlee was gone. Sheriff’s deputies were joined by federal and state wildlife agents in the search for the alligator. A trap set by alligator hunters captured the 500-pound animal Monday morning.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: Potato growers anticipate a solid crop and stronger demand thanks to reopening restaurants, providing a sense of optimism heading into the harvest in northern Maine. Another positive indicator: A decline in acreage was reversed with an extra 8,000 acres planted this summer. “Growing conditions have been really good. We have a quality crop, and we expect good yields. Market demand is good,” said Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board. Growers are looking for something to cheer after a dismal 2020 in which some farmers gave away potatoes to avoid having them go to waste, and crops withered from heat and drought in northern Maine. This summer, rainfall was nearly 3 inches below average, but that’s better than last summer, which ranked as the warmest and second-driest since records were kept in Caribou, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures hitting 90 and above can stunt the growth of potatoes, but the highest temperature this summer was 84 degrees, Flannery said. Potatoes are big business in Maine, with direct sales in the neighborhood of $300 million supporting about 2,400 jobs. About 65% of Maine’s potatoes are processed into french fries, chips or some other product, and demand for processed potatoes is rebounding.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A panel of state lawmakers approved an emergency measure Tuesday to require masks in K-12 schools to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The 10-7 vote by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review puts the emergency regulation into effect for up to 180 days. The Maryland State Board of Education approved the regulation last month on an 11-1 vote. Only two of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions, Carroll and Somerset counties, had not already required students to wear masks while attending school. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended universal mask-wearing for teachers and students inside school buildings this fall, citing the rapid spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. Maryland State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said the mask requirement will increase safety and help reduce the need for quarantining sick students. “Seventeen other states, including most of Maryland’s neighbors, have required that all individuals wear masks in school buildings,” Choudhury said. He said data will be reviewed each month, and the board of education will consider whether the requirement could be lifted, if conditions improve enough, in consultation with the state health department.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Harvard University will divest itself from holdings in fossil fuels, President Lawrence Bacow said Thursday. Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s nearly $42 billion endowment, has already been reducing its exposure to fossil fuels and has no direct investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels, Bacow said in a message posted on the university’s website. The university has legacy investments in a number of private equity funds with holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Those indirect investments constitute less than 2% of the endowment, according to Bacow. The school has not made any new commitments to these limited partnerships since 2019 and has no intention to do so going forward, he said. Bacow said the legacy investments are in “runoff mode” and will end as these partnerships are liquidated. Harvard has already committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire investment portfolio by 2050, he said. The decision follows years of protests from students who have pressed Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies. Harvard is building a portfolio of investments in funds that support the transition to a green economy, Bacow wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig formally announced his campaign for governor Tuesday – but not before protesters derailed his kickoff event on Belle Isle and forced him to move. Craig effectively has been running for months. He is among 10 Republicans, all of them political newcomers, looking to unseat Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022. Craig was to speak to the media at the state park in the middle of the Detroit River in his hometown, but he abandoned that plan when he was shouted down by a couple dozen people critical of his role as chief. He turned around and walked back toward a waiting vehicle, which took him to a nearby office complex, where he made the announcement a short time later. “My name is James Craig. And I’m running to be your governor,” he said, flashing a thumbs-up. “The governor for the state of Michigan.” He nodded as supporters chanted: “Chief Craig.” As for the disruption on Belle Isle, Craig said a “small group of paid protesters did nothing. What they did is reinforce why we need change.” Asked about his statement that the protesters were paid, Craig said he did not have evidence of that but believed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Four former police officers charged with violating George Floyd’s civil rights pleaded not guilty Tuesday in a federal hearing that included arguments on several pretrial motions, including requests to hold separate trials. A federal grand jury indicted Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao in May for allegedly depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority May 25, 2020, as Floyd, 46, was held face-down, handcuffed and not resisting in a restraint that was captured on bystander video. His death led to worldwide protests and calls for change in policing. All four of the men appeared at the hearing remotely via videoconference. Chauvin, wearing a plain T-shirt, appeared from a small room in the state’s maximum-security prison, where he is serving a 22 1/ 2 -year sentence for murder in Floyd’s death. The other three men appeared remotely alongside their attorneys. U.S. Magistrate Judge Tony Leung asked each man separately how he would plea, and each clearly responded: “Not guilty.” The hearing also addressed roughly 40 pretrial motions. Most of the motions were routine, such as agreeing when names of witnesses would be disclosed. But Leung heard oral arguments on two issues and ordered attorneys to file additional written arguments on those motions.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: A third person has died as a result of a highway collapse two weeks ago. Amanda Williams of Wiggins died Saturday after being hospitalized since the Aug. 30 collapse, WLOX-TV reports. The collapse on Highway 26 outside Lucedale in George County, which occurred during torrential rain brought by Hurricane Ida, caused seven vehicles to crash into the washed-out roadway. Two people died at the time of the crash, and 10 others were injured, including 39-year-old Wiggins and her 16-year-old daughter, Emily. Emily Williams is currently recovering from a torn colon, a broken leg and other injuries. Amanda Williams was being treated for her injuries at Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg when she died, according to WLOX. During a Sept. 5 video interview with WLOX-TV, Emily Williams said she could hear the terrifying sounds of other vehicles crashing around – and on top of – the pickup truck where she and her mother were trapped after the truck plunged into a dark, muddy pit when the highway collapsed. “I saw a black hole, then I blacked out, and I woke up, and my mom was leaned over toward me. She was choking on her blood, and she couldn’t breathe or anything,” she told the television station.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A cave containing Native American artwork from more than 1,000 years ago was sold at auction Tuesday, disappointing leaders of the Osage Nation who hoped to buy the land to “protect and preserve our most sacred site.” A bidder agreed to pay $2.2 million to private owners for what’s known as “Picture Cave,” along with the 43 hilly acres that surround it near the town of Warrenton, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Bryan Laughlin, director of Selkirk Auctioneers & Appraisers, the St. Louis-based firm handling the auction, said the winning bidder declined to be named. A St. Louis family that’s owned the land since 1953 has mainly used it for hunting. The cave was the site of sacred rituals and burying of the dead. It also has more than 290 prehistoric glyphs, “making it the largest collection of indigenous people’s polychrome paintings in Missouri,” according to the auction website. The Osage Nation, in a statement, called the sale “truly heartbreaking.” “Our ancestors lived in this area for 1300 years,” the statement said. “This was our land. We have hundreds of thousands of our ancestors buried throughout Missouri and Illinois, including Picture Cave.” The cave features drawings of people, animals, birds and mythical creatures.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: The U.S. Forest Service has given preliminary approval to a plan for road building, logging and other forest management measures in the Swan Valley with the goal of reducing fire danger and enhancing habitat for several federally protected species, the agency said. The project area is located on U.S. Forest Service lands on both sides of Montana Highway 83 between the communities of Condon and Swan Lake. “Species such as Canada lynx, bull trout and whitebark pine face unprecedented risk from climate change, exotic pathogens and all the associated ecological impacts, and failure to act will most likely result in their continued decline,” Flathead National Forest Supervisor Kurt Steele wrote in a draft record of a decision published Friday. “A warming and drier climate, combined with the legacy effects of fire suppression, requires active vegetation management, and the scientific knowledge applied to this decision has been shown to be an effective prescription to mitigate these risks.” The agency plans to approve about half of its initially proposed 15-year project. Doing so will reduce plans for logging, road building and improvement, and the number of acres where trees are to be thinned or burned with fires called prescribed burns set in certain areas to reduce wildfire risks, the Daily Inter Lake reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers launched a special session Monday to redraw the state’s political boundaries, with one proposal that would add a 50th state senator to the Legislature to try to keep rural Nebraska from losing a seat. Sen. Mark Kolterman, of Seward, proposed the measure along with two other rural senators. The bill would expand the Legislature from its current 49 members to 50, as allowed under the Nebraska Constitution. Adding a senator would reduce the ideal number of residents per legislative district, making it easier for lawmakers to preserve rural districts that lost population over the past decade while still adding a district to fast-growing suburban Omaha. The bill’s prospects are unclear, and some lawmakers questioned whether they could legally consider it in a special session that’s strictly limited to redistricting issues. Lawmakers have asked the state’s attorney general to offer a legal opinion. Even so, rural senators said they planned to press the issue as a way to ease pressure on senators by reducing the average number of residents per district. The measure was co-sponsored by Sens. Matt Williams, of Gothenburg, and John Stinner, of Gering. “I want to help protect the rural senators of the state,” said Kolterman, whose district could be merged with another rural area under one of the proposed plans.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A national advocacy group has filed a sweeping federal lawsuit aimed at convincing a judge the nation’s only legal brothels are dens of illegal sex trafficking and unconstitutional slavery. The case filed Friday in Las Vegas by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation names the governor, state attorney general, and city and county officials as defendants, along with a brothel in Nye County and hip-hop music figure Jamal “Mally Mall” Rashid. Rashid, 46, is serving a 33-month federal prison term after pleading guilty to operating a prostitution business disguised as a Las Vegas escort enterprise. Attorneys who represented him in that case did not immediately respond to a message about the lawsuit. Representatives of Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, state Attorney General Aaron Ford, Las Vegas and Clark County declined to comment. Officials in Nye County and the Chicken Ranch brothel in Pahrump did not immediately respond to messages. The lawsuit seeks to abolish Nevada’s legal prostitution statutes as unconstitutional and a violation of federal anti-trafficking laws. It asks the court to order reimbursement to victims of “all profits and unjust enrichment obtained as a result.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A man has been accused of putting his baby daughter into a clothes dryer and turning on the machine before the mother quickly stopped it, police said. Police arrested the man in Manchester on Sunday on charges of reckless conduct, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal threatening. The child did not appear to be injured. The man waived arraignment Monday, and a judge ordered him held without bail. His case has been assigned to a public defender’s office, but no attorney was listed for him in court documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The Sea Hear Now music festival returns to town this upcoming weekend after the 2020 event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. And this year’s fest will have some musicians showing off their other artistic talents, too. Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and other members of Pearl Jam, Scott Avett of the Avett Brothers, and more will show their artwork inside the Transparent Gallery pop-up Saturday and Sunday in Bradley Park. In past festivals, musicians have popped into the gallery for an impromptu performance. Musically, the fest – held on the beach and in Bradley Park – will also feature acts including Billy Idol, Lord Huron, Dr. Dog, Grouplove, Orville Peck, Ani DiFranco, and Tank and the Bangas. More than 35,000 people attended the second Sea Hear Now in 2019 to see groups such as the Dave Matthews Band and the Lumineers. Organizers expect about 35,000 this year, but there will be more room on the beach, as the two stages will be farther apart by about a city block. Construction on the festival grounds started over the weekend. Attendees will need to require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election officials are deploying ballot drop boxes across the state for people who choose to cast absentee ballots without walking indoors during the upcoming Nov. 2 local elections for public offices including the mayors of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told a legislative panel Monday that county clerks are required to provide one drop box for every 25,000 voters and at least two per county. Exceptions can be made at the request of local county officials. The quick-drop boxes for voting are among a long list measures backed by Toulouse Oliver, a second-term Democrat, that are aimed at making voting more accessible. Lawmakers appropriated funding for the initiative amid concerns about COVID-19 and indoor crowding at polling places. Ballots must be collected at least once a day from the boxes, video surveillance of drop boxes is required, and recordings must be retained by county clerks. It remains illegal for any person to deliver a ballot for another person with the exception of immediate family, and signs at each drop box are required to explain that prohibition against so-called ballot harvesting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Parents of adults with severe autism and other disabilities say state officials are threatening to revoke funding for their children’s long-term care at out-of-state care centers unless they agree to send their children to a secure, in-state facility. Some parents believe they have no alternative but to send their adult children to the Sunmount Developmental Center in Franklin County in the Adirondacks, the Times Union of Albany reports. They describe the facility as remote and prison-like. A group of state lawmakers recently asked Gov. Kathy Hochul to end the policy, which they say was put in place by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in an apparent cost-saving move. The lawmakers, including Democratic Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi of New York City, say the policy may violate disabled people’s right to receive care in the least restrictive setting, which was guaranteed under a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A 2014 state law also guaranteed due-process rights for disabled children and their families in long-term care decisions, when the child turns 21 or graduates from school. In a response Friday, the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities said a legal process prevents the agency from providing funding for out-of-state care at a certain point.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: A fund set up to honor George Floyd and raise awareness about racial injustice said Monday that it has awarded more than $50,000 in scholarships since it was created. The Fayetteville-based George Floyd Memorial Foundation said it has recently given scholarships valued at $1,000 to 15 law school students, scholarships valued at $10,000 to interns, and $2,500 scholarships to undergraduate students. The foundation said it has also awarded $25,000 to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college. Foundation executive director Jacari Harris said the scholarships keep Floyd’s memory alive and support students. “Our hope at the George Floyd Memorial Foundation is that these high-achieving students will become attorneys, activists and scholars who will work to ensure people are treated fairly around the world,” Harris said in a statement. Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd’s sister and the foundation’s founder, said that “as the days, months and years go by, one thing is true: My brother George’s death truly changed the world, and by offering support to these students, it will allow us to continue to bring hope to those in need.” The foundation, created in August 2020, focuses on raising awareness of racial injustices, police brutality and ensuring everyone’s civil rights are protected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A three-day symposium to discuss the history and revitalization of the American bison has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, event organizers said Monday. The Dakota Bison Symposium had been scheduled for Thursday through Saturday. Many of the national speakers have recently decided against traveling to North Dakota, where 1 in every 253 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. It is also one of the worst states in the country for rate of COVID-19 vaccinations. Bismarck State College and its partners decided against a virtual format and rescheduled the event for next spring, BSC President Doug Jensen told The Bismarck Tribune. “One of the exciting things about symposia is getting to rub elbows with these national speakers,” Jensen said. “Within the last few weeks, we’ve lost that aspect of the conference.” The symposium also was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The North Dakota Department of Health on Monday confirmed 180 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,815 active cases throughout the state. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by nearly 48%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republicans and Democrats appeared closer to agreement Monday on a map of state legislative districts that could stand for the next 10 years, as a powerful new redistricting panel faced a looming Wednesday deadline. But a group that monitors redistricting and works to reduce the drawing of political district lines that maximize partisan advantage, a process called gerrymandering, flunked the Ohio GOP’s proposed state House map in an analysis released earlier Monday. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, working with the anti-corruption group RepresentUS, said its boundaries fell short of being fair when compared to a million simulated alternatives, delivering it a score of “F.” The analysis gave a better score of “B” to the Ohio Senate map that Republicans have proposed, which Democratic consultant Chris Glassburn also reworked and presented Monday. Analysts said the second map fared better because each Senate district contains three House districts, diluting the partisan advantage. During a regional hearing in suburban Cleveland, members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission’s GOP majority – including state Auditor Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Senate President Matt Huffman praised Glassburn, for his work on a revised map aimed at garnering the support of both parties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials said Tuesday that coronavirus hospitalizations appear to be leveling off, but hospital stays are longer due to the delta variant of the virus. The three-day average of new COVID-19 hospitalizations fell from 1,518 a week ago to 1,352 on Tuesday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which reported a seven-day average of 2,114 new cases daily, down from 2,709 one week ago. However, the average hospitalization increased from five to six days in January to 10-11 days currently, and intensive acre unit stays rose from 10-11 days to 15-20, said Dr. David Kendrick, chair of Medical Informatics at the University of Oklahoma School of Community Medicine. Patti Davis, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said it is too soon to call the decline a trend. “Given … Labor Day activities, all health care providers probably have their fingers crossed and are hoping for the best, but not assuming (the decline) will hold once we get at the requisite date past Labor Day,” which could result in another surge in cases, Davis said. Kendrick said most new virus cases are among younger patients; 21.6% are 36-49 years old, and those ages 18-35 account for about 18% of new cases.\n\nOregon\n\nTroutdale: An explosion in a pickup truck killed a man early Monday, authorities said. Police and firefighters responded to calls at 2:19 a.m. reporting a loud explosion and vehicle fire at a home , the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said. The Gresham Fire Department extinguished the fire, and the sheriff’s office said a person was located inside the burned vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The body was taken to the county Medical Examiner’s Office. The case and manner of death are yet to be determined. Investigators are not yet releasing the identity of the man, the sheriff’s office said. Special agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Seattle branch are assisting the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office and other agencies in the investigation. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the explosion, which is believed to have originated inside the vehicle, according to the sheriff’s office. No other injuries were reported, and the sheriff’s office said there was no threat of additional explosions. “We woke up with a big explosion, and things were falling in the house, so I thought the house was falling down,” neighbor JoAnn Robinson told KGW-TV. The siding on Robinson’s home is covered in holes from debris.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: More than $104 million in Pennsylvania Turnpike tolls went uncollected last year as the agency fully converted to all-electronic tolling, with the millions of motorists who don’t use E-ZPass having a nearly 1 in 2 chance of riding without paying under the “toll-by-plate” license plate camera system. An internal turnpike report issued in July and obtained by the Associated Press through a Right-to-Know Law request showed nearly 11 million out of the total of about 170 million turnpike rides generated no revenue for the agency in the year that ended May 31. “We take this issue very seriously. It is a big number, there’s no question,” turnpike Chief Executive Mark Compton said. “But we, as an organization, are leaving no stone unturned in the way in which we’re going after that leakage.” Toll revenue “leakage” – an industry euphemism for uncollected tolls – has become the focus of turnpike agencies across the country as the use of E-ZPass transponders and license plate cameras continues to spread. It is a particular problem for the debt-strapped Pennsylvania Turnpike, more than half of whose total revenue goes to pay borrowing costs and tolls have more than quadrupled in 12 years for the minority of motorists who don’t have E-Z Pass to pay for rides.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has paused in-person dining and instituted a limit of five people for undergraduate social gatherings in response to a recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. The Ivy League school had 82 confirmed coronavirus cases, primarily among undergraduate students, in the prior seven days, according to a statement Monday. “The increase in positive asymptomatic test results is a reflection of the transmissibility of the delta variant, our significant increase in the number of tests conducted at Brown, and an increase in our student population, some of whom have been engaging with other students in multiple smaller groups outside the classroom, especially indoors without masks,” the school’s statement said. Those testing positive generally remain asymptomatic, and there are no indications of serious illness and no hospitalizations, the school said. There is no evidence of spread in classrooms, and classes will continue, the school said. The “short-term” restrictions also include increased undergraduate student testing from once to twice per week and an indoor mask requirement. Brown requires vaccinations for students and employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: Residents of an Upstate neighborhood say they were ducking for cover after pellets from a nearby dove hunt started striking them. Children playing outside were also struck by the pellets, one of them as he played on a trampoline, WYFF-TV reports. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources responded to calls Saturday afternoon about the stray pellets coming from a field in Greenwood County. Neighbors said they saw 10 to 20 people in the field hunting doves. Department of Natural resources officials said they talked to several people who say they were hit, including a 6-year-old boy who had two marks on his cheek. The land is private property, and the landowner wasn’t doing anything illegal, authorities said. There is no state law or regulation mandating the minimum distance from other homes or properties from a dove hunt on private land. Officials said they talked to the landowner, who voluntarily stopped the hunt due to safety and noise concerns. Neighbors said the children struck by pellets were OK.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Monday rejected a handful of proposals for rules governing medical marijuana from Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration but approved the bulk of the program. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee, which is responsible for approving administration rules, effectively told the Department of Health to try again on a number of controversial rule proposals. Most of the Department of Health’s 124-page proposal got the sign-off from the Legislature, spelling out rules ranging from fees for cardholders to the heights of fences around cannabis growing facilities. The rules they rejected included proposals that would have limited the amount of high-potency marijuana that patients could possess, required medical practitioners to write a recommendation for patients who wanted to grow more than three cannabis plants, and defined a list of conditions that would qualify for a medical marijuana recommendation. The law allowing medical marijuana, passed by 70% of voters last year, has seen a halting acceptance from officials trying to balance a clear mandate from voters while placing restrictions on medical marijuana. The rules set a $75 application fee for medical marijuana cards and discount the fee to $20 for low-income applicants.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Rhodes College is investigating after students reported racist and anti-Semitic incidents on campus a few weeks into the fall semester. In one instance, a banana was taped to the door of a dorm room of two Black students, student organization Men of Distinction has said. The group called for more swift and public response by the college. Interim President Carroll D. Stevens wrote to campus last Friday: “Whatever the intentions when actions or words make members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, they do not align with our values as a college community.” The president’s letter did not specify particular incidents on campus but said the incidents made Black and Jewish students in particular feel unsafe. Kofi Whitehead, student president of Men of Distinction, immediately called leaders of the organization together. He knew the students targeted by the Labor Day incident, he said, but it could have been “any of us.” In a post days after it happened, Men of Distinction decried the lack of response from the Rhodes administration. In an interview Monday, Whitehead said he acknowledged that internally, campus leadership was likely working to address the issue. But when a racist incident occurs in a public place, and students see it across social media, he expects the college to be more upfront.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Travis County commissioners voted unanimously Tuesday to allocate $110million in federal funds to build housing units for people experiencing homelessness in the area. The vote was met by applause from the group of homelessness service providers and community leaders gathered in the commissioners’ court chambers. The vote marks a significant investment in housing projects from the county – a change from the commissioners’ initial reluctance to spend money directly on housing units. Commissioner Margaret Gomez, who developed and sponsored the plan with Commissioner Ann Howard and a diverse coalition of local community leaders and organizations, said after years of discussion on the need to address affordable housing issues and homelessness in the Austin area, it was time for something different. “I think it’s time we take some action here,” Gomez said. The $110 million comes from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, which was the second of two federal stimulus programs created during the coronavirus pandemic. Travis County received $247 million from the program and had wide discretion on how to spend it. The funding will go toward the construction of 10 or so projects that would total more than 2,000 new housing units.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man who displayed a rifle at a youth soccer tournament, spreading panic through the crowd, wasn’t prompted by anything related to the game, police said Monday. People screamed “active shooter” as parents and players ran to take cover behind cars in the parking lot after the man retrieved the gun from his car Saturday afternoon, the Deseret News reports. Ultimately no shots were fired, but it was terrifying for many who were there. “It was pretty traumatizing,” said parent Megan Perkins. “My kid is pretty shaken.” The man had been involved in an argument at the game when he went back to his car and retrieved the weapon, Salt Lake City Police said. No one has been arrested, but those involved have been identified by investigators. Police did not release their names or say what the argument was about but said it did not appear to be related to the game or the tournament, according to a statement Monday. U.S. Youth Soccer officials said they were saddened by the traumatic experience but proud of staff and volunteers who helped defuse the situation. The team associated with the people involved was expelled from the tournament, the organization said. Additional sanctions are possible.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state on Tuesday became the latest to sue some of the country’s top fossil fuel companies by alleging they misled the public about the impact their products have on climate change. The state wants the companies to tell consumers that the use of fossil fuel products harms the environment, Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan said after the lawsuit was filed in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington. The warnings could be similar to those noting the danger of tobacco products or food products that include nutritional and calorie information, he said. Donovan, speaking outside the Chittenden County courthouse in downtown Burlington where the lawsuit was filed, said officials are not trying to prevent the companies from selling their products in the state, and residents will continue to be able to use fossil fuels. “What we are saying is that Vermonters have the right to know,” Donovan said. “Give Vermonters accurate information. Put a label on the product, and let Vermonters decide.” The suit names ExxonMobil Corp., Shell Oil Co., Sunoco LP, CITGO Petroleum Corp. and other corporations. In a Tuesday email, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the suit was baseless and without merit. Citgo declined to comment on pending litigation. The other two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Five people who recently traveled to the state from Afghanistan have been diagnosed with measles, health officials said Tuesday. The cases are being reported four days after the U.S. halted inbound flights of Afghan evacuees following the discovery of a few cases of measles among new arrivals. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release that the people were part of the U.S. government’s emergency evacuation efforts from Afghanistan, which recently came under Taliban rule. State health officials did not offer specifics Tuesday regarding where the people who are infected are located. But they said they’re working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed in three parts of the state. Those places include Dulles International Airport, where some refugees flew into the U.S., and other parts of northern Virginia. Health officials are also working to notify people potentially exposed at an unidentified Richmond hospital and at Fort Pickett, an Army National Guard base southwest of Richmond that is providing temporary housing to recently arrived evacuees. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat. Most Americans are vaccinated against it as children.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted to move some of the $15 million in savings related to police officer departures to community-based programs. The police department will keep about $10 illion for technology projects and other expenses, while about $5 million will be invested elsewhere in what Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda described as a “hybrid approach.” The plan will partially address commitments the council made in 2020 to decrease the police department’s budget during 2021, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-1, with Councilmember Kshama Sawant calling for the department to keep less money. The council’s midyear budget legislation somewhat jibes with a plan proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan over the summer, though a Durkan-backed request that some money be allocated for officer hiring and retention incentives was rejected. In November, Durkan and the council decreased the police department’s budget by tens of millions of dollars for 2021, reversing a growth trend. But they also cleared the department to hire new officers. The council is also no longer pursuing layoffs of officers with records of misconduct, citing legal barriers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The numbers of new cases and people hospitalized for the coronavirus in the state both smashed records yet again Monday as Gov. Jim Justice scolded residents who continue to balk at receiving COVID-19 vaccines. At least 40% of the state’s population above age 12 has not been fully inoculated, according to health data. Efforts by Justice and others to urge residents to do so have resulted in only minimal improvement in recent weeks. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Justice said at a news conference. The Republican governor has himself balked at issuing either a vaccination mandate or new mask requirements. An earlier indoor masking rule was lifted in June as the number of cases dropped. At the news conference, Justice introduced Linda Lanier, who said her adult son, Joe Goodnite, refused to get vaccinated and contracted COVID-19 on a family vacation. He’s been in a Charleston hospital for more than six weeks and remains on a ventilator. Lanier’s son “listened to all the negative and false accusations about vaccination,” she said. “Being in the medical field myself, I tried to convince him. However, it didn’t work. He listened to his friends. He listened to social media. And he just listened to what I call the garbage that’s out there.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge’s decision to release from a mental health facility a woman who helped stab her sixth grade classmate to please online horror character Slender Man has left the victim’s family nervous and afraid, a spokesman said Tuesday. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren on Friday ordered 19-year-old Anissa Weier released from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh, ruling that she’s no longer a threat and that conditions on her release should protect both her and the community. Weier has spent nearly four years at the facility. Bohren had scheduled her release for Monday. Officials with the state Department of Health Services, which oversees Winnebago, have repeatedly refused to so much as acknowledge Weier was a patient out of privacy concerns. Steve Lyons, a spokesman for victim Payton Leutner’s family, said Tuesday that they’re disappointed with Bohren’s decision and that Weier should have served more time. “We’re just nervous that she’s going to be out,” Lyons said. “We’re nervous about the potential of what could happen.” Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Leutner suffered 19 wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The leader of the state Senate expects Gov. Mark Gordon to call a special legislation session on vaccine mandates, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Senate President Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, said the effort to repel President Joe Biden’s controversial executive order last week – which says large companies must require workers either to get a COVID-19 vaccination or to undergo regular coronavirus testing – seemed likely to result in a special session, though the Republican governor would have to request the move. But it’s unlikely legislators could block a presidential order, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/15"}]}

More than 4,500 adults here identify as transgender, the ninth-highest percentage by population nationwide.\n\nState policy mandates that transgender state employees be called by their preferred names and pronouns and be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. But those protections don't extend to transgender students, a News Journal investigation has found.\n\nThe state Department of Education, whose mission includes promoting \"safe and healthy environments conducive to learning,\" doesn't track how individual districts treat transgender students and gives no specific guidance to schools, according to department spokeswoman Alison May.\n\n\"Districts are separate government entities from the state governed by locally elected school boards,\" May wrote in an email.\n\nAsked if he would encourage local school districts to adopt formal policies to protect transgender students, Gov. John Carney, who admonished President Trump for rolling back transgender student protections earlier this year, responded that it was a local matter.\n\n\"I expect them to work with their communities to ensure every student can use their schools' facilities comfortably and without fear,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nOther states don't cede that control. In New York, the state education department announced last month that it would build or designate single-stall restrooms in all 1,100 school buildings to meet the needs of transgender and gender nonconforming students, and those with medical conditions or disabilities.\n\nSTORY: Transgender teen pushes boundaries to be legal\n\nAbsent state oversight in Delaware, none of the 11 public school districts that responded to questions from The News Journal has enacted a policy to give transgender students equal access to bathrooms, locker rooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. Rather, individual school principals handle requests on a \"case-by-case basis,\" a majority of district spokespeople said, refusing to elaborate.\n\nSpokespeople for the Colonial and Indian River school districts noted that their districts' nondiscrimination policies cover gender identity.\n\n\"We have a committee in place that is addressing the transgender issue,\" Colonial spokeswoman Lauren Wilson said, declining further comment.\n\nIndian River spokesman David Maull said he wasn't aware of any transgender students enrolled in the 10,000-student Sussex County district.\n\nIn 2014, Indian River students flooded a school board meeting to protest comments made by one board member, Shaun Fink, about eliminating homosexuality from the health curriculum and promoting abstinence-only education. Fink later resigned, citing the district's \"acquiescence to the homosexual agenda.\"\n\nThat same year, the state Human Relations Commission began investigating the Cape Henlopen School District in Lewes after reports surfaced about a teacher disparaging gay students in her class, and members of the Gay-Straight Alliance Club complained that they were prevented from wearing rainbow-colored stoles at graduation.\n\nAt the time, high school Principal Brian Donahue explained that graduation stoles were limited to members of academic-oriented and service-oriented clubs. The district later amended its policy to allow stoles for all approved high school clubs and organizations.\n\nEarlier this year, Cape senior Arianna Carpenito, who is a lesbian, said she was so incensed by the school's lack of tolerance that she created T-shirts for her and her friends accusing Cape of supporting homophobia, racism and transphobia.\n\nWhen Carpenito wore the shirt to school in April, administrators ordered her to change, explaining that her political statement violated the school dress code, she said. Carpenito later wore a similar shirt to a school board meeting in protest.\n\n\"Teachers are preaching that homosexuality leads to polygamy and pedophilia,\" she said recently. Four other LGBT Cape students told The News Journal they had heard similar insults from faculty.\n\nDonahue declined a recent request for comment. District Assistant Superintendent Cathy Petitgout wrote in an email that individual schools provide accommodations for LGBT students on a case-by-case basis, but declined to be more specific.\n\nMadison, who socially transitioned from male to female two years ago and is now a freshman at Cape Henlopen High, said she had to circulate a petition and threaten a \"bathroom strike\" before the school would agree to let her use the girl's bathroom.\n\n\"I don't even know how I'm going to do this,\" she said of the next three years.\n\nIn Appoquinimink, spokeswoman Lillian Miles said no transgender student has \"requested the use of a bathroom or locker facility that corresponds to his or her gender identity.\"\n\nAppoquininimk, along with Milford and Polytech, offers transgender students the option of using gender-neutral bathrooms in the nurse's office or elsewhere. That practice, successfully challenged in courts nationwide, has been criticized by national LGBT organizations for further isolating transgender students.\n\nThree districts — Brandywine, Christina and Red Clay in New Castle County — reported that some or all of their schools open up bathrooms and locker rooms to transgender students that match their gender identity.\n\nIn Red Clay, where Madison had to use the nurse's bathroom before she switched to Cape Henlopen, administrators have no record that the transgender girl experienced bullying, spokeswoman Pati Nash said.\n\n\"She had a lot of friends,\" Nash added.\n\nAt Brandywine, Superintendent Mark Holodick said he has personally met with four transgender students this school year. The district is weighing adopting a formal policy to codify transgender student rights, he said.\n\n\"The topic isn't easy or comfortable to navigate,\" Holodick acknowledged. \"At some point, I do think the state should provide guidance.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the remaining eight districts, half of them in Sussex, did not respond to any questions on the issue.\n\nThe News Journal did not survey all private and charter schools statewide. But after hearing reports from students that some Delaware Catholic schools bar same-sex couples from attending school dances, the newspaper asked the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington to provide details on how individual schools treat LGBT students.\n\nDiocese spokesman Robert Krebs declined to answer specific questions, citing student privacy concerns. LGBT policies are developed at \"the school level to address the needs of the particular school community,\" he wrote in an email.\n\n\"The formal, written policy in all of our schools is that all students must at all times be treated with kindness and respect since all are made in the image and likeness of God,\" he added.\n\nIt's not surprising that Delaware schools are tight-lipped on such a politically charged, sensitive issue, said Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights in Washington, D.C., which promotes LGBT-inclusive policies.\n\n\"Treating people the same may make people uncomfortable but we never as a country see that as a good justification for discrimination,\" Minter said. \"It's a shame that this has become something that schools are afraid of even talking about.\"\n\nDoing so can be a Catch-22. Taking a formal stand can expose a district to a flurry of privacy-invasion lawsuits filed by non-transgender students, parents and conservative Christian organizations. By doing nothing, a district can be sued for violating Title IX, a 1972 federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in any educational program or activity that receives federal funding.\n\nTitle IX protections remain in effect even after the Trump administration in February revoked Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. Previously, the Obama administration had urged public schools to give transgender students access to restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities or risk losing federal funding.\n\nEven before the Obama-era guidelines were in place, LGBT rights organizations successfully sued school districts to uphold transgender student protections.\n\nIn turn, the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit, has represented nontransgender students and their parents who feel violated by policies that allow biological males to undress alongside biological females.\n\nHeartened by the Trump administration's recent action, Kerri Kupac, the alliance's legal counsel, said many of her clients have been \"bullied into silence.\"\n\n\"The reality is there's a reason we wear clothing,\" she added. \"People are fundamentally private about their bodies and anatomy.\"\n\nTrump's move kicked the issue back to the states and local districts. Appearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee last month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reiterated the administration's hands-off approach by refusing to say whether she would withhold federal funds from private schools that discriminate against LGBT students.\n\nSimilarly, Roger Severino, who now heads the Civil Rights Office of the Department of Health and Human Services, has argued against same-sex marriage and extending civil rights protections to transgender people.\n\nThe Alliance filed a federal lawsuit in March against the Boyertown School District in Pennsylvania on behalf of a high school student and his parents. The student charged that his \"bodily privacy\" was violated after he saw a transgender male student wearing a bra in the boys' locker room.\n\nThat suit came only a few weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court decided against hearing the case of transgender high school student Gavin Grimm, who was suing his Virginia school district for the right to use the boys' bathroom. Given the Trump administration's policy shift, the high court sent the controversial case back to the same U.S. appeals court that had ruled in Grimm's favor under the old federal guidelines.\n\nNewark Charter School Director Gregory Meece contributed to an amicus, or friend of the court, brief filed in the Grimm case. The charter school permits transgender students to access bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity.\n\n\"All students deserve to feel safe and accepted at school,\" Meece said in an interview\n\nIn 2015, Media Matters, a progressive research nonprofit, contacted officials at the largest school districts in a dozen states that have laws protecting transgender students. None reported \"any incidences of harassment or inappropriate behavior\" by allowing transgender students to access facilities that align with their gender identity, the group found.\n\nLast month, the private Wilmington Friends School held its first \"LGBT+\" dance open to all New Castle County high schoolers, offering them a nonjudgmental space.\n\nThe Quaker school, with 750 students, adopted a formal policy last year addressing transgender student rights, encompassing proper pronouns, access to bathrooms, locker rooms, field trips and more.\n\n\"Everything that's important to us is in writing,\" noted Kathleen Martin, the school's director of College Guidance.\n\nWilmington Friends' guidelines are modeled after another Quaker school in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The defining belief of Quakerism is that there is 'that of God' in everyone, according to the policy.\n\nSTORY: Under Trump, LBGT students fear their futures\n\nUnlike private schools, public schools have to answer to local taxpayers who may have strong opinions.\n\n\"People still have the same rights they had before Trump pulled the guidelines,\" said Richard Morse, legal director for the ACLU of Delaware. But if school districts fail to adopt written policies, he said, \"it's more likely people will make a mistake.\"\n\nIn the last year, the local ACLU has intervened on behalf of two transgender Delaware students who reported harassment and bathroom access problems at their schools. Both complaints were resolved privately without court intervention, Morse said.\n\nThe ACLU, in coordination with other national advocacy groups, has published a first-of-its-kind guide to help K-12 schools \"foster gender-inclusive learning environments.\" Among the recommendations are to give transgender students access to all facilities that correspond with their gender identity and update school databases to reflect the students' preferred names and gender markers. Other typical stumbling points involve afterschool programs, yearbooks, lunch cards and more.\n\n\"Even in the most supportive of school settings,\" the guide notes, \"simple bureaucratic oversights can cause real trauma for a transgender student.\"\n\nDownward spiral\n\nDelaware schools' lack of consistency in supporting transgender students has real consequences for their emotional well-being and ability to succeed, said Linda Gregory, president of the Rehoboth PFLAG support group for LGBT children, parents and allies.\n\nMore than half of transgender and gender nonconforming people who were bullied, harassed or assaulted in school because of their gender identity have attempted suicide, as reported in a 2010 survey conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nA more recent survey from 2015 found that the majority of respondents who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender in grades K-12 experienced some form of mistreatment, including being verbally harassed (54 percent), physically attacked (24 percent), and sexually assaulted (13 percent) because they were transgender. Further, 17 percent experienced such severe mistreatment that they left a school as a result.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Education reported six substantiated incidents of bullying related to gender identity and expression and eight related to sexual orientation during the 2015-16 school year. That's roughly one-third of the cases documented three years prior.\n\nThe state Human Relations Commission, the agency responsible for enforcing Delaware's Equal Accommodations Law, has received no complaints from transgender students in the last five years, according to Commission Director Romona Fuller.\n\nLocal LGBT advocates say that does not tell the whole story, explaining that not all complaints bubble up to the state level.\n\nIn Sussex, where voters overwhelmingly supported Trump in the recent presidential election, most transgender students are homeschooled to avoid being harassed, said Gregory, who is not aware of an active Gay-Straight Alliance at any school in western Sussex.\n\n\"Students complain that their teachers say, 'You're going to hell,'\" she added.\n\nOne Sussex parent, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said her 9-year-old transgender daughter begs to be homeschooled to avoid nasty comments from her peers and school bus drivers. Similarly, the girl's mother said she has been harassed by other parents online and at the school pick-up spot for \"putting little girls in harm's way.\"\n\nThe school, which the mother declined to identify, permits her daughter to use the girl's bathroom and added gender-neutral lavatories on each floor and more library books that address fluid gender roles. But administrators are reluctant to reprimand students who gender-shame her daughter, the mother said.\n\nIn one instance, a former friend of her daughter's publicly outed her in front of an entire class for using the girl's bathroom. Mortified and humiliated, the transgender girl refused to use the girl's bathroom for the rest of the year, and instead used a converted staff bathroom at the opposite end of the hall.\n\n\"It seems to me they are handling this as if my child will be the last transgender child to come out,\" the mother said.\n\nWhile access to bathrooms has dominated media coverage of transgender students, local advocates say they struggle quietly to use their preferred names on school IDs and standardized tests, and to be assigned to health classes and sports teams that correspond to their gender identity.\n\nAccording to Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association guidelines, transgender students are permitted to participate on teams that match their gender identity as long as the member school agrees and the student meets \"minimum standards\" developed by the association.\n\nThose standards include producing an official document with the student's gender identity listed, undergoing sexual reassignment surgery, or having a doctor certify that the student is in the process of transitioning. The association doesn't track how many transgender students play on Delaware sports teams, a spokesman said.\n\nDespite the state's paucity of data related to the school experience for transgender children and teens, Delaware officials continue to trumpet the state's record on protecting LGBT civil rights.\n\nLast year, in reaction to the controversial North Carolina bathroom bill, then-Gov. Jack Markell and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, penned an op-ed for CNN.\n\nIn it, the pair praised Delaware as a place \"where transgender people can fully participate in society, including by using facilities in accordance with their gender identities.\"\n\nStarting this month, the state the Department of Education will use $700 from a multi-focused $1.8 million federal grant to offer one two-hour training for faculty, staff and parents to help navigate issues of transgender student inclusion, a Carney spokesman said.\n\nMore training is sorely needed, according to Bob Martz of the United Way Pride Council. In 2012, when the Pride Council began training administrators and teachers on gender identity issues, fewer than 15 schools statewide had Gay-Straight Alliance student groups.\n\nThat number has since doubled. The program also funds one LGBTQ case manager at Big Brothers, Big Sisters of Delaware, the first position of its kind in the country.\n\n\"We stay away from the bathroom talk,\" noted Martz, who prefers to review basic LGBT terminology during training. \"Is every teacher accepting? Hell no.\"\n\nSTORY: Transgender teen pushes boundaries to be legal\n\nCloud with a rainbow lining\n\nMaddie Heeney is one of the lucky ones. When classmates first teased her as a female imposter, she was too young to remember.\n\nNow 17, the transgender girl from Wilmington bats her long lashes and wears a scrunchie around her wrist. At age 2, a family member watched the biological boy sashay upstairs and blurted out: \"You know she's gay, right?\"\n\nAt age 6, Maddie, who went by a different name, told her parents she wanted to grow up to be a mommy. One year later, she was in therapy, and three years after that, she socially transitioned from male to female.\n\nHeeney's mother, Andrea Rashbaum, remembers having to pull Maddie out of her elementary school, which she declined to name. Administrators refused to accept Rashbaum's offer for staff training on LGBT issues, she said.\n\n\"Boys don't do that,\" was something Maddie heard often. To appear hypermasculine, she joined soccer and karate and got a buzzcut. She visited a therapist more than an hour's drive away to avoid running into classmates while wearing her pink T-shirts.\n\nBy fifth grade, Maddie was enrolled in the private Newark Center for Creative Learning. By that time, she had formally changed her name and presented as a girl.\n\nAfter she was outed by a former classmate, one family snatched their daughter from the Montessori school.\n\nToday, Maddie is one of about seven transgender students at Cab Calloway School of the Arts in Wilmington, where she has access to all amenities that correspond to her gender identity. Last year, after noticing that the hashtag #transtakeover was trending on Twitter, she decided to come out to many of her high school classmates who had no idea she was different.\n\n\"Some people don't know,\" she tweeted. \"But (expletive deleted) it.\"\n\n\"There's definitely a loss,\" admits Maddie's father, Brian, who used to call his son Buddy. \"Older memories don't go with Maddie now.\"\n\n\"It was society that told me I was a boy,\" his daughter politely corrects him.\n\nDownstate, another transgender teen reluctantly accepts the role of proud pioneer as the only openly transgender student in her high school.\n\nEven though substitute teachers continue to use her birth name during roll call, Madison feels more accepted here than at Skyline. A statuesque brunette, she plans to try out for cheerleading and run for prom queen. Sassy and self-assured, she insists that she doesn't care what anyone else thinks.\n\nYet she still yearns to blend in.\n\n\"I want to have a normal experience as every other girl in Cape,\" she said.\n\nReporter Jessica Bies contributed to this report.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nAccommodations for transgender students vary by school district\n\nThe following school districts did not respond to any questions posed by The News Journal related to the treatment of transgender students: Caesar Rodney, Capital, Delmar, Lake Forest, Laurel, Seaford, Smyrna and Woodbridge\n\nNone of the 11 of 19 districts that responded to The News Journal has a formal policy to deal with transgender students.

News Journal\n\nWaves from large hurricanes can be powerful enough to permanently change artificial reef systems\n\nResearcher says superstorm Sandy was powerful in its offshore destruction but so was Hurricane Irene in 2011\n\nTeam compared bottom of ocean sea floor three days before Sandy and immediately after\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. -- Big waves from hurricanes like Irene in 2011 or Superstorm Sandy last October or even nor'easters erode shorelines and the beach and dunes.\n\nBut it turns out, they also impact deeper waters offshore – shifting sand, creating ripples and gullies and are even powerful enough to permanently change the artificial reef system just off the Delaware Coast, according to new research by Arthur Trembanis, at associate professor at the University of Delaware College of Earth, Ocean and the Environment.\n\nAfter a really big storm like Sandy \"it looks like somebody attacked the (sea) floor with ill intent,\" Trembanis said.\n\nAt surface level, the waves from Sandy were large and distant – about two football fields, he said. That wide spread gives waves lots of power – enough to destroy the old Indian River Inlet bridge access road in Delaware or demolish boardwalks and buildings in New Jersey and New York.\n\nIn deep water where the state's Redbird Artificial Reef is located – a collection of 997 subway cars dropped over board to make a fish habitat or at the tri-state reef project in which the 563-foot long Navy destroyer, the Arthur W. Radford, was sunk for both a fish and dive area – the waves still pack considerable power and the strength to topple, crush or destroy the subway cars, split old fishing boats, and even separate the bow of the Radford from its midship and stern.\n\nSandy was powerful in its offshore destruction but so was Hurricane Irene, the previous year. And there also was a damaging nor'easter in March, Trembanis said. It each case, the offshore waves were big and their impact was significant, he said.\n\nHe and his crew are planning one last trip to the offshore reef sites next month and to assess whether this latest nor'easter changed the bottom profile or altered the reef sites, yet again.\n\nBut among the best data Trembanis and his team of students collected was gathered three days before Sandy hit and then, right after.\n\nThe pre-Sandy bottom is relatively smooth – almost like a sandy beach. But during Sandy, the deep wave patterns scoured the sand from the subway cars on each side as the remnants of the powerful, surface waves radiated to the bottom. They formed ridges across the open bottom – a pattern Trembanis describes as ripples and they left smooth, eroded patches.\n\nThe physics of the ocean wave at the surface has its power in the wave length. Waves that are spread apart, pack more power than waves closer together. It is those distant waves that have the power to penetrate the deeper waters of the reef sites – at about half the length of the surface wave.\n\nIt's a little more complicated because not only do the waves have to form far apart, but they also have to be big. The perfect sets of conditions – with hurricanes like Irene, large nor'easters and superstorms like Sandy – don't happen all the time but they aren't as unusual as you might imagine.\n\nThe research is important because it helps scientists understand how sediment – the sand and mud and gravel on the sea floor moves and is transported in the ocean system, Trembanis said. But understanding how the ripples form on the sea floor and the types of wave conditions that make them, help scientists improve the models used to study oceanography.\n\n\"If we don't get the ripples right, we can't get the models right,\" Trembanis said.\n\nThe patterns, it turns out, almost create a wave action fingerprint on the bottom based on what is happening on the surface, he said.\n\n\"It can help us understand what to expect during coastal storms,\" he said.\n\nWave heights just offshore during Superstorm Sandy totaled about 22 feet, compared with the 1991 \"Perfect Storm,\" where waves were 18 feet, said Carter DuVal, a graduate student working on the deep wave project.\n\n\"That's pretty tall,\" DuVal said.\n\nBut a nor'easter that came right after Sandy, had offshore waves of 16 feet and the waves from a nor'easter in March were 26 feet, he said.\n\nWhat Trembanis isn't certain of is when the bow of the Radford split from the rest of the ship. He suspects it may have happened during Hurricane Irene because the damage was done prior to Sandy.\n\nBut he does know that deep waves from Sandy crushed some of the subway cars and formed deep scour pits around them.\n\n\"It was moving really fast across the sea floor,\" he said, of the waves near the bottom.\n\nIn December 2012, they revisited the site and found the area had begun to recover.\n\nAnd then, they went out again after the March nor'easter and they found more damage with crushed and rotated subway cars.\n\n\"It was like the whole seabed had shifted,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/07/07/data-shows-impact-january-storm-seafloor/86756454/", "title": "Data shows impact of January storm on seafloor", "text": "January's storm combined huge waves over the course of several hours to produce a record-breaking high tide.\n\nUniversity of Delaware researches have been monitoring how waves and currents alter the seafloor.\n\nThere are 14 artificial reef sites in the Delaware Bay and coastal waters and an additional five reefs in the ocean.\n\nGiant waves cut away at Delaware's ocean coast during a record-breaking nor'easter in January but offshore, the impact on the seafloor was even more dramatic.\n\nThe waves from the storm were powerful enough to peel away the tops of sunken subway cars on the state's Redbird Reef, an artificial reef 16 miles east of the Indian River Inlet, and turn a barge on the site.\n\n\"My jaw just immediately dropped,\" said Arthur Trembanis, an associate professor at the University of Delaware. \"I said, 'That's really weird. That doesn't look like the orientation. I don't remember the barge having a north-west orientation.\"\n\nJanuary's storm combined huge waves over the course of several hours to produce a record-breaking high tide at Lewes Breakwater Harbor and cause significant shoreline erosion from Lewes south to Fenwick Island.\n\nAt Rehoboth Beach, waves washed under the boardwalk at the city's north end and pounded the structure from the bottom up, lifting the decking and breaking the hurricane ties that held it in place. Dunes were swept away, and at Bethany and South Bethany, as much as one-third to one-half of the protective sand dune was chopped off leaving a 12- to 16-foot dropoff to the beach.\n\nBut the geologic change off shore was even more dramatic, Trembanis and his team of students found.\n\nSTORY: Delaware seeks $2.5 million in coastal disaster aid\n\nSTORY: For beach businesses, July Fourth is no holiday\n\nTrembanis has been monitoring how waves and currents alter the seafloor, deep beneath the ocean surface. It is not, as some might think, protected from the surface waves. Instead, the seafloor is a dynamic place where surface waves can create sand ripples and scours. Wreck sites like the man-made Redbird Reef site make the perfect undersea laboratory where researchers can see how surface waves and currents impact the bottom.\n\nDelaware officials started the Redbird reef site in 1996. It gets its name from the Redbird paint-schemed subway cars donated in 2001 by New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority. State officials sank 619 of the obsolete subway cars. Each was 51 feet long by 9 feet wide and were used to create structure at the reef site. They later added a tugboat and a barge.\n\nJeff Tinsman, Delaware's Artificial Reef manager, said \"We were hoping for a 20 to 25 year life expectancy\" for the subway cars once they were added to the reef. This is the 15th year.\n\nThey were a huge game-changer for the reef site, which at the time it was developed was the farthest offshore. Initially, it was built using surplus military vehicles that had been cleaned for use on a reef, Tinsman said. But it was a large area and the sunken vehicles didn't create a large expanse of undersea habitat. It didn't get all that much use.\n\nOnce the cars were added, the rate of anglers fishing on the Redbird artificial reef site increased 50-fold, Tinsman said.\n\nThe structure on the formerly flat expanse of sand creates a unique habitat for fish. And even as the subway cars move and shift, the habitat evolves, he said.\n\nFor instance, the lower the profile of the cars, the more suitable they become for lobster, Tinsman said. That's because the crustaceans can back into openings that form in the remains of the cars.\n\nDelaware has 14 artificial reef sites in the Delaware Bay and coastal waters and an additional five reefs in the ocean.\n\nTrembanis and his team use high-tech tools and robots to map the seafloor, and they have been monitoring the changes at several sites including the Redbird Reef, since just before Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The massive superstorm gave them an opportunity to get both before and after images of the bottom, and because their instruments were still in position, they could collect real-time data.\n\nThat information has allowed them to use data from nearby off-shore buoys that measure wave height and frequency to calculate what is happening on the seafloor.\n\nSince Sandy, Delaware has experienced major nor'easters in October 2015 and in January.\n\nTrembanis said each was slightly different, both from inshore and undersea impacts. Sandy was very powerful but of short duration. The October storm built over several days but was less intense, and the January storm was a hybrid of the two, lasting far longer than Sandy with offshore waves that exceeded the height of those in the superstorm, he said.\n\nAfter Sandy, Trembanis and his team found dramatic changes at the reef site with subway cars turned and toppled on their sides.\n\nIn the October storm, the footprint from Sandy remained and there weren't significant changes, he said.\n\nBut the January storm altered the site again.\n\nThe edge of the barge had what looked like a plowed edge, Trembanis said. It almost looked like what your windshield would look like once your wipers pushed through slushy snow, he said.\n\n\"It was incredible,\" he said.\n\nTrembanis and his team didn't have access to a research vessel to visit the site immediately after the January storm so he reached out to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which had a survey vessel travelling between New York and Norfolk. That team agreed to run a bottom survey over the Redbird reef site and supplied Trembanis with the data.\n\nThen, he and his team went out in March and confirmed that the barge had shifted.\n\n\"We saw fragments of subway cars. doorways, window jams, frames ... the tops were kind of peeled off and blown like some drifting tumbleweeds into the side of the barge,\" he said. \"The barge itself is still intact. It's actually at the same height.\"\n\nWhat the scientists see are ripples on the seafloor. They form a signature of storm events and tell the story of the wave-generated currents that move back and forth on the ocean bottom as the movement stirs up sediment and sand. You can see similar ripples on the beach after the tide recedes.\n\nBy studying these ripples, scientists get a clear picture of how storms impact the bottom and the ability to predict what will happen in future storms, said Carter DuVal, a University of Delaware oceanography doctoral student. He likens the ripples to a storm's fingerprint on the seafloor.\n\n\"Not only were we seeing a record of the storm, but of the most energetic part of the storm. This is very important for recording the storm's dynamics,\" DuVal said.\n\nAs the planet warms, many scientists expect coastal storms to increase in intensity, frequency and duration.\n\n“For the Mid-Atlantic, nor’easters really are the dominant storm. What we’ve seen by looking back at the records is that the energy level conditions we measured during Hurricane Sandy have a two and a half to three-year recurrence interval,” Trembanis said.\n\nSTORY: Penguin declines linked to warming\n\nSTORY: New Killens Pond State Park slides unveiled\n\nThe January storm, for instance, shifted an old Navy barge that was sunk at the Redbird site 160 degrees, he said.\n\nThe work is part of a bigger study sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. The project is designed to look at the ecosystem and to create detailed maps of the seafloor at Redbird Reef. The site has been mapped every year since 2008 except in 2014.\n\nThe work has implications for people who live along the coast, too.\n\nTrembanis said that to predict erosion, storm surge and the places where the ocean will wash over a beach, they must predict how a wave will change as it moves from the deep ocean just beyond the continental shelf to the shallower, nearshore waters that start about 60 miles off the Delaware coast.\n\n“At practical levels, if we are going to appropriately predict and model how storms are going to behave, we need to be able to determine ripple parameters, such as wavelength and orientation to the shoreline, with accuracy,\" Trembanis said. \"Until we began using a fingerprint algorithm, we didn’t have strong enough tools to do this.\"\n\nReach Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.
