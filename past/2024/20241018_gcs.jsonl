Follow here for the latest updates and news from Tuesday, March 25, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Russia should be kicked out of the Group of 20 nations in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, a major step that would further isolate the Kremlin and restrict Russia's say in the global economy.\n\nRussia’s membership in the group, which represents the world’s major economies, was discussed during an emergency meeting with key U.S. allies, Biden told reporters Thursday during a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels.\n\nHe noted that the decision on whether to boot Russia from the group is up to other G-20 members. If the other members decline to revoke Russia’s membership, Ukraine should be permitted to attend G-20 meetings, Biden said.\n\nThe G-20 includes not only Western democracies but also tyrannical and authoritarian countries such as China and Saudi Arabia. The group works to address major issues impacting the global economy.\n\nThe U.S. and other allies expelled Russia in 2014 from a smaller group that represents industrialized nations after Russia’s annexation of Crimea. That alliance, known at the time as the Group of Eight, is now called the Group of Seven, or G-7.\n\nThe president's remarks came as the U.S. reinforced a united stand with allies in supporting Ukraine one month into Russia’s invasion, with added sanctions against the Kremlin aimed at further crippling the country's economy. The sanctions against more than 400 Russian officials and entities came as Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy has shrunk to half the size it was before the invasion, according to the White House.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters that independent assessments indicate Russia’s last 15 years of economic gains will evaporate this year and inflation will spike to 15%.\n\nRussia, which had the world’s 11th largest economy before the invasion, will fall out of the top 20, according to the official. At the same time, the official said, sanctions are cutting off all sources of potential growth, including blocking Russia from purchasing cutting-edge technology.\n\nBiden also announced Thursday he hopes to meet with Ukrainian refugees while in Europe, giving away a part of his schedule that the White House had not announced.\n\nBiden said getting a first-hand look at the effects of the war on Ukrainians will reinforce his commitment to the U.S. playing a major role in helping both those inside and outside Ukraine.\n\n“I plan on attempting to see those folks as well as, I hope, I'm going to be able to see -- guess I'm not supposed to say where I'm going, am I?” Biden said. “But anyway, I hope I get to see a lot of people.”\n\nLATEST MOVEMENTS:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nNEWS COMES TO YOU:The latest updates on the situation in Ukraine. Sign up here.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk says Ukraine and Russia exchanged a total of 50 military and civilian prisoners Thursday.\n\n►Bulgaria is recalling its ambassador to Moscow for consultations in response to \"undiplomatic, sharp and rude” statements made by Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova. Mitrofanova said Monday that Bulgarians do not \"support the rhetoric and actions of their government\" regarding Russia’s invasion.\n\n►Herman Gref, the head of Russia's largest bank and a close Putin associate, was among those targeted by sanctions the U.S. Treasury Department unveiled Thursday. As CEO of Sberbank, Gref, 58, also oversees a large number of companies owned by Sberbank in other industries, the department said.\n\n►The Russian stock market resumed limited trading Thursday under heavy restrictions almost one month after prices plunged and the market was shut down following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine says Moscow is forcibly taking civilians to Russia\n\nUkraine accused Moscow on Thursday of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up.\n\nLyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, have been taken against their will.\n\nThe Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but said they wanted to go to Russia. Ukraine’s rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow.\n\nRussian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said the roughly 400,000 people evacuated to Russia since the start of the military action were from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years.\n\nRussian authorities said they are providing accommodations and dispensing payments to the evacuees.\n\nUkrainian officials said that the Russians are taking people’s passports and moving them to “filtration camps” in Ukraine’s separatist-controlled east before sending them to various distant, economically depressed areas in Russia.\n\nPoll shows Americans support Russian sanctions, think Biden should be tougher\n\nA majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been \"too tough,\" the poll shows.\n\nAcross the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nBiden: China understands its economic future is 'tied to the West'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he is “hopeful” that Chinese President Xi Jinping will not assist Russia in its war against Ukraine but declined to say whether he’s seen any indications that China will intervene.\n\n“China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the west than it is to Russia,” Biden said. “And so I'm hopeful that he does not get engaged.”\n\nBiden pointed to his virtual meeting last week with Xi in which the president said he “made it clear to him” him that he understand the consequences and would be “putting himself in significant jeopardy.”\n\nBiden said he “made no threats,” to Xi but pointed out the number of American companies that have pulled out of Russia as a result of Putin’s “barbaric behavior.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden: US, NATO will ‘respond’ if Russia uses chemical weapons\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the United States and NATO allies would “respond” to Russia if they used chemical weapons.\n\n“We would respond, we would respond if he uses it,” Biden said during a press conference Thursday. “The nature of the responses depend on the nature of the use.”\n\nBiden would not expand on whether the United States has gathered specific intelligence on if Russian President Vladimir Putin is using chemical weapons.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said Russian military forces committed war crimes in Ukraine after hitting civilian targets.\n\nWhen asked whether there could be a military response if Putin uses chemical weapons, Biden said that NATO would decide as a whole if they would cross that line.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden says ‘sanctions never deter,’ defending US actions against Putin\n\nPresident Joe Biden vigorously defended his administration’s use of sanctions on Russia, arguing the financial penalties were never meant to deter Putin from invading Ukraine but are designed to provide sustained pain.\n\n“Sanctions never deter,” Biden said when pressed why U.S. sanctions have not stopped Putin’s course in Ukraine. “You keep talking about that.”\n\nBiden said it’s the “maintenance of sanctions” and “increasing the pain” over the next year that will stop Russia.\n\n“We have to demonstrate the purpose,” Biden said. “The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and for the world to continue to focus on what a brut this guy is.”\n\nBiden noted that Putin was banking on NATO being split when he invaded Ukraine. Instead, “NATO has never, never been more united than it’s been today,” Biden declared Thursday after an emergency meeting of the allies in Brussels.\n\nBut Putin can take anything for another month, including the harsh sanctions, so the alliance must not crack, Biden added.\n\n– Joey Garrison and Maureen Groppe\n\nU.S. to accept 100K refugees, provide $1B in humanitarian assistance\n\nThe U.S. will accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and others fleeing Russia’s invasion and provide more than $1 billion in new humanitarian assistance, the White House announced Thursday.\n\nThe funding will pay for food, shelter, clean water, medical supplies and other forms of assistance.\n\nAlthough many Ukrainian refugees prefer to remain in Europe where they will be closer to family and their homes, the Biden administration is working to expand and develop new programs with a focus on welcoming Ukrainians who have family members in the U.S.\n\nFood shortages have been a major concern as both Russia and Ukraine are top producers of wheat. Biden discussed with other countries Thursday during a meeting in Brussels how to alleviate the issue, with both Canada and the U.S. – also top producers of the crop – discussing how production can be increased.\n\n“It’s going to be real,” Biden said of food disruptions.\n\nThe nations also talked about the need to end trade restrictions on sending food abroad, Biden said.\n\nBiden noted the U.S. has provided $1 billion in assistance to Ukraine and, along with American allies, is committed to identifying \"additional equipment, including air defense systems, to help Ukraine.” The U.S. is consulting with allies on providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday after meeting with key allies in Brussles, Biden said U.S. weapons are flowing into Ukraine to help the embattled country resist Russia’s invasion.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Biden said the U.S. has committed to provide over $2 billion in military equipment to Ukraine since he became president. Air systems and armor systems ammunitions are flowing into the country “as I speak”, he said.\n\nMeet Ukraine’s volunteer online army\n\nTens of thousands of ordinary people across Europe have joined a grassroots, pro-democratic mission to fight Russia on social media. They call themselves “elves” because they hunt trolls spreading Russian propaganda and disinformation on Facebook and counter Kremlin conspiracy theories with credible information gathered from allies on the ground in embattled parts of Ukraine.\n\nTheir ranks have swelled since the start of the war one month ago as more office workers, doctors, scientists, teachers and IT professionals enlist to stem the flood of pro-Russian falsehoods and conspiracy theories in news feeds.\n\nRičardas Savukynas, a management consultant from Vilnius, started the underground resistance movement in Lithuania in 2014 during the Ukrainian uprising on Kyiv’s Maidan Square and Russia’s annexation of the Crimea Peninsula.\n\n“The idea is everybody can be an elf simply by fighting against propaganda, against lies,” Savukynas said.

Kirby, speaking on Fox News, did not directly respond to a question about how the U.S. and NATO would respond if Russia struck a convoy – accidentally or on purpose – in Poland. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has warned that convoys \"pumping Ukraine with weapons\" will be considered legitimate targets.\n\n\"We have not seen the Russians attempt to strike any of these convoys,\" Kirby said. \"We're watching this very, very carefully, as you might expect. But so far, we have not seen any attempt by the Russians to stall or to slow these convoys.\n\nKirby added that the Russian military has their \"hands full\" in places such as Kyiv, and Chernihiv, Kharkiv and in the south near Crimea.\n\nZelenskyy seeks 1% military solution\n\nIn a video address to a NATO summit Thursday, Ukraine President VolodymyrZelenskyy stressed the need for military assistance. Zelenskyy urged NATO to provide Ukraine with “1% of all your planes, 1% of all your tanks.”\n\n“When we will have all this, it will give us, just like you, 100% security,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy called on people worldwide to gather in public to show support for his embattled country.\n\n“Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,” Zelenskyy said in English during an emotional video address late Wednesday that was recorded in the dark near the presidential offices in Kyiv. “Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.”\n\nUS, allies consider providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. is consulting with allies on providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there could be technical challenges but that it is something that allies are “starting to work on.” The Russians have several warships off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, according to the official. They include surface combatants that have shelled the city of Mariupol. They also have amphibious landing craft, supply ships and patrol boats.\n\nUkraine’s navy reported Thursday that it had sunk the Russian ship Orsk in the Azov near the port city of Berdyansk. It released photos and video of fire and thick smoke coming from the port area. Russia did not immediately comment on the claim.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMcConnell: Ukraine war shows need for more US defense spending\n\nThe 2023 budget request the White House will send to Congress on Monday must reflect that “the world is dangerous and getting smaller,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday.\n\n“We have to meet the military requirements that come from being a superpower facing growing threats to our global interests,” McConnell said on the Senate floor as he addressed President Joe Biden’s meetings with European allies.\n\nMcConnell said the U.S. needs to increase defense spending and expand inventories of critical weapons to meet the nation’s own security ends and to be a reliable supplier of weapons and munitions to allies. He said the war in Ukraine has highlighted shortcomings in both current stockpiles and in the industrial capacity to produce more quickly.\n\n“Ukrainian forces can win this fight,” he said, “but they need more weapons, more ammunition, more fuel. And they need it all as fast as possible.\n\nDissident Russian journalist Oksana Bauline killed in Kyiv bombardment\n\nDissident Russian journalist Oksana Baulina was killed while filming in Kyiv, making her at least the fourth journalist to die in the country during the war. Baulina was working as a correspondent for The Insider when Russian troops shelled a shopping center in the Podil district, a historic neighborhood in Kyiv, the site said in a statement. Another civilian was killed and two more people were wounded and hospitalized.\n\nBaulina had fled Russia but had continued to report on corruption inside the Russian government.\n\n\"The Insider expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana's family and friends,\" the statement read.\n\n– Asha C. Gilbert\n\nZelenskyy address doesn't mention 'no-fly' zone, NATO membership\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked NATO allies Thursday for continued help in his fight against Russia’s invasion but did not repeat his recurring request for a “no-fly\" zone, according to the White House. Zelenskyy addressed the NATO summit by video from Ukraine, speaking shortly after the emergency summit was opened by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, according to a senior administration official who described the closed-door gathering on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said Zelenskyy also did not ask for Ukraine to become a member of the alliance. Russia is opposed to Ukraine joining NATO, one of the conditions Moscow set in the failed negotiations before troops invaded Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy's frequents requests for a \"no-fly\" zone over his country have been dismissed by U.S. and NATO officials who say defending Ukraine skies would risk a wider escalation of the war.\n\nNATO nations agree to strengthen defense forces\n\nNATO leaders agreed Thursday to strengthen its deterrence and defense forces in Europe for the longer-term while increasing support to Ukraine and imposing further costs on Russia, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said after the alliance’s emergency meeting.\n\n“Transatlantic solidarity remains vital,” Stoltenberg tweeted.\n\nIn a group statement released after the meeting, NATO leaders said they condemn Russia’s invasion and called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to immediately stop the war and withdraw forces. The leaders also called on Belarus to end its complicity in the war and for China and other countries to stop supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to \"refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.” NATO also will enhance cyber capabilities and defenses and “substantially increasing” defense spending overall.\n\nRussia to expel more American diplomats, State Department says\n\nRussia has begun the process to expel several American diplomats from the U.S. embassy in Moscow, the State Department said Wednesday.\n\nThe department said it received a list of diplomats on who have been declared “persona non grata” by the Russian foreign ministry. It didn’t say how many diplomats were affected by the order, which generally results in the expulsion of those targeted within 72 hours.\n\nThe State Department called Wednesday’s move “Russia’s latest unhelpful and unproductive step” in relations between the countries. It urged Russia “to end its unjustified expulsions of U.S. diplomats and staff.”\n\n– Charles Ventura\n\nUS has determined Russia committed war crimes, Blinken says\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States has determined Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n“Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine,” Blinken said in a statement.\n\nHe said the assessment is based on “a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources.”\n\nBlinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion has unleashed “unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine.” He cited reports of indiscriminate attacks, including those deliberately targeting civilians, among other atrocities.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}]}

Middle, right: Sardinian bronze figurines. H.W.Nørgaard/National Museum of Denmark/National Archeology Museum of Calgary\n\nSimilar horned helmet imagery has been identified from the Bronze Age in Sardinia, southwestern Iberia and southern Scandinavia, according to the study.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age in Sardinia, symbols of horned creatures such as bulls had religious significance, and were often used to decorate Neolithic tombs.\n\nThe horned helmet motif is linked to Iberia through the expansion of Phoenician society in the west, the research suggests. The Phoenicians were a group of people who inhabited the coast of Levant, in the eastern Mediterranean, according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nPhoenician seafaring routes coincide with the addition of Scandinavia to the network, exposing a Mediterranean-Atlantic sea route into the Baltic Sea. The helmets would not have been transported by land, as “the other-wise flourishing transalpine trade route seems to have been inactive in disseminating the image of the horned warrior hero,” researchers said.\n\n“Our study shows that Scandinavian depictions of horned warriors occur at the same time as very similar images in Sardinia and southwest Spain. This testifies to the tight connections between the great civilisations of Bronze Age Europe; the first globalisation based on long-distance trade in metals, ideas and luxuries,” Vandkilde added.\n\n“The horned warriors in Scandinavia, Sardinia and Spain all associate with new political regimes backed by control of metals and new religious beliefs.”\n\nThose who wore horned helmets would have been considered “the quintessential warrior,” researchers said.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/19/viking-slaves-masters/2836903/", "title": "Odd tale of headless Norse men: Slaves buried with masters", "text": "Traci Watson\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nSlavery was widespread in the Viking world\n\nDietary differences suggest a wide gap in social status between those buried\n\nThose differences also suggest that the headless bodies had premature ends\n\nAbout 1,000 to 1,200 years ago, a Viking man still in his 20s was laid to rest on a craggy island in the Norwegian Sea. A new analysis of his skeleton and others buried nearby — several without their heads — suggests a haunting possibility: Some of the dead may have been slaves killed to lie in the grave with their masters.\n\nSlavery was widespread in the Viking world, and scientists have found other Viking graves that include the remains of slaves sacrificed as \"grave goods\" and buried with their masters, a custom also practiced in ancient China and elsewhere. But the newly analyzed site is one of a very few Viking burials to include more than one slave, says the University of Oslo's Elise Naumann, a Ph.D. student in archaeology who led the research.\n\n\"These are people who had values very different from our own,\" says Naumann, whose study was published online in the Journal of Archaeological Science last week. \"There were probably a very few people who were the most privileged, and many people who suffered.\"\n\nThe skeletons were found in the 1980s by a farmer working the fields. Documentation of the discovery is sparse, and the excavations did not involve archaeologists. But from the start, the researchers suspected they were onto something unusual. At least three of the seven skeletons divided among three graves were apparently buried without their skulls — a mark of disrespect seen at other slave burial sites. The scientists believe that every intact body was probably buried with one or perhaps two headless bodies.\n\nTo understand the relationship between those interred together, the scientists measured the skeletons' ratios of certain types of nitrogen and carbon atoms that depend on diet. The analysis can't pinpoint the foods eaten by the dead, but the data did show that the people buried with their heads had eaten lots of land-based protein, such as milk or beef. The decapitated people, however, had diets rich in seafood, as did a dog buried at the site.\n\nThe differences in diet point to a significant gap in social status between those buried with and without their heads, Naumann says. Perhaps those who dined on meat or dairy products were rich or powerful; perhaps they were a religious elite. A DNA analysis showed that most of those buried in graves together probably weren't close kin, at least through their mothers, the researchers say. The mistreatment of the bodies, the DNA results and the dietary differences led the scientists to think that the headless bodies are most likely slaves who met premature ends to be interred with their masters.\n\nThe paper is an interesting combination of archaeology and molecular studies, says Jette Arneborg of the National Museum of Denmark, and it raises new questions about social structure in the region. But Arneborg says via e-mail that diet \"does not give an unequivocal answer on social status.\" Naumann concedes that the chemical analysis can't detect all dietary differences, but she says those buried together certainly ate differently, indicating clear differences in their community standing — differences that made the Viking world very different from today's egalitarian Scandinavia.\n\n\"It must've been a rough society,\" Naumann says. \"I often think I'm grateful that I didn't live in that time myself.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/12/gold-diggers-buried-treasure-shows-vikings-hoarded-precious-metals/657229001/", "title": "Gold diggers: Buried treasure shows Vikings hoarded precious metals", "text": "A Danish farm field has yielded a priceless harvest: a buried treasure of Viking gold necklaces, arm rings and other precious objects that could help shed light on the relationships among the Viking elite.\n\nMetal-detector enthusiasts and archaeologists have uncovered roughly three pounds of gold from the field, almost all of it discovered in the last 18 months. The cache, known as the Fæsted hoard, is the second-largest known haul of Viking gold and the biggest in Denmark.\n\nThe find shows that the king who originally owned the hoard was “filthy rich,” says curator Lars Grundvad of Denmark’s Sønderskov Museum, who is studying the hoard. “It raises the question, where did they get all this gold?”\n\nDespite the image of the Vikings as thuggish brutes, many of the golden objects are exquisitely worked. There are bracelets made of gold strands twisted together, gold-and-crystal pendants and a unique brooch from which delicate gold chains dangle. There are also silver bracelets, gold beads and fragments of golden jewelry hacked into bits to serve as currency.\n\nNo inscriptions accompany the hoard to reveal its history. But Viking-Age histories provide a clue: Kings evidently showered sumptuous gifts on local chiefs to build alliances.\n\nThe style of some of the jewelry connects it to the dynasty of Viking King Harald Bluetooth, Grundvad says. The nature of the metal also hints at a royal connection. Most Viking treasure is made of silver. As a far more expensive material, gold “shows status,” Grundvad says.\n\nBut who was the recipient of such a lavish gift? One possibility is the family of a high-ranking local chief named Ravnunge-Tue, which translates loosely to “raven youth.” Near the hoard’s burial site stand ceremonial stones inscribed with Ravnunge-Tue’s name, signifying his wealth and stature.\n\nThe treasure was buried no later than 970, according to dates on coins found in the hoard, and Ravnunge-Tue lived at roughly the same time, Grundvad says\n\nPerhaps he hid his gold underground for safekeeping, but it’s also possible he was driven by fear. A burial date of 970 is near the time that German forces invaded Denmark from the south, laying waste to the border wall and an important town.\n\nThe hoard “tells us quite a lot about the very, very early years of Denmark as a nation,” Grundvad says. Studying the treasure will help reveal how Viking rulers bought loyalty and control, a process central to the founding of the Danish state.\n\nThe hoard “is of great significance,” agrees Charlotta Lindblom, curator of archaeology at Denmark’s Vejle Museums. “The level of craftsmanship is extraordinary, as is the value of the gold,” she says, adding that she agrees that the treasure was probably bestowed to cement a political tie.\n\nA necklace and pendants from the hoard were found more than a century ago, but searches since then came up empty. One group of metal-detector users surveyed the field and told Grundvad it was just a “dead spot,” he says.\n\nThen, in early 2016, a second group of metal-detector enthusiasts called Team Rainbow Power took a look. Within 10 minutes, they’d literally struck gold, and the field has continued to produce new pieces of loot ever since.\n\n“When we found the first bracelet, we felt that we had found gold at the end of the rainbow,” Team Rainbow Power member Marie Aagaard Larsen said after discovering the first pieces of the hoard. “But when more bracelets appeared, it became almost unreal.”\n\nRead more:\n\nFla. family finds $1M of sunken Spanish treasure\n\nBuried treasure: Cemetery work uncovers historic gems", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/06/28/ancient-trove-silver-unearthed-scotland/86454862/", "title": "Ancient trove of silver unearthed in Scotland", "text": "Traci Watson\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\n\n\nA farm field in Scotland has yielded a dazzling harvest of ancient silver, left at a prehistoric stone circle more than a thousand years ago by someone who never recovered the treasure.\n\nSurprised researchers found the trove at a site called Gaulcross in northeastern Scotland. The scientists were merely trying to learn more about Gaulcross, where 19th-century farm workers dug up a silver cache that has been almost entirely scattered and lost.\n\n“We hoped we might find the odd fragment,” says archaeologist Gordon Noble of Scotland’s University of Aberdeen. “I don’t think we really expected in our wildest dreams to find more than 100 pieces of silver.” He and his colleagues report the new find in the current issue of the journal Antiquity.\n\nThe silver dates back to the 5th or 6th century, after the Romans decamped and before the Vikings stormed onshore. In this time of political and cultural ferment, Scotland was the realm of an enigmatic people known as the Picts. Often stereotyped as tattooed barbarians, the Picts certainly had a talent for war – but also a talent for carving stone and shaping silver.\n\nThe Gaulcross hoard, as the treasure is known, includes both Roman handiwork and fine Pictish goods. The Roman items include clippings of silver dishes and silverwork of a kind that adorned Roman military uniforms, says archaeologist Alice Blackwell, Glenmorangie Research Fellow at the National Museums Scotland, who is analyzing the hoard. There are also fragments snapped off Pictish brooches and bits of an extremely rare type of wrist bangle.\n\nLike other hoards, the Gaulcross treasure has “preserved fashions (from) what we think of as the darkest bits of the dark age after the fall of the Roman Empire,” says study co-author Martin Goldberg of National Museums Scotland. “It’s like a little snapshot in time.”\n\nBut the key to the mysterious treasure may lie not with the few intact objects but with the many small scraps of silver. Half of the hoard, Goldberg says, consists of silver pieces smaller than a pinky fingernail, many the remains of hacked-up bracelets. Similar hoards have turned up in Denmark and Germany.\n\nSuch chop-shop collections may have been a way to squeeze value out of passé jewelry and worn-out tableware. So perhaps someone left behind the Gaulcross silver with every intention of retrieving it.\n\nOn the other hand, the silver was deposited at a stone circle that was already 2,000 years old at the time of the Picts’ rise. A century before the silver was dropped off, a war trumpet had been thrown into a nearby bog as a religious rite. So perhaps the silver, too, was a religious offering.\n\nWhatever its ultimate purpose, these were elite items that would’ve belonged to the most powerful members of society, the researchers write.\n\n“We don’t always see how wealthy past societies were,” says archaeologist Rob Collins of Britain’s Newcastle University. “These hoards really give us a glimpse of that.

'Titanic' (1997)\n\nIn James Cameron’s blockbuster, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet gave us a doomed love story folks could (mostly) buy amid a historical disaster. (Jack totally could have fit on Rose's door, though.)\n\n31. 'Annie Hall' (1977)\n\nWoody Allen is polarizing, his best movie is not.

'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1929/30)\n\nThe extremely powerful anti-war film explored the carnage of World War I and the disillusioned soldiers who came home.\n\n16. 'Spotlight' (2015)\n\nSigh. \"All the President's Men\" didn't win best picture. Thankfully this story of crusading Boston journalists and a shady Catholic Church cover-up did.\n\n15. 'West Side Story' (1961)\n\nThe cultural portrayals earn some side-eye, but the musical love story still soars with powerhouse tunes and a phenomenal Rita Moreno.\n\n14. 'Gone With the Wind' (1939)\n\nIt's problematic for modern eyes, but the Southern-fried Civil War epic still works as a spectacle of unrequited romance.\n\n13. 'Moonlight' (2016)\n\nBarry Jenkins' elegant character study of a Black man dealing with his identity and sexuality is an unforgettable, multilayered work.\n\n12. 'Parasite' (2019)\n\nIn the first non-English language film to win best picture, a poor but clever Korean family infiltrates a wealthy clan – as well as the viewer's heart and mind.\n\n11.

It will certainly have been heard in the Chelsea boardroom by the directors whose decision to dismiss Lampard in January and hire Tuchel now seems vindicated.\n\n“I am very grateful and thankful to have this opportunity,” said Tuchel, who'd been dismissed by Paris Saint-Germain in December despite leading the French club to last year's Champions League final. “You can never be ahead of plan as a manager and as a player — it does not exist.”\n\nJust like when owner Roman Abramovich made mid-season managerial changes in the 2007-08 and 2011-12 seasons, Chelsea will end the campaign by contesting the biggest game in European football. And by the end of the month two Champions League trophies could be at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea the first club to reach the men's and women's finals in the same season.\n\nEven though the men's showpiece will be an all-English encounter on May 29, the Premier League rivals will have to fly four hours to play the UEFA showpiece in Istanbul, which is currently in a coronavirus lockdown. While City has never lifted the European Cup, Chelsea's only triumph came in 2012 when the 22-year-old Mount was in the youth system.\n\n“It’s going to be a stunning game,\" Mount said.\n\nUnlike last season's final — when Tuchel's PSG lost to Bayern Munich — fans are set to be allowed in. Chelsea supporters have yet to see Tuchel managing their team in the flesh due to England's ongoing coronavirus restrictions. But they can't deny the impact he has made.\n\nChelsea was five points outside the four Champions League qualification places when he was hired, but heads into the final four games of the Premier League season in fourth place with a three-point cushion. There's a chance to pick up a trophy before the trip to Turkey, too, with an FA Cup final against Leicester on May 15 after beating City in the semifinals.\n\nMadrid coach Zinedine Zidane is left to focus on trying on wiping out Atletico Madrid's two-point lead in Spain to win La Liga, rather than adding to the three Champions League titles he won from 2016 to 2018.\n\n“I think we tried, but the truth is today Chelsea were superior and we have to congratulate them,\" Zidane said. “It was complicated throughout the match because they had many chances to score more goals and they deserved their victory.”\n\nAfter conceding a costly away goal last week, Madrid lacked the attacking nous or threat to turn this semifinal around as Chelsea kept an 18th clean sheet in 24 games under Tuchel.\n\nKarim Benzema was denied by the first in a series of fine saves by Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy before Werner's opener but the visitors were sluggish, lacking a creative spark from Eden Hazard on an ineffective return to his former home.\n\nEven in a debut season of misfortune, not even Werner could miss in the 28th minute when presented with an unguarded net to head into from close range after Kai Havertz had lobbed former Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and hit the crossbar.\n\n“I had to wait a long time for the ball coming down — it felt like hours,\" Werner said.\n\nThe chants of “Timo” from the substitutes' bench reflected the delight from his teammates that the Germany forward had scored only his fourth goal in 35 games for Chelsea. For all the scrutiny faced, though, Werner has still managed 12 goals and 10 assists since last year costing Chelsea up to $68 million.\n\nFor all Chelsea's threat, Madrid only needed to score once to force the second leg into extra time. When the second half opened with Havertz heading against the crossbar and having a low shot saved it looked like the misses could prove costly.\n\n“Keep on pushing guys,” Tuchel urged from the sideline.\n\nAnd so they did, helped by the arrival of Christian Pulisic from the bench as Werner's replacement to spark the second goal. The American headed to N’Golo Kante and received the ball back to feed Mount, who lifted a shot over Courtois in the 85th.\n\n“I have to go on and do my bit,” Pulisic sad, “be creative and try to finish the game off strong and luckily I was able to do that.”\n\nNot that Pulisic was satisfied waiting more than an hour to enter the game.\n\n“Very frustrated — I wanted to play from the beginning, as I always do,\" said the forward signed in 2019 from Borussia Dortmund. I’ve had to continue to prove myself over and over again. ... Nothing can stop me, really.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/05"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/955393/gingerism-last-socially-acceptable-form-of-bullying", "title": "'Gingerism': the last socially acceptable form of bullying? | The Week", "text": "The head of a human rights charity has warned that prejudice against people with ginger hair is “not just ‘harmless banter’” and that red-haired children need to be protected.\n\nChrissy Meleady, CEO of Equalities and Human Rights UK, told the Sheffield Star that “bullying red-haired people is one of the last socially accepted forms of prejudice against people for a trait they were born with”.\n\nCampaigners and red-haired people have been trying to change such attitudes for years.

An employment tribunal heard that John Brelsford was sacked after being accused of bullying and “humiliating” pupils, the Sheffield Star reported.\n\nThe reported incidents included doing an internet search for “gingerphobia” during a lesson, which “led to a child in the class with red hair being teased by his classmates and getting upset”.\n\nAlthough gingerism may be presented as just “banter”, rights campaigner Meleady, “who is ginger herself”, argued that such so-called jokes can “strip red-haired children “of their positive self-identity and confidence”, said The Telegraph.\n\n“And worse, it can lead to school refusal, health problems, self-injurious behaviour and even children wanting and trying to die by suicide,” added Meleady, who was awarded an MBE in 2000 for her services to children.\n\nShe told the Sheffield Star that she had recently witnessed a case of “a family physically abusing their baby for having red hair as they equated her red hair as being the ‘mark of the devil’”.\n\nAnother family, who were seeking to adopt, had said that “they would accept any child of any race, social background, nationality, sexual orientation, diverse genders, disabled, but that they ’could not abide a red-haired child’”, she continued.\n\nMeleady called for action to protect young redheads, “not just from gingerism or anti-red haired prejudice and abuse from other children, but from school and other settings members who model the bullying and abuses to red-haired children”.\n\nBetween 1% and 2% of the global population have red hair, but the figure is much higher in England, at 6%, and higher still in Scotland, at 13%.\n\nIn 2013, genetic researchers believed they had “developed a powerful tool to combat the bullying of some redheads in Britain”, Reuters reported.

His death happened during an intervention with officers from Operation Trident, a unit targeting gun crime in London, who were attempting to carry out an arrest, reported the BBC in 2015.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct, later admitted to wrongly giving journalists the impression that shots had been fired by Duggan.\n\nAt first, the shooting drew “little attention”, writes former Downing Street official Craig Oliver in a retrospective of the ensuing events in The Times. “But it turns out there was no gun (though one was found near by)” and Duggan’s relatives and friends were “distraught and incensed”.\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was “shocked and deeply worried” about the incident, and on Saturday 6 August 300 people gathered outside Tottenham police station to protest the shooting, saying they wanted “justice” for Duggan and his family.\n\nPart of the reason for their demonstration was down to the “alleged failure by the IPCC to provide Duggan’s family and the local community with reliable information in the aftermath of his death”, wrote The Guardian at the time.\n\nThe newspaper says “two different portraits were painted” of Duggan that week, a “hardened north London gangster and drug dealer” and a “loving family man who would never seek confrontation”.\n\nA 2014 inquest found the shooting to be lawful but concluded that Duggan did not have a weapon in his hands when confronted by police and had thrown it from the taxi.\n\nDoves are released outside Tottenham police station on 11 January 2014, during a vigil following a jury’s ruling that Mark Duggan was lawfully killed when he was shot dead by police (Image credit: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPeaceful protests turn violent\n\nAccording to the BBC, the protests started peacefully, with the demonstration outside Tottenham police station on 6 August, but a “confrontation between a teenage protester and a police officer” sparked violence, with bottles being thrown at two patrol cars, which were then set alight. Riot officers and police on horseback were “deployed to disperse the crowds”, but “came under attack from bottles, fireworks and other missiles”.\n\nThe peaceful gathering “culminated 12 hours later in a full-scale riot that saw brazen looting spread across north-London suburbs”, reported The Guardian at the time. The protest had been “good-natured”, added the paper, but what became clear over the next four hours was that as tensions “gradually escalated”, the “police made only limited attempts to talk to the demonstrators”.\n\nBy 11pm that evening, a double-decker bus had been set alight, reported The Guardian, and many local shops along the high road had been broken into. Haringey Council said the damage to roads and pavements in Tottenham was in the region of £227,000, according to the Daily Mail in 2011.\n\nBurnt out cars lie in the road after riots in Tottenham on 7 August 2011 (Image credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking on the morning of 7 August, Lammy described the events as a “disgrace”. “What happened here on Thursday night raised huge questions and we need answers”, he said. “The response to that is not to loot and rob… This must stop. This is an attack on Tottenham, on people, on ordinary people.”\n\nUnrest spreads across England\n\nThe day after the Tottenham riots, televisions showed “helicopter shots of rioting across London”, writes Oliver in The Times. “From Hackney to Croydon, Ealing to Bromley, shops [were] on fire or being looted.” It was agreed that Prime Minister David Cameron, who was on a summer holiday in Italy, should fly back as soon as possible. Then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson was criticised for not coming back from his holiday quickly enough.\n\n“These images of rioters driving the police from the streets quickly proved an inspiration to others”, says Matteo Tiratelli, a lecturer in political sociology at University College London, in The Conversation. Over the next five nights, roughly 15,000 people took to the streets in towns and cities across England. “Hundreds of police officers were injured and £250m worth of damage was done to shops and businesses in London alone.”\n\nRiot police walk along Clarence Road in Hackney, east London, on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nOn the evening of 8 August, the riots claimed two lives: Trevor Ellis, 26, was found with bullet wounds in a car in Croydon and Richard Bowes, 68, was critically injured trying to put out a fire. He later died from his injuries.\n\nTwo days later, on 10 August, Haroon Jahan, 21, Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were killed when a car hit them in Winson Green, Birmingham. According to witnesses, they had been protecting their community and local businesses from looting and destruction.\n\nHours after finding his dying son in the street, Jahan’s father called for calm: “Black, white, Asians – we all live in the same community... step forward if you want to lose your son. Otherwise, calm down and go home – please”, he said.\n\nTariq Jahan, Haroon’s father, gives a statement to the media near to where his son and two other men were hit by a car and killed in Birmingham on 10 August 2011 (Image credit: CARL DE SOUZA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAn extra 1,700 police officers were deployed in London and more than 400 people were arrested. “The Met was stretched beyond belief in a way that it has never experienced before,” Stephen Kavanagh, the Met deputy assistant commissioner at the time, told BBC Breakfast. It is thought that social media networks including Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger played a key role in fuelling the unrest.\n\nAlthough protests over Duggan’s death had sparked the original Tottenham riots, many seemed to agree that the unrest was “a long time coming” and not just a reaction to the shooting, The Telegraph said. One woman told the paper: “You had a tinder box that was waiting and that was just the match… It's frustration by young people who have been pushed to the wall.”\n\nHow did the riots end?\n\nBy 11 August, the total number of arrests in London had reached 1,009 and of those, 464 people had been charged. One hundred families had been made homeless as a result of the unrest, five people had died and 26 police officers were injured. The situation was reaching a tipping point and, by the fourth night of the riots, London increased its number of police to 16,000 by pulling in officers from other forces across the country.\n\nA damaged Currys store is pictured in Brixton on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThis greater police presence on the streets was the major factor in persuading people to stay at home, according to the Reading the Riots study, which interviewed 270 people involved in the events.\n\n“I think the 16,000 police was a deterrent for everyone; they thought: ‘You know what, we’ve done enough, we’ve done what we had to do… Leave it’,” said one of the people interviewed, a 23-year-old unemployed man from Newham, east London.\n\nOther explanations for the riots ending included a lack of excitement and there being nothing left to loot. Some of those involved in the report said they were impacted by Jahan’s father’s moving speech. “When I [saw his] interview I did stop like, because that did hit me quite hard”, one interviewee said.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nThe IPCC’s investigation into Duggan’s death continued, but in September 2011 Duggan’s brother Shaun Hall said he was “not confident at all” that the watchdog would successfully establish what had happened, the BBC reported.\n\nMembers of Mark Duggan’s family, including his aunt, Carol Duggan, and his half-brother, Shaun, examine a reconstruction of the scene of the shooting on 2 December 2013 (Image credit: Oli Scarff/Getty Images)\n\nThat same month, Scotland Yard apologised to Duggan’s family for failing to inform them directly of his death. A year on from Duggan’s shooting, in 2012, his mother, Pam, said she still had “no answers about why my son died”.\n\nTo this day, questions remain surrounding the events which led to the shooting. In 2015, an IPCC report “found Duggan was probably in the process of throwing away a handgun when he was shot”. However, Forensic Architecture, a human rights research organisation based at Goldsmiths, University of London, has said this conclusion is wrong, according to a detailed report in The Guardian published in 2020.\n\nThe IPCC has called “implausible” a claim that police moved the gun. “There is no sensible reason why they [the police] would have opted to plant the firearm on the grass such a distance away from Mr Duggan thereby giving rise to the various doubts which have inevitably arisen about this matter,” the police watchdog said.\n\nThe penal response to the rioters was “enormous and unprecedented”, says Tiratelli on The Conversation, with cases “pushed from the magistrates’ to the crown courts, ensuring that longer sentences were available and costing minors their right to anonymity in the press”.\n\nThe result was that more than 2,000 people faced jail sentences “which were four and a half times longer than those same offences would normally warrant”.\n\nIn 2011, Cameron agreed to establish the Riots Communities and Victims Panel to investigate the causes of the riots and consider what more could be done to build greater social and economic resilience in communities.\n\nNotes are pinned on a ‘peace wall’ on a boarded-up window of Poundland on Rye Lane, Peckham, in August 2011 (Image credit: John Phillips/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nA decade on\n\nOnly “a handful” of the 63 recommendations in the After the riots report have been implemented, writes David Lammy in The Guardian, which included “calling on the government to provide greater support for families, address youth unemployment, improve school attainment, improve police relations and tackle reoffending by young offenders”.\n\nOver the years, “instead of acting to strengthen the fabric of society’s fire blanket to reduce the risk of riots”, Conservative prime ministers have “decimated police forces, youth services and local authority budgets”, he adds. “I say this with deep regret: by failing to implement the measures designed to tackle society’s dissatisfaction, alienation and fragmentation, Johnson risks letting a spark set fire to the fuel all over again.”\n\nBut writing in The Times, Oliver says he believes that if the country faced a similar situation again, “the police would be quicker off the mark in terms of tightening their grip and making clear actions have consequences”.\n\nHowever, the events of 2011 made it clear that “social order isn’t as stable as we thought”, he adds. “All it takes is for a few thousand people to rebel and, as Yeats famously wrote, ‘Things fall apart... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world’”.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/956046/the-pros-and-cons-of-fracking", "title": "The pros and cons of fracking | The Week", "text": "The new Prime Minister Liz Truss could lift the ban on fracking “within days” amid ever-growing concern about the energy crisis and increasing demands that her government does more to improve energy security.\n\nTruss repeatedly spoke out in favour of fracking during the Tory leadership campaign and has vowed to “end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking”, noted the Daily Mail.\n\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. It was halted in the UK in 2019 amid opposition from green groups and local concerns over earth tremors, but there have been “calls to rethink the ban, given the soaring cost of energy”, said the BBC.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph ahead of her election as Tory leader, Truss said: “On the subject of fracking, I think it depends on the local area, and whether there is support in the local area for it.”\n\nThe Telegraph also reported that outgoing chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has been “eyeing measures to turn the tide of public opinion” on the controversial practice as part of a twin approach to provide better incentives for investors to back gas projects alongside persuading residents to support extracting shale gas, amid concerns it contaminates the environment and causes earthquakes. The paper pointed to a softening of public opinion following the spike in energy prices, with support for fracking almost doubling over the past year.\n\nHowever, in what The Guardian described as “a jibe” at his successor, Boris Johnson joined the chorus of sceptics over Truss’s plans for fracking, saying “if we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea.”\n\n1. Pro: alternative to coal\n\nReliance on natural gas, rather than coal, is “indisputably creating widespread public health benefits, as the burning of natural gas produces fewer harmful particles in the air”, said news service Yale Climate Connections. That’s because natural gas emits about half of the greenhouse gas emissions of coal per unit of energy, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nWhile burning natural gas does create pollution, it doesn’t produce pollutants such as ash and mercury, “which can pose health and environmental hazards for years”, reported Vox. “Regardless of what you believe about the future, shale gas has played a substantial role in getting rid of carbon emissions and conventional emissions from coal,” Sam Ori, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, told the news site in 2020.\n\n2. Con: a question of demand\n\nAlthough there are estimates of how much potentially recoverable shale gas the UK has, this is “not the same as proven reserves”, which is “the amount that can be produced commercially at any given time”, said experts from Warwick and Newcastle universities for The Conversation.\n\nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) estimated the UK shale resource at about 1,329 trillion cubic feet in 2013, falling short of the 2.8 trillion cubic feet of gas consumed by the UK per year. Since the estimates were published, “only 11 dedicated shale gas exploration wells have been drilled, and only two have had flow tests carried out to determine their technical and economic viability”, they noted. It could well be “inaccurate” to say that the UK has “vast” shale gas reserves. And fracking will not be able to provide a “quick fix” – it may take “years of drilling” before production could begin in earnest.\n\n“The shale gas industry has a history of secrecy, broken promises, delays and a failure to deliver, despite years of government backing,” said Drill or Drop news site, claiming that “in more than a decade, it has produced no gas for homes or businesses” in the UK.\n\n3. Pro: access to materials\n\nFracking can reach depths that other extraction methods cannot, meaning greater access to natural deposits of gas and oil. “This is a really important benefit, as many scientists previously thought that we had only a few years left to use fossil fuels before they ran out,” Conserve Energy Future said. In the US, fracking has “significantly boosted” domestic oil production, and has contributed to lower gas prices, reported the BBC in 2018. The use of fracking means that the US and Canada are likely to enjoy gas security for “about 100 years”, said the broadcaster in 2018, and so it has proved during the current energy crisis, with energy prices 10 times higher on average in Europe than the US, according to Foreign Policy.\n\n4. Con: risk of earthquakes\n\nThe disposal of drilling wastewater used in fracking has been scientifically linked to earthquakes. The fluids used in fracking, along with the wastewater that comes back up the well, is disposed of “by injecting it into disposal wells deep underground”, said energy and environment news site StateImpact Texas. “This is generally regarded as the safest, most cost-efficient way to get rid of it,” the site noted, but added that fracking has been causing earthquakes that are “growing both in number and strength” in some parts of the US. In the UK, exploratory drilling in Lancashire by the company Cuadrilla was suspended in 2011 after fracking caused two earth tremors, which prompted a temporary ban on fracking in the UK. In 2019, a tremor measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale was recorded near a Cuadrilla fracking site in Blackpool, leading to an indefinite suspension of fracking. In November of that year, the government announced a moratorium on shale-gas extraction.\n\n5. Pro: job creation\n\nFracking has triggered “a shale gas revolution in the US,” said The Times, “creating a jobs boom in states such as Pennsylvania that had previously suffered from the closures of coal mines”.\n\nIt is hoped something similar could happen in the UK. An industry-commission report by professional services firm Ernst & Young in 2014 said that the sector could create around 64,000 jobs in the UK, based on 4,000 horizontal wells being drilled by 2032.\n\nBut the figure was criticised as unrealistic by The Guardian, and based on the creation of 4,000 wells. The UK has only ever opened two shale gas wells – those owned by Cuadrilla – which The Oil and Gas Authority has ordered to be permanently sealed by 30 June this year.\n\nHowever, in a further signal the government could be preparing to change its position on fracking, Johnson has reportedly told Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng that it does “not make sense” to seal the wells, as he continues to search for ways to secure the UK’s energy supplies, reported The Guardian. Kwarteng added that he and Johnson were “still in conversations” over the matter.\n\n6. Con: air and water pollution\n\nA “buried” UK government report from 2015 found that a fracking industry of 400 wells would increase national emissions of air pollution, with nitrogen dioxides rising by 1% and 4%, and volatile organic compounds by 1% and 3%, The Guardian reported. And in the US, the BBC reported, some areas near fracking sites have “complained about high levels of the carcinogen benzene in underground water supplies” as a result of the practice. The water used in fracking often “comes back to the surface” and can be contaminated with heavy metals and radioactivity, the broadcaster added.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Irenie Forshaw", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/education/960356/the-pros-and-cons-of-school-holidays", "title": "The pros and cons of school holidays | The Week", "text": "For most children in the UK, the school holidays are a welcome reprieve after weeks of learning. For some parents, however, the school holidays can be an unwelcome time of logistical stress and financial pressure.\n\nWith most working parents unable to take leave for the duration of the school holidays throughout the year, the impending breaks can be a “mix of panic, overwork, trying to find money for childcare and begging for help from grandparents”, said Allegra Chapman for the i news site. The “combination of the cost-of-living crisis and the long school holidays” also piles on the pressure for parents, said Katharine Swindells at City Monitor, and many parents “will be forced to give up work or reduce their hours” to look after their children.\n\nFor teachers, the holidays are “necessary for a break for both pupils and themselves”, said Yahoo!

Sign up\n\nWhile the UK’s current school holiday calendar is a long-standing tradition, there is an ongoing debate as to whether school breaks should adapt to changes and pressures in society.\n\n1. Pro: sufficient breaks for kids\n\nThe 91 days of holiday given to schoolchildren in the UK can be beneficial in allowing them time away from the rigours of structured learning.\n\nThe six-week summer break particularly gives them time to “just be kids”, mother-of-two and former teacher Jo Otto argued in Yahoo! News, providing sufficient time for “children to have other opportunities” and “learn other skills outside of what they learn at school”. For parents, it can also be “precious time spent with them” within busy schedules.\n\n2. Con: effect on learning\n\nPupils can lose up to “40% of the gains they have made over the school year while on summer break”, a 2020 study showed, often known as “‘summer slide’, or ‘summer learning loss’, reversing some of the progress students have made over the year”, said Forbes.\n\nIt seems true that “disparities in academic attainment, particularly around reading and language, grow during breaks”, Jon Kay of the Education Endowment Foundation told The Guardian. This can be largely “explained by levels of access to books and stimulation like museum visits”, which is much easier for affluent pupils, while those from poorer backgrounds tend to “stay stationary”.\n\n3. Pro: good for teachers\n\nThe idea of shortening holidays is “incredibly unpopular with teachers” and would impact “the recruitment of high-quality teachers”, Kay said, and the UK’s summer holiday is already “one of the shortest in the OECD countries”.\n\nIndeed, when the Welsh government launched a consultation on shortening school holidays and spreading them throughout the year, it immediately put “education unions on the defence”, Neil Butler, the national official for Wales for teaching union NASUWT, told the BBC. He said that if the “six weeks were reduced, you’d see a mass exodus from the profession”.\n\nThe summer break is a “key time for teachers to switch off from the stress and demand of the job”, the BBC said.\n\n4. Con: pressure on parents\n\nSchool holidays “are a nightmare for parents”, writes Chapman at the i news site, arguing for “shorter, more frequent set breaks across the year” or even having schools “operating all year round” and giving “annual leave” to children to match their parents. That would require “more investment into the school system to provide more, better paid, staff who can share the load and cover time off”, to also benefit teachers, she said.\n\nThe impending school holidays are an “intricate task demanding hours of planning” for parents, said Susannah Streeter at the BBC, trying to find “childcare and entertainment for the long stretch of summer”.\n\nIncreasing costs mean “many parents have to make some stark choices in terms of their careers”, with many choosing to take “a big salary drop as a compromise for flexibility”.\n\n5. Pro: summer is best time for break\n\nA drastic change to school holidays would almost certainly see a reduction of the long summer stretch, meaning extra weeks earlier and later in the year at half-terms.\n\n“The huge disadvantage of a two-week half-term break at the end of October is undoubtedly the weather,” writes teacher Yvonne Williams in TES Magazine. She argues that a staycation is a “less attractive proposition in the last weeks of October” and that inclement weather and shorter days will keep children “glued even more firmly to the internet”.\n\nAn extension of the summer break would be better, she argues, as there are “threads trailing” in the autumn, making it harder for teachers to switch off and for pupils to stay on top of their work.\n\n6. Con: exacerbates inequality\n\nThe increasing cost of childcare and activities during holidays means disadvantaged families are often left worse off. The UK has seen a “decline in the availability and sufficiency of holiday childcare” while the “cost of accessing physical activity spaces” is preventing some children from “doing more physical activity”, writes Katharine Swindells.\n\nPoorer families who rely on free school meals often have to “meet the extra food costs” during the holidays, with some parents having to “skip meals over the summer break” to ensure their children are fed, said The Observer. With lower government support it’s “leaving charities, food banks and businesses to pick up the shortfall”, said Swindells.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Amanda Constance", "Joel Mathis"], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}]}

While NASA spacecraft have been busy studying asteroids, gas giants and terrestrial planets, ocean worlds have largely remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nAnd though Europa has been imaged before, no vehicles have gotten as up-close a look as the Clipper should get. When the uncrewed orbiter reaches the moon by 2030, it will begin the historic task of mapping and scanning above and beneath Europa's surface to determine whether the celestial body is indeed habitable, as scientists have long suspected.\n\nWith the launch window set to open as soon as Oct. 10, NASA officials took the time Tuesday to provide an update on the Europa Clipper mission during a news conference.\n\n\"Our journey of exploration and discovery is about to begin,\" said Laurie Leshin, director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, in prepared remarks. \"This is an incredibly impressive mission.\"\n\nHarvest Moon:What time is the partial lunar eclipse? Tonight's celestial event coincides with Harvest Moon\n\nWhy are scientists interested in Europa?\n\nThe fourth largest of Jupiter’s 95 moons, Europa is an icy celestial body teeming with enigma and intrigue.\n\nThough Europa is slightly smaller than Earth’s own moon and barely one-quarter the diameter of Earth, beneath its surface is a vast salty ocean twice the size of Earth’s own oceans combined. Scientists have long theorized that the icy crust above the ocean conceals evidence of organic compounds and energy sources – ingredients that are the stuff of life.\n\nThe icy shell encasing Europa – named for a woman from Greek mythology abducted by Zeus (Jupiter, in Roman mythology) – was first detected in 1972 through telescope observations. Thermal models a year earlier also suggested the presence of the layer of liquid water flowing beneath it, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is the Europa Clipper mission?\n\nIf the conditions to support life do indeed exist on Europa, then NASA is hoping the Clipper will be able to discover them.\n\n\"There's very strong evidence that the ingredients for life exist on Europa, but we have to go there to find out,\" Bonnie Buratti, deputy project scientist for the Clipper mission, said during Tuesday's news conference.\n\nAstronomers believe oceans worlds such as Europa are common outside of our solar system, so studying Europa could prove to be the first step to understanding how life could exist beyond Earth. But NASA officials were clear on one point: The Clipper is not looking to find life itself; just the conditions that could support it.\n\nDuring the course of 49 close flybys of Europa, the Clipper will gather and relay data to help scientists determine, for instance, the subsurface's salinity and how deep the water is, said Gina DiBraccio, acting director of NASA's Planetary Science Division.\n\n\"NASA is so excited to being one step closer to answering fundamental questions about the solar system and beyond,\" DiBraccio said in prepared remarks. \"This is going to pave the way for the future: for future missions to Europa and elsewhere in our solar system where we can search more directly for life.\"\n\nWhat to know about the Clipper spacecraft\n\nWith its massive solar arrays and radar antennas, the Clipper is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission.\n\nBigger than a basketball court, the spacecraft extends 100 feet from one end to the other and is about 58 feet across. With no propellant in the tank, the Europa Clipper weighs about 7,145 pounds.\n\nThe orbiter's solar arrays alone, which need to be huge so they can collect enough sunlight while near Jupiter to power the craft, measure about 46.5 feet long and about 13.5 feet high.\n\nThough mission engineers plotted orbits to limit the Clipper's time amid Jupiter's most intense radiation, the spacecraft was also designed with a thick-walled vault made of titanium and aluminum to shield sensitive electronics.\n\nNASA spacecraft have imaged Europa before – but not like this\n\nSix spacecraft have visited Europa since it became one of the first moons found beyond Earth.\n\nNASA’s Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft flew by Jupiter in the early 1970s, but the first spacecraft to image the surfaces of Jupiter's moons in significant detail were the Voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1979. NASA's Junospacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since July 2016.\n\nHowever, it was the imaging conducted in the 1990s during the Galileo mission that provided the most data on Europa to date.\n\nScientists have long been intrigued by the moon's surprising lack of large impact craters that lend it a notably smooth surface, especially relative to the other icy moons. Galileo's imaging also revealed reddish-brown cracks slicing the surface that scientists hope to better understand when the Clipper arrives.\n\nThe Europa Clipper's flybys will cover both hemispheres of the moon, the closest of which will be at an altitude of 16 miles above Europa's surface, NASA says.\n\nOn board, the Europa Clipper will carry nine observational instruments, including cameras needed for high-resolution imaging and an ice-penetrating radar to search for the subsurface water. The instruments, which will also study the moon's geology and atmosphere, will operate simultaneously on every pass so that scientists can layer the data together to paint a full picture of the moon.\n\n\"Every mission we have ever been to, we have always uncovered things we could not have imagined,\" Buratti said. \"There's going to be something there, the unknown, that is going to be so wonderful that we can't conceive of it right now.\"\n\nWhen will the Europa Clipper launch?\n\nNASA officials said Tuesday that the Europa Clipper remains on track to be ready when the launch window opens Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nEngineers have been hard at work readying the spacecraft to endure both a launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket as well as the harsh conditions of the vacuum of space, said Jordan Evans, Europa Clipper project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The orbiter is now prepared to get fueled up and head to Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Evans said.\n\nAhead of the spacecraft is a 1.8 billion-mile journey to Europa on a trajectory taking it past Mars and then Earth, using the planets’ gravity as a slingshot to add speed for the trek. After journeying for more than five years, the Europa Clipper will fire its engines to enter Jupiter's orbit in 2030.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information and because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Add a telescope into the mix, and suddenly millions more come into view.\n\nThe Milky Way is brimming with an estimated hundred billions stars, giant balls of hot gas, including our galaxy's most famous – the sun. But outside of our home galaxy? The number of stars is near unfathomable.\n\nYet getting a handle on observing stars, which form in large molecular clouds of gas and dust, is crucial to better understand not only how they evolve, but how our universe grows and changes with them, astronomers say.\n\nTo do that, what's the harm of adding just one more \"star\" to the mix – even if it's a humanmade one?\n\nIn a $19.5 million NASA-funded mission, researchers at George Mason University are heading a project to construct and eventually launch a small satellite into space. Once in orbit, the contraption will be far enough away to look like a star to telescopes back on Earth.\n\nThe satellite will then begin the work of helping researchers study star brightness to gain more precise estimates of their size, scale and age. By doing so, the researchers hope to uncover fresh clues about how fast the universe is expanding and, just maybe, whether life could exist anywhere else in the universe.\n\n“It might impact and change the way we measure or understand the properties of stars, surface temperatures and the habitability of exoplanets,\" said Eliad Peretz of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who is the mission's deputy principal investigator.\n\nHere's a look inside NASA's plan to launch an \"artificial star\" over the U.S. before the end of the decade.\n\nArtificial star will be visible to ground telescopes\n\nThe purpose of the so-named Landolt NASA Space Mission is to place a calibrated light source into orbit at a distance of 22,236 miles from the Earth.\n\nThe satellite, or \"artificial star,\" that the astronomers shoot into orbit won't be big enough, bright enough or close enough for skygazers to detect with the naked eye, but it should be visible to anyone with a telescope. Named for late astronomer Arlo Landolt, who created a renowned star catalog, the satellite will then spend its inaugural year in space moving at the same speed as Earth's rotation, keeping it positioned over the United States.\n\nIn technical terms, the small satellite is what's called a CubeSat, which is a a class of nanosatellites. Equipping the device with a cache of eight lasers will allow it to provide consistent observations on brightness levels of millions of stars to mission control on George Mason's campus in Fairfax, Virginia and other observatories.\n\nBy providing data that ground-based telescopes cannot, the artificial star should be able to refine the accuracy of measuring stellar brightness levels of nearby stars and even distant supernovae in far-away galaxies, Peter Plavchan, an astronomer at George Mason University, explained in a paper on the project.\n\n\"The Landolt mission will allow us to re-calibrate the brightnesses of millions of stars,\" Plavchan, the mission's primary investigator, wrote. \"Such measurements can only be achieved by a space-based orbiting artificial star.\"\n\nGeorge Mason leading $19.5 million Landolt NASA Space Mission\n\nNASA, which recently approved the mission for deployment as part of the space agency's Pioneers program, is providing the funding.\n\nWhile $19.5 million is relatively low-cost in terms of space missions, the green light represents a major first for George Mason, which will build and operate the mission for NASA.\n\nBut the university won't be doing it alone.\n\nAlong with NASA, George Mason will also partner with the National Institute of Standards and Technology – a U.S. Department of Commerce agency – as well as 10 other universities to develop the satellite.\n\n“This is an incredibly exciting opportunity for George Mason and our students,\" said Peter Pachowicz, an engineering associate professor at George Mason who is part of the Landolt mission, in a statement. \"Our team will design, build, and integrate the payload, which, because it’s going very high into geostationary orbit, must handle incredible challenges.”\n\nNASA will provide management and oversight of Landolt, which is already part of the space agency's fleet chart, by hosting reviews in the coming years amid key decision points, Plavchan told USA TODAY. He added that he and other mission operators will also provide monthly briefings to NASA.\n\nA specific launch vehicle will not be selected for another two-and-a-half years, Plavchan said. And because the Landolt satellite will be relatively small, the craft will have to hitch a ride to orbit via a private space company with the launch of either a bigger satellite or a set of small satellites, he added.\n\nUnderstanding more about habitable planets\n\nThe Landolt mission is not just one of a characterizing the brightness of stars. As the satellite gazes into the endless expanse of outer space, astronomers hope to learn about distant terrestrial worlds that could harbor life.\n\nAstronomers have long been interested in so-called habitable zones and the abundance of ocean worlds theorized to exist throughout the cosmos. Next month, NASA is on the cusp of launching its own largest planetary craft to date to study Jupiter's moon Europa to see if the vast ocean beneath its surface hold clues to how life could exist beyond our own planet.\n\nBy gathering data on stellar evolution, the Landolt mission may play a vital role in helping identify habitable zones where planets could have water, providing a key ingredient for life to flourish. In a nod to the classic fairy tale, astronomers even refer to these regions as \"Goldilocks\" zones because conditions have to be just right – neither too hot nor too cold – for water to remain in liquid form and pool on planetary surfaces.\n\nWhile finding evidence of life on another planet would be monumental, it's a tricky business: One that requires diligence and an abundance of evidence to determine, for instance, if a star gives off enough energy or if a planet is close enough to support life, explained Jamie Tayar, an astronomer at the University of Florida, a partner on the Landolt mission.\n\n“There are so many big questions in astronomy: How did we get here? Are there other planets like ours? Do aliens exist?” Tayar said in a statement. “But those are really hard questions, and so to answer them the measurements have to be really good, and they have to be right.”\n\nThe team hopes to launch the \"artificial star\" into orbit by 2029.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Space officials have \"limited readiness to quickly implement needed space missions,\" and methods to keep the public informed about a looming disaster are not fully developed.\n\nOf the participants, from federal agencies like the State Department and international bodies like the U.N.'s Office for Outer Space Affairs, 33% said humanity was not prepared to launch a space mission to prevent an asteroid from impacting the planet, and 19% said \"reconnaissance missions\" were not ready.\n\nKelly Fast, NASA's acting planetary defense officer, said the exercise helped government agencies to plan out how they would work together to prepare for a future asteroid strike.\n\n\"In the unlikely event we ever face a scenario like this, it won't be the first time that anybody's talked about how to treat this,\" she said.\n\nMore:Scientists probe a space mystery: Why do people age faster during space travel?\n\nNASA runs fifth test to gauge asteroid preparedness\n\nThe exercise, designed to test government readiness for an asteroid headed towards Earth, was organized by NASA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency at an April meeting at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, according to a news release. It marked the fifth test to gauge whether authorities are prepared to defend Earth from space. This year's exercise was the first to include \"international collaborators on planetary defense.\"\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario, an asteroid collides with the Earth in 2038. The collision would have a 47% chance of affecting more than 1,000 people, and an 8% chance of affecting more than a million. It could strike a swath of cities across the U.S., Europe, and Africa, including Washington, Dallas, Madrid, and Algiers.\n\nIn the scenario, participants weren't told \"the asteroid’s size, composition, and long-term trajectory,\" according to the news release. Further observations about the asteroid would also hypothetically have to be delayed by at least seven months as the asteroid passed behind the Sun – \"a critical loss of time.\"\n\nEven with years to prepare, agencies would still have to work efficiently to respond to an approaching asteroid, Fast said. \"When you talk about planning a mission, any kind of spacecraft mission, it doesn't happen on a dime,\" she said.\n\n\"Even though 14 years sounds like a long time, it actually might not be when you think of developing missions,\" Fast added.\n\nSpace officials have only one tested method of heading off an asteroid on its way toward Earth – \"kinetic impact,\" or crashing a spacecraft into the asteroid to change its trajectory. In 2022, NASA crashed a spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small \"moonlet\" orbiting the asteroid Didymos around 6.8 million miles from Earth, successfully shortening the moonlet's orbit by 32 minutes, according to NASA.\n\nFast said scientists would need to tailor a space mission to respond to a particular asteroid collision scenario.\n\n\"It all depends on the asteroid,\" she said. \"A single kinetic impactor might work for a smaller asteroid but not for something much larger.\"\n\nSome participants were also skeptical that enough federal funding would be available to deal with the threat, according to the presentation. The decision-making process was \"unclear,\" it said.\n\nAuthorities would also have a limited ability to gather more information about the incoming asteroid by flying a spacecraft close to it, evaluators concluded.\n\nThe presentation also warned that coordinating the release of information to the public about an asteroid flying towards the planet would pose problems. \"Misinformation and disinformation would have to be dealt with,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Maintaining trust at the start of this event is critical and that means talking early – probably earlier than the scientists and lawyers are comfortable with,\" another unnamed participant said.\n\nFast said it would be important to \"turn information into something that is understandable to the public, and not to be overly technical and jargon-y.\"\n\nThe latest exercise, which used data from the test, recommended more tests on the new technology\n\nFast said people should be reassured that scientists and agencies are coming together to map out strategies in the unlikely event of an asteroid collision.\n\nThe scenario was \"just a chance to continue to explore these possibilities and our own readiness, and to identify how we can do better in the future.\"\n\n\"This is actually a good thing, to be talking through this,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/09/spacex-launch-mars-elon-musk-starship/75145498007/", "title": "SpaceX Starship could make uncrewed trip to Mars in 2 years, Musk ...", "text": "The SpaceX mega-rocket has been undergoing a series of uncrewed tests to prepare it for its role in ferrying NASA astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon's surface as early as 2026.\n\nNASA is paying SpaceX a hefty $2.9 billion sum with the expectation that Musk's company will develop an operational spacecraft capable of safely transporting astronauts to the lunar surface.\n\nHumans could be headed to Mars in four years if the vision of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk becomes reality.\n\nMusk took to his social media platform X on Saturday to announce his plans to send an uncrewed Starship to Mars in two years before astronauts head to the Red Planet two years after that.

But before that can happen, space agencies like NASA need to ensure that the right conditions exist on Earth's sole natural satellite to establish lunar settlements.\n\nAnd one crucial component to make outposts on the moon feasible? The presence of water.\n\nFor years, NASA had been developing and preparing a rover designed to find and study water ice on the moon's mysterious south pole, where the substance is thought to be abundant. The half-billion dollar price tag for its Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, was thought to be well worth the investment to essentially conduct reconnaissance ahead of future crewed missions.\n\nThen in July, the unexpected happened: $450 million and multiple delays later, NASA scuttled the VIPER launch altogether.\n\nIn a press release, the U.S. space agency promised it was still dedicated to exploring the moon as part of its ambitious Artemis campaign – NASA's first lunar program since the Apollo era. But the setback came as China, a major lunar competitor, seeks to become a dominant spacefaring force in its own right.\n\nLast month, Chinese scientists analyzed soil samples that the nation's lunar probe brought back in 2020 to find water and other minerals in the soil – a potentially groundbreaking discovery that could have implications for lunar habitation.\n\nHere's what to know about the international race to study water on the moon ahead of crewed lunar missions.\n\nStudying the moon:What sustains the lunar exosphere? Being 'bombarded' by meteorites, study says\n\nWhat to know about NASA's VIPER\n\nSpace agencies across the world view the moon as a valuable destination due to the resources it provides to aid further deep space exploration.\n\nFor the United States, American astronauts have not set foot on the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972. NASA's Artemis program hopes to return the nation back to the lunar surface in order to establish a base of operations ahead of crewed trips to Mars.\n\nThe water ice thought to be present in the unexplored lunar south pole, where NASA plans to one day land its astronauts, would not only help sustain them on the surface, but it also would be a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel.\n\nAhead of those crewed missions, NASA had planned to send its robotic VIPER on a 100-day mission to explore the moon's south pole to locate, record and map images of water ice.\n\nVIPER was originally targeted for launch in late 2023, but the mission was first pushed back to 2024 before it was once again delayed until 2025. On July 17, NASA decided to cancel VIPER's journey due to rising costs, delays and potential disruptions to other commercial payload missions to the moon.\n\nIn a move protesting the decision, the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization promoting space exploration, circulated a letter signed by more than 1,000 individuals addressed to more than 200 congressional staffers. Calling NASA's decision \"both unprecedented and indefensible,\" the letter urged Congress to intervene, emphasizing the importance of VIPER for future lunar exploration.\n\nBut before NASA disassembles and reuses VIPER’s parts for other lunar missions, it has offered a chance to revive the rover's hopes of liftoff: Commercial space companies were given the chance to submit proposals to NASA by last Thursday with ideas for how the project could be saved.\n\nMeanwhile, the possibility remains that lawmakers in Washington, D.C. – who have already raised public concerns that China could beat the U.S. back to the moon – could intervene to reverse NASA's decision, CNN reported this week.\n\nChina lunar probe brings back soil samples\n\nAround the same time that NASA closed the door on VIPER, Chinese scientists who analyzed lunar soil samples collected by the nation's Chang’e-5 probe in 2020 unveiled the presence of water.\n\nPublished July 16 in the journal Nature, the findings were the first time that water in its molecular form, H2O, had been found in physical lunar samples.\n\nWhile it may be still too early to tell if the discovery will alter plans for future resource extraction or the location of lunar bases, it was the latest lunar breakthrough for a nation hoping to send its own astronauts to the moon by 2030.\n\nTwo months earlier, China had launched its Chang’e-6 lunar probe as it sought to become the first nation to ever retrieve samples from the far-side of the moon. That ambitious mission comes years after China completed its latest orbital space station, the Tiangong – a rival to the International Space Station, which will in the coming years be retired.\n\nWhat to know about Artemis and US' return to moon\n\nFortunately, VIPER is not the only NASA-led project designed to search out water on the moon ahead of the arrival of astronauts.\n\nFor instance, NASA has hired three companies to create preliminary designs for lunar vehicles that can be driven and can also operate autonomously on the moon's surface to allow for scientific tests and exploration even when astronauts are not there.\n\nNASA is also paying private companies billions of dollars to carry scientific payloads on private robotic landers bound for the moon, one of which –the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment-1 (PRIME-1) – is scheduled to land at the south pole by the end of 2024 to search for water ice.\n\n“The agency has an array of missions planned to look for ice and other resources on the moon over the next five years,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. “Our path forward will make maximum use of the technology and work that went into VIPER.”\n\nArtemis has been mired in delays and controversy as elected officials and other aeronautics experts have expressed concerns about the scope and cost of the ambitious program.\n\nNASA had intended to launch its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon, ahead of a moon landing itself in 2025 for Artemis III. But both Artemis missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues, including a battery flaw on the vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the moon.\n\nIn the meantime, preparations have continued to ensure the program stays on track.\n\nIn mid-March, SpaceX conducted its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket that will one day ferry U.S. astronauts to the moon's surface. NASA had awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its Artemis III mission.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft is gearing up for the first of a series of close encounters with the most volcanic place in the solar system. The Juno spacecraft will fly by Jupiter’s moon Io on Thursday, December 15.\n\nThe maneuver will be one of nine flybys of Io made by Juno over the next year and a half. Two of the encounters will be from a distance of just 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) away from the moon’s surface.\n\nJuno captured a glowing infrared view of Io on July 5 from 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometers) away. The brightest spots in that image correspond with the hottest temperatures on Io, which is home to hundreds of volcanoes — some of which can send lava fountains dozens of miles high.\n\nNASA's Juno mission captured an infrared view of Io in July. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM\n\nScientists will use Juno’s observations of Io to learn more about that network of volcanoes and how its eruptions interact with Jupiter. The moon is constantly tugged by Jupiter’s massive gravitational pull.\n\n“The team is really excited to have Juno’s extended mission include the study of Jupiter’s moons. With each close flyby, we have been able to obtain a wealth of new information,” said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, in a statement.\n\n“Juno sensors are designed to study Jupiter, but we’ve been thrilled at how well they can perform double duty by observing Jupiter’s moons.”\n\nThe spacecraft recently captured a new image of Jupiter’s northernmost cyclone on September 29. Jupiter’s atmosphere is dominated by hundreds of cyclones, and many cluster at the planet’s poles.\n\nJupiter's northernmost cyclone, seen to the right along the bottom edge of image, was captured by Juno.

The spacecraft used its instruments to look beneath the icy crust of both moons and gathered data about Europa’s interior, where a salty ocean is thought to exist.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Explore where the search for life is unfolding in our solar system\n\nThe ice shell that makes up Europa’s surface is between 10 and 15 miles (16 and 24 kilometers) thick, and the ocean it likely sits atop is estimated to be 40 to 100 miles (64 to 161 kilometers) deep.\n\nThe data and images captured by Juno could help inform two separate missions heading to Jupiter’s moons in the next two years: the European Space Agency’s JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and NASA’s Europa Clipper mission.\n\nThe first, expected to launch in April 2023, will spend three years exploring Jupiter and three of its icy moons — Ganymede, Callisto and Europa — in depth. All three moons are thought to have oceans beneath their ice-covered crusts, and scientists want to explore whether Ganymede’s ocean is potentially habitable.\n\nEuropa Clipper will launch in 2024 to perform a dedicated series of 50 flybys around the moon after arriving in 2030. Eventually transitioning from an altitude of 1,700 miles (2,736 kilometers) to just 16 miles (26 kilometers) above the moon’s surface, Europa Clipper may be able to help scientists determine whether an interior ocean truly exists there and if the moon could support life.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/03/06/ceres-dawn-spacecraft-nasa/24485279/", "title": "NASA 'exhilarated' as Dawn orbits mini-planet Ceres", "text": "NASA engineers said Friday they are \"exhilarated\" by the final maneuver in a 7 1/2 year \"celestial dance\" that put the spacecraft Dawn into orbit around the mini-planet Ceres 310 million miles from Earth.\n\nAt 7:39 a.m., EST, as the spacecraft, trailing a beam of blue-green vapor, closed in on the dwarf planet, Ceres \"reached out and tenderly took the newcomer from Earth into its permanent gravitational embrace,\" said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in his Dawn Blog.\n\n\"This beautifully choreographed celestial dance is now a pas de deux,\" he said.\n\nFrom its launch in September, 2007, Dawn has traveled 3.1 billion miles to reach Ceres in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n\"We feel exhilarated,\" said Chris Russell, principal investigator of the mission at UCLA. \"We have much to do over the next year and a half, but we are now on station with ample reserves, and a robust plan to obtain our science objectives.\"\n\nJim Green, the director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, said Dawn's mission \"allows us to look back in time to see how terrestrial planets are put together.\"\n\nThe crucial radio signal that arrived at JPL at 8:36 a.m. EST confirmed that Dawn was healthy and thrusting with its ion engine, the indicator it had entered orbit as planned.\n\n\"Since its discovery in 1801, Ceres was known as a planet, then an asteroid and later a dwarf planet,\" said Rayman. \"Now, after a journey of 3.1 billion miles and 7.5 years, Dawn calls Ceres, home.\"\n\nDawn offered it's own assessment via Twitter: \"Confirmed: I am in orbit around #Ceres.\"\n\nThe spacecraft then almost immediately swung behind the the dark side of the mini-planet and won't be able to deliver images until April.\n\nIts first science orbit will take place April 23 with an altitude of 8,400 miles above Ceres. Its final orbit will take it 230 miles above the surface.\n\nDawn's job is to tell all about Ceres, which was discovered more than 200 years ago but has let slip very little about itself. Does it have polar ice caps? Does it have a liquid ocean? And could it have once harbored – or could it still harbor -- life?\n\nThe planet has been like \"your secretive neighbor. Ceres would tell us nothing,\" said Russell. \"Everything we're seeing was unexpected.\"\n\nAmong the most unexpected sights are the two astonishingly bright spots nestled in a crater on Ceres's surface. Photographed by Dawn's camera Feb. 19, the dots have the experts buzzing with speculation. Maybe a direct hit from an asteroid -- a space rock – excavated some buried ice. Maybe the bright spots are a sheen of minerals deposited by gushing geysers.\n\nThe spots \"are unique in the solar system,\" Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator of the Dawn mission said at a NASA briefing Monday. \"The mystery will be solved, but it's really got us at the edge of our seats.\"\n\nLike the big boys of the solar system, Ceres first took shape some 4-1/2 billion years ago from gas and dust. Unlike the true planets, Ceres froze in a state of arrested development, never growing beyond roughly a third the size of our moon.\n\nCeres \"made it to the last rank before planet,\" says planetary scientist Andy Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, who has studied the body. \"The planets formed out of things that were Ceres-sized.\" Ceres, he says, can teach us what it takes to build an object such as the icy moons adorning some of the solar system's bigger planets.\n\nThough it's not a full-fledged planet, Ceres does merit the consolation title of \"dwarf planet,\" a title awarded to round bodies that, though big, are too small to make everything else get out of their way. Ceres is one of only known five dwarf planets – Pluto is another – and the first to host an orbiting spacecraft.\n\nScientists know that Ceres once had an icy ocean at its core and probably still does. But it's also possible that radioactivity inside the planet melted some of the ice, creating a lake or a sea. Dawn will look for a liquid ocean.\n\nIf it's there, says Dawn science team member Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, that \"raises the question, if water equals life, could life have evolved under the surface of Ceres?\" He and others agree that Ceres may once have been hospitable to life, though it may no longer be so.\n\nJust because Ceres is intriguing doesn't mean it was easy to mount an expedition there. NASA canceled Dawn twice, recalls Russell, one of the mission's founders. One cancelation came on Christmas Eve; Russell learned about the second cancelation at his mother's funeral.\n\nAfter finally launching in 2007, the $473-million Dawn made a successful trip to the space rock Vesta before heading to Ceres. But the sailing hasn't always been smooth. Two of the gyroscope-like devices that help point the craft in the right direction have failed. Radioactive particles zapped the ship, triggering a cascade of problems.\n\nInventive engineering got the spacecraft back on its feet, and it's now expected to collect even more data at Ceres than originally planned, Rayman says.\n\nWhen it starts to orbit Ceres, Dawn will become the first spacecraft in history to orbit two extraterrestrial objects, a feat impossible without its high-tech propulsion system. Like the TIE fighters in \"Star Wars,\" Dawn is powered by so-called ion engines, which rely on electrically charged atoms called ions to push the craft ahead. The engines are far more efficient than conventional rocket engines, allowing the spacecraft to cover some 3 billion miles on a very small amount of fuel.\n\nDawn will study Ceres until at least mid-2016. The official end of its mission has not yet been determined. One thing is clear, Raymond said: \"Discoveries lie ahead.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/12/spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-complete-historic-spacewalk/75173651007/", "title": "Polaris Dawn crew make historic commercial spacewalk on SpaceX ...", "text": "The pioneering spacewalk came on the third of the five-day Polaris Dawn mission, which billionaire Jared Isaacman is commanding and helping to fund along with SpaceX.\n\nThe first of three missions under the Polaris Program, the venture is intended to test technology that could one day make SpaceX founder Elon Musk's vision of crewed trips to Mars a reality.\n\nNow that the spacewalk is complete, the Polaris Dawn crew will resume other scientific tests ahead of a planned Sunday landing off the Florida coast.\n\nFor the first time ever, a crew of private spacefarers have pulled off a daring orbital maneuver that until now had been left up to only government astronauts.\n\nIn the predawn hours Thursday, the crew of the Polaris Dawn mission suited up in specially designed SpaceX gear to prepare for the vacuum of space 435 miles above Earth. When billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and SpaceX employee Sarah Gillis exited their SpaceX Dragon capsule, they became the first commercial astronauts to do so.\n\nBecause the Dragon has no airlock, the other two members of the crew, Anna Menon and Scott “Kidd” Poteet, also were exposed to the conditions of space despite remaining in the vehicle.\n\nThe pioneering private spacewalk came on the third day of the five-day Polaris Dawn mission, which Isaacman is commanding and funding along with SpaceX. The first of three missions under the Polaris Program, the venture is intended to test technology that could one day make SpaceX founder Elon Musk's vision of crewed trips to Mars a reality.\n\nWhen the mission launched Tuesday, the SpaceX Dragon capsule bearing the astronauts traveled further into space than any spacecraft has gone in more than 50 years since NASA's Apollo era. The craft also surpassed the height reached by NASA's Gemini 11 in the 1960s, SpaceX said.\n\n“This incredible milestone is all thanks to the hard work of the crew and many SpaceX teams, all focused on a goal of making life multiplanetary,” Stu Keech, vice president of Dragon at SpaceX, said in a statement about the spacewalk.\n\nRewatch Polaris Dawn launch:Video shows SpaceX rocket launch 4-member crew for daring commercial mission\n\nTwo exit SpaceX Dragon for commercial spacewalk\n\nPreparations for the spacewalk began after the astronauts reached orbit Tuesday.\n\nShortly after liftoff, the Dragon's pressure began to slowly lower while oxygen levels inside the cabin increased, helping purge nitrogen from the crew members' bloodstreams. The protocol was to prepare the astronauts for the spacewalk and lower the risk of decompression sickness, SpaceX said.\n\nAfter the spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of about 870 miles, the Dragon was to descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth for the spacewalk itself.\n\nWhen it came time for the maneuver around 6 a.m. Thursday, Isaacman was the first to venture out of the Dragon. As he emerged from the forward hatch, the adventurer and experienced pilot soaked in the stunning view.\n\n\"Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here Earth sure looks like a perfect world,\" Isaacman said as SpaceX ground crews in Hawthorne, California could be heard on the livestream bursting into applause.\n\nGillis followed him shortly afterward, climbing out the “Skywalker” ladder at the top of the capsule to catch her first glimpse of the expanse of space. Gillis, an engineer who oversees astronaut training at SpaceX, would gain invaluable experience to train future astronauts, SpaceX officials have said.\n\nGillis was able to reenter the vehicle and securely latch and close the hatch so the crew could begin repressurizing the cabin.\n\nSpacewalk timeline\n\nHere's a look at how the Polaris Dawn spacewalk unfolded early Thursday:\n\n1:35 a.m.SpaceX announces the spacewalk was delayed from its initial start time at around 2 a.m. and will begin at 5:58 a.m. EDT. A reason for the delay was not given.\n\n5:14 a.m. Crew members climb into their spacesuits to prepare for cabin pressure to lower to that of the vacuum of space. While Isaacman and Gillis test the mobility of the spacesuits outside the capsule, Poteet and Menon remain strapped in their seats monitoring vital support systems.\n\n5:25 a.m. The crew performs communication checks.\n\n5:55 a.m. The crew is ready for seat rotation. The seats will be rotated so the crew has more room to move.\n\n6:00 a.m. The SpaceX suits come complete with a heads-up display, which displays data in the crew members' visors. It shows data such as oxygen and temperature. They have about one hour and 50 minutes to complete the spacewalk. There are now live views from the spacecraft. The crew will have helmet cams, giving people on Earth live views of what the crew is seeing.\n\n6:09 a.m. SpaceX gives the go for the spacewalk. The crew's spacesuits pressurize.\n\n6:12 a.m. The spacewalk begins.\n\n6:22 a.m. The crew finishes final pre-breath operations, a process to avoid decompression sickness.\n\n6:30 a.m. The cabin is vented, which brings Dragon to vacuum. According to SpaceX, it will take eight minutes to match the vacuum of space. For the first time in history, all four crew members will technically be on a spacewalk.\n\n6:50 a.m. Isaacman opens the hatch to venture outside.\n\n7:00 a.m. Isaacman moves back inside to make way for Gillis to exit using the Skywalker.\n\n7:04 a.m. Gillis observes that part of the seal on the hatch popped out, but it can simply be popped in, according to SpaceX.\n\n7:06 a.m. Sarah Gillis is outside testing the spacesuit. SpaceX employees erupt into cheers to see one of their own preform a spacewalk.\n\n7:14 a.m. Gillis was heard saying the seal has bulges again. She pops it back in place and prepares to close the hatch.\n\n7:16 a.m. The Dragon hatch is now closed and sealed so the spacecraft can be pressurized. The process takes about an hour, SpaceX says.\n\n7:30 a.m. Oxygen is added into the cabin. Nitrox (oxygen and nitrogen mixture) will be added to the suits to take the crew out of the suits' pure oxygen environment.\n\n7:40 a.m. The cabin continues to pressurize, and no leaks have been found. The process is slow − as in scuba diving, there must be safety stops when changing to a different pressure so the body is not overexerted.\n\n7:55 a.m. The Dragon has returned to normal pressure, what the astronauts are accustomed to on Earth. That means the crew can now get out of their EVA suits, officially ending the spacewalk.\n\nAll 4 Polaris Dawn astronauts exposed to the vacuum of space\n\nUntil now, spacewalks have come only under the purview of government spacefarers such as NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. What's more, the maneuvers most often take place in craft with airlocks.\n\nBut because the Dragon does not have an airlock, the entire spacecraft had to be depressurized when the hatch was opened, exposing the entire crew to the vacuum of space. For that reason, even mission specialist Menon and pilot Poteet needed to wear EVA suits designed by SpaceX to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\nNot only have spacewalks historically not been commercial endeavors, but those who have taken part have done so in spacesuits regulated by a government space agency.\n\nThis time it is all being done by SpaceX. Gillis and Issacman each spent about 10 minutes outside of the Dragon moving around to test the suit's capabilities, which the rocket company developed for this flight.\n\nAside from providing a launch site at its Kennedy Space Center, NASA is not part of the Polaris Dawn mission. But after the historic spacewalk, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson took to X to congratulate SpaceX and the crew.\n\n\"Today’s success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and NASA's long-term goal to build a vibrant U.S. space economy,\" Nelson said.\n\nWhat is the Polaris Dawn mission?\n\nPolaris Dawn is the first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, all of which are intended to test SpaceX technologies needed to carry humans deep into the cosmos.\n\nIsaacman, founder of internet company Shift4 Payment, is the only member of the Polaris Dawn crew to have been to outer space before. Menon and Gillis are also now not only the the first SpaceX employees to travel to space but have traveled higher than any other women in history.\n\nThe crew has already been testing a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink.\n\nBefore and after the spacewalk, the crew is also conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments – many of which aim to understand the human body's reaction to long spaceflights as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars.\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon will return the Polaris Dawn astronauts to Earth on Sunday, splashing down off the Florida coast.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/04/04/nasa-to-use-rockets-to-study-eclipse-effect/73207582007/", "title": "NASA to use rockets to study eclipse effect on atmosphere | Fact check", "text": "The claim: Three rockets being launched by NASA during eclipse are part of 'sex magic ritual'\n\nA March 28 Instagram video (direct link, archive link) claims something is amiss about a government agency's plan to launch rockets during the upcoming eclipse.\n\n\"Sending a rocket to the moon is really just like a large-scale sex magic ritual,\" the woman says. \"A rocket is just like a giant obelisk.

There is no evidence the rockets are tied to any ritual – sexual, magical or otherwise.\n\nScientists will use rockets to study Earth's atmosphere during eclipse\n\nNASA is planning to launch three rockets during the total solar eclipse that will cross the U.S. on the afternoon of April 8, taking a narrow path across 13 states from Texas to Maine. There is no evidence, though, that the rockets will be part of a \"sex magic ritual\" or lead to \"mass psychosis,\" as the Instagram video claims.\n\nFor starters, the Instagram video describes a \"rocket to the moon,\" but these rockets are expected to reach a maximum altitude of about 260 miles. The moon, on average, is about 238,000 miles from Earth.\n\nAnd the purpose of the rockets is clearly laid out by NASA.\n\nNASA says it will use three sounding rockets to study what happens in the upper atmosphere when sunlight briefly dims over a part of the planet. The rockets will be fired from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia at three different times: 45 minutes before, during and 45 minutes after the eclipse peaks locally.\n\n\"These intervals are important to collect data on how the sun's sudden disappearance affects the ionosphere, creating disturbances that have the potential to interfere with our communications,\" the space agency's website says.\n\nFact check: April 8 solar eclipse totality will last for minutes, not cause 'days of darkness'\n\nThe ionosphere is part of the atmosphere that sits at the edge of space, roughly 50 to 400 miles above the Earth's surface. It reflects and refracts radio signals, and it also affects satellite communications, Aroh Barjatya, the mission's leader and a physicist at Florida's Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said in a news release.\n\n“Understanding the ionosphere and developing models to help us predict disturbances is crucial to making sure our increasingly communication-dependent world operates smoothly,\" Barjatya said.\n\nNASA launched the same rockets during a solar eclipse in October 2023. As a result, scientists observed a \"sharp reduction in the density of charged particles\" as the eclipse passed over the atmosphere.\n\n“We saw the perturbations capable of affecting radio communications in the second and third rockets, but not during the first rocket that was before peak local eclipse,\" Barjatya explained.\n\nNASA plans to livestream the upcoming launch on its YouTube page, and it will also let people watch in person from the facility's visitor center.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nPolitiFact also debunked the claim.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Or will the astronauts have no choice but to wait until February to hitch a ride on a SpaceX Dragon?\n\nThat answer may be coming soon as NASA officials appear poised to finally reveal the Starliner's fate.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson is scheduled to appear for a live news conference at 1 p.m. EDT Saturday from the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, the agency said Thursday. The news conference, which will be televised and livestreamed, will take place about one hour after Nelson will meet behind closed doors with officials at both NASA and Boeing for a flight readiness review.\n\nA rare process in the middle of a mission, the additional review became necessary for flight engineers to determine whether the beleaguered Starliner is capable of safely returning astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams to Earth – or whether the spacecraft will have to undock with no humans aboard.\n\n'Stuck' in space?Starliner astronauts aren't 1st with an extended orbital stay; Frank Rubio's delayed return set record\n\nHow to watch NASA news conference\n\nUnlike more recent Starliner news conferences, which have been geared primarily toward the media, Saturday's event will be made widely public and will feature the NASA administrator himself.\n\nThose interested in watching the news conference have a variety of ways to do so.\n\nThe conference will be streamed on NASA+ and broadcast on NASA Television, which the agency will soon phase out. It can also be watched on the NASA app, the agency’s website and its YouTube channel.\n\nWhat is a flight readiness review?\n\nThe Starliner capsule – built with the intention of running crews and deliveries regularly to the station on behalf of NASA – has always been the preferred transportation for Wilmore and Williams when they eventually make the return journey.\n\nHowever, NASA and Boeing have contingency plans in place to ensure the veteran astronauts – both of whom have been to space twice before – get home one way or another.\n\nFlight readiness reviews are required before every NASA mission is able to commence. In special circumstances, NASA scientists may need to revisit that review process mid-mission, Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said at an Aug. 14 media conference.\n\nEngineering and spaceflight specialists from NASA and Boeing have for the past week or so been collecting and analyzing Starliner data in preparation for the flight readiness review, NASA said Thursday in a blogpost about the mission.\n\nThe news conference will follow the review’s conclusion.\n\nBoeing officials have not taken part in recent news conferences with NASA, and the aerospace company has not issued an update of its own since Aug. 2.\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe beleaguered Starliner was besieged with troubles even before it finally managed to launch June 5 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on its inaugural crewed test flight.\n\nWilmore and Williams were only meant to be aboard the International Space Station for little more than a week before heading back to Earth. But when they made it to the orbital outpost a day after the launch, engineers discovered a slew of helium leaks and problems with the craft's propulsion system that have hampered Starliner's return to Earth.\n\nAmid the scramble to figure out what to do about Starliner, NASA previously made the call to postpone the launch of SpaceX Crew-9.\n\nThat mission had been slated to take off earlier in August for the space station in a routine flight to replace the Crew-8 mission that's been at the outpost since March. But because the four Crew-9 members cannot arrive at the station until the docking port occupied by Starliner is available, that mission won't happen any sooner than Sept. 24, NASA has said.\n\nTo stave off any more delays, Starliner will have to undock by then with or without a crew. Whether four astronauts or two astronauts head up to the International Space Station for the six-month Crew-9 rotation depends on whether Wilmore and Williams are on board Starliner when it departs.\n\nIn the event that Starliner leaves empty and returns to Earth autonomously, Wilmore and Williams would need to have room to hitch a ride home on Feb. 25 on the Dragon once the Crew-9 team completes its shift.\n\nIn the meantime, the astronauts have spent their extended stay working alongside the crew of Expedition 71, performing scientific research and helping to do mainteance on the space station, NASA said.\n\nWhat is the mission of Starliner?\n\nStarliner is intended to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX to make routine trips to space on behalf of NASA.\n\nThe partnership marks a shift in recent years for the U.S. space agency, which has pivoted to paying private companies for missions it once would carry out itself as a way to cut costs. Certifying the Starliner for such missions would provide NASA with a second operational spacecraft to carry astronauts and cargo to the space station after it shelled out billions of dollars to both Boeing and SpaceX to develop the vehicles.\n\nBut Boeing has lagged behind SpaceX, which has already begun reliably transporting astronauts and supplies since 2020 to the space station aboard its Dragon. It remains to be seen whether Starliner could still be certified for crewed rotation missions if the capsule returns without its crew.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

We have no intention of fighting Russia,” Biden said.\n\nEarlier in February, Biden told NBC News he would not consider any scenario that included sending US troops to evacuate Americans in Ukraine.\n\n“There’s not. That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another,” he said.\n\nWhile Biden’s clarification that US troops would not become offensively involved can helpavoid a conflict between the US and Russia, critics pointed out it also made clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that his forces would face fewer obstacles in their invasion.\n\n“Biden diluted our most important source of leverage in this crisis,” Ian Brzezinski, former Pentagon official under President George W. Bush told the New York Times earlier this month.\n\nUS troops are in countries that border Ukraine\n\nA major element of Putin’s invasion is his fear that Ukraine could become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, which was formed after World War II to contain the Soviet Union and has expanded in recent decades to include former Soviet bloc countries.\n\nUkraine borders the NATO member countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. If Russia threatened one of these countries, the US would be required by the agreement to defend them.\n\n“We want to send an unmistakable message, though, that the United States, together with our Allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by the commitments we made to NATO,” Biden said Tuesday.\n\nHe said something similar last week, in remarks from the White House, but he added clearly, “We also will not send troops in to fight in Ukraine, but we will continue to support the Ukrainian people.”\n\nMoving troops within NATO countries\n\nWhile Biden has pledged not to send US troops to Ukraine, the US has sent additional troops and fighter jets to eastern European countries includingPoland and Romania in recent weeks and on Thursday announced the deployment of 7,000 additional troops to Germany.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion and attack on Ukraine, CNN is reporting that the Biden administration is considering moving more US forces already in Europe to countries farther east due to the massive Russian firepower so close to allies, according to a US official familiar with the matter.\n\n“Today we activated NATO’s defense stance that gives our military commanders more authority to move forces and to deploy forces when needed, and of course this can also be elements of the NATO response force,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday. “We are ready, we are adjusting our posture but what we do is defensive, measured, and we don’t seek confrontation. We want to prevent the conflict.”\n\nOpposition to major US involvement\n\nAmericans are wary of US intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to polls taken in the runup to Russia’s invasion.\n\nIn an AP-NORC poll, conducted last Friday through this Monday, just 26% of Americans believed the US should play a major role in the situation between Russia and Ukraine. About half, 52%, said it should play a minor role and another 20% that it should play no role at all.\n\nOne-third of Democrats (32%) and 22% of Republicans wanted the US to play a major role. Independents were most likely to say the US should play no role; 32% felt that way, compared with 22% among Republicans and 14% among Democrats.\n\nIn light of the polling,Biden and American officials would have to be very careful to engage the public before changing the administration’s position on the commitment of US troops.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.\n\nFarsakh said many medics were refusing to evacuate hospitals and abandoned patients, which included the elderly, children, and many wounded civilians.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately confirm the broader evacuation order but the alert could signal an imminent ground offensive. Israel has been bombarding Gaza with airstrikes and on Thursday an airstrike killed at least 45 people in a Gaza refugee camp Thursday, the territory's interior ministry said, potentially stoking global protests a former Hamas leader has called for that have provoked fears among travelers.\n\nMinistry spokesman Eyad Bozum told The Associated Press the late-afternoon airstrike hit the al-Shihab family house at the center of the densely populated Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza, adding that the death toll would probably rise.

Those conditions won't improve until Hamas militants free the approximately 150 hostages captured in the weekend assault, Israel officials said. Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gaza, and Egypt has enforced a blockade. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade, restricting the passage of people and goods in and out of the territory,\n\n“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.\n\nAids organizations are warning of a humanitarian crisis as resources become increasingly scarce, and what's available is hard to access because of airstrikes that have involved 6,000 munitions, according to the Israeli military.\n\n“We can’t flee because anywhere you go, you are bombed,” Khalil Abu Yahia said from a refugee camp in north Gaza. “You need a miracle to survive here.”\n\n$6 billion in unfrozen funds not released to Iran for now\n\nIran, long a financial and military supporter of Hamas but not directly linked so far to Saturday's attacks, won't have access for a while to the $6 billion unfrozen by the U.S. as part of a prisoner exchange last month.\n\nThe U.S. has reached a deal with Qatar, where the funds are held, not to release them for the time being, a U.S. official said Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration has being criticized for the agreement with Iran, which freed five detained Americans, and Hamas' weekend onslaught in Israel has only sharpened Republican rebukes. Administration officials say Iran will only be allowed to spend the money, which is not technically refrozen but inaccessible, for humanitarian needs.\n\n\"Funds from that account are overseen by the Treasury Department, can only be dispensed for humanitarian goods — food, medicine, medical equipment — and never touch Iranian hands,” Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nBlinken meets with Netanyahu in Israel\n\nBlinken expressed U.S. solidarity with Israel, its military operations in Gaza and its goal of destroying the militant Hamas organization during his meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews,\" Blinken said. \"No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or return to the conditions that allowed it to take place.\"\n\nThe war has already claimed over 2,500 lives on both sides. International aid groups warn that the death toll may rise after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity to Gaza.\n\nBlinken said victims from Saturday's attack include citizens from 36 nations. He said Hamas, instead of promoting the well-being of Gazans, rules repressively and funnels resources to \"terror tunnels and rockets.\"\n\nBlinken said the Israeli government shared photos and videos of Hamas' atrocities and called them \"overwhelming.''\n\n\"A baby, an infant, riddled with bullets.

Israel has sought missile interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system, precision-guided munitions and artillery shells. Shipments from Pentagon supplies are expected to be continuous, the official said.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. military continued to build a “massive amount” of firepower in the Middle East this week as a warning to adversaries not to attack Israel, the official said. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and the ships in its strike group are operating in the eastern Mediterranean with intelligence and long-range strike capabilities, the official said. In addition, a squadron of A-10 ground-attack aircraft arrived in the region Thursday.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nAcross US, families wait for news about loved ones in Israel\n\nGillian Kaye awoke Saturday to a nightmare: Her stepson was missing.\n\nSagui Dekel-Chen, 35, was last seen by his family early that morning in Israel when Hamas destroyed his home as part of an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns near the border with Gaza. He lived at kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, two daughters, and 400 others until it was decimated by the militant group, leaving only around 160 people alive and accounted for.\n\n“This is so unfathomable,” said Kaye, a resident of Sarasota, Florida who was traveling when she learned of the assault.\n\nDekel-Chen, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, is among an estimated 130 missing Israelis following the attacks.\n\nAccording to his family, he sent his wife and children to the house’s bomb shelter while he confronted the attackers upstairs. Kaye and her family are urging Americans to write to their representatives in Congress to bolster search and rescue efforts. With no information about her stepson's whereabouts, Kaye said spreading the word is the only course of action.\n\n“We do what needs to get done,” Kaye said. “And what needs to get done is to do everything possible to get Sagui home.”\n\n− Heather Bushman, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nFBI provides expertise in finding hostages\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department has been working with families of missing Americans to locate their loved ones, including those taken hostage. The department offered Israel assistance through the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, Operational Security Division and Laboratory Division.\n\n“These highly trained hostage rescue specialists and other experts stand ready to advise their Israeli counterparts to help locate and bring home missing U.S. citizens,” said Garland, whose ancestors fled religious persecution in Eastern Europe.\n\n“And, as always, we remain focused on the threat terrorism poses to our country,” Garland added.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nA summary of Israel-Hamas war\n\nHamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks since the militant group was formed in 1987. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says Saturday's attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel, the blood enemy of Hamas. The attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nBy land, sea, air and online:How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian enclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since Israel was founded in 1948 and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip. Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem. Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. Prompted by the Holocaust, the UN United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish.\n\nWar quickly broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, leading to Israeli expansion three-quarters of Palestinian mandate territory. Over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N. Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories that had been sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. But Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/15/israel-gaza-humanitarian-assistance/75689575007/", "title": "U.S. warns Israel: Boost humanitarian aid in Gaza or risk military aid", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Biden administration has put Israel on notice that it could risk losing access to U.S. weapons unless it allows more humanitarian aid to flow to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to their counterparts in Israel on Sunday warning that Israel must take steps within the next 30 days to allow more food and other humanitarian assistant into Gaza or face restrictions on U.S. military aid.\n\n\"We are writing now to underscore the U.S. government's deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,\" they wrote, according to a copy of the letter posted by an Axios reporter on X.\n\nThe letter follows a recent drop in humanitarian assistance reaching the people of Gaza, said John Kirby, the White House spokesman on national security issues.\n\nKirby said making sure Palestinians have access to humanitarian assistance “is obviously something we've been very, very concerned about since the beginning of the conflict.”\n\nIsrael-Hamas war:U.S. condemns 'horrifying' Israeli attack that set Palestinian tent encampment ablaze\n\nThe letter was not intended as a threat, Kirby said, but “was simply meant to reiterate the sense of urgency we feel and the seriousness with which we feel it, about the need for an increase, a dramatic increase, in humanitarian assistance.”\n\nThe administration made a similar request for concrete measures to boost humanitarian assistance back in April, Kirby said, “and that letter did receive a constructive response from the Israelis.”\n\nHunger in Gaza:World Food Program director Cindy McCain: parts of Gaza in 'full-blown famine'\n\nThe letter is the clearest ultimatum yet to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government since the Gaza conflict began a year ago, raising the prospect of a shift in Washington's support for Israel.\n\nComing just three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, any cracks in that support could raise the pressure on Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, who has supported Israel’s right to defend itself but also has lamented the scale of human suffering in Gaza.\n\nThe Biden administration appeared to balance its criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza with a strong show of military support by announcing on Sunday – the same day it sent the letter – that it would send U.S. troops and the advanced THAAD anti-missile batteries to Israel.\n\nThe reports come as Israeli forces expand operations into northern Gaza amid ongoing concerns about access to humanitarian aid throughout Gaza and civilians' access to food, water and medicine.\n\nHumanitarian groups have said famine and other desperate conditions have spread across Gaza after a year of war, which was triggered by Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nU.S. forces built a $230 million pier three miles off the Gaza coast last spring to help increase the flow of food and medicine into the war-torn region.

But it could not definitively assess violations occurred, a senior State Department official who requested anonymity to discuss the unclassified document said.\n\nThe report covers the period through late April. It was transmitted to lawmakers on Friday afternoon.\n\nIn the report the Biden administration argued that a lack of U.S. government personnel on the ground and Hamas' penchant for hiding behind civilian populations made it \"difficult to assess or reach conclusive findings onindividual incidents.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, given Israel’s significant reliance on U.S.-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under NSM-20 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instancesinconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,\" the report said.\n\nThe report itself was not expected to force changes but the State Department official said it has allowed the U.S. to go to Israel and ask for specifics. There are still information gaps that the U.S. is pushing Israel to close, the official said.\n\nThe report's release follows several days of delay and a warning from Biden to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. would put an indefinite pause on weapons that have been used in civilian populations.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday afternoon that President Joe Biden was \"aware of the contents\" of the report and was \"fully briefed on it\" but would not say when the commander in chief was read in.\n\nThe State Department missed an original deadline of Wednesday to submit the report to Congress. Biden had pledged to provide an initial report by May 8 on U.S. weapons transfers in a national security memorandum he issued in February. Reports are due once annually after that.\n\nBiden's memo in February called on the secretary of state \"to obtain certain credible and reliable written assurances from foreign governments\" receiving U.S. weapons and pledges his administration will \"provide periodic congressional reports to enable meaningful oversight.\"\n\nThe pledge came amid a push from Democratic lawmakers for the Biden administration to press Israel on the treatment of civilians in Gaza.\n\nIn addition to Israel, the State Department says it \"sought and obtained credible and reliable assurances\" from the governments of Colombia, Iraq, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Ukraine that they were meeting the criteria, too.\n\n\"While in some countries there have been circumstances over the reporting period that raise serious concerns, the (U.S. government) currently assesses the assurances provided by each recipient country to be credible and reliable so as to allow the provision of defense articles covered under NSM-20 to continue,\" the report said.\n\nBiden said Wednesday that he would not send heavy payload bombs, artillery shells and other offensive weapons to Israel that have been used in population centers in Gaza with Netanyahu's government considering a major ground invasion in Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had taken refuge. The southern Gaza city was facing a mass exodus on Friday as the Israeli military and Hamas militants battled on its edges.\n\nHis administration has vowed to continue providing Israel with defensive weapons.\n\nHuman rights experts have accused Israel's military of crossing the line in its war against Hamas. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 34,500 Palestinians have died since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\nAmnesty International assessed in a late April report that Israel had used U.S.-supplied weapons to engage in \"serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and in a manner that is inconsistent with U.S. law and policy.\" The organization called on the Biden administration to suspend the transfer of weapons to Israel over the alleged misuse and denials of humanitarian assistance to civilians.\n\nA former State Department official, who quit last year over concerns the U.S. stance on the Israel-Hamas war, is helping to lead an independent task force. The group sent a report to the Biden administration last month accusing Israel of a \"systematic disregard for fundamental principles of U.S. and international law.\"\n\nState addressed the allegations in its Friday report, writing that while Israel asserts that it has taken steps to protect civilians, human rights groups deemed \"Israeli civilian harm mitigation efforts as inconsistent, ineffective, and inadequate, failing to provide protection to vulnerable civilians who cannot or chose not to relocate.\"\n\n\"While Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,\" the report stated.\n\nThe distribution of humanitarian aid also continues to be a serious problem, the State Department said in a summary of the report's key findings. However, it did not assess that the Israeli government was intentionally fueling the crisis or violating U.S. law.\n\n\"While the U.S. has had deep concerns during the period since October 7 about action and inaction by Israel that contributed significantly to a lack of sustained and predictable delivery of needed assistance at scale, and the overall level reaching Palestinian civilians – while improved – remains insufficient, we do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance within the meaning of section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act,\" the summary said.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, which typically agrees with Biden but has broken with the administration on Israel policy, chided the State Department over the findings in a statement Friday from its president and CEO Patrick Gaspard.\n\n\"It’s hard to believe that the administration sees what’s happening in Gaza yet fails to conclude that Israel has violated the terms for use of American weapons,\" Gaspard said.\n\nSenator Jim Risch, R-Idaho, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee accused Biden's administration of \"trying to have it both ways\" in a statement.\n\n“NSM-20 is aimed squarely at Israel in the near-term, but the additional highly politicized reporting requirements will eventually be aimed at other American allies and partners across the globe, further impeding the delivery of security assistance and undermining our ability to deter China and Russia,\" Risch said.\n\nMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who was behind the push by lawmakers for written assurances, also told reporters the report \"contradicts itself.\" It acknowledges that there is evidence that Israel broke the law but \"the administration ducked all the hard questions\" about whether action is needed, Van Hollen said.\n\n\"If this conduct complies with international standards, God help us all, because that would set a very low bar for what is allowed,\" he added. \"I think what they're trying to do is make clear that they recognize how bad the situation is, but they don't want to have to take any action to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for what's happening.\"\n\nContributing: Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/16/israel-hamas-war-live-updates/71201737007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war updates: US troops told to prepare to deploy", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israeli-Hamas conflict, please see Tuesday's live updates file here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will travel to Israel and Jordan this week in a show of solidarity, and to meet with both Israeli and Arab leadership amid growing concerns over the escalating violence in the Middle East.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken announced Biden's visit ahead of a possible Israeli ground invasion of Gaza aimed at crushing the Hamas militant group. The trip comes a week and half after Hamas' incursion on Israel that has killed over 4,000 on both sides and displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\n\n“He is coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world,” Blinken said.\n\nBlinken had returned to Israel on Monday − his second visit in less than a week − after a whirlwind tour of six Arab states aimed at keeping the war from expanding across the Middle East. Blinken met with Netanyahu, reaffirming U.S. determination to provide Israel whatever is needed to protect its citizens, Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe two also discussed coordination with the U.N. and \"regional partners\" to provide humanitarian aid to civilians as well as the U.S. commitment to the speedy release of hostages, Blinken said. Their meeting was interrupted twice by air raid sirens indicating incoming rockets, prompting them and others to seek shelter in a bunker.\n\nAbout 2,000 U.S. troops have been told to get ready to deploy in anticipation of the ground offensive. The American soldiers would not be sent to Israel but could be assigned to other countries in the region for support roles such as medical assistance or providing security at gate crossings, the Associated Press reported Monday, citing U.S. officials.\n\nLater in the day, Hamas said it's holding 200 to 250 hostages − the upper end is about 50 more than previously believed − and added that it would release the non-Israeli ones when it was feasible. And Hezbollah said its fighters targeted five Israeli posts along the Lebanese border Monday afternoon.\n\nNo spillover:Blinken says Arab leaders don't want spillover from Israel-Hamas war\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Biden was pondering a trip to Israel.

That has left trucks idling at the border with supplies Gazans desperately need.\n\nAs both warring sides continue to launch projectiles at each other, Israel has advised Palestinians in northern Gaza to head south ahead of the ground offensive. But even that hasn't proven entirely safe. At least 12 people were killed and nine were buried in the rubble of a Rafah building that was housing three families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north when it was pulverized by an airstrike, their relatives said.\n\nGriffiths, who is heading to Cairo to participate in the negotiations, said the U.N.’s “overwhelming priority” is to get access to Gaza.\n\n“You cannot ask people to move out of harm’s way without assisting them to do it” by providing safe places and humanitarian aid, which Israel is not currently doing, said Griffiths, who also called for Hamas to immediately release its hostages.\n\nNecessities in short supply in Gaza\n\nPalestinians crowded into hospitals and schools Monday as supplies of food, water and medicine ran low during a tight Israeli blockade of Gaza. Some relief was not far away but still unreachable.\n\nTrucks carrying necessities have waited for days at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt amid negotiations for a cease-fire that would allow them to enter Gaza and allow foreigners to leave. Gaza’s only border link to Egypt was shut down several days ago following Israeli airstrikes, and local media reported another hit at the crossing Monday.\n\n\"The conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory is an awful reminder of how quickly the health of millions of people can be put at risk,\" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a social media post. \"War will bring nothing but destruction and horror.\"\n\nHead of Israeli security agency issues mea culpa\n\nThe head of Israel's domestic security agency took responsibility for the failure to thwart the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught that claimed more than 1,400 lives.\n\n\"We were unable to create enough early warning to prevent the attack,” Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar said in a letter to agency employees. “As the person at the head of the organization, the responsibility for that is on me. There will be time for investigation – now is a time for war.”\n\nShin Bet, which monitors Palestinian extremists, is one of thee major Israeli security agencies along with Mossad and Aman.\n\nAbnormal activity detected in Gaza the night before the massacre prompted Bar to send a small team to the border, not realizing the huge scope of Hamas' planned attack, the Israeli news site Ynet reported.

Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, took a dig at the Biden administration, saying he was \"proud of how quickly we have been able to activate resources and do what the federal government could not – get Floridians and other Americans back home, reunited with their families, free of charge.”\n\nDeSantis said the state also is sending medical supplies, hygiene products, clothing and children’s toys to Israel to help Israelis affected by the war.

A gallon of regular unleaded fell about 12 cents to $3.628 on Friday, according to AAA, a nonprofit federation of motor clubs that tracks fuel costs. The decline comes even as oil rose by about $5 to around $90 per barrel last week. The price of crude, which is refined into gasoline, makes up more than half the price of a gallon of fuel. The cost at the pump is dropping because of lower demand from drivers and less expensive blends of winter gasoline coming into the market, AAA says.\n\n“As long as this war does not spread to include more countries in the region, the effect on the oil market will remain muted,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement.

On Oct. 7, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea. Hamas says the attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nBut Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of Israeli settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel. Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, and the attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, a decade after its founding. Several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/08/biden-hot-mic-moment-underscores-growing-frustration-with-netanyahu/72899225007/", "title": "Biden hot mic moment underscores growing frustration with ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden was captured on a hot mic following Thursday night's State of the Union address saying he's going to need a \"come to Jesus meeting\" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe remark − picked up by a microphone during a conversation with U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. − underscores Biden's growing frustration with Netanyahu amid Israel's war against Hamas as the U.S. works to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nAs Biden stayed in the Capitol to talk to supporters after his address, Bennett told Biden \"great speech\" during a brief conversation before urging the president to \"keep pushing\" for humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\n\"I told him, Bibi, and don't repeat this, 'But you and I are going to have a ‘come to Jesus’ meeting,'\" Biden said, referring to Netanyahu.\n\nMore:'My predecessor,' Laken Riley and Israel: Takeaways from Biden's fiery State of the Union\n\nA White House aide then came to Biden's side and appeared to tell him that he's still mic'd up.\n\n“I’m on a hot mic here. Good. That’s good,\" Biden said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken was standing next to Biden during the conversation.\n\n“You guys eavesdropping on things,” Biden told reporters Friday when about the hot mic remarks before boarding Air Force One on way to Philadelphia.\n\nThe Biden administration has become increasingly at odds with Netanyahu over Israel's refusal to scale back the war in Gaza and its efforts to get humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from progressives and Arab-Americans for his unwavering support of Israel in the months since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech, Biden put Israel on notice, saying it must \"do its part\" to get food and other aid into Gaza, adding that it \"cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip.\" His warning came as Biden announced the U.S. military will launch an emergency mission to build a port on the Gaza coast along the Mediterranean Sea to transport aid into Gaza.\n\nBiden also called it a \"fundamental responsibility\" for Israel to protect innocent civilians in Gaza.\n\nMore:Ready for the general: Biden launches swing-state tour, massive ad buy against Trump\n\nNetanyahu has refused Biden's demand for a two-state solution to the Middle East crisis and has pledged to continue the war in Gaza until Hamas is crushed.\n\nThis week, top White House officials including Vice President Kamala Harris met with Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s wartime Cabinet and centrist political rival of Netanyahu, who did not authorize Gantz's trip to Washington.\n\nThe Biden administration's efforts to secure a six-week pause in Israel's war against Hamas that would include the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza has stalled, lacking support from Hamas.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/03/04/super-tuesday-biden-problems-israel-gaza-2024-election/72792368007/", "title": "Super Tuesday will bring more voter problems for Biden", "text": "There are two ways to look at last Tuesday's Michigan Democratic primary, when 13% of the voters picked \"uncommitted\" over President Joe Biden.\n\nOne: Biden has a serious problem brewing with young progressive voters angry that he has not done more to constrain Israel's military action in Gaza.\n\nTwo: That problem received outsized media attention because there is no real Democratic primary contest to focus on and all those cable news pundits need something to talk about.\n\nBoth are true. And both are likely to continue as voters cast ballots this week on Super Tuesday.\n\nBut we don't know yet if protest votes in a primary Biden can't lose will swing the same way in a general election he could certainly lose to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd Trump may be Biden's best ally in all this, because the one-termer is still rehashing his selective travel ban on Muslims while shrugging off foreign policy challenges as someone else's problem.\n\nThe Gaza issue isn't going away for Biden\n\nProtesters have disrupted Biden speeches at campaign events this year, drawing attention to the five months of violence, death, confusion and hunger as Palestinians are pushed around an increasingly shattered Gaza Strip by Israel's army. The conflict divides Democrats more than Republicans.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday showed Biden tied with Trump at 36% each in a general election rematch, but it also showed a majority of voters who identified as Democrats being less likely to back a candidate proposing more military assistance to Israel in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nThat poll landed on a day when more than 100 Palestinians were killed and more than 700 were wounded while waiting in line for food, in a conflict with a death toll that has surpassed 30,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Hamas.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of University of Virginia's Center for Politics, told me he found news coverage of the Michigan protest vote \"overly dramatic\" and now is watching to see if other states with options for \"uncommitted\" or \"no preference\" see similar impacts.\n\nMichigan as a warning sign:Biden should heed the Gaza protest vote warning in Michigan. It could cost him in November.\n\nThe Michigan effort was well organized, with U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American Democrat from that state, leading the charge.\n\nBiden was slow to shift his rhetoric on what is happening in Gaza but has stepped up criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That came too late in Michigan.\n\n“I think if he had known how Netanyahu was going to handle Gaza, he would have been more careful in his proclamations of support for everything that Netanyahu and Israel did,\" Sabato said.\n\nWill the protest vote carry through to November's general election?\n\n“I don’t think its going to matter a whole lot,\" Sabato said. \"And it's a long time until November and we will have loads of things that happen that change people's minds one way or the other.”\n\nSuper Tuesday could tell us how much voters care\n\nDemocratic voters will cast ballots this week on Super Tuesday in 15 states.\n\nSix of those states offer Democratic primary voters the option like Michigan to choose \"uncommitted/noncommited\" or \"no preference\" instead of Biden.\n\nThat could be another headache for Biden in North Carolina, the only swing-state voting Tuesday. Biden lost North Carolina in 2020 to Trump by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nHe and \"no preference\" are the only two ballot options for Democrats in that state Tuesday. Trump leads Biden by 5.7 percentage points in North Carolina in a general election rematch, according to an average of polling compiled by Real Clear Politics.\n\nAnd North Carolina's Democratic voters have sent a primary message before to an incumbent president. President Barack Obama, seeking a second term in 2012, won 79% of the Democratic primary vote that year. But nearly 21% of those voters chose \"no preference\" instead, the only other option on that ballot.\n\nColorado adds 'noncommitted' to the primary ballot\n\nIn Colorado, Biden faces a \"noncommitted\" backlash after winning that state in 2020 with 55% of the vote. The Colorado Democratic Party chose to add \"noncommitted\" as a primary ballot option, even with an incumbent president seeking a second term.\n\nParty Chair Shad Murib told The Colorado Sun in December, “We aim to provide as many choices as we can to our voters.\"\n\nThe border issue:Fixing the border crisis is bad for Trump and good for Biden. That's the problem.\n\nThe Colorado Palestine Coalition and Denver chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America have launched a campaign to get voters to go \"uncommitted.\"\n\nThey're a little late to the game, compared with Michigan. But they're fired up all the same and calling for Biden's administration to stop pushing for military aid to Israel.\n\n\"Democrats have largely ignored the thousands of us protesting in the streets, emailing and calling their offices, and packing their town halls to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire,\" the activists said on their website. \"Our votes must be earned by immediate and drastic policy changes from the Biden Administration.\"\n\nWas Michigan overhyped or a warning sign? Yes.\n\nMatt Grossmann and David Hopkins co-wrote \"Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats.\"\n\nGrossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University, told me that 13% voting \"uncommitted\" in Michigan was \"enough for a successful protest vote but not necessarily a demonstration of much for the general election.\"\n\nHe smells some media hype \"in an otherwise dud of a presidential primary.\" But there is a political threat to Biden too, he added, with \"plenty of swing Arab American voters who might vote for Trump or a third party in November, but they are mostly people with conservative views on other issues that might be pushed over the edge by Gaza.\"\n\nHopkins, a political science professor at Boston College, said the protest vote could come home to Biden by November.\n\n\"Voters who are sufficiently invested in politics to participate in low-turnout primary elections are very likely to support their party in general elections even if they have this or that objection to the policies of the nominee,\" Hopkins said, while warning that Biden still has to appeal to young progressives and independents who don't care for his Middle East policies. “It seems likely to me that the fall election will be mostly decided by people who aren’t voting in the primaries.”\n\nThe primary season will continue for Biden and Trump\n\nBiden and Trump easily won their Michigan primaries. Biden touted the state's \"diverse coalition\" of voters that helped him defeat Trump there in 2020 and called for more. Trump mocked Biden for losing the city of Dearborn that night to \"uncommitted.\"\n\nThey'll both win their Super Tuesday primaries this week as well. Panels of cable news pundits will talk for hours into the evening, as if any of this is competitive. Primary season just keeps churning along, even though the outcome is certain.\n\nFor Biden's potential supporters who are now critics of his approach to Israel and Gaza, that means more platforms for months to ask just how committed they can be. That's an uncomfortable spot for an incumbent.\n\nBut the critics have to also face an uncomfortable question. If their actions help Trump win, do they think America's foreign policy will improve on this, or any other issue?\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/30/student-protests-israel-gaza-war-live-updates/73509573007/", "title": "University protests updates: Mayor Adams warns 'walk away now'", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on college campus protests against the Israel-Hamas war for Tuesday, April 30. For the latest news on the protests, view our live updates file for Wednesday, May 1.\n\nNEW YORK − Dozens of police in riot gear stormed into a building held by pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University late Tuesday after a tense day that saw Mayor Eric Adams warn that \"outside agitators\" would be removed from campus.\n\nCity police in an armored vehicle used a mechanical ramp to enter Hamilton Hall through a window shortly after 9:30 p.m., as hundreds of protesters below looked on or were arrested by police on the ground. More than a dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators were taken away in zip-tie handcuffs as supporters screamed in outrage.\n\nProtesters described chaos in the occupied building and elsewhere. “We’re trapped in a dorm,” student organizer Mohammad Hemeida wrote in a message to a USA TODAY reporter at the scene. A video he shared depicted police in helmets and nightsticks closing in on protesters. “NYPD barricaded us in with batons,\" he said.\n\nWithin minutes of the assault on the building, Columbia University officials said they had no choice but to request police intervention.\n\n\"We regret that protesters have chosen to escalate the situation through their actions,\" the statement said. \"After the university learned overnight that Hamilton Hall had been occupied, vandalized, and blockaded, we were left with no choice. Columbia public safety personnel were forced out of the building, and a member of our facilities team was threatened. We will not risk the safety of our community or the potential for further escalation.\"\n\nAdams had issued a stern warning earlier in the day that students at an encampment needed to leave right away – and advised their parents to urge them to do so – saying “external actors’’ have taken over the pro-Palestinian protest and must be removed.\n\n“I’ve been saying for days if not weeks now that what should have been a peaceful protest has basically been co-opted by professional outside agitators,’’ said Adams, a former police officer. “Walk away from this situation now. We cannot wait until this situation becomes even more serious. This must end now.\"\n\nColumbia protesters are demanding the school halt investments with companies profiting from Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, and they want amnesty for students and faculty involved in the protest. College campus demonstrations have been fueled by the civilian toll in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have died since the Israeli invasion that followed a Hamas-led attack that killed almost 1,200 people in Israel.\n\nAdams said the right to protest would be protected, but argued the agitators were taking advantage of the demonstrations to \"create discord and division.''\n\nThe American Association of University Professors, Columbia University Chapter, released a statement as crowds and police massed in the area:\n\n\"At this hour, the NYPD is massing on barricaded streets outside the gates of Columbia University. Columbia faculty have spent the day offering our help to defuse the situation on Columbia’s campus and have been rebuffed or ignored,\" the statement said. \"We have been locked out of our campus and have demanded to be allowed back in . . . This is not new. Columbia faculty have attempted for the past two weeks to intervene in the situation, only to be shut out by senior University leadership.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"NYPD presence in our neighborhood endangers our entire community. Armed police entering our campus places students and everyone else on campus at risk.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Tuesday’s clearing of Hamilton Hall at Columbia University and the onslaught of officers came on the 56th anniversary of a police bust of a campus protest against racism and the Vietnam War. The university called in police on April 30, 1968, to clear five buildings occupied by student demonstrators, including Hamilton Hall, according to archives of the student newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator. Nearly 700 students and faculty were arrested, and more than 100 were injured, the Spectator reported.\n\n∎ University of Southern California President Carol Folt had a second meeting with protesters from the encampment on the campus, but no agreement was reached. \"We brought some very specific proposals that would address concerns they had about the endowment, which they have said is one of their most important issues,\" Folt said in a statement Tuesday. \"Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in having me issue a political statement in support of their viewpoint as opposed to coming up with practical solutions to resolve the situation.\"\n\n∎ The University of California, Los Angeles, has \"significantly increased\" security presence near a pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus, Chancellor Gene D. Block said in a statement Tuesday. Block said the university has taken \"several immediate actions\" in response to demonstrations, including adding more law enforcement officers, safety personnel, and student affairs mitigators.\n\n∎ Seventy-nine people were arrested in connection with a protest at the University of Texas, the Travis County sheriff’s office said Tuesday. Seventy-eight of those arrested were charged with criminal trespass, and one person received an additional charge of obstructing a highway or passageway.\n\n∎ Officials at Portland State University in Oregon closed the campus Tuesday citing an \"ongoing incident at library.\" The school asked police to help remove dozens of protesters occupying the building. Last week the university paused seeking or accepting gifts or grants from Boeing pending a review of weapons sales to Israel.\n\n∎ Muslim leaders are condemning police removing the hijab from a woman who was arrested Saturday during demonstrations at Arizona State University, the Arizona Republic reported. The school said it's looking into the incident, which is regarded as a privacy violation for Muslim women.\n\nCity College of New York encampment cleared out by police\n\nThe City College of New York, a university within the City University of New York system, announced Tuesday that it is moving to remote learning starting Wednesday in response to the ongoing pro-Palestinian protests and encampment of demonstrators on the campus.\n\n“This encampment, however, poses significantly different and heightened challenges,” City College President Vince Boudreau said in a statement Tuesday. “Most importantly, this is not primarily a CCNY demonstration, and perhaps not primarily a CUNY demonstration. The significant inclusion of unaffiliated external individuals means that we don’t have established connections to them.”\n\nNYPD officers entered the campus late Tuesday after the university requested that police \"enter the City College campus and take all necessary law enforcement action,\" according to a letter sent to NYPD.\n\nVideos posted on X, formerly Twitter, by NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry showed officers moving into the campus in large numbers and ordering individuals to leave the campus. “If you refuse to leave, you will be placed under arrest,” police warned.\n\nAnother video showed police entering the encampment as demonstrators appeared to form a human chain. Officers also appeared to remove a Palestinian flag from a flagpole on the campus and replace it with a United States flag, according to a video posted by Daughtry.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram late Tuesday, the CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment urged the community to demand justice for “our comrades” and for the administration to meet its demands.\n\n“As for CUNY Administration- we will never forget the levels of violence and brutality you deployed on working class students of color while defending the most horrific of crimes- you chose to be on the side of genocide and violence, we chose to be on the side of liberation and freedom,” the CUNY Gaza Solidarity Encampment said.\n\nNYPD requested to remain on Columbia campus through May 17\n\nColumbia University leaders said they believe that the group that broke into and occupied Hamilton Hall was led by people not affiliated with the university.\n\n\"Sadly, this dangerous decision followed more than a week of what had been productive discussions\" with student protesters, they said. \"The decision to reach out to the NYPD was in response to the actions of the protesters, not the cause they are championing. We have made it clear that the life of campus cannot be endlessly interrupted by protesters who violate the rules and the law.\"\n\nUniversity President Minouche Shafik on Tuesday sent a letter to the NYPD requesting that police remain on campus through at least May 17 to \"maintain order and ensure encampments are not re-established.\"\n\nThroughout the day Tuesday, the city looked poised to intervene. A huge deployment of officers from the New York Police Department’s Strategic Response Group descended just outside the Columbia campus by late afternoon, a clear indication of law enforcement action to come.\n\nBy 9:05 p.m., police had blocked off both sides of Columbia University along Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. On Broadway, police in helmets, batons and zip tie cuffs stood by as streets were at a standstill in both directions. “This is a siege,” a speaker inside campus gates yelled from a megaphone.\n\nA message blared over a loudspeaker around 9:15 p.m., telling people they were unlawfully demonstrating and that they would be arrested if they refused to move. Large swaths of protesters formed lines blocking the fence leading into campus grounds. Within five minutes, police began to make arrests.\n\n'Sparked a national and even international movement'\n\nColumbia alumnus Dylan Stillwood, 43, wore a keffiyeh and stood in the rain near barricades after watching police buses full of detained people leave campus. He said his alma mater’s actions were \"disgusting\" as it called police on students for a second time since April 18, when police arrested over 100 people.\n\nHe had visited the encampment many times in support and described it as peaceful and informative.\n\n“It sparked a national and even international movement,” Stillwood said. “You can’t make a just cause go away through brute force. You can try to make it go away. But at the end of the day, I think something has changed.”\n\nColumbia says it will expel some students, suspend others\n\nColumbia administrators said late Tuesday afternoon they would follow through on plans to suspend some students and expel others as dozens remain in lawn encampments protesting Israel and its war in Gaza while dozens more are occupying Hamilton Hall.\n\nUniversity spokesperson Ben Chang outlined actions taken in the last day, including offering students to clear the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment'' by Monday afternoon or risk suspension. Chang said those who vandalized property, breaking doors and windows in taking over Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, would face expulsion. He also said protesters have created an unsafe and threatening environment for Jewish students and faculty in violation of civil rights laws, as well as a noisy distraction.\n\n“We are following through with the consequences. ... We are taking into account how daily life here has been disrupted,” said Chang, who reaffirmed the university’s commitment to safety as student demonstrators have escalated actions to what he called an “untenable'' level.\n\nColumbia severely restricted access to campus Tuesday after demonstrators seized an academic building and blocked the entrance with a human chain. The school also suspended graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, lead negotiator for Columbia University Apartheid Divest in talks with the administration that have failed to resolve the crisis.\n\n“Yet again, this shows the randomness and the arbitrary measures the university is taking against students,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nClasses canceled at UNC; protesters replace US flag with Palestinian one\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill canceled classes Tuesday afternoon, the last day of instruction in the spring semester, after police responded to a pro-Palestinian protest.\n\nThe school sent out an \"Adverse Conditions'' alert at 3:16 p.m. ET saying \"classes are canceled for the remainder of the day, and non-mandatory operations are suspended.'' Non-essential staff were told not to report for work or otherwise come to campus.\n\nThe student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported student protesters replaced an American flag that flew on a large pole in the university’s Polk Place courtyard with a Palestinian flag, which police later took down.\n\nA university administrator led dozens of police officers to the site of a pro-Palestinian demonstration, where students linked arms and encircled the flagpole, video and photos posted online by the Daily Tar Heel show.\n\nEarlier in the day, dozens of protesters were detained as police began breaking down the \"Triangle Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" after school officials demanded demonstrators remove the tents and leave the area.\n\nNegotiations over occupation have stalled, student group says\n\nThe Columbia University Apartheid Divestment group said Tuesday afternoon that negotiations between administrators and the approximately 60 protesters in a campus building have stalled.\n\nPalestinian students, including a student-appointed negotiator, have been temporarily suspended in the past 12 hours, CUAD said. The group also said Columbia tracked which students swiped into a campus library during a certain timeframe as a way to identify student protesters.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators are worried about the university calling riot police to Hamilton Hall after protesters seized the building overnight, the student group said.\n\nColumbia protesters rally inside and outside gates\n\nHundreds of people rallied outside of Columbia’s shuttered campus gates Tuesday afternoon in support of protesters opposed to the war, near where students are occupying Hamilton Hall. The rally occurred by the only entrance to campus.Inside the gates, a few dozen demonstrators led the rally with megaphones, drums and claps as those outside responded behind police barricades while officers stood watch on Amsterdam Avenue.“We want justice now, you say how,” one speaker chanted, with the crowd replying, “End the siege of Gaza now. End the siege of Columbia now.”At one point, someone waved a large Palestinian flag from the top of Hamilton Hall. The crowd celebrated, and police drones buzzed above.\n\nBarricades, checkpoints, restricted access at Columbia\n\nBlocks surrounding Columbia's campus in Manhattan were a maze of metal barricades Tuesday afternoon as the administration’s closure of campus dragged on.\n\nStudents with dorms on campus asked security guards at checkpoints whether they would be allowed back in if they left, and some faculty members complained they could not access campus Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice officers looked on as a group of pro-Palestinian protesters led rounds of chants outside the school’s ornate gates around 1:30 p.m. A smaller group of counterdemonstrators also held signs denouncing Hamas and calling for Israeli hostages to be released.\n\nUniversity threatens to expel students occupying building\n\nColumbia's administration said Tuesday afternoon its top priority is restoring safety and order on campus. Spokesperson Ben Chang said protesters have chosen to escalate actions to an “untenable situation” by vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows and blocking entrances to Hamilton Hall. The student encampment, in the center of campus, still remained Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“Students occupying the building face expulsion,” he said in an update. “Protesters were informed that their participation in the encampment violated numerous university policies. We gave everyone at the encampment the opportunity to leave peacefully.”\n\nStudents who didn’t commit to terms, which were distributed Monday, are now being suspended. Seniors are ineligible to graduate. Commencement ceremonies are still set for May 15.\n\n“This is about responding to the actions of the protesters, not their cause,” Chang said.\n\nWhite House denounces protest occupations\n\nThe White House on Tuesday condemned the surge in protests that seize and occupy university buildings, which includes not only Columbia but also Cal Poly Humboldt in Northern California, where an occupation was broken up Tuesday.\n\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said the Biden administration was monitoring the escalating protests on U.S. campuses. \"The president believes that forcibly taking over a building on campus is absolutely the wrong approach. That is not an example of peaceful protests,\" Kirby said at a briefing.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement that Biden has always condemned \"repugnant, antisemitic smears and violent rhetoric,\" adding that Biden respects freedom of expression but believes protests must be lawful. \"Forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful, it is wrong. And hate speech and hate symbols have no place in America,\" Bates said.\n\nOrganizers say protesters are peacefully supporting Palestinians and that some Jewish students have joined their movement. But there has been evidence of antisemitic sentiment and even calls to violence among some of the chants and signs, creating a hostile environment that prompted Columbia to offer classes remotely. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained of \"antisemitic mobs'' taking over schools, while Hamas called the demonstrations a \"rejection of the genocide'' of Palestinians.\n\nSchumer rips campus protests that 'veer into criminality'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia during a floor speech Tuesday.\n\n\"Smashing windows with hammers and taking over university buildings is not free speech, it is lawlessness,\" he said. \"Campuses cannot be places of learning and argument and discussion when protests veer into criminality, and those who commit such acts are doing nothing to convince others that their cause is just.\"\n\nHe added it is \"unacceptable\" for students to be targeted for being Jewish or for protests to glorify \"the murderous and hateful Hamas or the violence of Oct. 7.\"\n\nSchumer − the highest-ranking Jewish official in American history − called last month for Israel to hold new elections. It was at the time the sharpest criticism yet from a top Democrat of Netanyahu's government and prompted blowback from Israeli officials and Republican lawmakers.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nEducation secretary: 'What’s happening on our campuses is abhorrent'\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona, speaking at a Senate budget hearing Tuesday morning, condemned reports of antisemitic incidents on college campuses and pointed to his agency’s pending civil rights investigation into Columbia. “What's happening on our campuses is abhorrent,” he said. “Hate has no place on our campuses and I'm very concerned with the reports of antisemitism.”\n\nCardona said the Education Department has more than 100 pending civil rights probes investigating allegations of discrimination, including antisemitic and anti-Muslim harassment.\n\nColumbia, like many schools, will likely settle its civil rights case with the department. In recent days, Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of pulling the university’s federal funding for failing to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. Experts say that’s highly unlikely.\n\n− Zachary Schermele\n\n35 arrested at Northern California university\n\nCal Poly Humboldt in Arcata, California, said Tuesday its campus will be closed until May 10 after law enforcement began \"a series of actions to restore order.\" Two buildings were cleared and secured and 35 people arrested, the school said in a statement. Protesters for more than a week had occupied Siemans Hall, an administrative building that includes the president's office, renaming it \"Intifada Hall.\" The school dismissed freedom of expressions claims of the protesters, calling their actions \"criminal activity.\"\n\n“This is a difficult day, it breaks my heart to see it, and truly nobody wanted to see things come to this,\" school president Tom Jackson said.\n\nThe statement said the school made repeated efforts to resolve the situation and that \"this morning’s enforcement action was determined to be necessary to restore order and to address the lawlessness and dangerous conditions that had developed.\"\n\nIn Lebanon, solidarity with US students\n\nHundreds of students gathered Tuesday at university campuses across Lebanon to protest Israel's war, a movement participants said was inspired by U.S. protests. Students, alumni and other Lebanese gathered at campuses in the capital Beirut and elsewhere waved Palestinian flags and posters demanding their universities boycott companies that do business in Israel.\n\nRayyan Kilani, 21, who is graduating this semester from the American University of Beirut, said students had decided it was worth risking their degrees to show support for the embattled people of Gaza.\n\n\"Looking at the Palestinians in Gaza and students in Gaza that lost their universities, their lives and their families,'' she said. \"A degree would not matter to us as much as a liberated Palestine.\"\n\nJewish leaders call for more aggressive action against antisemitism\n\nJewish leaders on Monday urged Columbia officials to take stronger action against antisemitism on campuses. Kraft Center for Jewish Life hosted a Friday press conference featuring Columbia/Barnard Hillel Lavine Family executive director Brian Cohen, joined by other advocacy group leaders and students from Columbia, Brown University and Rutgers University. Cohen said it was \"sobering and disappointing\" that the events of recent days necessitated the leaders to speak out.\n\n\"The situation we are seeing on our campus and dozens of other campuses around the country stem from decades of decisions by administrators that have slowly eroded campus climate,\" Cohen said. He said students have a right to protest and to say things he does not agree with. But he urged schools to \"uphold your codes of conduct, enforce your rules and hold students who violate them responsible in real and consequential ways.\"\n\nPolice dismantle encampment at University of Utah\n\nPolice dismantled an encampment and dispersed protesters at the University of Utah late Monday after a rally that drew more than 300 people outside an administration building at the campus in Salt Lake City. Officers removed and dismantled about a dozen tents, stashes of water bottles, food and toilet paper as some protesters took down their own tents and drove away, the school said in a statement.\n\n“Utah college campuses around the state are not exempt from the significant unrest that currently exists in our country and world,” said Keith Squires, the school's chief safety officer. “Campuses serve as a stage and forum for not just students, but for members of the community who want their voice to be heard. We honor all voices, but the right to speech on our campus must occur within the confines of state law and campus policies.”\n\nColumbia suspends protesting students:Demonstrators take over university building\n\nWhat are college protests across the US about?\n\nThe student protesters opposed to Israel's military attacks in Gaza say they want their schools to stop funneling endowment money to Israeli companies and other businesses, like weapons manufacturers, that profit from the war in Gaza. In addition to divestment, protesters are calling for a cease-fire, and student governments at some colleges have also passed resolutions in recent weeks calling for an end to academic partnerships with Israel. The protesters also want the U.S. to stop supplying funding and weapons to the war effort.\n\nMore recently, amnesty for students and professors involved in the protests has become an issue. Protesters want protections amid threats of disciplinary action and termination for those participating in demonstrations that violate campus policy or local laws.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen and Minnah Arshad, USA TODAY; Skye Seipp, Austin American-Statesman; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-news-conference/index.html", "title": "Russia 'will move in' to Ukraine, Biden predicts, but 'minor incursion ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday predicted Russia “will move in” to Ukraine, citing existential concerns by the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, even as he acknowledged disunity within NATO over how to respond to a “minor incursion.”\n\nThe candid assessment laid bare the struggle Biden faces in creating meaningful consequences and deterrents for Moscow, which remains closely intertwined economically with the United States’ top European partners.\n\nThe remark elicited near-immediate outcry in Kyiv, where officials have been meeting with Biden’s top diplomat as Russian troops amass on the country’s border. High-level attempts to clean-up the comment soon followed at the White House.\n\nWhile Biden vowed withering economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the frontier, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur.\n\n“It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do,” Biden told reporters at an East Room news conference. “But if they actually do what they’re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine.”\n\nLater, asked to clarify what he meant by “minor incursion,” Biden said he drew the line at “Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters”\n\n“I think that changes everything,” the President said. “But it depends on what he does, to what extent we’ll get total unity on the NATO front.”\n\n“It’s very important that we keep everyone in NATO on the same page. That’s what I’m spending a lot of time doing, and there are differences,” he went on. “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens.”\n\nThe candid assessment of NATO’s divisions – which have been well documented, even as US and Western officials seek to project unity amid the crisis – left Ukrainian officials aghast. One told CNN’s Matthew Chance he was “shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion” and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions.\n\n“This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,” the official added, claiming he’d never heard any nuance like this from the US administration before.\n\n“Kyiv is stunned,” he said, referring to the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe White House sought to explain Biden’s remarks by pointing out a Russian attack in cyberspace or through paramilitary forces would prompt a reciprocal response compared to a scenario where Russian troops move from their positions into Ukraine.\n\n“President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,” press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement following Biden’s marathon news conference.\n\n“President Biden also knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics,” Psaki went on. “And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal, and united response.”\n\nA senior administration official said if Russian military forces tried to take Ukrainian territory by force and violated Ukrainian sovereignty – whether that was a “small portion or a large portion” of land – that would constitute an “invasion” by the Biden administration’s standards and would warrant severe penalties.\n\nAnd while the official acknowledged the US and NATO members likely will not have the “same list” of targets and details matching on every measure, the response would remain “highly unified” and “provide a force multiplier to actions we take.”\n\nBiden’s remarks came as the US entered what officials have deemed a dangerous period, when a Russian invasion could occur at any moment. The President, while acknowledging lingering uncertainty over Putin’s intentions, said Wednesday he believed the Russian leader would soon invade Ukraine.\n\n“I’m not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,” Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world. “He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west.”\n\nBiden’s prediction of an invasion was the firmest acknowledgment to date the United States fully expects Putin to move after amassing 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border.\n\nAfter speaking with Putin twice last month, Biden said he believed his Russian counterpart had a good understanding of the economic sanctions he was preparing to enact.\n\n“He’s never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one,” he said, adding the level of punishment would depend on what Russia’s invasion looks like.\n\nThat includes limiting Russian transactions in US financial institutions – “anything that involves dollar denominations,” Biden said.\n\nThe President warned Russian lives would be lost in an invasion, along with potential Ukrainian casualties.\n\n“The cost of going into Ukraine in terms of physical loss of life for the Russians – they’ll be able to prevail over time but it’s going to be heavy,” he said. “It’s going to be real. It’s going to be consequential. Putin has a stark choice. Either de-escalation or diplomacy. Confrontation and consequences.”\n\n“This is not all just a cake walk for Russia,” he went on. “Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority. And as it relates to Ukraine, they’ll pay a stiff price immediately, near term, medium term and long term if they do it.”\n\nBiden speculated Putin was not seeking “any full-blown war,” but said he did believe he was looking for some type of confrontation: “Do I think he’ll test the west? Test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he’ll pay a serious and dear price for it.”\n\nBiden’s prediction came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday urged Ukrainians to not panic and to “calm down” over fears of a possible Russian invasion.\n\n“All our citizens, especially the elderly, need to understand this: Everyone needs to exhale. Calm down. Don’t run for emergency supplies like buckwheat and matches. To all the media: Remain as the media, not become a source of mass hysteria. Do not help the enemy in the pursuit of hype by reporting daily that war may happen tomorrow! This will definitely not stop it.”\n\n“What is new here? Is this not the reality for the past eight years? Didn’t the invasion begin in 2014? Did the threat of the war emerge just now?” he said.\n\nThe only reason for “panic is that after eight years we are still influenced by this panic,” he added.\n\nZelensky said Russia’s “aim is to weaken Ukraine” in order to force Kyiv to concede to Moscow and “to create such a background that our ‘no’ sounds weaker.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said Moscow is “actively attacking your nerves, not our state. So that you have a constant feeling of panic.”\n\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional reporting Wednesday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/treasury-banks-russia-cyber-meeting/index.html", "title": "US officials prep big banks for potential Russian hacking as ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nOfficials from multiple US agencies met Thursday with executives from big US banks to discuss how they might respond to Russian hacking threats as US officials warn that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time, five people briefed on the meeting told CNN.\n\nThe meeting — which covered how to defend against potential Russia-backed hacking attempts against US financial institutions should the Biden administration sanction Russian entities — shows how US officials continue to see cyberspace as a domain of risk so long as the Ukraine crisis drags on.It comes as other critical infrastructure sectors, such as electric utilities, are on alert for any Russian activity.\n\nThe meeting came as President Joe Biden and his top officials spent the day laying out dire warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops positioned around the Ukrainian border, it was a day that underscored palpable concern that the pathway to a diplomatic off-ramp was growing exceedingly narrow.\n\nBiden said Friday that he was convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine, but emphasized that room for diplomacy remains.\n\nThe administration’s warnings have coincided with efforts to lay the groundwork for an array of sanctions the US and allies have promised would be deployed in the event of Russian military action.\n\nOfficials from the White House, Treasury Department, FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) attended the cybersecurity meeting Thursday, the people familiar with the meeting said. Executives from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which is the only US bank currently operating in Ukraine, were invited.\n\n“We have good insight into Russian capabilities, or those of aligned actors, based on past actions, so we’ve approached this [process] with those in mind,” one US official told CNN.\n\nUS officials such as CISA Director Jen Easterly continue to say there are “no specific credible threats to the US homeland’ stemming from the Russian military’s surrounding Ukraine. But officials are also preaching vigilance and, as CNN reported Monday, asking private executives to lower their thresholds for reporting suspicious digital activity to the government.\n\nAs US officials keep a close eye for any Russian hacking activity on US networks, they moved quickly on Friday to blame Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency for a cyberattack that temporarily blocked access to the websites of Ukrainian banks this week.\n\nThe banking sector got a lesson in the cyber risks that can come with geopolitics in 2012 and 2013, when, following Western sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, Iranian hackers overwhelmed the websites of dozens of US banks with phony traffic, costing tens of millions of dollars in lost business.\n\nThe experience has loomed large in the minds of cybersecurity executives at US financial institutions, which have strengthened their defenses in recent years. Experts consider the financial and electric sectors two of the more mature in its cyber defenses.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday’s meeting. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup declined to comment.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN that the White House and federal agencies have been preparing since November for “any potential disruptions to our critical infrastructure and possible impacts to individuals and communities.”\n\n‘Tabletop exercises’\n\nThe potential cyber threat has also featured in so-called “tabletop” exercises that have taken place inside the administration in recent months, as officials across the government have met to game out response possibilities that come with Russian escalation and potential invasion.\n\n“We have created a process for agencies to quickly assess the impact of cyber [and] physical incidents and to inform the White House of the same,” the official added.\n\nOne tipping point that could trigger Russia-backed hacking against US organizations is if the Biden administration imposes the “swift and severe” sanctions that officials have been promising if Russia further invades Ukraine.\n\nUS officials have sought input on potential market effects of any new sanctions, which officials have suggested would go further than any package prior, with potential targets ranging from financial institutions and networks to export controls designed to impair critical Russian economic sectors reliant on American software and equipment.\n\nAs tensions in the last several days have ratcheted up to their highest level yet, the tempo of the work to plan for what may occur in the wake of sanctions being put into place, already at a high level, has also increased, one official said.\n\nGrid regulator tells utilities to be at ‘highest possible level’ of preparedness\n\nFederal officials and executives from key sectors like banking and energy have been keeping a close eye on any potential spillover effects from US-Russia tensions over Ukraine. Those preparations included an Energy Department briefing on the history of Russian cyber capabilities in December for America’s largest utilities, and a previous classified briefing from Treasury for big banks, CNN previously reported.\n\nNorth American electric utilities should be at their “highest possible level” of preparedness for “potential Russia-linked cyber and disinformation activity” in light of US-Russia tensions over Ukraine, the North American grid regulator said in an advisory to the power sector this week obtained by CNN.\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) – a not-for-profit regulatory authority backed by the US and Canadian governments – said it was unaware of a “specific, credible threat to the North American electricity industry from Russia [or associated threat actors].”\n\nBut the regulator said it was making a “proactive recommendation” for the electric industry to be vigilant for any anomalous cyber activity.\n\n“During these heightened tensions, NERC recommends that entities adopt the highest possible security posture for their most critical system assets and have response, mitigation, and staffing plans in place for this escalating conflict,” NERC said.\n\nNERC regularly tracks various cyber threats and communicates with utilities about them.\n\nThe electric sector has also in the last year deployed additional threat-detection tools on the more sensitive industrial control systems that help deliver power as part of a US government-backed initiative.\n\n“If one of us gets punched in the face, all of us know about it,” said Robert M. Lee, CEO of industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos, of the greater visibility of threats in the sector.\n\nUS electric utilities and officials have also carefully studied cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 that cut power in parts of Ukraine, and which the Justice Department later blamed on Russia’s GRU.\n\nThe Department of Energy and the Pentagon’s research arm have in recent years hosted a series of drills for US grid operators to drill for mock cyberattacks modeled after the Ukrainian incident.\n\nPatrick C. Miller, the CEO and owner of Oregon-based Ampere Industrial Security, said the NERC alert was in that spirit of preparing for advanced cyberattacks.\n\nThe Ukraine cyberattacks in 2015 and 2016 “established the fact that power systems” are now fair game for adversaries, Miller told CNN.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas Phil Mattingly", "Sean Lyngaas", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}]}

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/29/artemis-1-oregon-abortion-taylor-swift-daily-briefing-monday/7902342001/", "title": "Artemis 1, Oregon, abortion, Taylor Swift: Daily Briefing Monday", "text": "NASA's new moon rocket was set to launch this morning – but setbacks stopped the operation.

The next launch attempt will not take place until Friday at the earliest. The 322-foot Space Launch System rocket was set to lift off Monday morning with three test dummies aboard on its first flight, a mission to propel a capsule into orbit around the moon. The shakedown flight, when it happens, will be a big step forward in America’s quest to put astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program 50 years ago. NASA hopes to send four astronauts around the moon in 2024 and land humans there as early as 2025.

Democrats want a unifier, Republicans want a fighter\n\nIt's not just that Democratic and Republican voters disagree about who should be the next president. A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds they also have different visions of the crucial characteristics needed for the job. Democratic voters say they want most of all a unifier who will focus on bringing the country together and finding compromises, while Republican voters value first and foremost a fighter who will battle on behalf of \"the freedom and dignity of all Americans.\" Partisans on both sides do want this: a nominee who can win.

The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a \"revolution\" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights.\n\nThe year that followed was no less dramatic.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans.\n\nInevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history.\n\nBut there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family.\n\nIn the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long.\n\nAfter another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.\n\nAlabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence\n\nThe eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate.\n\nThe Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its \"post-Weinstein moment,\" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that.\n\nAlaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord\n\nIn 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring.\n\nArizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal\n\nIt was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare with a dramatic \"thumbs down.\" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill.\n\nArkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours\n\nAfter years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement.\n\nCalifornia: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride\n\nRoyal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year.\n\nColorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections\n\nIn 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year.\n\nConnecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far?\n\nIn late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel \"Jazzy\" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing \"racial that motivated\" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along.\n\nDelaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president\n\nHad he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet.\n\nFlorida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast\n\nHurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators.\n\nGeorgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable\n\nAtlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach.\n\nHawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise\n\nThe Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date.\n\nIdaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base\n\nSgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, \"a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.\"\n\nIllinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing\n\nThe dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to \"conceal the true facts\" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. \"These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'\" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges.\n\nIndiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails\n\nWhen an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis.\n\nIowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world\n\nThe new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: \"Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game.\" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. \"Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,\" she said.\n\nKansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials\n\nA team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April.\n\nKentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar\n\nOn April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired.\n\nLouisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting\n\nWith two words, \"I'm back,\" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. \"You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House.\"\n\nMaine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy\n\nJacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19.\n\nMaryland: The day the NFL took a knee\n\nNFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nMassachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide\n\n\"You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it.\" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent.\n\nMichigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell\n\nSoundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year.\n\nMinnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard\n\nDemocratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of \"inappropriate behavior.\"\n\nMississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life\n\nUp to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains.\n\nMissouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral\n\nAbby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying.\n\nMontana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists\n\nThe first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with \"alternative facts\" and being labeled the \"enemy of the American people\" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam.\n\nNebraska: Sasse sasses Trump\n\nIt's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was \"recanting\" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" saying \"it's beneath the dignity of your office.\" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nNevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade\n\nOn Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016.\n\nNew Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims?\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State.\n\nNew Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate'\n\nJust before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to \"get the hell off the beach!\" A few weeks before \"beachgate,\" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach.\n\nNew Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time\n\nThe plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early.\n\nNew York: Terror in NYC\n\nIt was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, \"What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next?\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: \"He who controls redistricting can control Congress.\" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications.\n\nNorth Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy\n\nAfter months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise.\n\nOhio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea\n\nThe death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed \"Little Rocket Man,\" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nOklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter\n\n\"Hands up, don't shoot,\" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher \"looks like a bad dude.\" Crutcher's twin sister later said, \"That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son.\" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department.\n\nOregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation\n\nFor the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path.\n\nPennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die\n\nThe horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents.\n\nRhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election\n\nDespite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia.\n\nSouth Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities.\n\nSouth Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist\n\nResearchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries.\n\nTennessee: Tuition-free community college\n\nTennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit.\n\nTexas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard\n\nHurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest.\"\n\nUtah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood\n\nA Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs \"this is crazy.\" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.\n\nVermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor\n\nEthan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. \"We elected our oldest president ever,\" Sonneborn said, \"and he tweets like a kindergartner.\" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an \"unprecedented disaster.\" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue.\n\nVirginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville\n\nIt's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a \"Unite the Right\" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists.\n\nWashington: Amazon's new dome home\n\nAmazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will \"round\" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green \"bird's nest\" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year.\n\nWest Virginia: Coal country digs Trump\n\nWest Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to \"war on beautiful clean coal.\"\n\nWisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze\n\nAbbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned.\n\nWyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash\n\nThis year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance\n\nHome to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March.\n\nPuerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump\n\nHurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called \"inadequate.\" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had \"poor leadership ability.\" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid.\n\nGuam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam\n\nThe predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes\n\nBefore Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRemember when?\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

The carriage and the trailer it was on were found Monday behind a home about 20 miles from the church in Brighton where it was taken, al.com reported. Brighton Police Chief Larry Woods told the news site multiple people are in custody in connection with the theft. The owner of the carriage, Frank Tate, said it was valued at more than $15,000. His company, Magic Tours, provides carriages for funerals, downtown Birmingham tours and other special occasions. Tate told al.com he left the carriage in the parking lot of St. Mark AME Church to pick up horses. He planned to use it later on Saturday to take a family to a funeral, but when he returned about 9 a.m., it was gone. He said the carriage would be hard to hide. “It’s a distinctive carriage,’’ Tate said. “Nobody else around here has carriages.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. prosecutors have charged three men with leaving a special viewing platform and getting too close to bears in Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve. The U.S. attorney’s office filed charges last week in the August 2018 incident. Spokesperson Lisa Houghton said the office doesn’t discuss the timing of cases. “Every case is unique, and it takes varying amounts of time to bring forth criminal charges,” she said by email. The remote park on the northern Alaska Peninsula protects some of the highest densities of bears in the world and requires visitors to abide by special rules. Mature male brown bears at Katmai can weigh up to 900 pounds, the park said. The charges alleged the men entered a closed area of the park by leaving an authorized viewing area and wading into the Brooks River when bears were feeding on salmon in the nearby falls. The U.S. attorney’s office said two of the men are from Alaska and one is from New Mexico. An online court records system did not show attorneys for the men who could comment on their behalf.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed former television broadcaster Kari Lake in the Republican race for governor. Trump retains a strong following among many Republicans and his endorsement catapults the former news anchor into clear front-runner status in the crowded GOP primary field. Lake is a political newcomer who left her job in March and launched her bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 2022 in June. She had been widely seen as a possible candidate and has criticized a media landscape that she contends needs more balance.Trump announced his endorsement via email because he remains banned from Twitter and other social media sites following the Jan. 6 incidents at the U.S. Capitol. He said Lake is strong on crime, the border and supports gun rights. He also took a shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who is term-limited. Using the expression for “Republican in name only,” Trump said “she will do a far better job than RINO Governor Doug Ducey.” Ducey certified President Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona over Trump last year despite pressure from the former president to overturn the election results.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he allowed the state’s public health emergency for the coronavirus pandemic to end, saying he didn’t need any additional powers to respond to it. Hutchinson told reporters he didn’t seek an extension from the Legislature for the emergency, which expired Monday. But Hutchinson cautioned that the state is still feeling the effects of COVID-19, which the Health Department on Tuesday said had claimed another 21 lives in the state. “I need to emphasize that we are still in a pandemic. We still have 20 plus people dying every day because of COVID,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news conference. “Just because the technical emergency was not extended does not mean we’re not still in a very serious situation with the pandemic and the actions we need to take.” Arkansas lifted most of its virus restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate, and ended its emergency declaration last spring. But Hutchinson in July reinstated the emergency as the state saw a surge in cases due to the delta variant of the virus. The Health Department said the state’s death toll from COVID-19 now totals 7,651. The state reported its cases rose by 800 to 493,920 total since the pandemic began.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State Treasurer Fiona Ma repeatedly shared hotel rooms with employees, a practice she said saved money but that business experts contend crosses an ethical line and can lead to lawsuits like one Ma now faces, the Sacramento Bee reported Tuesday. Judith Blackwell, the former head of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, sued Ma in July, alleging sexual harassment, racial discrimination and wrongful termination. Ma said the allegations are without merit. Records obtained by the Bee show Ma shared a hotel room with her chief of staff, Genevieve Jopanda, 13 times over two years. She also stayed with four other aides at a three-bedroom property on a trip. There’s no policy in the state’s human resources manual on whether managers and staff can share hotel rooms. Ma said her work as state treasurer frequently requires her and aides to travel across the state and that the hotel rooms were shared to save money.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverthorne: The residents of several hundred homes have been evacuated or warned to be ready to leave because of a wildfire burning in Colorado’s north-central mountains. Evacuations were first ordered Monday night near Silverthorne shortly after the fire was reported on U.S. Forest Service land. The Ptarmigan Fire was burning on about 60 acres around midday Tuesday, after growing about 40 acres overnight, an amount which surprised officials, Dillon District Ranger Adam Bianchi said, the Summit Daily News reported. Air tankers and a helicopter were initially used to try to slow the fire’s growth and prevent it from moving downhill toward residential areas because it was considered too dangerous to send in firefighters on the ground. Officials have some hope that forecasted cooler weather in the mountains, where it has been dropping below freezing at night, and possible rain and snow in the coming days will also help.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate voted Tuesday to extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency powers for the sixth time during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite pushback from Republican lawmakers who argued the state is no longer in crisis. “It all needs to end,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “No one can deny that there’s no public health emergency and that individual, local and legislative powers must be restored.” Yet Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said state legislators have a “much stronger reason” to extend the public health and civil preparedness emergencies than back in July, the last time Lamont’s powers were extended until Sept. 30. He noted how the state’s COVID positivity rate and number of hospitalizations have increased since then because of the delta variant. The resolution to extend the governor’s powers until Feb. 15 passed 18-15 on Tuesday with two Democrats joining the Republicans in opposition. Three senators were absent. The vote came day after the House of Representatives voted 80-60 in favor of extending Lamont’s renewed declaration of public health and civil preparedness emergencies until early February, when the General Assembly’s regular legislative session is scheduled to open. Democrats control both chambers.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: All teachers and school staff in Delaware will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. The requirement announced by Carney, the Division of Public Health and Department of Education will be formally issued by emergency regulation and takes effect Nov. 1. The requirement also applies to contractors and volunteers who work in K-12 public and private schools. The top priority has been to get all students back in school this fall and the mandate will help minimize disruptions, Carney said in a statement. “There’s no better way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and keep all Delaware children in their classrooms, than to get vaccinated,” Carney said. “These vaccines are safe and extremely protective against COVID-19 infection and serious illness. I encourage all Delawareans to get your shot and help us finally put an end to this pandemic.” The Delaware State Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, supports the decision and urges members to get vaccinated, according to a statement from President Stephanie Ingram. The union’s goal is to keep educators and students in school while protecting their health, Ingram said. Since some have concerns about the vaccine, weekly testing is a “reasonable alternative,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The city’s new Planet Word museum is being lauded for its lavatories, WUSA-TV reported. Cintas, the cleaning product and services company, selected 10 places across the country for the cleanest, most innovative commodes, and Planet Word is among the finalists. “Planet Word is flush with bathroom humor,” said founder Ann Friedman, reading a slogan from one of the walls. She has a bit of a potty mouth. “Here’s our take on Shakespeare. ‘Farting is such sweet sorrow,’” she said, opening a stall and revealing the slogan painted behind a porcelain throne.The toilets on the second floor of the downtown museum are ripe with ribald literary references. “To pee or not to pee, that is the question,” is emblazoned in another stall. Then there’s “If at first you don’t succeed, flush, flush again.” and “I stink, therefore I am.” The museum has five floors, with restrooms on each, each with its own theme. “Here we have euphemisms for No. 1 and No. 2,” she said on the main floor. They include: “Take a whiz”...and others maybe we shouldn’t mention. Even Friedman’s a little embarrassed by some of the bathroom humor. Although when she was looking for donors, the phrase, “Take the Browns to the Super Bowl,” may have helped her close the deal with a guy from Ohio.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A group of South Florida businessmen sued the federal government Monday in hopes of overturning a gambling agreement Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed with the Seminole Tribe. The suit filed against the Department of the Interior in federal court in Washington claims the agreement illegally expands gambling in Florida. Among the plaintiffs are developer Armando Codina and car dealer Norman Braman. The department approved the deal in August. It allows the Seminole Tribe to operate sports betting and add roulette and craps to its seven Florida casinos, with the state potentially receiving $20 billion over the next 30 years. But the lawsuit claimed that the state constitution requires voters approve an expansion of gambling. The state Legislature approved the deal in May. It is the second suit filed challenging the gambling compact.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Logistics company Radial Inc. plans to hire 4,000 entry-level workers outside Atlanta this year ahead of the busy holiday season, the company announced Tuesday. The new employees will work out of two Atlanta-area fulfillment centers – one in Locust Grove and one in Buford – to process online orders from various different brands, Radial said in a news release. The company then plans to promote more than one-third of the seasonal employees to full-time positions, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. According to the statement, research conducted by Radial shows that 65% of shoppers plan to spend either increased or similar amounts of money on online purchases this year compared to 2020. The site director of the Locust Grove fulfillment center, Eric Narvaez, did not disclose how much the positions would be paid but said the pay would be similar to that of other large companies like Home Depot and Amazon, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. regulators on Tuesday banned swimming with Hawaii’s spinner dolphins to protect the nocturnal animals from people seeking close encounters with the playful species. Swimming with dolphins is a popular tourist activity in Hawaii. Several companies offer tours that take swimmers to areas frequented by dolphins with the aim of giving them an opportunity to get in the water with the animals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule under the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits swimming with or getting within 50 yards of a spinner dolphin that is within 2 nautical miles of the shore of the main Hawaiian Islands. The rule applies to boats, canoes, stand-up paddleboards, drones or other objects. NOAA also is proposing a regulation that would prohibit entering certain areas between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. in parts of the Big Island and Maui that are considered essential daytime habitats for spinner dolphins. Spinner dolphins hunt in offshore waters at night. During the day, they use areas close to shore that have optimal environmental conditions to socialize, nurture their young, hide from predators and rest in preparation for nightly hunting. Hawaii’s spinner dolphins get their name from their habit of leaping in the air and spinning around. Some scientists say such behavior is not always playfulness and can instead be an attempt to alert others to danger.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Schools should set up confidential tip lines that can be used by students and others to report concerning behavior as a way to prevent school shootings, a report reviewing an eastern Idaho school shooting said. That’s one of 29 recommendations in the report released Monday by the Idaho State Board of Education following a school shooting at Rigby Middle School in May. Authorities said a sixth grade girl injured two other students and a custodian after pulling a handgun from her backpack and firing multiple rounds inside and outside the school. She was ultimately disarmed by a teacher. The report said students saw behavioral changes in the accused attacker, but that didn’t come to light until after the shooting. The report, made by the School Safety and Security Program, noted that the behavior change was not apparent to school staff because the girl was in her first year at Rigby Middle School after moving up from elementary school. The same school had another incident last week when authorities said a 13-year-old girl brought a gun to school, but was disarmed by a school resource officer in the bathroom, and no one was injured. Immediately after that incident, Jefferson School District Superintendent Chad Martin banned backpacks at two middle schools and two high schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After five years of legal fights, gentrification concerns and a federal review, Barack and Michelle Obama dug shovels into the ground Tuesday during a celebratory groundbreaking on the Obama Presidential Center. Construction on the center along Lake Michigan, near the Obama family home and where the former president started his political career on Chicago’s South Side, officially began last month. Standing near an excavator and other heavy equipment, Obama described how the city’s South Side shaped him, first as a community organizer, then as a husband, father and elected official. He said the center was one way of giving back and he hoped it would bring an economic boost to the area and inspire a future generation of leaders. “We want this center to be more than a static museum or a source of archival research. It won’t just be a collection of campaign memorabilia or Michelle’s ballgowns, although I know everybody will come see those,” he joked. “It won’t just be an exercise in nostalgia or looking backwards. We want to look forward.” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and several city aldermen were among the few people allowed at the event, which was streamed online to limit crowds amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The presidential center will sit on 19 acres of the 540-acre of Jackson Park, named for the nation’s seventh president, Andrew Jackson.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: A historical marker has been dedicated in western Indiana in remembrance of a Black man lynched about 120 years ago by a white mob. George Ward’s descendants, Terre Haute residents and Mayor Duke Bennett were among those at Sunday’s ceremony in Fairbanks Park, the (Terre Haute) Tribune-Star reported. George Ward was arrested in 1901 in the slaying of a white teacher, Ida Finkelstein. The mob took him from the Vigo County Jail and struck him in the head with a sledgehammer, said Terry Ward, adding that the attackers grabbed his great-grandfather along a bridge and bystanders pelted him with sticks. “Imagine the pain and the fear and no one comes to your aid,” Terry Ward told those at the dedication. George Ward then was hanged from a former wagon bridge. His body later was cut down and burned. “George Ward was denied due process for a crime for which he was accused,” Terry Ward said. “He was killed by a mob that acted as judge, jury and executioner.” The dedication was part of the national Community Remembrance Project, which recognizes lynching victims.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The longtime president of the Des Moines police officers’ union sent explicit photos to four female colleagues but retired before he could face discipline and wasn’t criminally charged, the city confirmed late Tuesday. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, four Des Moines Police Department employees alleged that they were sent unsolicited photos by Des Moines Police Bargaining Unit Association President Stew Barnes in 2019 and 2020, including many of himself naked. The department let Barnes, 61, retire in August 2020 with full benefits despite “overwhelming evidence” of his harassment of co-workers and employees of a tanning salon and a credit union, the lawsuit claimed. Department leaders recognized him at a retirement banquet in October 2020. Iowa law allows the state pension system to deny retirement benefits to members who are not “in good standing,” including those who face pending disciplinary proceedings for misconduct. The lawsuit argued that Barnes should have been disqualified from benefits and faced a criminal investigation, alleging he was using police resources “to find and stalk women” and that his victims were ready to cooperate. A statement through the city manager’s office defended the department and the city’s handling of the internal investigation but did not explain the lack of a criminal investigation. Barnes confirmed to have sent the inappropriate photos and resigned his job before the inquiry concluded, the statement said. Police Chief Dana Wingert later determined the misconduct occurred and that it would have been a fireable offense.\n\nKansas\n\nSanta Fe:John Freeman Colt, a convicted sex offender who escaped June 30 from Larned State Hospital, was captured Monday night in Wayne County, Utah. Colt’s arrest came after residents recognized him from a wanted poster they saw on TV and contacted the U.S. Marshals Service and the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office, the marshals service said in a news release Tuesday. “As sheriff’s deputies were staging in a parking lot near the target house, they saw Colt roll by on his blue motorcycle and gave chase,” the marshals service said. “Colt eventually decided to give up.” Colt was being held Tuesday in Utah awaiting his return to Kansas, according to the news release.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State police said new regional driver testing branches have been created in Madisonville and Owensboro. The Madisonville office serves Caldwell, Crittenden, Hopkins, McLean, Muhlenberg and Webster counties, and the Owensboro site is for residents of Daviess, Hancock, and Ohio counties. Gov. Andy Beshear said the regional testing locations offer more efficient services. Driver testing was offered starting Monday in both locations. Appointments can be made online and are available Monday through Friday at the state police website. Appointments are required for a permit, driver’s license or commercial driver’s license test. Officials are working to open the remaining regional offices statewide by June 30.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Five people were injured in an explosion at a chemical plant, news outlets reported. The explosion at the Westlake petrochemical plant near Lake Charles was reported late Monday night, Louisiana State Police spokesman Derek Senegal said. He said five workers were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not immediately known. A fire at the site is now out, and the cause of the blast is under investigation. KPLC-TV reported that the unit where the explosion occurred is used in the production of ethylene and was undergoing maintenance at the time.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The owner of four hydroelectric dams on the Kennebec River sued two Maine agencies alleging they improperly cooperated on fish passage regulations that impact the future of the dams and fish populations. The lawsuit filed in Kennebec Superior Court is the latest brought by Brookfield Renewable Power, a subsidiary of a large Canadian company that owns many of the dams in the state, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lawsuit contended the Department of Marine Resources improperly helped the Department of Environmental Protection draft fish passage policies, claiming that the cooperation between state agencies violates a 1993 settlement between the dams’ then-owners, environmental groups and state and federal bodies. The company argued under that settlement, disputes about fish passage standards related to the dams must be resolved through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which licenses dams. The Shawmut dam is under review for FERC relicensing and must get water quality approval from Maine as part of that process.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: Five zebras that escaped from a farm nearly a month ago are still on the loose. They got away Aug. 31 from a private farm near Upper Marlboro, about 20 miles southeast of the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reported. Prince George’s County animal control officials told the newspaper the caretakers have been trying to lure the animals into a fenced feeding area ever since. Zebras have to be corralled to be captured, not chased. Three of the animals have been traveling together while the other two have been in a pair, officials said. Residents have been sharing stories of zebra sightings on social media. Joshua DuBois, who worked for the White House during the Obama administration, tweeted Sept. 19 that he and his wife dressed up their three children in zebra-print outfits to go “zebra hunting.” He shared a video and photos of when they found the animals. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton – who represents Washington in Congress – joked in a Sept. 10 statement that despite her general support for freedom and her recent opposition to fences, referring to the fences around the U.S. Capitol, she was not responsible for setting the zebras free.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMelrose: A home seriously damaged by fire has been listed on the market with an asking price of $399,000. WBZ-TV reported Monday that the listing for the home in Melrose, a suburb of Boston, is evidence of how hot the housing market is. In August, industry groups listed the median sale price of single-family homes in the state to be between $535,000 and $552,000. The online listing for the burned three-bedroom, 1,857-square foot home starts with a call out to contractors, and continues: “House is in need of a complete renovation or potential tear down and rebuild. Buyer to do due diligence. House being sold as is.” The house suffered an intense fire in August that blew out the front windows, which are now boarded up. The Boston Globe reported that firefighters had to tear out parts of the walls and ceiling of the home to extinguish the blaze.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A young Detroit-area man who snapped a photo of a gang chart while cleaning an FBI office and posted it on social media was sentenced Tuesday to probation. Publicizing the chart could have caused a “bloodbath,” said U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. Parker said it was a serious case, but she turned down the government’s request that Anthony Cassani be locked up for three months. “I don’t think you need to be incarcerated to understand the gravity of what you’ve done here,” the judge said. In 2020, Cassani, 22, was cleaning an FBI office to reduce the risk of COVID-19 when he saw a chart of Detroit gang members. He admits taking a picture of the chart with his phone and posting it on Snapchat. It could have gone “horribly wrong” if “search warrants were executed and the targets of the search warrant were prepared for the agents to come in,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eaton Brown said. “We’re thankful that’s not what happened.” Cassani pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. He apologized and acknowledged the potential harm.\n\nMinnesota\n\nChaska: Tensions at a suburban Twin Cities school board meeting over a new mask mandate escalated to a physical scuffle. The Eastern Carver County Schools said Monday all students would need to wear a mask through at least the middle of next month because of a rise in coronavirus cases. At a meeting Monday night in Chaska, speakers lined up to talk about their support or opposition to the mandate. A couple of men got physical over what appeared to be a disagreement about someone taking a photo. Several other men intervened to separate the two and police were summoned, video from WCCO-TV showed. Some parents said the mask mandate is causing bullying concerns on both sides of the issue. Many parents said they want some sort of protocol about what they should do if their child is exposed, and if there is a required quarantine period.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: Three Mississippi cities and Birmingham, Alabama have been awarded grants to improve their train stations ahead of the planned return of Amtrak service to the Gulf Coast. Bay St. Louis, Gulfport and Pascagoula received a little more than $700,000 total, and another $250,000 went to Birmingham, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported. The newspaper said the grants were announced Monday by the Southern Rail Commission. The money will fund improvements to amenities such as lighting, sidewalks and parking areas. The grants require an equivalent matching contribution from local officials. Amtrak said it hopes to resume operating between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama in January. The region has been without passenger service since Hurricane Katrina badly damaged tracks and equipment in 2005. Before that, passenger trains ran between the cities three times a week. The start of service is still pending a decision by the federal Surface Transportation Board on Amtrak’s right of access to freight lines.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A southwest Missouri prosecutor said he has charged five employees of a private Christian boarding school with abusing students – far fewer than the number of charges recommended by state investigators. The five employees of the Agape Boarding School near Stockton were charged with a total of 13 third-degree felony assault counts, Cedar County Prosecuting Attorney Ty Gaither said. The charges came after the Missouri State Highway Patrol investigated allegations of abuse at the school. Based on that investigation, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt recommended prosecuting 22 employees with 65 counts on behalf of 36 victims, including felonies for abuse of a child and tampering with a victim, and misdemeanors for endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report child abuse. After Gaither said last week that he planned to charge far fewer employees than recommended, Schmitt asked Gov. Mike Parson to remove his office from the investigation because he didn’t believe Gaither intended to “seek justice” for all the victims. Gaither said this office believed “these to be the appropriate charges under the fact of the investigation,” The Kansas City Star reported. Although Gaither asked for the attorney general’s assistance in the case, Missouri law gives county prosecutors sole authority in deciding what charges are filed.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal authorities are investigating a small plane crash that killed a couple and critically injured their son in southern Montana on Sunday, authorities said. Robby and Pam Stephens died at the crash south of Billings and son Riley was taken to a hospital with critical injuries, officials said. Responders arrived to find the plane on fire in a wooded area near the Blain Airstrip, Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said. According to preliminary information, the Beech 35S plane crashed at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday, National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Keith Holloway said. The investigation will include looking at any air traffic communications, radar data, weather reports and a review of the plane’s maintenance records and medical and flight history of the pilot, Holloway said. A typical NTSB investigation can take between one and two years to complete, he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nMaywood: A woman was arrested over the weekend in southwestern Nebraska after being accused of pulling a gun after a store clerk refused to sell her beer, authorities said. The incident happened shortly before noon Saturday, when a business in the village of Maywood called the Frontier County Sheriff’s Office to report that a woman who appeared to be high on drugs pulled a gun when she wasn’t allowed to buy beer, KRVN reported. Deputies and the Nebraska State Patrol later stopped a vehicle on Highway 23 in which the woman was believed to be riding. Officers arrested Dixie Kaiser, 39, of Wellfleet, on suspicion of making terroristic threats. Kaiser was being held in the Seward County Jail on $15,000 bond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe is launching the largest capital improvement project in the history of the resort with a $7.5 million expansion that includes a new high-speed chairlift and trail additions to help skier traffic patterns. Resort officials said the expansion including the new chairlift in the Lakeview mountain zone near the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe is expected to be completed ahead of the 2022-23 winter season. Mike Pierce, the resort’s marketing director, said strong ridership combined with COVID-19 related lift restrictions made it necessary to increase Lakeview’s lift capacity last season. The old lift has been accessing a part of the mountain with views of the alpine lake for 41 years. Improvements already under way include a $1 million investment in snowmaking infrastructure, and slope grading to reduce obstacles and allow opening of terrain with as little as a foot of packed snow, Pierce said. A 60-year-old domestic water system serving the main lodge base area also is being replaced.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging a decision by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s administration to end unemployment benefits under the federal CARES Act early, saying the claims are based on flawed interpretations of state law. The pandemic-related benefits were scheduled to run out on Sept. 6. The lawsuit filed in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua against the state of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Employment Security and its commissioner asked a judge to reinstate the benefits dating to June 19, when they were ended. In her ruling, Judge Jacalyn Colburn wrote “the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims because neither of the statutes on which they rely require the defendants to act.” New Hampshire was among the first to expand eligibility for unemployment benefits when the pandemic first struck. Thousands of people were collecting unemployment benefits, including $300 per week supplemental payments either from the state or a federal program created during the pandemic. The state decided to end the extra payments early because the unemployment rate had dropped and given the abundance of available jobs, Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: A man who apparently tried to break into a restaurant in a southern New Jersey strip mall died after he got trapped in an exhaust fan on the roof of the building, authorities said. The body was found shortly before 10 a.m. Monday at the restaurant in Galloway Township. It’s not known how or when the man became trapped, police said, and officials are still working to determine his identity. Authorities have not said how the body was discovered or who found it. A similar robbery had occurred at the business a few weeks ago, and authorities are trying to determine if the episodes are connected.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The family of a passenger on a hot air balloon that crashed and killed five people in Albuquerque in June is suing the estate of the deceased pilot and the companies that operated the commercial balloon. The estate of Martin Martinez, 62, filed a lawsuit in state district court last week against Hot Air Balloonatics LLC, Sventato LLC, and the estate of the pilot, Nicholas Meleski. The suit accuses Meleski, who had drugs in his system, of piloting the balloon in a reckless manner. Martinez’s family is seeking unspecified monetary, punitive and other damages. A Federal Aviation Administration report showed that Meleski, 62, had marijuana and cocaine in his blood and urine. The National Transportation Safety Board hasn’t ruled on the cause of the crash. According to the lawsuit, Meleski was an employee of Hot Air Balloonatics and one of the organizers of Sventato, which owned the balloon that crashed June 26. The balloon struck a power line and the basket toppled about 100 feet onto a busy street. Hot Air Balloonatics declined to comment on the lawsuit. Also killed in the crash were Martinez’s wife, Mary, 59; Georgia O’Keeffe Elementary School assistant principal Susan Montoya, 65; and her husband, John, 61. Co-workers had chipped in to purchase the balloon ride for Susan Montoya as a going-away gift because she planned to transfer to another school.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of the Catholic bishop of Brooklyn, Nicholas DiMarzio, weeks after a Vatican investigation cleared him of sexual abuse allegations, and appointed a native New Yorker to replace him. DiMarzio is 77, two years beyond the usual retirement age for bishops. Francis accepted his resignation and appointed Bishop Robert Brennan of Columbus, Ohio, to take over in Brooklyn, the Vatican said. On Sept. 1, the New York church announced that the Vatican had closed its case against DiMarzio after an investigation concluded that the allegations against DiMarzio didn’t have “the semblance of truth.” Two men had separately claimed DiMarzio abused them a half-century ago, when he was a priest in New Jersey. DiMarzio denied the allegations. The accusers’ attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, has said the men will press forward with civil cases against DiMarzio. In a tweet Wednesday, DiMarzio welcomed Brennan to Brooklyn and said he had “great confidence in his ability to lead” the diocese. Brennan, 59, was educated at St. John’s University in Queens, ordained in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and made an auxiliary bishop there before being sent to lead the Columbus diocese in 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCarolina Beach: The town’s council terminated the contract of Reef Parking because of defective parking meters and the need for new ideas. Reef Parking manages 1,200 parking spaces in Carolina Beach, including spots in 20 surface lots and 165 metered on-street spaces. Parking fees account for more than $1.9 million of the town’s $16.5 million general fund revenue for fiscal year 2022. This summer, the town fielded complaints about inoperable parking meters, Mayor LeAnn Pierce said. Pierce said she received more complaints about meters not working than about the town’s parking rates. The town will be accepting requests for proposals, which will include reviewing past proposals submitted by other parking companies, Pierce said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The developer of an oil refinery planned near Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota has a new contract with a company that will buy and market all diesel and gasoline produced at the facility. Developer Meridian Energy Group said its 10-year contract with Musket Corp. covers 360 million gallons of diesel and 280 million gallons of gasoline produced annually. The fuels make up 90% of the volume of refined products at the plant. Meridian first proposed the refinery just 3 miles from the park in 2016, with the goal of having it operating by next year. Meridian says the Billings County project has faced delays from the pandemic and litigation from environmental groups, and the company has struggled to secure financing. Environmentalists objected to the permitting process and have concerns about the refinery’s proximity to the national park, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The company announced last November that it had entered into an agreement with Utah-based Kiva Energy, which will purchase propane and butane from the refinery.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Ohio’s utility commission said it has asked an independent auditor to examine whether FirstEnergy Corp. used customer money to pay for naming rights at the stadium where the Cleveland Browns play. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio announcement follows a request on Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers. They want FirstEnergy’s name removed because of its involvement in secretly funding a $60 million bribery scheme to win legislative approval in 2019 for a $1 billion bailout for two nuclear plants operated by a wholly owned FirstEnergy subsidiary. Akron-based FirstEnergy in 2013 agreed to pay $102 million over 17 years for naming rights to the stadium that was called Cleveland Browns Stadium when it opened in 1999, cleveland.com reported. FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the corporation pays for the naming rights deal and not customers of its three Ohio electric companies.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Cherokee Nation and three opioid distributors reached a $75 million settlement to resolve opioid-related claims against the companies. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe announced the settlement, the largest in Cherokee Nation history, with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation. The settlement will be paid out over 61/ 2 years. The tribe sued the three companies, along with several pharmacy companies, in 2017, alleging they contributed to “an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse” within the tribe and have not done enough to prevent tribal members from acquiring illegally prescribed opioid painkillers. The three companies said in a joint statement that the settlement is a step toward “a broader settlement with all federally recognized Native American tribes across the country.” The Cherokee Nation’s claims against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS are pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:After more than a year of renovations – and a much-anticipated reopening delayed by rising COVID-19 cases — the Salem Public Library is set to open Friday with limited in-person services. Residents can visit the library for Express Service, which includes browsing, pickup of holds and limited public computer use. The services will be available 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday. Curbside services will continue by appointment, and the outdoor book return is available 24 hours a day. The library closed its downtown location in February 2020 to undergo $18.6 million bond-funded seismic retrofits and cosmetic renovations. It relocated its collection to a temporary location on Broadway Road NE, but the location was only open a few weeks before the pandemic hit Oregon and closed libraries and indoor services. There will be a number of rules in place, including masks being worn over the mouth and nose at all times inside the library and a maximum of 200 visitors in the building at one time.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Allegheny County government employees will be required to submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination by Dec. 1 or face termination under a policy announced Wednesday by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. About 5,000 employees are subject to the new mandate, of whom more than 75% are already vaccinated. The rest will need to get the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines on or before Dec. 1 to be considered in compliance, officials said. Government workers who remain unvaccinated and who do not obtain an exemption will face termination beginning Dec. 2, the county said. County officials cited the rise of the highly contagious delta variant, which has led to increased COVID-19 caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths, and the need to protect workers and the public.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation has awarded another $450,000 in grants to several more nonprofits that are helping state residents cope with and recover from the pandemic. Centro de Innovacion Mujer Latina, Rhode Island Rescue Ministries and The Samaritans of Rhode Island are among the organizations that benefited from the latest round of grants. Centro received $30,000 to provide community mental health services and other assistance to the Spanish-speaking community. Rescue Ministries received $20,000 to purchase cold storage and nonperishable food containers for its homeless shelter, food pantry and soup kitchen. Samaritans received $20,000 to improve the responsiveness of its digital suicide prevention services. The foundation has now awarded more than $21 million in pandemic relief since March 2020.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A federal judge suspended South Carolina from enforcing a rule that banned school districts from requiring masks for students. Parents of disabled children, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the state saying the ban discriminated against medically vulnerable students by keeping them out of public schools as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The mask ban has been forcefully backed by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster and GOP lawmakers who said parents should decide whether students wear masks, not school officials. U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis compared the General Assembly preventing mask requirements to telling schools they can no longer install wheelchair ramps. McMaster’s spokesman, Brian Symmes, said the ruling isn’t the last word in the case. “The governor strongly disagrees with the court’s decision and will defend a parent’s right to decide what’s best for their children up to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary,” Symmes said in a statement,\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBlack Hawk: More than 150 homeowners in a development outside Rapid City are suing Meade County over risks to their properties after a sinkhole exposed an abandoned gypsum mine. The federal complaint filed Monday by Hideaway Hills residents in Black Hawk seeks damages to be determined by a jury and other relief “allowed by law or equity.” The sinkhole forced about 40 residents from 15 homes in April 2020. Geotechnical studies showed there could be water flowing through the abandoned mine and toward Interstate 90 and there is the potential for future sinkholes, the Rapid City Journal reported. The complaint alleged several violations of the state Constitution. It said the decision to approve the subdivision by the county Planning Commission and the Meade County Commission put homeowners at risk. Developers allegedly informed the county in 2001 of an underground gypsum mine and discussed taking steps to determine if it was safe to build on. The commission approved the subdivision proposal in 2003. Katelyn Cook, an attorney for the county, said her legal team does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin:A house in downtown Franklin that belonged to the grandparents of country comedy legend Minnie Pearl, who performed at the Grand Ole Opry for more than 50 years, is for sale for $2.75 million. The home on West Main Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It belonged to Ophelia and William House,the grandparents of Sarah Colley Cannon, better known by her stage name of Minnie Pearl. The Queen Anne-style home was built in 1873 and sits in Franklin’s historic downtown district. Many of the original furnishings and fixtures remain, including mantels for the six fireplaces. The distinctive home has glass doorknobs and intricately designed door handles. The nearly 6,000 square foot residence sits on a little more than an acre, and has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. Outdoor space includes a wraparound front porch, sunroom, back porch and patio. Hardwood floors are throughout the home.\n\nTexas\n\nHuntsville: Rick Rhoades, 57, was executed Tuesday night for fatally stabbing two Houston-area brothers during a robbery in their home more than 30 years ago. Rhoades was executed by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the September 1991 killings of Charles Allen, 31, and Bradley Allen, 33. The brothers were killed less than a day after Rhoades had been released on parole after serving a sentence for burglary. Rhoades, strapped to the death chamber gurney, turned his head and looked briefly at relatives of his victims as they walked to a window in a witness area a few feet from him. Asked by the warden to make a final statement, he declined. He was pronounced dead at 6:29 p.m. CDT, 17 minutes after the lethal injection began. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to delay Rhoades’ execution over claims his constitutional right to due process was being violated because he was being prevented from pursuing allegations that some potential jurors at his trial might have been dismissed for racially discriminatory reasons. Rhoades was the third inmate put to death this year in Texas and the sixth in the U.S. Four more executions are scheduled for later this year in Texas, the nation’s busiest capital punishment state.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: The police chief in the tourist town where officers stopped Gabby Petito and her boyfriend weeks before her death has taken a leave of absence. Moab Police Chief Bret Edge requested a leave of absence that began Monday, city spokesperson Lisa Church said. It is unknown if his request is related to criticism the department has faced over the past week after Petito’s body was discovered in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Petito and her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night but no charges were filed and no serious injuries were reported. Last week, the city of Moab said it would conduct a formal investigation into the police department’s handling of the dispute. Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Laundrie visited parks in the West. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A food box program with its roots in the early days of the pandemic is ending after distributing tens of thousands of meals to people across Vermont. In June, the Full Plates Vermont program run by the Vermont Foodbank took over the Farmers to Families Food Box program that was begun by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The original USDA program was designed to feed people left hungry by the pandemic and give those in the food industry, notably farmers, a place to sell their products. The food bank, working with private, state and other partners, coordinated food distribution events where people’s vehicles were loaded with boxes of food containing poultry, fruit, vegetables and dairy items. The Rutland Herald reported that after the original program ended in May, the Vermont Foodbank continued with its version of the program, which has distributed 40,000 meals since June. Sayles said after the program ends Thursday, people who benefited from it can check with the Foodbank to learn where they can get help.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin clashed Tuesday night over vaccinations, tax policy, education and their respective records in the second and final debate in Virginia’s closely watched gubernatorial election. The event quickly got off to a combative start and neither candidate let up over the course of the hour, with each accusing the other of lying to voters. Five weeks from Election Day and with early voting already underway, recent polls suggested a tight race between McAuliffe, who is seeking a second term after his first ended in 2018, and Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer. Democrats made huge gains in Virginia while President Donald Trump was in office, taking full control of state government, but Republicans are more energized and optimistic about their chances this fall than they have been in years. The contest, one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races this year, is also drawing national attention as a possible indicator of voter sentiment heading into next year’s midterms.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: A woman has filed a lawsuit against King County Metro claiming a bus driver ran over her leg while she was laying on a sidewalk and then drove away. Jessica Chapel’s injuries were so severe that doctors had to amputate one of her legs, her attorneys said. The bus driver, who is no longer with King County Metro, is facing hit-and-run charges, KOMO-TV reported. Chapel was homeless in March and decided to lay down on the sidewalk to take a nap, her attorneys said. The bus pulled out of the South Renton Park & Ride lot and turned right, cutting the corner short. The rear tire of the bus ran on top of the curb and drove over Chapel’s leg, her attorneys said. “The injuries were gruesome,” said attorney Kirk Bernard. According to the complaint filed Tuesday, the King County bus driver initially stopped to check on Chapel before returning to the bus and pushing the response button to get help from law enforcement. The lawsuit alleged that the driver left Chapel on the road side and canceled the help that was supposed to be on the way. A passerby called for help.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A new program launched by West Virginia’s Supreme Court that uses technology to promote safety and access in cases involving sexual assault and domestic violence is expanding to Ohio County, officials said. The new system allows victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to file petitions for protective orders without going to a courthouse. Ohio County is the second community to pilot the program, which was introduced last month in Cabell County as a way to address safety concerns. The only option before the program was for victims to appear in person at the courthouse. “This new system will provide an option to victims to help keep them safe from the people they allege assaulted them. We also are ensuring every person’s constitutional rights are protected,” Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau:The city could soon be home to up to 85 refugees, including some of the thousands of evacuees who fled the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Ethiopian Community Development Council announced Wednesday that it is preparing for the first 10 individuals to be resettled into the central Wisconsin city by December, and that another 75 could be received from January through September of 2022. The organization said among those resettled in the community could be Afghans, through the Afghan Placement and Assistance program. The organization received authorization for the resettlement from the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, but no costs have yet been completed for the effort. Before the refugees can be resettled, the organization is working to hire a director for its Multicultural Community Center and raise funds to hire other local staff members, according to a release. As soon as staff members are in place, the group will work with local partners to prepare for the first arrivals.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Widespread news coverage of Gabby Petito helped searchers in an unrelated case find a man’s body not far away, officials said. A team with a search dog looked for four hours Tuesday before finding the body of a man matching the description of Robert ‘Bob’ Lowery, according to a Teton County Search & Rescue statement. Lowery, 46, of Houston, went missing Aug. 20. The man’s body was found on a steep, wooded slope in the area of Teton Pass in western Wyoming. How the man died wasn’t immediately known. Authorities notified Lowery’s family while awaiting confirmation the body was his. News coverage of Petito, 22, who went missing on a cross-country road trip and whose body was found near Grand Teton National Park on Sept. 19, sometimes mentioned Lowery’s disappearance. That prompted at least two people to call authorities with information about Lowery, searchers said Tuesday. Lowery was wearing a black baseball cap with a gold letter “P” and spotted in hotel camera images carrying a black duffel bag with the Nike logo. Searchers in the area of a popular canyon trail said they found a bag matching that description with the body, far off the trail. The bag contained a tent and sleeping bag, Lowery’s sister, Leigh, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. The Teton Pass-area canyon where the man’s body was found is about 45 miles from where Petito was found. Petito’s parents reported her missing Sept. 11 after she didn’t respond to calls and texts while she and boyfriend Brian Laundrie visited national parks in the West.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/30"}]}

However, sometimes the victory lies in the public knowing that the State Election Board is paying close attention to our election process,\" said state board member Janelle King, one of three members who backed the rule, in a statement.\n\nOther members of the state board, which passed the rule in a 3-2 vote, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for the election board of Georgia's Cobb County, which brought the lawsuit, also didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGeorgia is one of seven swing states that will decide the election. After President Joe Biden won Georgia by a margin of about 12,000 votes in 2020, Raffensperger, in a taped phone call, resisted pressure from then-President Trump to help \"find\" enough votes to reverse that result amid debunked claims of voter fraud. Trump has pleaded not guilty in Georgia to criminal charges that he and allies conspired to steal that election.\n\nThe late-Tuesday ruling was one of two significant election-related decisions from McBurney this week.

Raffensperger said the proposal could lead to \"error, lost or stolen ballots, and fraud.\"\n\nKing said in her statement that their opinions \"directly contradict\" the state board's rules and force a judge \"to rule on hypothetical scenarios.\"\n\nThe Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, a nonpartisan group of more than 500 officials and staff, had also warned the rule could delay results, undermine public confidence in the election, and \"set fatigued employees up for failure.\"\n\nMcBurney had appeared poised to halt the rule at a multihour hearing earlier on Tuesday, where he said he was seeing significant evidence \"of chaos that it is sowing.\"\n\nHis Tuesday ruling was more emphatic.\n\n\"The administrative chaos that will – not may – ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections ... to ensure that our elections are fair, legal, and orderly,\" McBurney wrote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/30/democrats-lawsuit-georgia-election-board-hand-count/75453261007/", "title": "Democrats sue Georgia election board over last-minute hand-count ...", "text": "The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia filed a lawsuit Monday to block Georgia's controversial ballot hand-count rule from going into effect in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nThree Republican members of the election board passed the rule Sept. 20 over the objections of their two colleagues and the advice of Republican Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.\n\nThe rule requires three separate individuals in each of Georgia's voting precincts – there are 2,400 precincts, according to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger – to hand count the ballots before the county deadline to certify election results.

The DNC and its allies are also pursuing litigation to block restrictions on voting and prevent last-minute changes in election rules.\n\nThe RNC contends the lawsuits are aimed at ensuring election officials follow the law. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley has said Pennsylvania's policies for mail-in ballots “ignore the law” and “erode public confidence in our elections,” and the North Carolina State Board of Elections “violated the law” in how it registered voters.\n\n“There has been a very large volume of litigation around the election this year,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHere are some cases with potentially big ramifications:\n\nMississippi's absentee ballot deadline\n\nLegal experts say a Mississippi case about the deadline for absentee ballots could reach the Supreme Court and have widespread impact across numerous states.\n\nMississippi allows mailed-in ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to arrive up to five days later and still be counted. Another 12 states – including California, Florida and New York – and the District of Columbia have similar grace periods ranging from one to 10 days for absentee ballots.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and Mississippi GOP challenged the law in federal court in January by arguing federal law ends voting on Election Day.\n\nBut county election officials represented by the state contend ballots just need to be cast by that deadline – confirmed by the postmark – and can be counted later.\n\nThe Justice Department sided with the state in arguing that setting an Election Day deadline could hurt military and overseas voters who mail in ballots.\n\nIf the case reaches the Supreme Court and the justices side with the RNC, the ruling could invalidate tens of thousands of ballots received after Election Day nationwide. More than 50,000 mailed ballots were rejected as late in 2020 without making deadlines tighter, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study. But legal experts said it was unlikely the 5th Circuit or Supreme Court would make such a \"radical\" decision.\n\n\"The potential outcome would be pretty dramatic, I certainly hope that the 5th Circuit isn’t willing to be quite that radical,\" Morales-Doyle said.\n\nThe 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already rejected a similar lawsuit in August from Illinois. In Mississippi, a U.S. District Court upheld the state’s deadline in July and Republicans appealed. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Sept. 24.\n\n\"If the 5th Circuit accepts the argument that the RNC is making, this would have very broad implications, and could conceivably make it up to the Supreme Court,\" said Daniel Tokaji, dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School.\n\nCertifying the vote in Georgia\n\nSeveral lawsuits in Georgia could affect whether county election results are certified on time amid bipartisan fears that last-minute rule changes from the Georgia State Election Board could cause delays and invite election misinformation.\n\nOne of the rules, passed Sept. 20, requires three individuals in each of thousands of Georgia voting precincts to count the number of ballots by hand and match the totals to figures generated by machines. The Democratic National Committee and Georgia Democratic Party are arguing in a lawsuit filed Sept. 30 that the state Legislature didn't authorize the board to pass such a rule, echoing guidance Republican Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr gave the board.\n\n\"If the Hand Count Rule is allowed to go into effect, the general election will not be orderly and uniform – large counties will face significant delays in reporting vote counts\" and \"election officials will struggle to implement new procedures at the last minute,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nTwo Georgia county election boards near Atlanta, the boards for Cobb County and DeKalb County, also sued the state election board Tuesday over the hand-count rule and other last-minute changes.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Georgia Judge Robert C. I. McBurney held expedited trial proceedings in a separate Democratic lawsuit targeting two August rules from the state election board. One rule requires county officials to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying results, and the other empowers county officials to examine any documentation created as the election was being conducted.\n\nTo \"prevent chaos in November,\" Democrats have asked McBurney to declare ahead of the election that the Nov. 12 county certification deadline is mandatory, and the new rules don't change that.\n\nMcBurney also held trial proceedings Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by Julie Adams, a Republican on Atlanta's Fulton County election board who refused to certify results in the May primary election – a growing phenomenon across different states. Adams is suing Fulton County to get access to election-related documents and to get a court to declare she is permitted to vote 'no' on certification. The county says she doesn't have a right to the documents or to vote 'no,' but also says it has voluntarily given her document access.\n\nMcBurney appeared poised to largely give Adams a win when it comes to accessing documents, but give her a loss when it comes to certification.\n\n\"You can certify by looking at lots of records or a few records, interrogating poll workers, not interrogating poll workers, looking at everything to your heart's content – within the narrow window of time that you have,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nBallot errors in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania, another crucial swing state, has had a couple of key cases pending about how to deal with errors on absentee ballots.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled Sept. 13 that absentee ballots with missing or incorrect dates on their outer envelopes should not be counted. The American Civil Liberties Union asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 27 to review the issue by arguing that rejecting ballots for an “immaterial error” would violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe state's high court threw out another similar case Friday by ruling it wouldn’t “impose nor countenance substantial alterations to existing laws and procedures” because voting has already begun.\n\nJustice Kevin Brobson agreed with the unsigned decision by writing the court had already ruled in February 2023 that failing to date or mistakenly dating envelopes “renders a ballot invalid as a matter of Pennsylvania law.” Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy joined his opinion.\n\nJustice Christine Donohue also agreed by writing that overturning a statute “is serious business” and that the court should review the entire statute rather than just a portion dealing with mistakes on absentee ballots. Justice Daniel McCaffery joined her opinion.\n\nChief Justice Debra Todd disagreed with the decision, writing that the question was “of grave importance and it was “imperative” to resolve the dispute now.\n\nIn the second case, the RNC and Pennsylvania GOP asked the state Supreme Court on Sept. 18 to block instructions state Secretary of State Al Schmidt gave county election boards in March and August about how to fix mistakes with absentee ballots rather than have them thrown out. The flaws could be a voter forgetting to sign or date the ballot, or defects such as the lack of an outer security envelope.\n\nBased on Schmidt’s guidance, some counties are sending automatic emails to voters whose mail ballots are flawed so they have the option of casting provisional ballots on Election Day. Republicans contend the Legislature hasn’t given Schmidt or the counties the authority to help voters fix mail ballots so the ballots should be rejected entirely. Otherwise, Republicans argue the uncertainty about fixing mail ballot threatens to \"unleash chaos and an erosion of public confidence in the election.”\n\nGovernment lawyers responded that the Republicans muddled legal issues and misrepresented facts. Election officials for counties including those around Democratic strongholds of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh said they were trying to ensure voters get to cast a ballot even if mailed ballots are defective. The Democratic National Committee and state party argue the Republican argument would disenfranchise voters whose mailed ballots are rejected.\n\nThe state Supreme Court threw out the case Friday in an unsigned opinion that said Republicans waited too long to bring it. Republicans had filed a similar lawsuit in September 2022 that was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in the local court, but then didn’t return to court until this September.\n\nBrobson wrote an opinion agreeing with the decision that said Republicans raised “important questions” in their lawsuit but that the general election is already under way, adding that the case “could have pursued these challenges in a more timely fashion.” He said the issues should be resolved before future elections and that another lawsuit could be filed after the election. Mundy again joined Brobson’s opinion.\n\nDispute over voter registration identification in North Carolina\n\nIn North Carolina, the fight is over identification required to register to vote. The eventual decision in the courts could determine whether 225,000 voters are removed from the rolls, which is about three times more than Trump's victory margin over Biden in the state in 2020.\n\nThe RNC and the state GOP sued the State Board of Elections in August for failing to require identification such as a driver’s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number. The result is that noncitizens could have been allowed to register, which fuels distrust in the election, Republicans argued.\n\nElection board members responded it wasn’t clear the federal Help America Vote Act required registrants to provide ID numbers. The election board members accused Republicans of trying to remove hundreds of thousands of voters while voting is under way and urged a judge to dismiss the case.\n\nVoting began Sept. 20 with ballots distributed to military and overseas voters.\n\nU.S. Chief District Judge Richard Myers scheduled a hearing Oct. 17.\n\n\"It doesn't strike me as implausible that you would see a case like that ... before the Supreme Court in late October,\" said Aziz Huq, a University of Chicago law professor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/20/georgia-election-board-hand-count/75295518007/", "title": "Georgia election board passes controversial, last-minute counting rule", "text": "This story was updated to add new information.\n\nThe Georgia State Election Board passed a controversial measure Friday requiring local precincts to conduct hand counts for the November election and confirm the figures match machine counts before certifying election results.\n\nThe rule was one of several proposals under consideration Friday as three Trump-approved Republican members – who have made up the board's majority since May – continue to entertain a flurry of proposals to change the state's election processes in the final months before November. Those three members passed the rule despite being advised by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, that the board would likely be unlawfully usurping the power of the state legislature.\n\nBoard Chairman John Fervier, who was appointed by Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to his nonpartisan role, raised Carr's warning as he tried to dissuade his colleagues ahead of the Friday vote.\n\n\"We know the legislature is not shy of passing laws,\" Fervier said. \"This board needs to take seriously the guidance that we've received from the attorney general, from the secretary of state's office, and from the election professionals across the state.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nElection board member Janelle King, who backed the rule, accused Fervier of \"welcoming lawsuits\" – which she said will be dismissed – through his comments.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has publicly praised King and two of her fellow board members, Janice Johnston and Rick Jeffares, as \"pit bulls\" fighting for \"victory.\"\n\nDemocratic board member Sara Tindall Ghazal joined Fervier in voting against the measure.\n\nState officials protest board's actions\n\nUSA TODAY obtained a copy of Carr's Thursday-dated letter to the board, in which he said the hand-counting rule is \"likely the precise type of impermissible legislation that agencies cannot do.\"\n\nMore generally, Carr said any new rules about how to conduct elections \"are disfavored when implemented as close to an election as the rules on the September 20 agenda.\" Eleven proposed rules were on the board's agenda ahead of Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, a nonpartisan group of more than 500 Georgia officials and staff, also expressed concern in a Tuesday letter about many of the last-minute proposals.\n\n\"Election officials are training thousands of poll workers daily across the state and are already working to educate the public on what to expect throughout the voting process and beyond,\" the group wrote. \"We respectfully ask that these proposed rules, and any other petitions for rulemaking, be tabled until 2025.\"\n\nThe proposed hand-counting rule, in particular, could delay results, set fatigued employees up to fail, and \"undermine the very confidence the rule’s author claims to seek,\" according to the election officials.\n\nThe election board members didn't immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of the Friday meeting. Previously, King told USA TODAY her mission is \"to ensure that every vote is counted accurately and every election is conducted correctly going forward.\"\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, raised his own concerns at an election-related forum Thursday, saying there are 2,400 precincts in Georgia that would need to comply with the hand-counting proposal, which he said would create delays in receiving results and jeopardize the security of the paper ballots.\n\n\"Ninety days before an election, you should not institute major changes to the election process,\" Raffensperger said. \"The more moving parts you have, the more chance you have to fail.\"\n\nFriday meeting opens with another dispute\n\nFriday's meeting opened with more contentiousness as board Chairman John Fervier was overruled by the three Trump-approved Republican members over whether to add another petition to the day's agenda, in addition to 11 proposed rule changes and multiple other petitions already scheduled for consideration.\n\nBoard member Janice Johnston proposed the addition, saying her colleagues could review it later at the lunch break and that it regards \"storage of returns.\"\n\nFervier objected that the board hadn't had time to get guidance on the petition from the public, the Georgia Attorney General's Office, or the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, and he wouldn't add it.\n\nBut Johnston made a motion to overrule him and was quickly supported by her colleagues Janelle King and Rick Jeffares, who outvoted Fervier and Democratic board member Sara Tindall Ghazal.\n\n\"Waiting even until (the next meeting) is time wasted and of concern that again, there will be a howl of voices that it is too late to accept this or adopt it or implement it for this current election,\" Johnston said.\n\nControversial last-minute changes\n\nThe board has already been taking heat for rules passed in August that critics fear could delay certification and cause chaos.\n\nHowever, proponents of recent changes say they are designed to ensure accuracy and boost public confidence in the system.\n\nFormer Virginia Attorney General and Trump administration official Ken Cuccinelli, for example, spoke at the election board's Aug. 19 meeting in defense of a rule requiring counties to investigate even minor discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and the number of voters in a precinct before certifying results.\n\n\"If more ballots show up than voters, good grief, I would think anybody would want to flag and solve that problem as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe Georgia Democratic Party has sued the board over two rules passed in August that it fears could prevent election results from being certified on time. One rule requires counties to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying results. The other is the same rule Cuccinelli defended. The lawsuit focuses on a portion of the rule that allows local election board officials to examine election-related documentation created through running the election.\n\nGeorgia Democrats want a judge to instruct local officials that the state's certification deadlines are mandatory, even after the rules. A state judge has scheduled a trial for Oct. 1 to resolve the issue quickly.\n\nPublic weighs in at meeting\n\nThe board members heard more than an hour of public comments Friday morning before they were set to hear presentations and vote on proposed rules. Commenters largely criticized the proposed changes.\n\nKristin Nabers, the Georgia state director for a nonpartisan voting rights organization, All Voting is Local, said she has personally watched multiple counties conduct full hand counts and every time there has been an error, it's been a human error rather than a machine problem or voter malfeasance.\n\n\"People doing a hand count are going to make mistakes, which can then be exploited to spread lies and sow further distrust in our elections and our election officials,\" Nabers said.\n\nDemocratic Georgia state congresswoman Saira Draper said she thought many of the election professionals who were weighing in had mistakenly presumed the majority board members were approaching the late-in-the-game election proposals in good faith, and so had spoken about their operational, logistical, and practical concerns.\n\n\"I think what is happening is we are setting up our counties to fail,\" Draper said. \"And when these counties fail, when there are inaccuracies, if there is a result of the election that some of the members of this board do not like, they will be able to point to those inaccuracies, and they will say that this is – that the election is inaccurate, that there is a lack of integrity in the election.\"\n\nJulie Adams, a Republican on Atlanta's Fulton County Election Board who refused to certify results in the May primary election, defended rule changes coming from the board's majority. She analogized the hand-counting proposal to double-checking the cash a bank issues.\n\n\"A machine is going to count the thousand dollars, the teller is going to hand count to make sure it's $1,000, and you ... are going to count and make sure it's $1,000,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Erin Mansfield", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/01/georgia-election-board-republicans-democrats-trial/75455177007/", "title": "Judge signals he may rule that Georgia counties must certify election", "text": "This story was updated to add new information.\n\nAn Atlanta-based judge overseeing two cases dealing with whether Georgia county election boards must certify election results by the state's November deadline signaled Tuesday that he is likely to rule that certification is mandatory, even if board members can investigate issues before the deadline.\n\nThe court proceedings took place amidst growing, bipartisan concern about new rules from the Georgia State Election Board that increase local officials' powers and responsibilities before the mid-November county certification deadline. Critics fear the rules could delay election results and be used to cast doubt on the election's integrity.\n\nJudge Robert C. I. McBurney said Tuesday that he thought it \"would be a problematic ruling\" if he were to say a board member's \"discretion encompasses the ability of a board member to decline to certify some or all of the votes.\"\n\n\"You could very easily have an outcome where there's no certification. How is that consistent with the law?\" McBurney asked.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMcBurney made the comments during afternoon trial proceedings in the case of Julie Adams, a Republican on Atlanta's Fulton County Election Board who refused to certify results in the May primary election – a growing phenomenon across the country since the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAdams sued Fulton County in order to get what's called a \"declaratory judgment\" making clear that she has discretion in exercising her board member duties, and that she has the right to information she says she needs to perform her duties.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, McBurney held trial proceedings in a case brought by the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia against the Georgia State Election Board. They want the judge to declare that, regardless of the two new rules, county election boards must certify the upcoming election's results by the November deadline.\n\n\"According to their drafters, these rules rest on the assumption that certification of election results by a county board is discretionary and subject to free-ranging inquiry that may delay certification or render it wholly optional,\" Democrats said in their brief ahead of the trial.\n\nMcBurney allowed the Georgia Republican Party and the Republican National Committee to jump into the Democrats' case to fight against their position, just as he allowed the Democratic groups to jump into Adams' case to fight her position. He held bench trial proceedings Tuesday, in which a judge decides the full case without a jury.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans agree – on the surface\n\nThe state board, the Republican groups, and the Democratic groups all agreed at the outset of Tuesday's proceedings that county election boards are legally required to certify results by 5 p.m. EDT on Nov. 12 – a week after Election Day. A Georgia statute explicitly states that election returns \"shall ... be certified\" by the county superintendent no later than 5 p.m. the Monday after Election Day, which would fall on Veterans Day – Nov. 11 – this year.\n\nHowever, they maintained their disagreement over whether Judge McBurney could officially say so ahead of the upcoming presidential contest.\n\nArguing on behalf of Democrats, lawyer Kurt G. Kastorf said his clients are concerned that, without a court ruling to the contrary, county officials who don't believe they can properly determine a particular vote should count might conclude under the new rules that they should exclude the vote from the certification total or should refuse to vote for certification.\n\n\"All of these are possibilities that a county official could take that would prevent a voter from having their votes legally cast,\" Kastorf said.\n\nSpeaking for the Georgia Republican Party, lawyer Baxter D. Drennon said it wasn't appropriate for the judge to make a ruling based on hypotheticals that haven't come to pass.\n\n\"All these things are mere possibilities or potential things that could occur, but none of them are actual, immediate legal consequences under the rule, and I don't think this Court can issue an opinion based on that,\" Drennon said.\n\nJudge suggests a certification comment box\n\nLater in the day, Richard Lawson, a lawyer for Adams, also said certification by mid-November is mandatory, although he wasn't sure if Nov. 11 – Veterans Day – or Nov. 12 would be the precise date.\n\nHowever, some of Lawson's ensuing comments indicated he didn't believe the law required Adams to vote 'yes' on certification. He noted that, as a board member, Adams takes an oath to \"prevent any fraud\" and to \"make a true and perfect return of ... primaries and elections.\"\n\n\"I do think that a 'no' vote just has to be permitted,\" Lawson said.\n\nJudge McBurney said \"there's clearly some tension\" between the oath to make a \"perfect return\" and the statute requiring certification, at least when a board member is questioning the legitimacy of the results.\n\n\"To me, it's resolvable by having a certification that has a comment box for each of the certifiers. 'I know I'm certifying, but I've got concerns about precinct 17,'\" McBurney said. \"Now it's on notice, and there can be an election contest about that, a district attorney can jump into action, who knows?\"\n\nWhat do the new rules do?\n\nOne of the two rules at issue requires election officials to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" into the accuracy of the election results before certifying them, without defining what a \"reasonable inquiry\" is. The other allows individual county election board members to examine documentation that was created as the election was being conducted.\n\nThe rules were passed by three members of the state election board after former President Donald Trump praised them each by name at an Aug. 3 Atlanta campaign rally, calling them “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory.” The two remaining members – a Democrat and the nonpartisan board chair who was appointed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp – objected but were outvoted.\n\nThe two rules are part of a series of last-minute changes to the November election by the same three board members. Those changes have sparked bipartisan concern, with many worrying the changes could delay election results and be used to cast doubt on the election's integrity.\n\nGeorgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who famously refused Trump's request to \"find\" nearly 12,000 votes to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia, previously told USA TODAY that the board's efforts to change result certification requirements in the final few months before the election \"are a mess.\"\n\nDemocrats sued on Monday to block a separate rule that Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr advised the board was probably unlawful. That Sept. 20 rule requires thousands of Georgia voting precincts to hand-count ballots and match the totals to figures produced by machines.\n\nWhat is the election board arguing?\n\nIn its brief to McBurney, the election board appeared to agree with Democrats that county election results certification is a mandatory duty.\n\n\"Petitioners ask this Court to declare what is already enshrined in Georgia law: the fact that certification is a mandatory act that must occur at the county level by a certain date,\" the election board said.\n\nYet despite agreeing with Democrats on that point, the board is fighting Democrats' legal effort to get a judge to make that clear. It says the lawsuit should be dismissed because it's premature – a court declaration wouldn't be appropriate where the controversy \"is based on possible or probable future contingencies,\" according to the brief.\n\nThe board is also arguing that it is shielded from the lawsuit by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which protects the government from being sued without its consent.\n\nWhat does the Georgia GOP say?\n\nThe Republican National Committee and the Georgia Republican Party won permission from Judge McBurney to jump into the case and weigh in separately.\n\nIn their brief to the court ahead of the trial, they tried to turn Democrats' concern about injecting chaos into the election process onto its head by saying the lawsuit is the real threat.\n\nBlocking the rules \"in the final weeks before voting starts would inject judicially created confusion,\" they said. \"It is policymakers—not judges—who should make 'policy choices on the ground before and during an election.'\"\n\nAdams to get leeway on pre-certification investigating?\n\nJudge McBurney appeared more favorably disposed to Adams' request for a court declaration that county board members can access election materials, especially given the new rule allowing for that access. He compared the issue to deciding how best to cut down a tree.\n\n\"In the end you must certify. In the end, you must cut down that tree,\" McBurney said.\n\n\"You have full discretion as to how you cut that tree down, in the same way that you can certify by looking at lots of records or a few records, interrogating poll workers, not interrogating poll workers, looking at everything to your heart's content – within the narrow window of time that you have,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/11/06/tcf-center-detroit-ballot-counting/6173577002/", "title": "What really happened inside Detroit's TCF Center amid ballot counting", "text": "By nightfall on Election Day, the TCF Center in downtown Detroit was already heating up.\n\nWorried Republicans sounded the horn for backup to come to Detroit, while equally concerned Democrats did the same.\n\nThe Detroit vote had everyone on edge.\n\nOne group wanted to challenge it, while the other wanted to protect it.\n\nThe 24 hours that followed would turn the vote-counting arena inside TCF into a sports stadium, complete with yelling, taunting, cheering, fists pounding on glass and unruly challengers being hauled off by cops.\n\nAlso read:\n\nProtesters rally at TCF Center as Biden's lead overtakes Trump in key states\n\nIn the basement of the center, a historic election process unfolded on the world stage as an unprecedented amount of absentee ballots were counted in a space thick with fear, anxiety and escalating tension.\n\nRepublican attorney Tim Griffin found himself pacing in the wee hours of the night, frantically calling for volunteers to head to Detroit to challenge the ballots, suspicious that something nefarious was happening.\n\nPoll volunteer Jeffrey Nolish ditched his dinner and rushed to the scene, where he would monitor the counting process at the request of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to ensure that every vote was counted.\n\nAs tensioned swirled, ballot counter Mary Hill, 71, kept her head down, quietly processing the mountain of absentee ballots through the night, unfazed by the paranoia and rumors surrounding her.\n\nAmong the wild claims on social media was that someone slipped ballots into the TCF counting center on a wagon, in the middle of the night. But the picture offered as proof turned out to be of a WXYZ-TV photographer, hauling his equipment.\n\nAs expected in a city known for grit, resilience, strife and persistence, the vote count at Detroit's TCF was a roller coaster ride, resulting in a record 167,000 absentee ballots counted by Wednesday evening to the soundtrack of crowds shouting \"Stop the Count!\"\n\nRelated: Trump lies repeatedly about election efforts in Michigan\n\nRelated: Black voters in Detroit key for Joe Biden and Gary Peters' victories\n\nRelated: Michigan Election 2020 live updates\n\nThis was no ordinary election, but an extraordinary democratic process that planted a bull's-eye on Detroit as the election played out exactly how Republicans feared and precisely how Democrats prayed, with the state ultimately being called for challenger Joe Biden.\n\nUltimately, more than 5.5 million people voted in Michigan’s presidential election — the most ever and the highest percentage of voting-age residents to cast a ballot in 60 years.\n\nIn Detroit, turnout was just under 50%, but it was higher than in 2016, when low turnout in similar urban areas may have helped President Donald Trump win the state, political observers have said. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan by a slim margin of less than 11,000 votes.\n\n“That’s hotter than Stevie Wonder’s 'Hotter than July' ” hit,\" election official Daniel Baxter proclaimed over a loud speaker to a cheering room of exhausted poll workers Wednesday night. \"We broke a record in Detroit tonight.”\n\nBut getting there wasn't easy.\n\nAnd days later, as protesters rallied at TCF on Friday, the drama was far from over.\n\nEarly rule breakers, mask antics\n\nThe drama at TCF actually started before Election Day — before voters even went to the polls.\n\nThe absentee ballot processing began at 10 a.m. Monday in Detroit, with poll workers seated at their tables inside the center, removing outer envelopes as they prepared for the daunting task.\n\nBecause of changes to Michigan state law, clerks of cities and townships with more than 25,000 residents can now start processing ballots — but not opening them — the day before Election Day.\n\nOn Monday, Republican challengers were standing by. So were police, who within 15 minutes of the process starting removed a man wearing a white horror movie mask from the center.\n\nPolice sent a clear message early on that they would act swiftly to eject disrupters.\n\nThe man in the horror movie mask had credentials to be a poll challenger, election officials said. But he started a commotion, shouting that the process was “crooked.”\n\nOne hour later, another Republican challenger was removed, this one for causing a commotion at a ballot processing table and refusing to pull her face mask over her nose. Robin Bozenski, 61, of Southgate, had a mask on, as required due to the coronavirus rules. But when election officials asked her to pull it up over her nose, she refused, so Detroit police removed her from the center.\n\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson said the police acted appropriately and issued a warning to future rabble rousers: \"If there's any disruption at all, either at our polling places and our absentee counting board, it will not be tolerated.\"\n\n'Our phones started going off'\n\nBy 11 p.m. Tuesday Jeffrey Nolish was settling down at a friend's house to make dinner and watch election results. He had just spent a day volunteering at the polls, and was looking to unwind.\n\nThen his phone rang.\n\nThe absentee ballot counting process inside the TCF Center was being disrupted, Nolish was told, and the ACLU needed people to monitor what was happening.\n\n“Our phones started going off,” Nolish recalled in a Thursday interview with the Free Press. “Within a half an hour, we rallied a list of 90-some people to activate, to go to the TCF Center and to volunteer with these lawyers to defend our democracy.”\n\nAround the same time, Republicans also sounded alarms\n\nNolish, 39, of Detroit, was in the first wave of election monitors who descended on the TCF Center shortly before midnight on Tuesday over concerns that Republican challengers were disrupting Detroit workers as they counted the city’s absentee ballots.\n\nNolish, who stayed until 5 a.m., was among many who showed up to be a stabilizing force and ensure that every vote was counted, he said.\n\nRepublican election monitors and challengers had maintained a steady presence inside the TCF Center throughout Tuesday evening and into the night. Democratic challenger Joe Biden had not yet taken the lead in Michigan, though the ACLU and other groups put out calls for help, concerned that GOP observers at TCF outnumbered Democratic and nonpartisan groups.\n\nAccording to Nolish, those who turned out to help protect Detroiters' votes came from several groups, including the ACLU, NAACP, Detroit Will Breathe, Detroit Action, Michigan Liberation, 482Forward and the 313 Care Collective.\n\nAs for his role, Nolish said he received instructions from a lawyer to observe any conflicts that arose during the ballot-counting process and to take notes. A typical conflict involved ballots that were incorrectly filled in, such as the ovals were not fully darkened, but rather had check marks drawn on them. Poll workers who saw this would wave a red flag to get a supervisor’s attention, though the flag also alerted the election monitors and the Republican watchers.\n\n“Oftentimes, we would see one or more Republican watchers go to the table, which they have every right to do,” Nolish said. “But we saw them not respecting the 6-feet rule and then asking questions and interfering with the process.\"\n\nAmong the counters working those tables was 71-year-old Mary Hill, who lives in the New Center area of Detroit and worked the overnight shift from election night until early Wednesday morning, helping to process absentee ballots.\n\nHill recalled seeing \"quite a few challengers\" congregating at a set of doors in the back of the room, where the trucks came in with the mail.\n\n“I don't know if they thought somebody was going to take some ballots off the truck or something. I don't know,\" Hill said. “But we always knew when mail was coming in because they would all be at the door. … There were a lot of them on the floor. … It just seemed like it was a lot of challengers.”\n\nStill, Hill recalled a relatively calm night at her table, noting there were some ballot challenges, including one that appeared to be a name discrepancy: The voter had one name in the poll book, and a hyphenated name in the master record.\n\n\"And it was a woman,\" Hill recalled. \"So we don't know if she got married, and she didn't change her name.”\n\nThe ballot, though, was not automatically invalidated. It was given to election supervisors to review.\n\nHill was relieved to get through the night unscathed, spared from the mayhem that would erupt hours later.\n\n“I was glad I wasn’t there for all that commotion,” Hill said. “That would have probably frightened me to see all that and not understanding what was going on. For me, it was a good experience. I think the people were really dedicated.”\n\nBiden takes the lead, chaos erupts\n\nShortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday, Biden appeared to be ahead of Trump in Michigan for the first time since the polls closed the previous night.\n\nTensions inside TCF grew as Republicans challengers sounded multiple alarms, saying volunteers were needed right away in Detroit.\n\n\"Who is available to go to COBO Hall right now to help monitor the vote? 35K ballots showed up out of nowhere at 3 am. Need help\" a group called the Michigan Trump Republicans 2020 posted on Facebook at 9:39 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nHours later, a similar request was made on Twitter, this one saying 75 more volunteers were needed in Detroit.\n\n\"Help needed now,\" Tweeted a group called Stand Up Michigan. \"Go as soon as possible. We are attempting to mount aggressive challenges.\"\n\nRepublicans showed up in droves. By 1 p.m., there were 227 Republican challengers freely roaming the floor where the ballots were being counted — almost double the 134 they were permitted to have — and more kept coming.\n\nRelated: No, Joe Biden did not magically 'find' votes in Michigan\n\nAnother 268 Democratic challengers were there too — also double the permitted amount — and there were also another 75 nonpartisan challengers.\n\nAs the crowd of challengers swelled, so did COVID-19 fears and security concerns. There were no security checks to get in TCF. There were no metal detectors. And no pat-downs.\n\nThe Trump campaign filed a lawsuit Wednesday to stop the counting of ballots in Michigan.\n\nThe lawsuit came as Biden led Trump by approximately 46,000 votes, with 96% of the estimated votes already tallied. By later afternoon, Biden had amassed a 67,000 vote advantage with almost all of the votes counted.\n\nThe Republican challengers got bolder, at one point forming a circle around the tables and clapping and chanting in unison: 'Stop the count! Stop the count!'\n\nThe police presence grew. Election officials shut it down.\n\nSome saw the battle at the TCF Center as an example of some conservatives, trying to restrict the voting rights of African Americans.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. election officials shut the doors to the absentee ballot counting room and turned away all new challengers, even the ones who had stepped out for a lunch break.\n\n\"If you are a Republican or a Democrat, back up!\" an election official shouted in the room of angry challengers, who felt they were unfairly being kept out.\n\nThey screamed at police, complained to the media and banged on the windows to the counting room.\n\nThat led to more chaos as officials then put cardboard over the windows, saying challengers were videotaping and photographing the counting process, which intimidated the counters.\n\nBut after the windows were covered up, the angry challengers banged louder.\n\nConservatives ‘appalled’ by process\n\nTim Griffin, a Republican organizer and Virginia attorney, stayed all night at the TCF Center, intent on protecting Trump from what he believed was a fraudulent process.\n\nHe complained about the process, alleging Democrats were controlling the counting and far outnumbered Republicans in the room.\n\n“We’re just appalled by what we’re seeing,” said Griffin, who summoned more Republicans to Detroit, only to watch them be turned away.\n\n\"This whole thing is under suspicion,\" Griffin said. \"It's just not fair.\"\n\nMeshawn Maddock, 53, of Milford agreed, alleging Republican attorneys, observers and election challengers were mistreated at the TCF Center on many fronts:\n\nThey were ridiculed and laughed at. Poll books were covered up so they couldn’t see what was written in them, Maddock said. And they were “literally dragged out of the room because of their masks falling down below their nose,\" she said.\n\n“I can't believe the way our people were treated. I mean, it was appalling,” said Maddock, who organized Republican volunteer poll watchers, challengers and their training.\n\nMaddock also scoffed at the COVID-19 rules that required challengers to wear masks or be forced to leave.\n\n“I think it's ridiculous. … Masks are weaponized against the president,” Maddock said. “It’s all hypocrisy, the whole mask thing. Was there a single Democrat dragged out of the room? Or is it just that they are all such good-behaved mask-wearers that didn’t happen? \"\n\n“I think it's ridiculous. … Masks are weaponized against the president,” she said.\n\nMaddock also blasted the covering of the windows with cardboard and paper.\n\n“This was how we were going to shut people out,\" she lamented. \"I mean, where’s the transparency? ... People are being cheated and they feel like something is being stolen from them right now.\"\n\n'Hogwash,' countered Democratic challengers, including several who were also denied access to the counting room in TCF.\n\n“I can’t get there either. I’m a Democrat and I’m a lawyer,” said Bill Richards, an attorney from Beverly Hills who monitored the counting process Wednesday morning, but got locked out later in the afternoon.\n\nRichards said that he was impressed with the counting process, saying challengers could freely roam the center and approach counters from up to 6 feet behind, and even witness inspectors deciding which ballots could be spoiled or not.\n\n“I was totally blown away at the process,” Richards said. “It’s amazing to me that the public is allowed in there.”\n\nLiz Linkewitz, 35, of Harrison Township, said she was there to protect the vote, not challenge it. She didn't make it in to the counting room because she got there after the doors were closed.\n\n“I just want to make sure that all Michigan votes are counted,” said Linkewitz, “This election is, as Joe Biden says, for the soul of our country.”\n\nElection official: Challengers are confused\n\nChris Thomas, a former longtime director of elections for the Michigan Secretary of State, addressed the concerns of Republican challengers and debunked rumors of foul play that circulated on social media.\n\nThomas, who has worked for both Democratic and Republican secretaries of state, and who has offered constructive criticism of the Detroit clerk's performance in previous elections, said he was \"extremely confident\" that Detroit's final vote tally will be right.\n\n\"They're in a good position to come through with a nice clean report,\" Thomas said. \"I don't have any questions about it.\"\n\nThomas also debunked rumors that every Republican challenger had been removed from the counting room, and, that ballots were sneaked into the room in coolers and a wagon.\n\nNeither were true, said Thomas, noting that had secret ballots arrived, Republican challengers inside the room would have raised a ruckus and he would have been notified.\n\n\"I didn't hear that,\" Thomas said.\n\nAnd there was no favoritism shown to any of the challengers, said Thomas, who refuted claims that all Republican were removed. As he spoke, there were more than 100 Republican challengers still freely roaming the counting room, with only four tables left counting.\n\n\"Nobody was mistreated,\" Thomas said, referring to all challengers.\n\nThomas, who has been working with Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey's team to improve procedures, spent long hours overseeing the counting before heading out late Wednesday night.\n\nWhile at TCF, Thomas explained that election officials sought to make sure “that the rules are being followed,\" and that challengers \"have only one person per table at about 134 tables.”\n\n“We just want to make sure that we don’t have too much chaos going on in here,\" said Thomas, responding to Republicans' allegations that they were unfairly left out of the process. \"People are trying to work, get the job done.”\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas said, some challengers don't understand the rules of the counting process.\n\n“Challengers are usually confused” when they first arrive, he said. “A lot of them don’t know the intricacies of the process.”\n\nMeanwhile, as Republicans complained about what was going on inside TCF, a truck with a float known as the “Trump Unity Bridge” circled outside the center. It blared Kid Rock’s song ‘Born Free,’ as a voice piped through a loudspeaker claimed that election fraud was taking place, and that the only valid votes are the ones counted on Election Day, not afterward.\n\nNot true, countered critics and Democratic rivals, including Detroit Will Breathe protesters who took to the streets this week, calling for the ballot count at TCF to continue as the contentious presidential election gripped the nation.\n\n“Don’t fall into fascist fears, all your votes are counted here,” they chanted as many residents came out of their homes.\n\nMany waved. Others put their fists up. Detroit was not going to be silenced.\n\n'Challenge every single ballot'\n\nDemocratic election challenger Khaliluh Gaston, 44, of Detroit went to the TCF Center early Wednesday morning to get trained and certified.\n\nShe started watching the ballots being counted at about 9:30 a.m., when Biden pulled ahead.\n\nBy 11 a.m., things \"started to get a little bit tense,\" she said. The GOP observers appeared more defiant, with many refusing to wear masks and ignoring the 6-foot distance rule, she said.\n\n“I visibly witnessed one man harassing an election worker, standing right over her shoulder very closely when a ballot got rejected from the machine,” said Gaston, who is an urban planner and entrepreneur. “Other observers that were with him came over and asked him to take a walk to let off some steam because he was just getting very, very frustrated.\"\n\nGaston said she also witnessed Republican observers asking election workers whether they were Republican or Democrat.\n\n\"That's not allowed,\" she said, adding that at one point, she heard a Republican election challenger tell her colleagues “challenge every single ballot.”\n\n“Even before a ballot would hit the table, they were saying, ‘We’re going to challenge every ballot at this table,’ “ Gaston recalled, stressing she never witnessed any impropriety on the part of election workers.\n\n\"They stayed committed to the task at hand,” Gaston said.\n\nFor Democratic challenger Palencia Mobley, 40, of Detroit, protecting the absentee vote count process was about justice, fairness and civility.\n\n“I was overcome with so much emotion,” said Mobley, who is the Deputy Director and Chief Engineer for the city water department.“We were there trying to uphold democracy. … It said a lot to me about the length we have to go through to protect our rights, and to uphold civility in this country.”\n\n“I’m proud of Detroit and how we represented for ourselves and ultimately for the rest of the country,” Mobley said.\n\nMobley left the TCF Center about 1 p.m. Wednesday for a work meeting, and returned about 4 p.m. to see angry crowds gathered outside.\n\n“I thought, not in Detroit,” Mobley said. “Are we really trying to infringe upon people’s civil rights?”\n\nStill, she didn’t try to push her way through or go back inside. Instead, Mobley said, she left with a greater appreciation for the people who volunteer and work in the election process, and resolved to do that work herself in future elections.\n\n“The work is important,” Mobley said. “The most important thing now is unifying this country and making a difference for the generations to come.”\n\nBy 5 p.m. Wednesday, Trump supporters and liberal groups had amassed at the entrance to the TCF Center, where Washington Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue meet.\n\nCompeting shouts of \"Stop the vote!\" and \"Count every vote!\" rose from the packed crowd pressed almost against the glass facade of the home of the North American International Auto Show. Nearby, security workers manned the doors and more than a dozen Detroit police stood by, watching from the street.\n\nClose by, a half dozen women and men joined in a circle, singing together in an effort to generate positive vibes. A collection of nuns, priests, ministers and other volunteers from faith groups also circulated throughout the crowd.\n\nAfter 10-15 minutes of ruckus, the crowd slowly began to thin out.\n\nAt 2 p.m. Wednesday, election officials said only 16,000 of Detroit's absentee ballots had yet to be counted. By 4 p.m., there were only six tables of ballots left to be counted. A few hours later that number had dropped to four tables. At 6 p.m. Michigan was called for Biden.\n\nBy 6:30 p.m., as darkness set in, there were nearly as many reporters and photographers as activists at the TCF center.\n\nMeanwhile, on social media, an unsubstantiated post claimed that every Republican election challenger had been ejected from the cavernous basement counting area, leaving only Democrats to eyeball the processing of absentee ballots. Other posts claimed that votes were smuggled into the counting room in boxes and on a wagon.\n\nThe drama in Detroit would wind up on Tucker Carlson's top-rated cable news show on Fox News. A national correspondent for Fox News was inside the TCF, and joined Carlson for a live broadcast.\n\nCarlson set up the exchange by noting that news organizations had declared Biden the winner in Michigan and adding \"we're seeing a lot of strange things happen in that state tonight, including poll watchers apparently being blocked from watching the count, and that's not a good sign.\"\n\nWhat Carlson failed to say was that hundreds of vote challengers were still inside the count room, observing the vote count. And the paper taped to the windows blocked anyone — regardless of party — in the basement of the TCF Center from peering in at poll workers.\n\nThe Fox News correspondent explained to Carlson that officials ordered some windows covered because protesters were pounding on the glass and election workers were concerned they were filming information on ballots.\n\nCarlson thanked the reporter for his report and opined: \"Detroit, Michigan, one of the most mismanaged places in the Western hemisphere. Now tonight, helping to pick your president.\"\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nFrom midnight Wednesday to Thursday morning, election workers slowly trickled out of the counting room, some carrying cushions they had been sitting on during hours of pushing paper.\n\nBy 4:30 a.m., there were few people left. A handful of Republican election challengers, random election workers, and a couple of police who would guard the room — and the ballots — until their next stop.\n\nWith the counting finally done, the responsibility for certifying the vote totals now shifts to the Wayne County Board of Canvassers. The panel of two Republicans and two Democrats has two weeks to challenge or confirm the count before sending the results to the State Board of Canvassers, who will certify Michigan's results.\n\nThe angry voices in and around the TCF Center had faded before the moon rose, and long before the sun shone on what would turn out to be a gorgeous Michigan fall day.\n\nIn the end, what remained at the TCF Center on Thursday morning was perhaps one thing that the fractured country can agree on. The massive electronic sign outside the center read in bright letters: DEFEAT RONA.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nTresa Baldas is an award-winning courts and legal issues reporter and was named the 2020 Richard Milliman \"Michigan\" Journalist of the Year by the Michigan Press Association.

Some of those holes are already being tested by local officials, such as refusing to certify elections at the county level, according to Matthew Seligman, a fellow at Stanford's Constitutional Law Center and co-author of the 2024 book \"How to Steal a Presidential Election.\"\n\n\"Due to the changes in the Electoral Count Reform Act, the effort has shifted to try to get county boards of elections, and then potentially state-level boards of election, to have some kind of authority to refuse to certify the election results,\" Seligman told USA TODAY.\n\nIn 2020, Trump tried to persuade Republican members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count the Electoral College votes after Joe Biden won the election.\n\nThe Electoral Count Reform Act makes that approach more difficult by clarifying that the vice president's vote-counting role is ceremonial and by raising the number of votes in Congress needed to object to election results.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nProcedure changes in vote-counting and election certification at the state and local level − which supporters say are meant to bolster confidence and accuracy in elections − are now the battleground.\n\nThis year has seen last-minute rule changes from the Georgia State Election Board and commissioners in a key Nevada swing county voting against certifying elections.\n\nThese \"misguided attempts by the State Election Board will delay election results and undermine chain of custody safeguards,\" warned Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in a statement about recent rule changes by the state election board.\n\nEven if the local officials did try to reverse an election using the means laid out below, they very well could fail: A statewide election administrator or governor could intervene, and courts could block efforts to overturn the results – just as they rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies in 2020.\n\nHowever, election law experts say the risks show that vulnerabilities still exist, and the system depends on the integrity of the officials and judges in power.\n\n\"Means, motive, and opportunity are here to flip this, and that creates real danger,\" Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor and Seligman's \"How to Steal a Presidential Election\" co-author, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"To the extent the folks who want to overturn elections think they have identified a vulnerability, I think it is at the county level,\" Adav Noti, executive director of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, told USA TODAY.\n\nHere's a look at what the Electoral Count Reform Act did and three possible strategies for overturning the election in spite of it:\n\nThe 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act\n\nIn every presidential election, each state certifies its results and appoints electors who meet in mid-December to cast votes for president and vice president. The electors send certificates of their presidential electoral votes to the federal government. Congress then meets on Jan. 6 of the new year to count the electoral votes.\n\nStarting in 1887, the Electoral Count Act governed procedures for counting presidential electoral votes. The 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act modified those rules, including by clarifying that the vice president's constitutional role of opening electors' vote certificates for counting doesn't include the power to unilaterally reject votes – a position Pence and prominent legal experts across the political spectrum maintained even before the new law.\n\nThe new law also requires Congress to honor the state's certification unless a court has ordered it to be modified, with an expedited process for federal courts to hear disputes.\n\nWhat's true? What's false? Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter for all the answers.\n\nLosing candidate is certified at time of deadline\n\nThe Electoral Count Reform Act requires a state's governor – or another official, if designated by the state in advance – to certify the state's presidential electors six days before the electors vote in mid-December. In 2024, those dates fall on Dec. 11 and 17, respectively.\n\nThat provides a little more than a month for courts to address disputes over a state's election results, such as whether the state included unlawful votes or excluded lawful ones.\n\nPicture this scenario: One candidate is ahead in Georgia after the election, and then a state court judge throws out a number of absentee ballots, resulting in the other candidate leading in the vote. The first candidate appeals that decision, but the other candidate's lawyers flood the court system with delay-inducing filings before the appeals courts can rule, and the governor certifies Georgia's electors for the second candidate when the deadline arrives.\n\n\"There are a million ways for lawyers to slow a process down, so if they slow the process down till after the governor's supposed to certify, they've won, even if they ultimately shouldn't have won,\" Lessig said.\n\nLessig described the scenario as the most \"fear-inducing\" ahead of November.\n\nWhat if a certification deadline is missed?\n\nIf a county or state doesn't certify its results on time, the Electoral Count Reform Act doesn't provide a way for the state's electoral votes to be counted by Congress on Jan. 6.\n\nA number of states have already seen individual county officials refuse to certify election results since 2020.\n\nIn Reno, Nevada's Washoe County, for example, the majority of the election board voted 'no' on certification in two local elections in July before reversing course about a week later. A Republican member of Atlanta's Fulton County election board refused to certify a primary election in May and is suing over what she claims is her right to do that again.\n\nA USA TODAY review found that local officials have either delayed certifying or voted against certifying election results at least three dozen times since the 2020 election, although those efforts haven't resulted in overturning an outcome.\n\n\"Every governor in every battleground state I think is very clearly going to do the right thing, but they may not be able to certify the actual winning electors in the state because of earlier-in-the-process delay and manipulation,\" Seligman said.\n\nThe Georgia State Election Board is facing several lawsuits over last-minute rule changes that the board's critics fear risk certification delays or failures. For example, one recent rule requires counties to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying results. Another rule requires local precincts to hand-count ballots and confirm the totals match figures produced through machine processes.\n\nTo \"prevent chaos in November,\" Democrats have asked an Atlanta judge to declare ahead of the election that the Nov. 12 certification deadline for Georgia counties is mandatory, and the new rules don't change that.\n\nRepublican board member Janice Johnston, one of the three members behind the rules, pushed back at a Sept. 23 meeting against fears that the rules could be a basis to not certify. \"These rules will help to prevent a last-minute surprise of questioning the results,\" she said.\n\nAnother of those members, Janelle King, has told USA TODAY no approved rules would allow county officials to break the law by delaying certification.\n\nAny effort to block certification at the county level could run into a state official determined to see it happen on schedule.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Raffensperger spokesperson Mike Hassinger said Georgia law explicitly requires counties to certify their elections by Nov. 12, and Raffensperger's \"expectation is that all Counties will follow the law and certify their results by that date.\"\n\nStatewide election officials in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin have told USA TODAY they are ready to take local officials to court if they refuse to certify the November presidential election. Raffensperger said it may not be necessary to engage with a Georgia county that doesn't certify, but his office will ultimately make sure counties follow the law.\n\n\"There will be a lawsuit filed at 5:01 p.m. on November 12 in Georgia if one of their 159 counties doesn't certify,\" said David Becker, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, which works with Republican and Democratic election officials to build confidence in elections.\n\nCourts may not know what to do\n\nBecause the Electoral Count Reform Act is new, there's no history for courts to rely on when it comes to interpreting the law.\n\nIf a governor defies a court order, for example, to certify his or her state's election for a particular candidate, the act doesn't spell out what should happen next. Would the court system say Congress is permitted – or even required – to count the votes of a slate of electors that the governor refused to certify?\n\nThat's just one question courts may have to grapple with in a short timeline.\n\nSylvia Albert, director of voting and elections for the nonpartisan, nonprofit Common Cause, told USA TODAY judges would have little guidance in resolving election issues − not just because there won't be significant precedent from previous legal cases to guide them, but also because the behind-the-scenes congressional negotiations that resulted in the law didn't leave a large record to guide courts.\n\n\"That is the kind of big black hole of – we don't know how a court is going to interpret cases around the ECRA,\" she said.\n\nJustin Levitt, a Loyola Marymount law professor who has published extensively on election issues, told USA TODAY he couldn't foresee courts producing a result that even arguably deviates from the will of the voters unless the election comes down to just hundreds of votes in a single state, as with the Bush versus Gore presidential election in 2000. Levitt pointed to the 2020 experience – in which Trump lost nearly all of more than 60 court challenges – as evidence of that.\n\n\"The law doesn't support just throwing nonsense against the wall and seeing what sticks, as we saw real clear in 2020.\"\n\nContributing: Erin Mansfield", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/20/florida-elections-what-you-need-know-how-vote-under-new-desantis-election-law/10086583002/", "title": "Election 2022: How to vote in Florida under DeSantis' new law ...", "text": "We're heading into Florida's 2022 election season and you might be forgiven if you're not quite sure how to go about it.\n\nLast year, after Gov. Ron DeSantis previously declared the 2020 election was the “smoothest and most successful election of any state,” he nonetheless called for a new bill adding numerous restrictions to the voting process with the stated goal of making state and local elections more secure.\n\nThe first bill (SB 90) requires more information to update existing voter registrations, doubles how often vote-by-mail (absentee) ballots must be requested, limits who can collect and drop off ballots, limits where and when drop boxes may be used, adds required language for non-government groups running voter registration drives and drastically increases potential fines for deadline violations, and expands the no-solicitation zone for polling places. It also prohibits local and state officials from using outside funding for election-related expenses, even during emergencies. The first bill passed along partisan lines and DeSantis signed it live on FOX News.\n\nThe law was immediately challenged in court by the Florida League of Women Voters, NAACP and other plaintiffs. A federal judge struck down parts of the law in March as being unconstitutional and discriminatory against Black voters.\n\nBut an appeals court issued a stay of the judge's ruling in May, keeping the law in place for the upcoming elections. Arguments in the case are scheduled to take place in September, before a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWalker's ruling:Federal judge rules Florida lawmakers intentionally discriminated against Black voters\n\nA 'grotesque history':Key excerpts in judge's scathing ruling on new Florida voting law\n\nIn April, DeSantis signed SB 524 to create a new security office to investigate claims of voter fraud, and to increase penalties for anyone violating state election laws. The new law also took aim at so-called \"ballot harvesting,\" making it a felony, and required election officials to update (and potentially purge) voter rolls annually\n\nSo what has changed?\n\nFor many Floridians, not much. For some, quite a lot. Here's what you need to know to cast a vote in the Sunshine State.\n\n'Integrity and transparency':DeSantis signs controversial Florida election law with 2022 looming\n\nWho can vote in Florida?\n\nAny Florida resident who is a citizen of the United States, 18 and older, who has not been adjudicated mentally incapacitated with respect to voting in any state without having the right restored and has not been convicted of a felony without civil rights being restored.\n\nDoes Florida require an ID to vote?\n\nYes, you must provide a current and valid ID with a photo and signature. Any one of the following is acceptable:\n\nFlorida driver’s license\n\nFlorida identification card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles\n\nUnited States passport\n\nDebit or credit card\n\nMilitary identification\n\nStudent identification\n\nRetirement center identification\n\nNeighborhood association identification\n\nPublic assistance identification\n\nVeteran health identification card issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nLicense to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued pursuant to s. 790.06\n\nEmployee identification card issued by any branch, department, agency, or entity of the Federal Government, the state, a county, or a municipality.\n\nIf you don't have valid ID you still will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot, which will be counted provided you are eligible to vote, you voted in the correct precinct, and your signature matches the one on file.\n\nWhat time are the polls open in Florida?\n\nThe polls are open on Election Day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in whatever time zone you live in. Any voters still in line at 7 p.m. will be permitted to cast a ballot however long it takes.\n\nHow do I find my polling place?\n\nIt's listed on your voter registration card, or you can look it up at your county's Supervisor of Elections website. Here's how to find yours.\n\nCan I vote by mail in Florida?\n\nYes. You do not have to provide a reason and there are no eligibility requirements. Vote-by-mail (or absentee) ballots must be completed and received by election officials by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Be sure to follow the instructions on the envelope; missing signatures can get your ballot delayed or thrown out.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: You'll have to request them twice as often. Before, you could request mail ballots through the next two general elections (the next four years). Now you must request them every time.\n\nAlso, when you request a mail ballot you must provide your driver's license number, a state-issued ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number, whatever matches what's in your records, as opposed to simply providing your birthday or signature. This may cause problems for older people who registered long enough ago that such documents are not on file. There is also no alternative given if you don't have either number.\n\nIn Duval County about 33,000 voters were notified by mail they had to update their records to get a mail-in ballot. This information is also necessary if they wish to switch party registration or change an address by going online or over the phone.\n\nElections officials in Florida are now prohibited from sending out unrequested vote-by-mail ballots. No Florida officials actually did this, but officials in other states have. During the height of the pandemic, some election officials sent out ballots to help voters who wanted to stay distanced. California sends mail ballots to all registered voters in all elections.\n\nElection security:As GOP looks to restrict Florida mail ballots, advocates unveil report that process worked\n\nCan I vote by drop box in Florida?\n\nYes.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: The convenience and, in some cases, the possibility.\n\nDrop boxes are secure metal boxes where you can slip your sealed ballot like mailing a letter. Previously these were placed at various places around the state for 24/7 use and monitored by elections workers, video surveillance or law enforcement personnel.\n\nNow drop boxes may only be at the Supervisor of Election's office or outside early voting sites, open only during early voting hours, and monitored at all times, in person, by an election worker. Apart from the Supervisor of Election's dropbox, all the others will be limited to 8-12 hours a day.\n\nWithout the option of video surveillance or other monitoring besides an elections worker, a supervisor may face a fine of $25,000 if that person takes a bathroom break during official hours so extra manpower will be required for each one.\n\nDrop boxes will now likely be fewer in number, in fewer locations, only open for a limited time during the day, and will close the third day before an election.\n\nIt's estimated that about 1.5 million Floridians used drop boxes during the 2020 general election.\n\nNo more 'drop boxes':Voting drop boxes are now called 'secure ballot intake stations:' New language will cost taxpayers\n\nDoes Florida allow early voting?\n\nYes. Early voting, when you can go to a designated place before Election Day and vote just as you would on Election Day, is required for any election that includes a state or federal office race. The same requirements and eligibility apply.\n\nWhen are the 2022 elections in Florida?\n\nFlorida's next State Primary Election will be held Tuesday, August 23, 2022. The deadline to register to vote in the primary is Monday, July 25. The deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot is Saturday, August 13.\n\nThe State General Election will be Tuesday, November 8, 2022. The deadline to register to vote in the general election is Tuesday, October 11. The deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot is Saturday, October 29.\n\nWhen is early voting in Florida?\n\nThe early voting period must start on at least the 10th day before the election and end on the third day before the election for a minimum of eight days of early voting, although Supervisors of Elections may expand that if desired. Early voting hours may run from eight to 12 hours per day for each site.\n\nEarly voting may be provided for elections without state or federal races, at the supervisor's discretion.\n\nCan someone drop off my ballot for me in Florida?\n\nYes.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: They can't drop off very many. The new law restricts the number of signed, sealed ballots one person may possess to two besides their own, except immediate family members, and makes violation of this a felony.\n\nBallot collection, criticized as ballot harvesting, is where a voter fills out an absentee ballot, seals it with all the required security checks, and hands it to another person to mail it in or drop it off at an authorized location on their behalf.\n\nCriminalizing the practice largely affects third-party, get-out-the-vote types of programs from political groups, community organizations and churches, or even just friendly neighbors, that helped voters for whom transportation was a problem. Proponents of this change say it strikes against bad actors who might throw away ballots from people of opposing parties, although experts say this is extremely rare and most claims of it have been disproven.\n\nCritics say this change will disproportionately affect minorities and the elderly, and voters who need assistance voting but do not have family available to help.\n\nBallot harvesting, open primaries, double voting:Explaining the vexing vernacular of elections\n\nCan I organize voter registrations?\n\nYes. But you must register with the state, you'll need to carefully document each person you help to sign up, and you can incur harsh penalties for failing to comply with all regulations.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: Community organizations must now warn applicants that the organization \"might not\" get their registration in on time. Organizations that fail to submit voter applications within 14 days already incurred a $50 fine for each one, but the annual cap on fines has been raised from $1,000 to $50,000.\n\nCritics worry that may have a chilling effect on churches, nonprofits and other third-party organizations that have traditionally set up registration drives but now fear financial ruin for mistakes or targeted accusations.\n\nThird parties are the fourth-leading registrars in the state, behind the DHSMV, elections offices and RegisterToVoteFlorida.gov.\n\n‘It’s too important’:Fight to overcome barriers to voter registration in Florida endures\n\nCan I vote in Florida if I'm homeless?\n\nYes, if you are otherwise eligible. Check the voter information page on the Florida Coalition to End Homelessness website for more details.\n\nCan I vote in Florida if I am a convicted felon?\n\nMaybe, if your voting rights have been restored (check here) and you are fully paid up for any fines or fees incurred or restitution owed. You can get help at the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.\n\nBe aware that this can be extremely confusing to work out and ignorance of your status may not save you from prosecution if you're not actually eligible yet.\n\nPay up to vote:Federal appeals court blocks Florida's felons from voting until fees and fines are paid\n\nMore:Florida election officials offered inmates a chance to vote; it got them prosecuted\n\nCan I register to vote online in Florida?\n\nYes. Just go to RegistertoVoteFlorida.gov .\n\nHow do I check my voter registration in Florida?\n\nYou can make sure you're still registered and all the information is correct by going here. Since voter rolls may now be purged annually, you should do this every year well in time to address it before any voting deadlines.\n\nWhat is 'voter solicitation' in Florida?\n\nGood question. Florida already banned anyone from asking for votes, seeking signatures, taking polls or handing out material within 100 feet of a polling place. That has been expanded to 150 feet and drop box locations have been added, and solicitation now includes \"engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter.\" There is no indication of what activities that might include, or who decides.\n\nThe new law doesn't specifically say that anyone besides poll workers are prohibited from handing out food or water to people waiting in line to vote (unlike Georgia's voting law, which does) but by remaining vague it could serve as a deterrent for anyone hoping to help people weather the wait. That's a problem for a state that has previously been nationally infamous for voting lines lasting long hours.\n\nWill the new law reduce voter fraud in Florida?\n\nIt's hard to see how, since there wasn't much to begin with. An Associated Press investigation of the 2020 presidential election found fewer than 475 potential cases of voter fraud out of 25.5 million ballots cast in the six states where President Donald Trump and his allies disputed his loss to President Joe Biden, and none of the lawsuits filed by Trump's people proved the existence of fraud in any meaningful amount.\n\nMore:DeSantis signs bill to create new elections security force to investigate potential ballot fraud\n\nContributors: John Kennedy, USA TODAY NETWORK-FLORIDA; Mike Diamond and Jeff Burlew, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nC.

The USA TODAY Fact Check team is dedicated to verifying claims and fighting misinformation. Here's a list of recent fact-checks related to the 2020 election:\n\nOn counting votes\n\nFact check: Typo led to false post about Michigan votes showing up 'magically' for Biden\n\nA typo by a local Michigan county accounts for a sudden increase in Biden votes. The error was quickly corrected, and framing the incident as evidence of fraud is a gross mischaracterization.\n\nFact check: Democrat-led states did not stop counting votes for no reason\n\nMail-in ballots take longer to count, so many states counted overnight. Reports of counting delays or stoppages were either explained or false.\n\nFact check: That spike in the Wisconsin vote tally was expected and legitimate, not fraud\n\nThe vote tally in Wisconsin jumped at 3:30 a.m. on Nov. 4 because that's when officials finished counting the city of Milwaukee's absentee ballots, a group of votes expected to lean heavily left. It's false to call the spike in the voting count fraud.\n\nFact check: No, Wisconsin did not take a break from counting election results\n\nSome of the state's election results arrived late due to an influx of mail-in ballots, not because officials took a break. And President-elect Joe Biden never held a large lead there.\n\nFact check: Post-election ballot counting not dependent on state's party\n\nNone of the seven key states left in play on Nov. 4 were fully Democrat-run, some more than others. And, the time it took to count ballots in each state can be explained by circumstances or state law.\n\nFact check: Claim saying ongoing ballot counting is cheating, voter fraud is inaccurate\n\nA claim that ongoing ballot counting in Pennsylvania is cheating or fraudulent is false.\n\nFact check: Votes in Virginia accidentally tallied for Biden, error quickly fixed\n\nThere were 100,000 Central Absentee Precinct ballots that were mistakenly entered for Joe Biden in Fairfax County's unofficial election results spreadsheet, but the error was quickly noticed and fixed. The county's spreadsheet has been amended, and the state Board of Election's total votes counted tally never reflected the error.\n\nFact check: Georgia ballot curing is not election fraud\n\nBallot curing is a legal process that ensures voters who cast their ballots by Election Day have a chance to see their vote counted. It's allowed in many states, and there is no evidence ballot curing was used to commit election fraud in Georgia.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin county did not have a glitch that stole votes from Trump\n\nA data entry error by the Associated Press left presidential totals transposed for several minutes, but election officials were not involved. The votes in Rock County were counted following standard procedure.\n\nFact check: No, Wisconsin votes don’t have to be counted by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3\n\nVoters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote. No judge made this ruling, and an earlier ruling from a federal judge — since upheld by an appeals panel — actually did the opposite, allowing any absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nOn the outcome, past election comparisons\n\nFact check: Trump lost the 2020 presidential election\n\nAnalyses of the 2020 election results explain Trump's loss to Biden.\n\nFact check: Joe Biden has secured enough electors from certified results to be elected president\n\nIn the false map, Gateway Pundit excludes results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President-elect Joe Biden won all six states, and all six have certified their results.\n\nFact check: Joe Biden legally won presidential election, despite persistent contrary claims\n\nBiden legally won the popular vote and obtained enough electoral votes to claim the win. There's no evidence of voter fraud, despite widespread, unfounded claims.\n\nFact check: Joe Biden outperformed Hillary Clinton in most major metro areas\n\nBiden received more votes than Hillary Clinton in many of the country's major metro areas. The claims that the four swing states listed are led by Democrats and that votes exceeded the number of voters registered in those states are also false.\n\nFact check: Biden won popular, Electoral College votes in several battleground states\n\nThe claim references unproven and falsified allegations to support statements about flipping votes in battleground states from Biden to Trump. There is no evidence to support claims of cheating, outstanding software glitches or illegal voting in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFact check: Biden won the most total votes – and the fewest total counties – of any president-elect\n\nWith over 81 million votes, Biden received the most votes of any presidential candidate in history. It is also true that he won a record-low number of counties – but counties vary by population size, so those wins don't correlate with the popular vote.\n\nFact check: Meme is missing context, potentially misleads on support for Biden, Trump and Obama\n\nPeople vote, not places, and Biden won the most populous counties in the country, according to a Census Bureau report. It's also disingenuous to suggest Biden's small campaign events indicated a lack of support, given the ongoing viral pandemic.\n\nFact check: Biden got record number of popular votes despite small campaign events\n\nThe Trump campaign disregarded many COVID-19 precautions and hosted large crowds, while Biden made following coronavirus guidelines central to his efforts. Biden's lack of crowds does not translate to a lack of support from voters, but rather a consistent adherence to pandemic safety guidelines.\n\nFact check: After endorsing him, New York Post now pushes Trump to accept Biden's victory\n\nBased on our research, the claim that the New York Post published a cover and staff editorial urging President Trump to accept defeat is true; the items were published in print and online on Dec. 27.\n\nFact check: These 5 election statistics do not discredit Joe Biden's victory\n\nSocial media shared a meme with statistics that they claim discredits Joe Biden's victory. The meme compares information about former President Barack Obama in 2008 and President Donald Trump and Biden in 2020. It lists total number of votes received, includes the number of counties each candidate won; the fraction of bellwether counties each candidate won; whether they won Florida, Ohio and Iowa; and whether each candidate's political party won seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOn calling states, certifying votes\n\nFact check: 14 of the first 25 states called went to Trump, contrary to viral claims\n\nThe claim that blue states were called immediately, while red states were not is false. Of the first 25 states called by the Associated Press, 14 were for Trump. There's also no evidence vote counting was paused to \"find\" ballots.\n\nFact check: Key Senate races left uncalled due to uncounted ballots, not fraud\n\nThe five states still not called on Nov. 5 still had unreported votes outstanding. None of those states had elected new Republican senators when the post was made, though some races appear as if they may eventually.\n\nFact check: Statistical analysis supporting pro-Trump Supreme Court case is 'ludicrous'\n\nThe votes still uncounted when Trump had his short-lived lead were largely absentee ballots from major cities. Those cities have consistently voted Democratic historically, and mail-in votes within them should be expected to lean even more that direction since Trump had attacked that method of voting leading up to the election while Biden encouraged it.\n\nFact check: CNN never made – or retracted – Arizona call for Joe Biden\n\nA spokesperson for CNN said the news network never called Arizona for Biden, and USA TODAY found no evidence indicating otherwise.\n\nFact check: Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted twice on certifying election results\n\nThe board of canvassers did initially split in a 2-2 vote, officials reversed course a few hours later and certified election results in Wayne County based on the condition that a comprehensive audit be conducted on precincts with out-of-balance tallies.\n\nFact check: Trump lawyer Sidney Powell falsely stated he won election 'by a landslide'\n\nSidney Powell did make the claim that Trump won the election \"by a landslide,\" the assertion is false. Joe Biden is the president-elect after having garnered enough electoral votes as a result of the popular vote across the country earlier this month.\n\nFact check: Nevada's AG did not admit to changing signature verification manually in election\n\nThe statement regarding allegations that votes were changed by a signature verification machine was made by the former attorney general of Nevada, a Republican and co-chairman of the Nevada Trump campaign, and not by current Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat.\n\nFact check: Political news website never called Pennsylvania for Joe Biden\n\nReal Clear Politics never called Pennsylvania or switched it from Biden as many social media posts claim, according to its co-founder and president, Tom Bevan, as well as its Washington bureau chief, Carl M. Cannon.\n\nFact check: Some electoral maps show Trump leading with 232 votes. They're wrong.\n\nEpoch Times, Gateway Pundit, and EveryLegalVote.com show a different electoral vote count for two reasons: They exclude states with pending litigation or recounts, subtracting votes from Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, and in one case Virginia, from Biden. They also called North Carolina for Trump, though the state was not done counting as of publication time and has not been called by the Associated Press. Their counts are incorrect.\n\nFact check: Election unlikely to be decided in the House, even if Trump refuses to concede\n\nWhile all presidential elections have the potential to be decided in the House of Representatives under the Constitution, the post fails to mention key steps needed in order for the election to go to the House. Even if the election results were contested and Trump doesn't concede, experts have agreed that it is unlikely for Trump to win the election this way.\n\nFact check: Map showing Trump landslide based on false report of seized election servers in Germany\n\nThe false claim that Donald Trump received 410 electoral votes and Joe Biden received 128 is based on false reports that the U.S. Army seized servers with election information on them in a recent raid in Germany.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin bill does not decertify results and give Trump the win\n\nA Wisconsin Legislature bill would prioritize legislation addressing election laws. But it says nothing related to decertification or awarding the state to Trump. And in any case, the state’s electoral votes were already cast for Biden weeks ago. The claim is false.\n\nFact check: False news report indicates Biden plans to step down as president-elect\n\nA claim that President-elect Joe Biden is stepping down because of health concerns is false, the news report that makes the statement is faked.\n\nFact check: Trump pressured officials in Georgia to recalculate state's vote in his favor\n\nOn Jan. 3, the Washington Post broke the news of an hourlong call in which President Donald Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes.\" Since then, Trump has doubled down on his baseless claims of electoral fraud, while Democrats have expressed outrage.\n\nFact check: No, court did not rule 200,000 Wisconsin ballots were illegitimate\n\nA Wisconsin statute allows voters to declare themselves as \"indefinitely confined.\" They can then cast an absentee ballot without providing a photo ID, as would be required for in-person voting or a traditional absentee ballot. Trump and other Republicans have attacked this method of voting as improper. A final ruling from the state Supreme Court released Dec. 14 said it's up to each voter whether they meet the requirements for being \"indefinitely confined\" — not clerks or anyone else.\n\nOn voter registration, turnout\n\nFact check: Wisconsin has more registered voters than ballots cast\n\nThe number for registered Wisconsin voters stated by a Facebook image is incorrect. Over 3.6 million voters were registered in the state as of Nov. 1, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which denied there being more ballots than registered voters.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin turnout in line with past elections, didn't jump 22% as claimed\n\nTurnout is measured as a percentage of eligible voters, not registered voters. Donald Trump Jr.’s figures use eligible voters for the 2016 figure but registered voters for 2020. Using the proper denominator for 2020 shows a turnout around 72%, firmly in the range of past presidential elections.\n\nFact check: Milwaukee wards did not have more votes for president than registered voters\n\nThe numbers cited by Milwaukee City Wire do not match data from the Milwaukee County clerk’s office, which show the number of registered voters exceeded ballots cast.\n\nFact check: Claim of Georgia vote spike for Biden after pipe burst at counting site is false\n\nThe pipe leak happened early in the morning of Nov. 3, while ballot counting without monitors took place Nov. 4 and was not related to the pipe incident.\n\nFact check: Over 159 million people voted in the US general election\n\nThe claim cites correct vote totals for Trump (74 million) and Biden (81 million), but it falsely reports the number of registered voters. More than 159 million registered voters cast ballots in the general election, out of 239 million eligible voters.\n\nFact check: False claim that 'fake votes' found during recount in Dane County, Wis.\n\nThe repeated initials referred to in the claim aren’t those of a voter; they’re initials of the clerk who issued the absentee ballots.\n\nFact check: Image from 2017 White House event altered to make claim about votes for Biden\n\nThe original image is from a 2017 event where Trump spoke about deregulation goals and cut a ribbon across stacks of paper that represented current regulations and 1960 regulations.\n\nFact check: States don't have more than 100% voter turnout in an election\n\nUpdated data and individual state reporting show no state had more than 100% voter turnout for the 2020 election. The implication that Democrats doctored election results to show higher turnout than possible is based off outdated data that has since been updated.\n\nFact check: There was strong Navajo support for Biden, but numbers cited in claim have changed\n\nThe statistics in the social media posts are inaccurate – possibly because they came from an article that cited returns before the full vote count was in. However, it is true that among the three Arizona counties that overlap the Navajo Nation, the vote went 58% to Biden and 42% to Trump, with some individual precincts on the Navajo Nation up to 90% for Biden.\n\nFact check: Claim that voting noncitizens affected 2020 election outcome is unverified\n\nVoting in federal elections is reserved for U.S. citizens and few noncitizens knowingly register to vote. The claim that voter turnout from noncitizens affected the popular vote in the 2020 presidential race in battleground states is plausible but unproven.\n\nFact check: Dual language ballots create confusion in Georgia's Gwinnett County data\n\nThe Voting Rights Act ensures language assistance to individuals not proficient in English by providing electoral material and other information in their native language. Gwinnett County meets the thresholds to require electoral material in another language due to its sizable Latino or Hispanic population. Single ballots are thus printed on two sheets, one in English and one in Spanish, which are both counted in the county's election summary results and cannot be omitted under federal law.\n\nFact check: North Carolina vote total for governor didn't exceed ballots cast\n\nOur research of the official vote tally shows the assertion that only 4.5 million votes were cast is wrong, rendering moot any issue about a purported half-million or more \"extra\" votes. The vote totals for two gubernatorial candidates are correct for the time the claim was made, but they are incomplete, missing three candidates. Any suggestions of fraud are baseless\n\nFact check: Kanye West, other third-party candidates, not leading in Kentucky voting\n\nThe screenshot showing a number of third-party presidential candidates leading at the polls in Kentucky depicts fake election results. Kanye West has not received 40,000 votes in Kentucky.\n\nFact check: Michigan townships had more registered voters than votes\n\nThe claim that four townships in Michigan logged 290,000 more votes than there are people is false. Voter turnout data shows no township in Michigan had more than 100% turnout for the 2020 presidential election. There were some cases of errors in voter turnout rates, however, the errors were fixed, and there is no evidence that four townships logged more votes than there are people.\n\nFact check: False claim of fraud in Arizona voter registrations\n\nThere is no proof behind the claim that 2,012 Arizona voters are registered under one address.\n\nElection Day debunks\n\nFact check: Pennsylvania voters exposed to COVID-19 can still vote\n\nPennsylvania officials did not \"attempt to silence voters\" exposed to COVID-19 by telling them via letter they can't vote in person. Letters have been sent to Pennsylvanians exposed to the coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic, and the letter makes no mention of the election.\n\nFact check: Poll watcher turned away at Philadelphia polling station in misunderstanding\n\nA poll watcher was turned away from a Philadelphia polling station due to a legal misunderstanding, but he was allowed back in after the mistake was recognized. This appears to be an isolated incident.\n\nFact check: 'Nothing wrong' with Kentucky county's voting Nov. 3, clerk says\n\nA Facebook post made on Oct. 13 about a voting holdup in Fayette County, Kentucky, was shared as if it was made on Nov. 3. While there was a brief hold up in voting the day the post was created, the Fayette County clerk said the delay was mischaracterized in the post – and the timing of the post's share is misleading.\n\nFact check: Video misrepresents timing and severity of Scranton ballot-scanning machine outage\n\nVoting machines did go down in several polling districts in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the morning of Election Day, but all machines were up and running in under 2.5 hours. The video, labeled \"BREAKING,\" was shared several hours after the issues were fixed.\n\nFact check: Image does not show massive wall in front of White House\n\nThe image at hand does not show a massive wall in front of the White House; it's fabricated from a 2009 image. The National Park Service confirmed the photo does not resemble the actual fencing at the White House that federal authorities did put up.\n\nFact check: Bricks in Detroit are for construction projects, not to incite violence\n\nThere's no evidence bricks were purposely staged in Detroit to incite violence. Detroit police and the owner of a local construction company confirmed the bricks photographed are for construction projects.\n\nFact check: No one was allowed to vote after Nov. 3\n\nDespite the post's claims, all Americans, including Democrats, must vote on or before Election Day. Mail-in ballots must be postmarked by that day.\n\nOn election technology\n\nFact check: Dominion Voting machines create ballots only for audits, testing\n\nIt is true that Dominion Voting machines create ballots, for testing, audits and after a voter has voted and approves the ballot creation. But assertions that machines can be hacked, votes were dumped and test ballots can be counted are false. The federal government and election experts discovered no election fraud on the part of Dominion Voting Systems or its voting machines.\n\nFact check: Dominion voting machines didn't delete votes from Trump, switch them to Biden\n\nA national election security coalition announced on Thursday that \"there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\" Other experts and Dominion itself also condemned the claims.\n\nFact check: Claims linking Dominion Voting Systems to Democrats are wrong or misleading\n\nIt is true that Nancy's Pelosi's former chief of staff is a lobbyist for Dominion Voting Systems, which supplied the election software in Michigan and other states. But Republicans have lobbying ties to Dominion, as well, making this claim partly false.\n\nFact check: Video claim that Dominion tech manipulated Georgia votes is false\n\nState and local election officials and a spokesperson for Dominion explain such manipulation is not possible. Our research uncovered no evidence to support the claim.\n\nFact check: False claim that electronic voting software companies Dominion and Smartmatic have closed\n\nNeither Dominion nor Smartmatic has closed in the aftermath of the election and their CEOs are not \"on the run.\"\n\nFact check: A 37-vote change in Georgia was the result of human error, not vote-flipping\n\nState and local elections officials have denied the claim and explained that a 37-vote difference was the result of a human tabulation error, not the fault of Dominion.\n\nFact check: Viral photo shows fake logo and slogan for Dominion Voting Systems\n\nArchived and current versions of Dominion Voting System's logo show that the company's actual logo is a red ballot going into a red ballot box, suggesting the image in posts online is a doctored version of the authentic logo.\n\nFact check: School bus in Arizona was full of office equipment, not voting machines\n\nThe Buckeye Police Department confirmed that the bus contained \"office equipment,\" not voting machines.\n\nFact check: No, Joe Biden's brother-in-law does not own Dominion Voting Systems\n\nThere is no familial relationship between Joe Biden's relatives with the last name Owens and Stephen Owens, the co-founder of a private equity firm that acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.\n\nFact check: Hugo Chávez's family does not own Dominion Voting Systems\n\nHugo Chávez did not found Dominion Voting Systems, nor does his family own a stake of the company. Dominion was founded in Canada in 2003 and its majority owner is Staple Street Capital, which is based in New York.\n\nClaims of discarded, destructed ballots\n\nFact check: Trump ballots were not thrown out as claimed by fake poll worker\n\nInstagram user @omg_seabass, who claimed to be an Erie County poll worker, is not in any way associated with the county, and the claim has been denied by Carl J. Anderson III, the chair of Erie County's Board of Elections. Additionally, poll workers do not have access to marked-up ballots in a way that would allow disposal.\n\nFact check: False claim that viral video shows Trump ballots being burned\n\nCity officials in Virginia Beach, Virginia, have confirmed that a video shows sample ballots. There is no evidence that ballots burning in a viral video were real ballots.\n\nFact check: Partly false claim about discarded ballots in Pennsylvania amplified by Eric Trump\n\nIt is true that nine military ballots were incorrectly discarded in a dumpster — seven of which were cast for President Donald Trump — were incorrectly discarded in a dumpster, but the incident was an error by a contractor, not evidence of cheating. The Pennsylvania secretary of state also stated that the situation was not \"intentional fraud.\"\n\nFact check: Post about stolen – and returned – Arizona ballots lacks context\n\nIt’s true that stolen ballots were found under a rock in Arizona. But the ballots had not yet been opened or filled out, and all 18 of the stolen ballots were returned to the voters three days prior to Election Day.\n\nFact check: Viral video claiming to show 'shredded mail-in ballots' is of printing waste\n\nA company confirmed that the video is of printing waste, not ballots that were not delivered. The applications are blank, not \"for Trump.\"\n\nFact check: False claim that photo of discarded mail shows ballots cast for Trump\n\nSeven discarded ballots for Trump were found in Pennsylvania after an error by a temporary contractor, not the U.S. Postal Service. Based on our research, the claim that a photo shows mail-in ballots cast for President Donald Trump discarded on the side of a road is false, and our research did not reveal discarded Trump ballots in California or Texas.\n\nFact check: 2018 empty mail-in ballot envelopes in California dumpster spur false fraud claims\n\nSonoma County officials confirmed that the photos on social media are of old empty envelopes from the November 2018 election and were recycled after the state's mandated 22-month ballot preservation period.\n\nOn absentee, early voting\n\nFact check: False QAnon claim that Trump secretly watermarked mail-in ballots to prove fraud\n\nA QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theory claims President Donald Trump had mail-in ballots secretly watermarked to prove Democrats committed fraud, but federal officials and ballot printers confirmed to USA TODAY that's impossible. Mail-in ballots are designed by local governments and ordered from private printers.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin clerks followed guidance in place since 2016 about witnesses and absentee ballots\n\nThe claim that the Wisconsin Election Commission may have violated state law by allowing clerks to \"fix\" ballots is missing context, because the policy in question has been in place since 2016, without objection, was brought forth by Republicans and was unanimously passed by a nonpartisan commission.\n\nFact check: Mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day will count in some states\n\nSome states won't count ballots received after Election Day, but many have extensions that allow for ballots to arrive and be counted after Nov. 3.\n\nFact check: Michigan governor encourages voters to drop off ballots, not mail them\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told voters to deliver their ballots in person, but she never explicitly told voters not to mail their ballots. At the time the claim was made, on Oct. 19, experts nationwide concurred that it was too late to rely on the mail to deliver ballots on time.\n\nFact check: Alleged ‘backdated’ ballots wouldn’t have been counted even if USPS claim true\n\nAbsentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day to be counted, and all state election results were reported by the early morning hours of Nov. 4. Pease’s claims relate to actions allegedly taken Nov. 4 and 5. Whatever happened to ballots then, no one was going to count and include them, so this claim is missing context.\n\nFact check: Woman in Indiana charged with modifying absentee ballot applications, not mail-in ballots\n\nReed was arrested for modifying 300 absentee ballot applications, not 400 ballots, that signed voters up for the Democratic primary without their consent during the June 2020 primary. Election officials were aware of the matter and were able to send voters new applications. No candidates were pre-marked, as the posts claim.\n\nFact check: Pennsylvania mail-in ballot claim mixes primary, general election data\n\nNumbers from the Pennsylvania Department of State show that over 2.6 million mail in ballots had been counted and over 3 million voters requested mail ballots by the Oct. 27 deadline. The false figure used in the claim originates from the number of mail in ballots requested for the Pennsylvania primary election or the number of registered Democrats that requested a mail ballot.\n\nFact check: Pennsylvania mail-in votes need 2 envelopes to be counted\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that officials can reject ballots that aren't properly enclosed in the required envelopes, and the state's secretary of state further confirmed the information is in an online voter guide. This claim is true.\n\nClick here for more general fact checks on voting by mail.\n\nOn poll workers, challengers and electors\n\nFact check: Viral video shows Pennsylvania poll workers fixing damaged ballots\n\nCounty officials confirmed that workers were fixing damaged ballots and the video has been manipulated to crop out bipartisan observers who witnessed the process. The damaged ballots have been preserved, and Pennsylvania's Election Code states damaged ballots must be duplicated.\n\nFact check: Videos showing crowd locked out of Detroit TCF Center with windows obstructed are missing context\n\nViral videos depict crowds of challengers stuck outside Detroit's TCF Center as election workers count ballots inside behind obstructed windows. Statements from officials and witnesses clarify that Republican challengers were not more frequently denied entry, and the TCF Center's windows were covered because election workers felt intimidated.\n\nFact check: Federal Election Commission chair echoes false claims of fraud\n\nThe quotes from FEC Chair Trey Trainor are real and came from an interview with Newsmax. But he's not the \"top boss of all the election officials,\" and the FEC's jurisdiction isn't related to vote counting or election security — only campaign finances. The post's claims are partly false, true only in that Trainor expressed his opinion about the election.\n\nFact check: State legislatures choose electors, but electors vote how state dictates\n\nIt is true the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to choose electors for the Electoral College. But it is false to suggest that legislatures retain this authority after a popular vote on Election Day. A \"safe harbor\" provision of the Electoral Count Act dictates changing the slate of electors after election day is a violation of federal law.\n\nClaims of dead voters\n\nFact check: False claim that deceased Michigan man voted in 2020\n\nWhile the screenshots posted to social media are real and can be replicated, Michigan’s Secretary of State's office debunked the claim as “misinformation,” and USA TODAY found evidence to support that.\n\nFact check: Lawsuit alleging errors in Detroit voter rolls was in 2019 and was settled\n\nThe report of a lawsuit alleging errors in Detroit voter rolls was accurate, but the posts fail to note that the case was filed in December and settled in June. It was not an issue in the 2020 election.\n\nFact check: No evidence vote was cast in Joe Frazier's name\n\nThere is no evidence to support this, and numerous election and county officials have confirmed that there is no evidence that dead people voted in Philadelphia.\n\nFact check: No evidence that 14,000 dead people cast ballots in Wayne County, Michigan\n\nThe list has been investigated and it was found that some individuals on the list were either still alive, or not living in Michigan. Other examples cited were the result of date of birth errors. Ballots cast by dead people in Michigan are rejected and there is no evidence of fraud.\n\nFact check: Claim that Pennsylvania case is proof of ‘dead people’ voting is under investigation\n\nWhile Pennsylvania’s ballot tracker does show a recorded mail-in ballot for a Denise Ondick, county officials have yet to determine this was an instance of voter fraud. Moreover, experts say voter fraud involving the deceased is rare.\n\nFact check: Thousands of ballots were not sent to dead people or pets in Nevada, Virginia\n\nAbout 500,000 voters in Virginia were sent vote-by-mail applications, not an actual ballot, that included incorrect return addresses. In Nevada, ballots for the primary election were returned due to a change of address. Election officials have not mailed absentee ballots in Nevada. Virginia started mailing absentee ballots on Sept. 18.\n\nOn 'Sharpiegate,' Ukraine, Italy\n\nFact check: Sharpie is 'perfectly fine' for Michigan ballots. In some counties, it is 'preferred.'\n\nMultiple election officials confirmed that filling out ballots with a blue or black Sharpie is acceptable – and in some cases, even \"preferred.\"\n\nFact check: Arizona election departments confirm Sharpies can be used on ballots\n\nThe Maricopa County Elections Department confirmed that Sharpies are preferred for filling out ballots. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has also confirmed that ballots marked with Sharpie pens would be counted.\n\nFact check: No connection between Biden victory, Ukraine\n\nVarious iterations of conspiracy theories alleging wrongdoing on the part of Joe Biden in Ukraine have been investigated and debunked. Claims that the 2020 presidential election was the result of corruption are also false.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

If this requirement is met, flogging is a common punishment.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHowever, noted Sky News, in 2019 the Saudis allowed foreign men and women to share hotel rooms without proving they are married “in a move away from its traditionally strict social code and in order to grow its tourism industry”.\n\nThe Philippines\n\nAdultery is defined as consensual sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man who is not her husband, as well as a man cohabiting with a woman who is not his wife. Both are considered crimes under the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, according to the Sexual Rights Initiative.\n\nIran\n\nThe Iranian Islamic penal code stipulates that “the penalty for fornication is flogging, that is 100 strokes of the lash, for unmarried male and female offenders”, according to Article 83, with stoning also on the statute book as a punishment.\n\nHowever, noted IranWire, since 2013 Iranian judges have been permitted to “replace a sentence of stoning to death” with “execution by hanging at their discretion”.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nTaliban officials are using a manual that prohibits sex outside of marriage – which the penal code adopted by the previous government also prohibited, said Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn August 2010, a couple were stoned to death in Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan after being found guilty of adultery, reported The Guardian.\n\nPakistan\n\nPremarital sex and adultery are crimes under the Hudood Ordinances, which sets a maximum penalty of death for adultery. However, it is believed that imprisonment and corporal punishment have been the most serious punishments imposed for the offence to date.\n\nSudan\n\nUnder the country’s Sharia law, premarital sex and adultery are punishable by stoning the accused to death.\n\nIn 2012 Intisar Sharif Abdallah, a mother of one, was found guilty of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning. However, noted Amnesty International, the court of appeal overturned the sentence and she walked free after charges were dropped at her retrial.\n\nEgypt\n\nA married woman who commits adultery can be imprisoned for up to two years, said the Sexual Rights Initiative. Any husband who commits adultery in the marital house can be jailed for up to six months.\n\nIn 2017 Doaa Salah, an Egyptian TV presenter, was sentenced to three years in prison for merely discussing premarital sex on TV, reported The Guardian. She was convicted of “outraging public decency” in conservative Egyptian society.\n\nMalaysia\n\nLegislation in Malaysia makes it illegal for unmarried Muslims to meet behind closed doors or engage in premarital sex, under the threat of up to six months in prison.\n\nSharia laws apply to Muslims, who account for nearly two-thirds of Malaysia’s population, in all personal matters. However, non-Muslims are covered by civil laws and are not subject to Islamic courts.\n\nIn 2009, 26 unmarried Muslim couples were arrested in hotel rooms during Operation Valentine.

A slew of election reforms. A minimum wage hike and the creation of a legal marijuana industry.\n\nThose are just a few of the hotly contested measures lawmakers are expected to tackle in the remaining weeks of the 149th General Assembly.\n\nBut with only 13 work days left, it is unlikely every bill still on the table will get a final vote.\n\nThat means the race is on to see who can get their measure through both the Senate and the House before the final gavel strikes during the early morning hours on July 1.\n\n\"It always happens around this time and this year is no different,\" said House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach. \"And, yes, there is always a chance some of these bills might not get a vote.\"\n\nThe good news is Delaware has a $430 million surplus this year. That means lawmakers are less likely to use what little time is left battling over spending cuts and tax hikes — the same brinksmanship that pushed last year's legislative calendar past June 30 for the first time in decades.\n\nThe expectation is that will open up room for debate over many of the bills left on the agenda.\n\nMuch of that legislation is currently awaiting action in the Senate, where Democrats' one-vote majority has contributed to what some view as a legislative bottleneck.\n\nSenate President David McBride, D-Hawk's Nest, does not see it that way.\n\n\"I think we're working right along,\" he said. \"I don't see why we can't get most of these bills done. The agendas might get longer and ladies and gentlemen might have to stay longer. But in my mind, this is not unusual.\"\n\nThe stakes are high for lawmakers to clear the final hurdle. Any bills that do not reach Gov. John Carney before the final gavel strikes will need to start the legislative process all over again next year.\n\nRegardless of whether they pass or fail, several of the bills will end up driving public debate as the end of the legislative cycle gives way to the start of election season and finger-pointing over what lawmakers were able to accomplish.\n\nA fierce gun battle\n\nThe dominant issue in the Delaware General Assembly this year unquestionably has been gun control.\n\nIn the wake of mass shootings at a Las Vegas concert and a Parkland, Florida high school, Democrats rolled out a string of proposals aimed at limiting the public's access to firearms, including an assault weapons ban sought by Gov. John Carney but intensely opposed by Second Amendment advocates.\n\nRepublicans have pushed measures that would fund or require more school security enhancements.\n\nSo far, neither side has gained much ground.\n\nLegislation that would allow police to temporarily seize firearms from someone a mental health professional deems a danger to themselves and others won bipartisan support and was signed into law by the governor. A bill strengthening a rarely imposed sentence for straw purchases also cleared the General Assembly.\n\nBut the proposed assault weapons ban has languished in committee for months. It is unclear at this point whether it has the votes to reach the Senate floor. Even if it does, wavering by a few key senators means it might never reach the House.\n\nThe Senate also has yet to take final action on measures that would raise the legal age at which someone can buy a rifle, outlaw devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at a faster rate, and increase the penalties for failing to adequately store firearms.\n\nA bill to ban high-capacity magazines and another that would allow family members and police to recommend someone's firearms be seized temporarily are waiting to clear both chambers of the Legislature.\n\nSchool safety bills have not fared any better.\n\nLegislation that would require all 189 public and charter schools in Delaware to be outfitted with panic buttons has yet to be called up for a vote. Neither has a bill that would provide $50,000 grants to school districts for safety and security enhancements.\n\nSen. David Lawson, R-Marydel, last week unveiled a new proposal that would set aside $65 million of this year's surplus for school safety projects — funding that only could be unlocked by schools that agree to hire and arm at least two security guards.\n\nThat measure likely will be dead on arrival due to its massive cost and number of logistical issues that several lawmakers say it fails to consider.\n\nDELAWARE GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nDelaware lawmakers eye bonuses for state workers, other spending\n\nBudget deficit, then surplus: Delaware should consider plan to stop the crises\n\nA bill introduced by Rep. Earl Jaques, D-Glasgow, might have a better chance of success. It would require all future school construction and major renovation projects to include security features such as bulletproof glass, secured vestibules and lockable classroom doors. That legislation has passed the House and is awaiting a final vote in the Senate.\n\nBig changes, big votes\n\nThere are at least three proposals the General Assembly could consider in June that would have major impacts on state government.\n\nTwo would amend the state constitution while the third would make sweeping changes to Delaware's criminal code.\n\nEach would require a supermajority to pass. And one has yet to be introduced.\n\nA panel of economists and elected officials formally unveiled a long-awaited proposal this month that seeks to rein in Delaware's sometimes boom-and-bust budget process by fundamentally changing how the state allocates its surpluses.\n\nTheir \"budget smoothing\" plan would limit annual spending growth to a floating cap based on certain economic factors. Any revenue beyond that would be split evenly between funding one-time projects and a reserve account that could be tapped to fill future budget gaps.\n\nThe panel also recommended a series of tax reforms aimed at moving Delaware toward more stable revenue sources, largely by eliminating itemized deductions and consolidating myriad senior citizen tax discounts into a single, means-tested tax break.\n\nGov. John Carney and Republican state Treasurer Ken Simpler say the plan would help fix the state's structural deficit issues.\n\nBut getting there would involve amending the state constitution — a process that requires a two-thirds vote in consecutive General Assemblies. A bill to get that process rolling has yet to be introduced, although that could happen soon.\n\nMeanwhile, a proposed equal rights amendment that cleared the House in March is currently on life support in the Senate, where the measure failed, 11-9, earlier this month. The bill seeks to make men and women equal in the eyes of the law.\n\nA procedural ploy by Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington, means the bill could be called up for a revote. Legislators say they are working behind the scenes to address Republican concerns that the measure could have unintended consequences ranging from co-ed prisons to mandatory state funding for abortions.\n\nIt's unclear whether those efforts will convince three Republicans to switch their votes to provide the supermajority needed for passage.\n\nSeveral efforts to pass ERA have failed since the 1980s. Supporters and opponents will likely find out next week if 2018 marks the latest defeat.\n\nA multiyear effort to revise the rules that define crime and measure punishment in Delaware also is facing a steep climb.\n\nProponents of the reform effort argue the state's criminal code has become a bloated mess rife with redundancy, contradiction and inconsistency. They want to streamline the rules that cover more than 200 felonies and misdemeanors into a document that is clear and accessible to police, the courts and the public.\n\nRetiring Attorney General Matt Denn has been steadfast in his opposition, however.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Greg Lavelle, a key supporter of the effort, recently called for the General Assembly to hit the brakes on two bills — totaling 282 pages — that would enact the new version and amend other sections of the code. Each would require a two-thirds vote.\n\n\"I strongly believe that the Delaware General Assembly should wait to allow the Attorney General's office to fully review and comment on these final bills before we act on them,\" the Sharpley Republican said. \"Rushing this bill through without careful scrutiny with just four weeks of session remaining would be a significant mistake.\"\n\nMoney bills left to tally\n\nJust because the Joint Finance Committee is hashing out a tentative spending plan for next year does not mean the rest of the General Assembly will not get a say in how that money is spent.\n\nWhile the budget-writing panel is penciling in some added expenses, several of the programs that proposal would fund have yet to be approved by the full Legislature.\n\nThat includes a bill to provide $20 million a year in tax relief to Delaware's three casinos. The deal cleared the Senate in April and awaits final action in the House where Schwartzkopf is in no hurry to bring it up for a vote.\n\nThe speaker has been outspoken in his opposition to that tax cut, saying he would prefer something far less costly to the state.\n\nHe also noted that a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that will bring full sports betting to Delaware could cause lawmakers to hesitate when it comes to granting a casino tax break.\n\n\"That's a game changer for that bill,\" he said. \"I think there are some folks [in the Senate] who would like to have their vote back now that sports betting is legal.\"\n\nSchwartzkopf, meanwhile, is championing a tax cut for first-time homebuyers that would excuse them from their half of a 1-percentage point increase in the state's real estate transfer tax that was imposed last year when the Legislature was facing a $400 million shortfall.\n\nThat measure was passed by the House and is awaiting action in the Senate.\n\nOther tax bills on the table include competing legislation — one sponsored by Republicans and the other by Democrats — that both seek to impose a tax on prescription opioids. Proponents say the levy would force drug manufacturers and distributors to pay for addiction treatment in Delaware.\n\nMore than a dozen states have introduced similar bills but only New York has approved such a measure, leaving many unanswered questions that may not be settled in time for the local bill to pass this year.\n\nLawmakers are expected to give New Castle County and possibly a few municipalities the authority to impose a local lodging tax for the first time — measures vehemently opposed by the state hotel industry.\n\nThen there are a few spending bills that would provide new benefits for state employees, who are also slated to get raises and bonuses next year.\n\nCarney opened this year's legislative calendar by offering his full support to a bill introduced by Rep. Debra Heffernan, D-Bellefonte, that would grant workers employed by the state for at least a year 12 weeks of paid parental leave.\n\nThat bill has yet to be called up for a vote in the House. A fiscal note that put the price tag at $2.5 million a year is no longer attached to the legislation. And Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, recently introduced an amendment that would cut the length of paid leave down to six weeks.\n\nCarney also championed a bill that would create a student-loan forgiveness program for educators at high-needs schools and those who teach high-demand subject areas. The 250 educators accepted into the program would be eligible for loan repayments of up to $10,000 over five years.\n\nThat legislation has remained in the House Appropriations Committee for over a month.\n\nWaiting in the wings\n\nLegislation still pending before the General Assembly includes bills that could impact everything from the affordability of conception to the final days of life.\n\nState Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, has introduced several health care-related bills this year, including a measure that would require Delaware insurers to cover a range of fertility care services, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\nSupporters of the bill say the out-of-pocket costs for those treatments can be crippling, while opponents warn that requiring insurers to cover the procedures could raise premium costs for all residents. The measure unanimously passed the Senate in March and now awaits action in the House.\n\nRep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, has a highly-controversial bill focused on the other end of Delaware residents' life spectrum that would allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their own lives. Vehemently opposed by anti-abortion groups, the measure was introduced and moved out of committee in 2017 but has yet to come up for a vote on the House floor.\n\nSen. Robert Marshall, D-Wilmington, also is hoping to get a vote on his latest effort to increase the minimum wage in Delaware. A bill that would hike the state's base wage $2 over four years to $10.25 an hour in 2021 is awaiting a vote in the Senate, where similar legislation failed by a single vote in March.\n\nSeveral Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to advance a series of election reform bills in the final days of the legislative calendar.\n\nThey include a bill that would allow voters to register on Election Day, cast ballots in person up to 10 days before the election, open polls for school board elections two hours earlier and move statewide primaries to coincide with the presidential primary in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Helene Keeley and Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, both Wilmington Democrats, are still holding out hope of advancing legislation that would make Delaware the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nLegislation they introduced last year would allow people 21 and older to purchase up to an ounce of marijuana from dozens of stores authorized to sell the drug. The legislation also would authorize the creation of an entire marijuana industry, including cultivation facilities, testing companies and manufacturing businesses.\n\nThat bill failed to come up for a final vote in 2017, leading to the creation of a task force that released a lengthy report under rather inauspicious circumstances in March.\n\nSince then, Keeley has been using the panel's recommendations to craft a new version of the bill that she plans to introduce next week.\n\nBut it also will require a two-thirds majority in both chambers to reach the governor's desk. Carney also has said repeatedly that he does not support the legislation at this time.\n\nDozens of other bills also are waiting in the wings with just a few weeks left in the legislative session, leaving many to wonder how much the General Assembly will be able to act on.\n\n\"We always get a lot of requests to move bills after the May break so I would say the volume is pretty normal right now,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"But my hope is we might be able to finish up not too long after midnight on June 30.\"\n\nMcBride agreed the list of pending legislation is long but manageable.\n\n\"It's always a dance,\" he said of the final month. \"But one thing is certain and that's that there will be a soft landing sometime in the early morning of July 1. My job now is to get us there.\"\n\nWEEKEND MUST-READS\n\nRegulation 225 would no longer let students \"self-identify\" without parents' permission\n\nHospital settles lawsuit claiming doctor removed wrong part of thyroid\n\nBromberg's Big Noise moves opening night to Constitution Yards Beer Garden\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2019/08/06/burger-king-brings-back-impossible-burger/1902652001/", "title": "Burger King brings back Impossible Burger", "text": "Burger King has gone and done the impossible: It's brought back the Impossible Burger in a new form as an Impossible Whopper and many people can't tell the difference.\n\nThe plant-based burger, created by California food startup Impossible Foods, will be available everywhere starting Thursday, August 8.\n\nDelawareans got to try the burger Monday, however, a perk of being — wait for it — The First State.\n\nThe News Journal took a pile of Impossible Whoppers and beef Whoppers to Market Street in Wilmington during lunchtime to see how people thought the two compare.\n\nDaquan Dennis, 31, thought for sure that the first burger he tried was the original, although he liked both. Turned out that first one was the Impossible Whopper.\n\nBut the big surprise for him was that the Impossible Whopper was not only plant-based but literally had no meat in it at all.\n\n\"Oh, shoot,\" he said. \"I didn't know that.

And they hated both of them.\n\nKarema, 11, was shocked the Impossible Burger wasn't the Whopper.\n\n\"But that's nasty,\" she said about the real one.\n\nJohn Jackson, 58, knew the difference right away.\n\nAsked how that was possible, he looked around surreptitiously, leaned into the camera and said quietly: \"I always eat at Burger King.\"\n\nVegans won't be happy\n\nWhile a fast-food plant-based burger is a leap forward for vegetarians who also eat milk products, vegans — who won't eat any kind of animal products such as eggs or cheese — may wrinkle their noses.\n\nThe Impossible Burgers are flame grilled in the same broiler used for beef and chicken, according to Burger King's website.\n\nAlso of note is that Burger King uses regular mayonnaise, which contains egg, on each sandwich.\n\nHowever, a microwave option is available for anyone who wants a truly vegan version from Burger King. That option wouldn't include the mayo and would be microwaved away from any meat products.\n\nIntroduction of a new meatless era\n\nBurger King's Impossible Whopper is part of a trend by restaurants across the country to offer meatless or vegan alternatives.\n\nRestaurants like QDOBA Mexican Eats, Red Robin, Pizza Hut have all either rolled out meatless options or they are introducing them in the coming months.\n\nVEGGIE-FIRST EATING\n\nThe original soul food: Plant-based diet trend gains ground in African American community\n\nThe Impossible Whopper first entered the scene in April when Burger King and Impossible Foods announced that the burger would be tested, temporarily, around Burger Kings in the St. Louis area.\n\nThe burger is made with heme, an essential molecule found in plants and animals, according to Impossible Foods. Scientists at the start up company created their own plant-based heme from a soy plant and genetically engineered yeast.\n\nIt was then dyed to get the consistency, color, texture and taste of beef.\n\nSo what are your thoughts, Delaware?

Its existing holdings include the massive 46-acre Greenville Place residential complex and nearby Greenville Market Shell gas station on Kennett Pike.\n\nWith the purchase, Pettinaro, based in nearby Newport, will become the largest, single owner of property in Greenville’s commercial district.\n\nOther Stoltz properties that are part of the deal include Montchanin Corporate Center, an office campus on Del. 100 and Del. 141 that was built in 1970 as the headquarters for Columbia Gas System Inc.; the Greenville Professional Center complex at 3704 Kennett Pike; and the Barley Mill House at 3701 Kennett Pike. Settlements are staggered with some to be held next week. The Greenville Center closing is expected in about 60 days.\n\n“To me it’s irreplaceable real estate in our hometown,” said Greg Pettinaro, managing partner of the Pettinaro company. “It’s great to get it back under local ownership. It’s an asset we plan to keep for a long time.”\n\nOnce the properties change hands, it will be a game changer in Delaware’s wealthy community where the average household income is $242,605. The Stoltz’s ownership has been contentious for nearly 20 years; it has had heated battles with store owners and residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. More than one case resulted in lawsuits, including the historic fight over the development of the Barley Mill Plaza office campus on Del. 141 and Lancaster Pike.\n\nThe Stoltz organization, which is headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, is keeping Barley Mill Plaza. Sources close to the deal said Pettinaro didn’t want it.\n\nFor his part, Pettinaro said he plans to work with the community. The family-owned business intends to preserve the character of the properties and make sure they’re compatible with Greenville’s personality. One improvement being considered is to make the shopping area more walkable, Pettinaro said.\n\n“I want to be a good neighbor,” Pettinaro said.\n\nLarry Tarabicos, a lawyer for the Stoltz organization, said Keith Stoltz, who heads the Stoltz entity and is the face of the organization in Delaware, is “very upset” at having to sell the Greenville properties. Successful business people are often “criticized as being too tough, too hard,” Tarabicos said.\n\n“In the last six or seven years he (Stoltz) has felt very unwelcome in Delaware,” Tarabicos said. “He’s been a very good property owner and landlord. He’s been a good steward of valuable and important property not only in Greenville but all around the area. He’s upgraded those properties. He feels he hasn’t been appreciated.”\n\nTarabicos said other than the Christiana Mall, the upscale commercial properties in Greenville are “arguably the most coveted properties in Delaware.”\n\nWith the divestitures Stoltz will now be free to concentrate on the development of Barley Mill Plaza, which has been a flash point among rich and powerful Greenville residents since Stoltz bought the property from the DuPont Co. in 2007 for a hefty $94 million. The most recent plan to develop a proposed a 1.6-million-square-foot retail and office complex on 37 acres of the site was struck down by the Delaware courts.\n\n“It’s a fascinating property and has great possibilities,” Tarabicos said. “Keith will be able to give Barley Mill Plaza his full attention. It’s next on the horizon.”\n\nWithin 60 to 90 days Stoltz will “kick it into high gear,” Tarabicos said.\n\nThat statement has an ominous tone to many neighbors.\n\n“We’ll definitely be on the lookout, no question about it,” said Joe Kelly, head of Save Our County, a civic group formed in 2011 to fight the development at Barley Mill Plaza. “I’m not optimistic about working with Stoltz. He can prove me wrong by coming up with something that’s reasonable.”\n\nStoltz’s troubled history\n\nEven Stoltz’s sale of the five retail and office properties has not been without contention.\n\nRecently, the deal to sell some of the properties was threatened by legal action stemming from failure to record deed restrictions Stolz agreed to in 2011, but had failed to keep. As late as last week, Tarabicos and Richard Beck, attorney for the civic group Citizens for Responsible Growth, were exchanging heated letters about restrictions related to the Greenville Center.\n\n“Your letter seems to suggest that you believe that my client (and his counsel) will attempt to transfer his five properties in Greenville without addressing these issues,” Tarabicos wrote to Beck on July 8. “That suggestion is an insult to me and also to the parties involved in these transactions.”\n\nThe deed restrictions were recorded on Monday – four years after they were signed by Keith Stoltz.\n\nPettinaro said he agreed completely with the deed restrictions, and made their recordation a condition of the sale.\n\n“The sophisticated and well-respected purchaser of the Greenville properties is a respected member of the local community and they ... have no intention of closing on these transactions unless and until these issues have been resolved,” Tarabicos wrote.\n\nPrior to that development battle, Stoltz’s dust-ups in Greenville had largely been with tenants over leases. Alisa Morkides, owner of the Brew HaHa chain, waged a legal battle with Stoltz in the 1990s over his plan to bring a national competitor into the shopping center to compete with her independent coffee shop. Her case was settled without going to court, and Brew HaHa still has a presence in Powder Mill Square.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Francine Covelli, who ran Café Francine’s in the Greenville Center, walked away from her business after a costly and painful battle with Stoltz. In 2009, boutique clothing shop Lolita sued Stoltz when the landlord said it would bump Lolita from a visible location in Powder Mill Square to a back corner of the shopping center.\n\nBut the most contentious battle in Greenville’s history began in 2008, when Stoltz Real Estate Partners announced plans for three ambitious projects along the Del. 141 corridor in the Greenville area that included:\n\n•A $525 million redevelopment of the 24-building Barley Mill Plaza that called for 700 apartments or condominiums; 1.48 million square feet of office space; 731,250 square feet of retail space that included stores, restaurants, a fitness center, day care and hotel.\n\n•A $19 million addition to the Greenville Center shopping center at Kennett Pike and Buck Road. The project included an approximately 12-story building of mostly residential units near Greenville Manor housing community. It called for 12,800 square feet of office space and 22,235 square feet of retail, which included incorporating some existing space.\n\n•An expansion of the former MBNA office campus on Del. 141 and Montchanin Road (Del. 100) that was once the headquarters of Columbia Gas System. Stoltz bought the nearly 20-acre office campus from Bank of America. Plans called for a new, free-standing office building totaling 36,501 square feet.\n\nThe surrounding Greenville community erupted, and a well-funded group called Citizens for Responsible Growth emerged with members from several civic groups. Residents expressed alarm that the massive developments, including the 12-story building at the Greenville Center, would alter the character of Chateau Country.\n\nAnd neighbors were aghast at plans for Barley Mill Plaza, explaining that 2.9 million square feet of shops and restaurants, offices, housing and a hotel, with one proposed building 11 stories and three proposed buildings eight stories tall, would cripple traffic, disrupt noise levels, alter the natural light to nearby homes and destroy the bucolic landscape of the area.\n\nThe compromise\n\nBy 2010, negotiations for compromise were underway, and the final agreement called for:\n\n•Abandoning the 12-story residential tower and parking garage at Greenville Center. It would be replaced by a two-story building with retail on the first floor and office space on the second level. There would be a freestanding retail building of approximately 4,000 square feet at the corner of Kennett Pike and Buck Road, and additions to an existing building at the northwestern corner of the property totaling 3,469 square feet. There would be more generous setbacks. The plan called for a parking variance and a reduction in landscaping.\n\n•Dropping the scale of the Barley Mill Plaza development that called for 1.6-million square-feet of shops and offices on 92 acres. There was no residential component. Thirty-seven acres along Del. 141 would need to be rezoned from office to commercial use.\n\n•Rezoning no more than two acres of Montchanin Corporate Center along Del. 100 from office regional to commercial neighborhood, with the development of a commercial building not larger than 6,000 square feet. Plans called for the lifting of deed restrictions on the property that had been in place since the late 1960s.\n\n•Seeking a variance to add an additional 19 parking spaces at Greenville Professional Center at 3704 Kennett Pike.\n\nAs part of the compromise, Stoltz agreed to certain deed restrictions, including building height limitations of 50 feet at Greenville Center. The deed restrictions would be legally recorded with the New Castle County Recorder of Deeds. The restrictions would run with the properties and be conveyed to any new owners.\n\nIf Stoltz’s plans did not get land approvals, he could withdraw from compromise plans and return to the status quo.\n\nThe Stoltz company began work on getting the necessary land approvals for the four projects. The variances were granted at Greenville Center and Greenville Professional Center at 3704 Kennett Pike. But there were complications with two other properties.\n\nThe rezoning at Montchanin Corporate Center was overwhelmingly rejected by New Castle County Council.\n\nAnd although Barley Mill Plaza was successfully rezoned in 2011, residents living closer to the development felt their interests were sacrificed to the building-height concerns of the people living closer to the Greenville Center shopping center.\n\nThe compromise bitterly divided the community, leading to acrimonious feelings between residents concerned about the development of Barley Mill Plaza and those more concerned about a 12-story tower at Greenville Center.\n\nA group of citizens splintered off from CRG and formed Save Our County. The new group sued New Castle County and the property owner Barley Mill LLC in December 2011, saying the rezoning of 37 acres at the front of the property violated state law. The group claims a traffic study of the roads near the plaza should have been completed before the council voted on the rezoning.\n\nSave Our County scored a major victory in 2013 when Delaware Chancery Court ruled the rezoning of 37 acres to retail development was invalid because at least one vote by a member of New Castle County Council was made arbitrarily – and that vote was necessary for the ordinance to pass. The ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in 2014.\n\n“For many in the community, even the brightened prospect of being in closer proximity to a Cheesecake Factory and Cinnabon did not assuage their worries about the effect that the large scale development and its accompanying traffic would have on their quality of life,” Leo E. Strine Jr., the Supreme Court’s new Chief Justice, wrote in the opinion.\n\nDeed restriction trouble\n\nDespite seven years of high-profile back and forth regarding Stoltz’s proposed Greenville projects, nothing substantial has physically happened to the properties with the exception of Barley Mill Plaza. Work is underway on transforming 34 acres of Barley Mill Plaza at the rear of the site into the new Odyssey Charter School campus.\n\nBut that changed approximately eight weeks ago, when Keith Stoltz contacted John Danzeisen of CRG with word that he was going to reject the 2011 compromise and return to the status quo.\n\n“He advised me a couple months ago, he was going to walk away from the compromise,” Danzeisen said.\n\nA little later, Stoltz changed his mind and was going to live by the compromise, Danzeisen said. The sticking point was the variances. To return to the status quo, the variances would have to be rejected through a formal land approval process and that would take time. By then, though, Stoltz was ready to sell to Pettinaro.\n\nIt was at that point in the negotiations that CRG and the community learned the deed restrictions were never recorded – four years after the compromise was inked. Residents worried that the properties would pass to a new owner without the deed restrictions.\n\n“It was a concern,” Danzeisen said. “We wanted those deed restrictions.”\n\nCRG alerted the people at the Save Our County civic group, and began discussions about hiring attorney Jeff Goddess, who waged a successful battle against Stoltz for Save Our County.\n\n“As an aside, I find it curious and amusing that you are now seeking to enlist support from the Save Our County people and their able counsel, who, as I understand it, believe that your efforts to ‘protect’ your neighbors in the vicinity of the Greenville Center, was at the expense of ‘protecting’ the folks of Barley Mill Plaza,” Tarabicos wrote. “I am not quite sure why they would even care if the Greenville Center Declarations of Restrictions were ever recorded.”\n\nWaiting to see\n\nCommunity leaders said there is high energy today among residents around the entire land-use process.\n\nOne positive thing that resulted from the recent dust-up over the deed restrictions was the joining together of a number of civic organization, civic leaders say.\n\n“We will work together,” Kelly said.\n\nHe commends Stoltz and Tarabicos for bringing the Odyssey Charter School to Barley Mill Plaza. But Kelly believes the community still has a battle ahead of it when it comes to Barley Mill Plaza.\n\n“We’re going to fight. We’re not just going to roll over,” Kelly said. “We didn’t spend all that effort to after three years say: ‘OK, you can go in there and do what you want.’ We’re going to insist that something that comes there is consistent with the character of the community.”\n\nContact Maureen Milford at (302) 324-2881 or mmilford@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/28/corn-curb-buttery-cow-six-triple-eight-news-around-states/50535587/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontogmery:Romay Davis, 102, the oldest living member of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the largest all-Black, all-female group to serve in World War II, was honored Tuesday at City Hall that followed President Joe Biden’s decision in March to sign a bill authorizing the Congressional Gold Medal for the unit, nicknamed the “Six Triple Eight.” More than 800 Black women formed the 6888th, which began sailing for England in February 1945. Once there, they were confronted not only by mountains of undelivered mail but by racism and sexism. They were denied entry into an American Red Cross club and hotels, according to the history, and a senior officer was threatened with being being replaced by a white first lieutenant when some unit members missed an inspection. Working under the motto of “No Mail, Low Morale,” the women served 24/7 in shifts and developed a new tracking system that processed about 65,000 items each shift, allowing them to clear a six-month backlog of mail in just three months.

The weekend shooting of the bear by Sitka police was the first this year in the southeast Alaska city, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Last year, 14 bears were killed in and around Sitka, which the newspaper reported was a record for the community. Steve Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said four shots were fired, at least two of which hit the bear. Police received a call about a bear at about 11:40 p.m. Saturday. By the time Bethune arrived about 1 a.m. Sunday, officers had killed the animal, he said. Police later Sunday issued citations at three addresses for having bear attractants. Bethune estimated the bear was 8 to 12 years old and otherwise healthy.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Supreme Court denied a request from the Cyber Ninjas, a company that oversaw a partisan Arizona election review, to reject a daily $50,000 penalty for refusing to hand over records related to the state Senate’s ballot review. The court also denied Cyber Ninjas’ request to find the records are not public documents. It was the second time they had made that request to the high court, and the second time the court rejected it this year. The court’s brief order means the fines continue, as the Ninjas’ owner have been slow to comply with a court order that its records related to last year’s ballot review are public documents. The court also denied a request from The Arizona Republic for attorney fees in its appeal to the high court. The decision does not affect a pending request for fees in the ongoing fight in the lower court. The Republic is suing Cyber Ninjas and its owners, Doug and Meghan Logan, arguing records the company has that are related to the state Senate-ordered ballot review of the 2020 Maricopa County election results are public records. The lawsuit also extends to the Senate, but it was not a party to the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A fire at a northwestern Arkansas home killed six people, including four children, authorities said. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said Monday the fire happened early Sunday at a trailer home in Springdale, about 145 miles northwest of Little Rock. Emergency responders received a call at about 2 a.m. about a fire and that people were still inside the home, the sheriff’s office said. One child was able to escape. Detectives are investigating the cause of the blaze. The victims’ bodies have been sent to the state crime lab to determine cause of death. The sheriff’s office did not release names or ages of the victims. Television station KNWA reported the Springdale School District said the victims included students enrolled in the district.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Tap water used by more than 900,000 Californians is unsafe to drink and the state isn’t acting fast enough to help clean it up, state auditors said in a report. Thousands of water systems supply the state’s 39 million people, and about 5% of them have some type of contaminant, such as nitrates or arsenic, in them, according to the audit. That means people can’t safely drink the water or use it to cook or bathe. Most of the 370 failing systems are in economically disadvantaged communities, many in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural heartland. The State Water Resources Control Board has provided at least $1.7 billion in grants since 2016 for design and construction to improve water systems. That could include building new treatment plants, consolidating water systems or other actions designed to improve water quality. But it took the board 33 months on average in 2021 for water system operators to complete the application process and receive money, the audit found – nearly double the time it took in 2017. The audit found a lack of clear metrics and poor communication created confusion for water districts seeking help and slowed down the award process. Eileen Sobeck, executive director for the water board, told state auditors the board agrees the process could be clearer and faster. But she disagreed with the conclusion the board hasn’t acted with urgency to improve contaminated water systems, saying the board’s “highest priority is advancing the human right to water.” California made a right to safe drinking water state law in 2013. The water board has previously said it would need $4.5 billion to address all the needs through 2025.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two Republicans who suggested their losses in last month’s GOP primaries in Colorado might be the result of fraud filed their second round of requests for recounts Tuesday. Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters and state Rep. Ron Hanks echoed former President Donald Trump’s claims about the 2020 election during their own races for their party’s nomination for Secretary of State and U.S. Senate, respectively. After they each lost by more than 40,000 votes, they requested a hand recount. The Colorado Secretary of State’s office said their regulations required any recounts to be done by machine and that it would cost $236,000. When the candidates didn’t pay, it proceeded with certification of their losses.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Max Reiss, the face of Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration for the past three years, said he is leaving next month to take a new position in the private sector. Reiss, 36, will become a senior vice president at M&T Bank, which recently completed the acquisition of Connecticut-based People’s United Financial, Inc. and will now have a presence in 12 states. Lamont praised his departing communications director, a former TV reporter who previously covered the Democratic administration for WVIT-TV, for his dedication, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reiss managed much of the state’s public outreach efforts and became a familiar voice for residents who tuned in daily for Lamont’s pandemic news conferences. Reiss previously worked as a TV and radio reporter in Alabama, Missouri and elsewhere. His final day as Lamont’s chief spokesperson is Aug. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: The Town Council voted to give $24,750 to the Georgetown Historical Society, a nonprofit that allows a Confederate flag to be flown on its property. Councilwomen Angela Townsend made a motion to approve granting the funds, and the other council members all voted in favor of it. Mayor Bill West did not vote. Townsend’s motion stipulated “a committee would be formed to address the concerns,” but did not specify details. The Georgetown Historical Society’s Marvel Museum is home to numerous buildings, a collection of antique carriages and items related to Georgetown’s history. The grounds and buildings are often used for public and private events, as well. The Delaware Grays Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp #2068 reached an agreement with the society in 2007, allowing them to install and maintain the flag and a monument to Delawareans who fought for the Confederacy. It was only 15 years ago, but it was a decidedly different time, one in which then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner celebrated the installation by declaring a statewide “Confederate History and Heritage Week.” By 2017, the Lower Sussex NAACP was calling for the removal of the flag. In 2019, the state declined to provide funding to the Georgetown Historical Society because of the flag.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police said they found a woman for which they were searching after confirming their investigation into an armed kidnapping in Northwest D.C. on Wednesday morning. Lt. McHauly Murphy with the MPD's Second District originally announced police were looking for 30-year-old Selita Lee. Police said they believe she was kidnapped by her boyfriend, Marquez \"Mikko\" Antonio Parker, 44, for whom they are still searching. Parker is described by police as about 5-foot-8 and 140 pounds, with a medium build. He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, light blue pants and white shoes. Police said he was carrying a black satchel and is armed with a black handgun. Anyone with information about this case should contact police by dialing 911, texting the department's tip line at 50411 or calling (202) 727-9099.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s population grew slightly over a previous forecast in the first quarter of this year, but slowing growth with deaths outpacing births is still in the Sunshine State’s future over the next decade, according to estimates released last week. The estimates released by the state Demographic Estimating Conference showed that Florida’s population growth appears to have peaked last year with a 1.6% rate. Florida’s population in 2022 will stand at more than 22 million residents, trailing only California and Texas in size. The April 1 estimate was 3,795 residents higher than a forecast in December, reflecting an increase in migration. Although Florida will continue to grow over the next decade and beyond, with its population reaching just short of 25 million residents by 2032, it’s pace of growth will slow to 0.8% in 10 years and 0.6% by 2039, according to the estimates.\n\nGeorgia\n\nReidsville: A judge has been arrested on charges he threatened a man who confronted the jurist about taking vegetables from his garden. Tattnall County Chief Magistrate Judge Eddie Anderson, 70, was charged Monday with felony counts of making a terrorist threat and violating his oath of office, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release. He was booked at the county jail and released on his own recognizance. The GBI said a man reported to the county sheriff he believed the judge had come onto his property and taken vegetables without permission. The man told authorities Anderson threatened him with violence when confronted during a phone call. Witnesses overheard the judge making the threat, the GBI said. Anderson did not immediately respond to an a phone message left at his office or an email seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man accused of using counterfeit bank checks totaling $1.2 million to bail three people out of a jail has been arrested and ordered held without bail, according to court records. Samuela Tuikolongahau Jr. was detained by federal authorities on Monday. A U.S. Secret Service affidavit filed in court alleged he presented the bank checks for $760,000, $400,000 and $50,000 in 2020 during the attempt to post bail for three people held at the Oahu Community Correctional Center. He left a Honolulu courthouse after being told the checks would need verification, the court document said. Officials determined the checks were counterfeit and the two men and woman he tried to get out of jail were not released. Court documents did not specify his relationship to the three jailed people. Tuikolongahau appeared in federal court Tuesday for a hearing, where a judge appointed defense attorney Walter Rodby to represent him. Tuikolongahau consented to be detained without bail as prosecutors requested, according to court records. Rodby did not immediately return email and phone messages seeking comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 800 wildland firefighters and support staff are fighting a blaze in east-central Idaho that officials said is threatening homes, an important north-south corridor, energy infrastructure, recreation opportunities and the municipal watershed for the town of Salmon. The Moose Fire on Tuesday grew to nearly 60 square miles burning grass, timber understory and dead and down material in the Salmon-Challis National Forest. It’s only 10% contained. Firefighters are protecting structures in several areas, as well as the U.S. Highway 93 corridor, a major north-south route. Two helicopter pilots fighting the fire died last week when their CH-47D Series “Chinook” crashed in the Salmon River. Plans call for removing the helicopter from the river with a large crane. The cause of the fire that started July 17 is unknown. High temperatures and dry relative humidity are hampering efforts to control the blaze. Smoke has also been a problem.\n\nIllinois\n\nNorthbrook: A coyote on public display in suburban Chicago will get a larger den but not a transfer to a wild animal sanctuary in Colorado. A report for the Cook County Forest Preserve District said the coyote, named Rocky, is “happy and healthy” in his 266-square-foot home but will get more room. Critics, however, said his constant pacing is proof that he’s bored. “You put an animal in a cage they’re not happy,” said Jodie Wiederkehr, director of the Chicago Alliance for Animals. Rocky has been at the River Trail Nature Center in Northbrook since 2018, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. He was found as a pup in Tennessee. An expanded habitat is in the works at the nature center. A petition to relocate the coyote to a wild animal sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colorado, has more than 6,000 signatures. “Because the coyote is an imprinted animal that has lived with humans practically since birth, there is no guarantee it will thrive if moved across the country and introduced to other coyotes,” Forest Preserve officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers on Tuesday narrowly advanced a plan to ban nearly all abortions in the state, despite opposition from abortion-rights supporters, who said the bill goes too far, and anti-abortion activists, who said it doesn’t go far enough. Indiana has one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling — a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. In Indiana, chants from anti-abortion activists, such as “Let their heart beat,” could be heard inside the Senate chamber as a committee wrapped up two days of testimony during which none of the more than 60 people speaking voiced support for the Republican-sponsored bill. The committee voted 7-5 in favor of the ban after also adding provisions under which doctors could face felony criminal charges and up to six years in prison for performing an illegal abortion. That’s the same potential penalty for performing abortions under Indiana’s current 20-week ban. More amendments to the bill could be debated by the full Senate on Thursday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The butter cow at the Iowa State Fair, which runs Aug. 11-21, will be showcased with a companion piece – a tribute to “The Music Man,” the Broadway musical written by Mason City native Meredith Willson in 1957. The musical based on the fictional town of River City, Iowa, celebrates its 60th year in film with a Broadway reboot that stars Hugh Jackman, who plays traveling salesman Harold Hill trying to sell a town of Iowans musical instruments and uniforms to start a band. Officials promised at least one of the 76 trombones from the musical’s centerpiece song to make an appearance. The 600-pound butter cow will have another companion piece, a relief that celebrates the 100th anniversary of Ye Old Mill. The 1,500-foot canal ride was first constructed in 1921. Couples like to float on the boats and many a couple shared a first kiss or proposed on the ride. In 1996, a strong wind blew down the mill, but a $100,000 gift from Boatmen’s Bank of Iowa helped the ride return for the State Fair that year. The butter cow became a regular fixture at the State Fair in 1911. The fair added a companion sculpture in 1996 that featured Grant Wood’s “American Gothic.” Through the years, sculptures of Harry Potter, Garth Brooks, the 25th anniversary of “Field of Dreams,” Superman and gymnast Shawn Johnson were featured.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Early voting is surging in Kansas ahead of next week’s statewide abortion vote. More than 2½ times as many people cast early ballots as of Tuesday compared to the same point in the 2018 midterm primary, the Kansas secretary of state’s office reported. Voters will decide Tuesday whether to amend the state Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. The Kansas vote is the first statewide referendum on abortion policy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June. The Republican-controlled Legislature put the anti-abortion measure on the ballot to overturn a 2019 state Supreme Court decision declaring access to abortion a “fundamental” right under the state constitution. The measure would add language saying the state constitution does not grant a right to abortion, allowing lawmakers to regulate it as they see fit.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has awarded a license for a new facility with plans to offer quarter horse racing in the state. Revolutionary Racing will build in Ashland and feature an American quarter horse “sprint racing” track and a historical horse racing facility, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Tuesday. Historical racing machines allow people to bet on randomly generated horse races from the past. The games typically show video of condensed horse races. Revolutionary Racing obtained the last available racing license in Kentucky, according to state officials. The project invests $55 million and creates 200 jobs, Beshear said. The construction project is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Jury deliberations resumed Wednesday in the federal trial of New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams, who was elected to be the city’s top prosecutor in December 2020 despite having been indicted months earlier on tax charges. Williams and Nicole Burdett, who was an attorney in his law practice, were accused in an indictment of conspiring to cheat on Williams’ taxes during a five-year period ending in 2017. Prosecutors said Williams’ tax burden was illegally cut by $200,000. Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday morning, a week after the trial began. Prosecution witnesses included the tax preparer, Henry Timothy, who was cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to a single tax charge. The defense rested Tuesday morning as well, without calling witnesses. Williams has long contended the prosecution was politically motivated. Defense attorneys have portrayed Timothy as a fraud while attacking his credibility, and questioned why others whose taxes were prepared by Timothy weren’t criminally prosecuted.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills increased her fundraising advantage over Republican challenger Paul LePage in the latest reporting period, hauling in $605,000 during the 42-day period, according to documents filed Tuesday. The report that covers the period from June 1 to July 19 lifted Mills’ fundraising haul to $3.8 million, with $2.7 million in cash on hand, according to the campaign disclosure reports. LePage, a former two-term governor, raised about $312,000 for the same period, bringing his total to nearly $1.8 million, the reports said. The race is one of several gubernatorial contests that will be on the national radar during the 2022 midterm elections. LePage is seeking to become the first governor to serve three, four-year terms. LePage served consecutive terms, but Maine allows a former governor to serve again after sitting out an election.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:The Washington County Democratic Central Committee is expected to open its headquarters in downtown Hagerstown. An orientation was held Saturday by the county Democratic Central Committee, where volunteers received information on how to educate, support and encourage people to vote for Democratic candidates during the general election Nov. 8.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation to ban discrimination based on natural and protective hairstyles – such as Afros, cornrows or tightly coiled twists – in workplaces, school districts and school-related organizations in Massachusetts was signed into law Tuesday by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Black women in particular have faced pressure in school and on the job to alter their hair to conform to policies that are biased against natural hairstyles, according to supporters of the law. The bill had been unanimously approved by the Democrat-controlled House and Senate. The new law defines natural and protective hairstyles as including “braids, locks, twists, Bantu knots and other formations,” and tasks the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination with enforcing the protections. Policies that limit or prohibit natural hairstyles in all school districts are now banned. The law also prohibits hair discrimination in employment, business, advertising and public spaces. Massachusetts is the 18th state to adopt a version of the the bill – known as the Crown Act – into law, legislators said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thousands who were wrongly accused of fraud when seeking unemployment benefits can seek financial relief from the state, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, breaking new ground when someone claims their constitutional rights have been violated by the government. “The state is prohibited from violating the rights the Constitution guarantees. If it does so, it is liable for the harm it causes,” Justice Megan Cavanagh wrote in a 4-3 opinion.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has voted to remove a decades-old requirement that members have a minimum of 25% Chippewa blood. Officials said 65% of voters on an advisory referendum said the blood quantum requirement should be removed from membership in the six-reservation tribe. The referendum is a guide for tribal leaders who will now decide whether to ask voters to amend the tribe’s constitution. The majority of voters said each reservation – Fond du Lac, Mille Lacs, Bois Forte, Grand Portage, White Earth and Leech Lake – should be allowed to determine its own enrollment requirements, the Star Tribune reported. The blood quantum requirement has caused the tribe’s enrollment to shrink, with many children not considered members despite having a parent who is. About 15% of the tribe’s roughly 39,000 citizens are under age 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is moving forward with creating an office for violence prevention and trauma recovery that was announced in early May, said Safiya R. Omari, the city’s chief of staff. The National League of Cities and Wells Fargo Bank awarded the city a $700,000 grant in May to create the office. In addition, the city will hire an executive director and policy analyst with public safety experience, while seeking additional funds for the prevention office, Omari said. “Students from local colleges will have the opportunity to serve as interns to broaden the community-based interventions towards violence prevention,” Omari said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Federal investigators said a Springfield man robbed a bank last week after writing a demand note in pink highlighter on the back of his birth certificate and handing it to the teller. On July 20, at about 11:30 a.m., court documents showed a 29-year-old man wearing a cut-off gray T-shirt, blue gym shorts and one orange shoe, entered the Bank of America on West Kearney Street and handed a teller a note reading “Give me your money now. Don’t say anything. I have a partner outside.” The teller emptied the cash drawer and handed the man the money and the note, at which time the man left and fled the scene in a black pickup truck, according to court documents. The man was arrested later that day because of a tip. The man allegedly confessed to the crime and told investigators he robbed the bank to “prove a point” to his girlfriend after they got into an argument. He told investigators that he didn’t know which bank he was going to rob, but drove by the Bank of America and decided it would be that one. According to court documents, the man told law enforcement he wrote the note on the back of his birth certificate in pink highlighter and after fleeing the scene, he threw his birth certificate and ID out the car window. The man is charged with one count of bank robbery, a federal crime that is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A 79-year-old Florida man died in a fall in Glacier National Park while he was trying to scramble up an off-trail slope with a group of friends, park officials said Tuesday. The incident happened Monday morning on Rising Wolf Mountain, several hundred feet above the Two Medicine Campground in the southeastern part of the park, spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The friends descended to the victim’s location, yelled to the campground for help and called 911. National Park Service staff responded. A search helicopter operated by Two Bear Air, which had been working to recover the bodies of two men who died in a climbing accident several days earlier, was temporarily diverted to help with the rescue. The helicopter transported the unconscious man to the Two Medicine Ranger Station, where an air ambulance was waiting. The air ambulance crew declared the man dead, authorities said. The man’s name and hometown were being withheld until family members could be notified. The bodies of the two 67-year-old Montana men who died in a fall on Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s interior were also recovered Monday, Kerzman said. Brian McKenzie Kennedy of Columbia Falls and Jack Dewayne Beard of Kalispell were expert climbers who had been summitting mountain peaks in Glacier park for decades, park officials said in releasing their names Tuesday. Both were members of the Glacier Mountaineering Society, the park said in a statement. The men set out for a climb on July 22 and were to return the next day. They were reported missing July 24 and their bodies were spotted from a search helicopter Monday morning.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: President Joe Biden approved a request for a federal disaster declaration for a portion of Nebraska that suffered damage from severe storms and straight-line winds in May. The designation allows state, local and tribal governments and some private nonprofit organizations to access federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and for the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The declaration covers 20 counties from central to northeastern Nebraska. The counties included in the declaration are Antelope, Boone, Burt, Cedar, Cuming, Custer, Dixon, Garfield, Greeley, Holt, Knox, Logan, Pierce, Polk, Sherman, Thurston, Valley, Wayne, Wheeler, and York. A line of severe storms that moved through the eastern half of the state on May 12 generated straight-line winds of up to 100 mph in some places, the National Weather Services reported, downing power lines, poles and trees and damaging buildings.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Another body has surfaced at Lake Mead – this time in a swimming area where water levels have dropped as the Colorado River reservoir behind Hoover Dam recedes because of drought. The National Park Service did not say in a statement how long officials believe the corpse was submerged in the Boulder Beach area before it was found Monday by people who summoned park rangers. Clark County Coroner Melanie Rouse said Tuesday it was partially encased in mud at the water line of the swimming area along the shore north of Hemenway Harbor marina. The gender of the dead person was not immediately apparent, Rouse said, and it was too early to tell a time, cause and manner of death. Investigators will review missing persons records as part of the effort, Rouse said. The corpse was the third found since May as the shoreline retreats at the shrinking reservoir between Nevada and Arizona east of Las Vegas. The lake surface has dropped more than 170 feet since the reservoir was full in 1983. It is now about 30% full. The coroner said her office was continuing work to identify a man whose body was found May 1 in a rusted barrel in the Hemenway Harbor area and a man whose bones were found May 7 in a newly surfaced sand bar near Callville Bay, more than 9 miles from the marina. On July 6, the body of a 22-year-old Boulder City woman was found in the water near where she disappeared while riding a personal watercraft. Rouse said it might take several weeks to determine her cause of death. The case of the body in the barrel was being investigated as a homicide after police said the man had been shot and his clothing dated to the mid-1970s to early 1980s.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: The state Executive Council – which approves nominations and state contracts – voted 4-1 to deny funding to the Equality Health Center, Lovering Health Center and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. The contracts, which were supported by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, would have funded cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, contraception and other routine health care services for more than 16,000 low-income women. The outcome was the same when the council voted in September, December and January. Wednesday was the first vote since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal right to abortion. Republican councilors previously raised concerns that public money would pay for abortions and continued to vote no even after audit reports confirmed that funds were not commingled.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:Hospitalized patients in New Jersey who have tested positive for the coronavirus have surpassed 1,000 again for the first time since February and most of the state is back to seeing high rates of transmission as a new mutation continues to spread quickly, data from the state Department of Health shows. But administrators at some of the state’s largest hospital networks said most patients have relatively mild symptoms and are being sent home with medication. The latest surge is being driven by the omicron BA.5 subvariant, which makes up about 82% of all positive cases in New Jersey and New York – up from 64% less than two weeks ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gun-safety advocates said police, prosecutors and judges are still learning how to harness a 2020 red-flag law that can be used to seize guns from people who pose a danger to others or themselves. Shiela Lewis offers training to police, prosecutors and school administrators on how to petition a judge for a red-flag order to temporarily seize guns for a one-year period that can be extended. She told a panel of state legislators Tuesday that an incomplete understanding of the current law is limiting its use as a precaution against gun violence. Just nine petitions have been filed to have guns removed since New Mexico’s red-flag law went into effect in May 2020. The state Department of Health said it plans to begin soliciting grants aimed at preventing gun violence, starting in August.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A jury was asked Tuesday to consider whether a neurologist used his thriving pain-management practice to sexually prey on six patients or if he is a victim of accusers with false stories. The case against Dr. Ricardo Cruciani relied on “survivor stories of six very different women,” assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said in closing arguments at Cruciani’s trial. “This is a trial about a doctor who raped, sodomized, hugged and manipulated his patients,” Lucey said. The prosecutor argued the evidence showed Cruciani groomed patients by overprescribing pain killers, sometimes to treat serious injuries from car wrecks and other accidents. The accusers testified the sexual abuse often occurred behind closed doors during appointments in 2013 at a Manhattan medical center, where the doctor would expose himself and demand sex. Defense attorney Fred Sosinsky countered by arguing the witnesses were unreliable, telling jurors, “You should have every reason to doubt these accusations.” He added that the witnesses “were willing to lie” and “dispute the indisputable.” Cruciani, 68, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including rape, sexual abuse and predatory sexual assault. The jury worked for about an hour late Tuesday without reaching a verdict. It was to resume deliberations Wednesday morning.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Mayor Vi Lyles won a third term Tuesday as the Democrat defeated Republican rival Stephanie de Sarachaga-Bilbao by a more than 2-to-1 margin, according to unofficial results. In Greensboro, the state’s third-largest city, Mayor Nancy Vaughan led challenger Justin Outling by more than 400 votes in the officially nonpartisan race. The News & Record of Greensboro reported that Outling, a city councilmember, declined to concede late Tuesday, saying he wanted to wait for other votes to be counted. There are an unknown number of provisional and mail-in absentee ballots outstanding. About 15% of the mayoral votes counted by Tuesday were for write-in candidates. Meanwhile, Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker lost handily to former deputy Willie Rowe in a runoff for the Democratic nomination. Rowe will now take on Republican Donnie Harrison – a former sheriff – in the November election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s only abortion clinic was preparing for what could be its final day of performing procedures, with a trigger ban set to take effect Thursday that will likely force patients to travel hundreds of miles to receive care pending the clinic’s relocation across the border to Minnesota. Barring a judge’s intervention, the Red River Women’s Clinic will provide abortion services Wednesday and then shut down. Owner Tammi Kromenaker is building a clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota, with the aid of nearly $1 million raised through GoFundMe. Kromenaker has not said when the new clinic will open and she did not respond to messages Tuesday. Planned Parenthood has said it can perform abortions at its own Moorhead facility to fill the gap if needed, but it is not known if that will happen. Once North Dakota’s ban takes effect, the nearest abortion clinics will be in Minneapolis and Duluth, a drive of about 4 hours from Fargo, and in Billings, Montana, which is nearly 4 hours from North Dakota’s western border.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio man who admitted threatening a witness after posting videos from the U.S. Capitol riots was sentenced Wednesday to two years of probation. Justin Stoll of Wilmington pleaded guilty in January in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati to transmitting a threat to injure. Authorities alleged Stoll breached the security barricades at the Capitol but did not enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021. According to court documents, Stoll attended the rally and went with other rioters past police barricades that had been torn down. He recorded videos showing this and posted them online. When one online viewer said they saved his video, Stoll warned if the viewer took action to “ever jeopardize me, from being with my family,” then the person would meet his or her “maker,” and that he would be the one to “arrange the meeting.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Crews are expected to break ground this fall for a new fairgrounds coliseum to replace “The Big House,” which opened in 1965 and helped the OKC Fairgrounds become known as “The Horse Show Capital of the World.” The new coliseum will be constructed for just over $102 million. Rising construction costs and inflation made the price tag much more than when a City Council memo in November 2020 estimated the cost at $73 million. Although a small portion of the Jim Norick arena will be demolished to make room for the coliseum, the arena will be fully operational during all phases of construction, fairgrounds spokesman Scott Munz said. The current fairgrounds arena has the largest economic impact of all publicly owned facilities in Oklahoma City, holding more than 250 event days a year, including international equine and livestock shows, concerts, sporting events and ice shows.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A man who reportedly ignited wildfires in a remote, forested corner of Oregon was apprehended by three local residents and tied to a tree until police arrived, a sheriff said Tuesday. Federal, state and county authorities responded to a radio call Monday from a U.S. Bureau of Land Management employee who reported a man was walking along a gravel road and setting fires in a forest about 25 miles northwest of Grants Pass. Ground crews, assisted by local residents, and three helicopters quickly got the two fires under control, Curry County Sheriff John Ward said. Meanwhile, three local residents located the suspect walking on the road near the fires and detained him. After being treated at a hospital for his injuries, Trennon Smith, 30, of Veneta, Oregon, was being held on Tuesday in the Curry County jail on charges of arson and reckless burning, Ward said. Court documents did not say if he has an attorney. Bond was set at $100,000.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A decision about whether the method of funding public education meets a state constitutional requirement was left in the hands of a state judge Tuesday when argument wrapped up in the long-running case. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer did not indicate when she will rule but said attorneys left her with a massive record to review. The case could result in substantial changes, as the plaintiffs are challenging whether the amounts and method of distribution of the annual education subsidies issued by the General Assembly comport with the state Constitution. The defendants, Republican leaders in the state House and Senate, argued funding has been growing and is adequate. State education funding was boosted in the budget that passed earlier this month and has increased by billions of dollars during Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s nearly eight years in office.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza said there would be no infringement of civil liberties with the deployment of the city’s license plate reading cameras despite concerns over a lack of public input. Although the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the cameras, designed by Atlanta company Flock Safety, and opposes the expansion of surveillance efforts, Elorza said “concerns about civil liberties being compromised will not materialize.” “I just urge everybody to have an open mind,” said City Council President John Igliozzi, who contended the cameras are essential to creating “a safe and secure environment to live in.” Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré said the cameras likely will be activated within the next 30 days. Paré said the policy governing the use of the cameras, which was distributed to reporters, was crafted over the course of 60 days. Flock is giving Providence 25 cameras at no cost for a one-year trial. The program did not receive any approval from the City Council, apparently because it did not need to be factored into the city’s budget.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette made history on Wednesday as the first gubernatorial ticket to file for reelection in South Carolina. This fall is only the second time voters will elect a governor and lieutenant governor together. Before 2018, lieutenant governors were elected separately. “We’ve had great success in the last four years,” McMaster told reporters after Evette signed her campaign paperwork. “She is fully conversant with the trials, tribulations and challenges of business. … I think that we offer a good, strong team that’s fully committed to the great people of South Carolina.” In 2018, as he sought his first full term, McMaster became the first governor to run on the same ticket as his pick for lieutenant governor. At the time, Evette was a political newcomer, a Greenville businesswoman McMaster said he picked in part because of her “fresh eyes” when it came to governing, as well as her relationships with the business community. Over the past four years, Evette has spent many months traveling the state, meeting with companies and businesses, as well as promoting relationships between South Carolina’s technical training schools, the strength of which both she and the governor have argued is key to the state’s growing manufacturing economy. In November, McMaster will face Democrat Joe Cunningham, a former one-term congressman. Cunningham has said he will announce his pick for a running mate next week. No Democrat has captured South Carolina’s top job in 20 years, and Republicans have held all statewide-elected offices for more than a decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A stalk of corn is growing in front of a home – in the concrete – at the 5700 block of W. Silver Valley Drive near Dunham Park on the city’s west side. It’s the second report of corn growing in unexpected places this week after a corn plant was found by a golfer at the Elmwood Gold Course on Monday in a sand bunker. Both plants were photographed and shared by separate people on the Sioux Falls Reddit page to the delight of others ready to relive what some consider the most positive story of 2020 in the city. In 2020, the 57th Street Corn became the talk of the town, inspiring T-shirts, memes and photos from fans across the region. The corn was later found pulled from the ground near the intersection at 57th Street and Minnesota Avenue. The Silver Valley Drive Corn is still a young plant, but Ldyia Smith, the owner of the house in front of the plant, said it’s in good hands. “I said that we could start serving street corn once it started growing,” Smith said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A Black repertory theater said it plans to open a tuition-free school for at-risk students and other groups in a historic church that will be renovated after falling into disrepair. Hattiloo Theatre said the new program is expected to begin in late 2023. Students will be accepted based on auditions, and two-thirds of admissions will be reserved for low-income and marginalized students, the theater said Tuesday. Hattiloo Theater School will hold free audition workshops in at-risk neighborhoods. Programs will include youth courses based on experience level and age, a diverse abilities course and a senior citizen course, the theater said. The school will be housed in the Third Presbyterian Church, built in 1860. A community redevelopment agency plans to fund renovations. The church served as a hospital for federal Civil War troops, and it has changed names and congregations over the years, the theater said.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The building housing one of the city’s oldest grocery stores will be remade into medical offices anchored by El Paso Children’s Hospital doctors’ offices and possibly a clinic. The Food City building at 5400 Alameda Ave. was sold June 30 by the grocery store owners to an El Paso developer for an undisclosed amount. The 50-year-old store is expected to close about Aug 10, a Food City official said. The building and the 5 acres it stands on are valued for tax purposes at $3.7 million by the El Paso Central Appraisal District. Food City officials notified the Texas Workforce Commission that it would lay off 90 people by Sept. 3. However, that number is now about 55 because some employees were placed at Food City’s two other El Paso stores, Carlos Loweree, Food City vice president, said Tuesday. El Paso Children’s Hospital officials in a statement said the hospital is leasing a portion of the Food City building because it needs more office space for doctors as it continues to employ more physician specialists.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Miniature bottles of alcohol could return to liquor stores in deeply religious Utah by the fall after the state agency that oversees alcohol approved a rule change Tuesday. Members of the state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Services Commission voted unanimously to allow spirits to be sold in sizes slightly larger than the average shot or glass of wine, Fox 13 reported. The commission plans to open the proposed rule change to public comment and, barring concerns, could institute it by the fall. A decadeslong prohibition on miniature alcohol bottles is one of many unique liquor laws in Utah, where a majority of the population are members of the alcohol-eschewing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Church officials have said the state’s laws are reasonable and effectively curtail excessive drinking and DUIs while still allowing people to drink responsibly. As Utah draws an increasing number of tourists and residents who aren’t members of the church, new tensions have arisen over the state’s liquor laws and concerns have grown over whether they entrench the state’s reputation as a religiously conservative place intolerant of those who drink alcohol. Alcohol regulators said the push bring back mini-bottles came from businesses in tourist-reliant parts of the state.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Shelburne Street roundabout will soon be completely open to traffic after a year of construction, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Although the $10 million project won't officially be done until next spring, the roundabout will be fully functional in late summer or early, fall said project manager Mike LaCroix via email. Planners hope the roundabout will lead to a safer situation for motorists and pedestrians as the former maze of merging lanes contributed to many serious accidents. The roundabout will be located at the intersection of Shelburne Road, South Willard Street, Ledge Road and Locust Street in the south end. Workers are now installing streetlights, curbing, splitter islands and sidewalks, as well as paving the shared-use paths and roadway, applying temporary line striping and making landscaping enhancements. This work will continue for the next few months.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A Virginia company and its owner have agreed to pay $310,000 to resolve allegations they violated federal and state law by submitting false bills to Medicare and Medicaid, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Jacob Patterson, 66 of Danville was a pharmacist who owned and operated Piedmont Infusion Services. The company employed nurses and nursing assistants to provide patients with compounded ,prescriptions as well as needle and catheter method medications ordered by their physicians, the department’s news release said. Piedmont Infusion Services did not employ a physician or “physician extender” such as a physician’s assistant to provide patient care. From 2013 through the beginning of 2018, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services falsely billed Medicare and Medicaid for high-level office visits that didn’t occur, a news release said. In addition, Patterson and Piedmont Infusion Services also fraudulently double-billed Medicare Part B for medications already billed to Medicare Part D. Prosecutors said a former employee of Piedmont Infusion Services came forward as a whistleblower and helped the government in its investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle chapter of the Audubon Society said it is dropping “Audubon” from its name because the man the organization is named after was a slave owner and opposed abolition. KNKX reported Seattle Audubon is one the largest chapters of the National Audubon Society, the nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats. Earlier this month, the board voted to change the chapter’s name because the man the organization is named after – illustrator, painter and bird lover John James Audubon, author of the seminal work “The Birds of America” – owned enslaved people. J. Drew Lanham, a former board member of the National Audubon Society and a wildlife ecology professor at Clemson University, called the move courageous. Lanham, who has written about Audubon and left the national chapter over concerns the nonprofit was not doing enough about racial equity, said organizations need to grapple with what to do about problematic monuments. Last year, the Audubon Naturalist Society, a Washington-based environmental organization, said it would remove “Audubon” from its name, but it is not affiliated with the National Audubon Society. Seattle Audubon said it plans to choose a new name by the end of the year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia corrections commissioner Betsy Jividen is resigning, Gov. Jim Justice said. Jividen’s resignation is effective Aug. 5. Justice said Tuesday he will begin the process of filling the vacancy. Jividen was appointed to lead the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation in 2018. She served as an acting and interim U.S. attorney for the state’s northern district. Her work as an assistant federal prosecutor dates to 1980. The corrections division operates 15 prisons, work-release centers and related facilities. It has more than 2,000 employees.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels said during a debate he can be taken at his word that he won’t raise gas taxes. Primary challenger Rebecca Kleefisch accused him of not taking responsibility for previously being in leadership roles for groups that backed increasing gas taxes. Kleefisch, Michels and state Rep. Tim Ramthun debated on the radio three days after a television debate and less than two weeks before the Aug. 9 primary. The winner will advance to face Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in November. Michels, who is endorsed by Donald Trump and co-owns the state’s largest construction company, Michels Corp., said he “never once” said he wanted to raise the gas tax. He said the groups he was on that lobbied for raising the gas tax, including the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, came to a consensus on issues and he didn’t always agree. Kleefisch and former Gov. Scott Walker have attacked Michels over the gas tax issue.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A judge temporarily blocked the state’s abortion ban on the day it took effect, siding with a women’s health clinic and others who argued the ban would harm health care workers and their patients and violate the state constitution. Attorneys arguing in front of Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens in Jackson disagreed over whether the state Constitution provided a right to abortion. Owens was sympathetic, however, with arguments that the ban left pregnant women with dangerous complications and their doctors in a difficult position. “That is a possible irreparable injury to the plaintiffs. They are left with no guidance,” Owens said. The U.S. Supreme Court formally issued its judgment Tuesday in the June 24 Dobbs v. Jackson ruling – a step that allows some state trigger laws to ban abortion to take effect. Those suing in Wyoming include a nonprofit opening a Casper women’s and LGBTQ health clinic that would have offered abortions. A May arson attack has set back the clinic’s opening from mid-June until at least the end of this year, months past the start of Wyoming’s new abortion ban. The four Wyoming women and two nonprofits that sued Monday claim the new law violates several rights guaranteed by the state constitution, including a “fundamental right to be left alone by the government.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/06/first-spouse-dolls-snowstang-sand-sculpture-news-around-states/40770471/", "title": "First Spouse Dolls, Snowstang: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey will light the state Christmas tree in a ceremony at 5:30 p.m. Friday at the Alabama Capitol. The public is invited to attend. The 151st Army National Guard Band and other musical performances will begin at 5 p.m. The theme of the ceremony is “Every light a prayer for peace.” This year’s Christmas tree is a 35-foot-tall Eastern red cedar grown in Bullock County. It was donated by Ray Allen’s farm of Fitzpatrick. The tree will be displayed on the front steps of the state Capitol. Decorations will include ornaments commemorating Alabama’s bicentennial.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The governor wants public input on an upcoming bill to set up a legal framework for Alaska Native tribal governments to operate K-12 schools, officials say. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy plans to introduce the bill during the next legislative session, The Anchorage Daily News reports. Tribes would be asked to enter into agreements with the state called compacts to operate the schools, education officials say. The state education department plans to hold a series of community meetings this month and in early 2020 to hear Alaska residents’ comments and questions, officials say. The schools would be open to all students and “offer a unique, culturally rich combination of Western and millennia-old tribal educational models,” the education department says.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: It’s taken 17 years, but the City Council has chosen a location and is moving forward with opening a Latino cultural center. The council voted Wednesday to build the center, which will support Latino arts and culture, in the north building of Margaret T. Hance Park downtown. But the years­long debate over the proper location continued during the meeting, with some suggesting the city find a spot more relevant to the Latino community. Councilman Carlos Garcia said the location did not meet the needs of the growing Latino community, which is expected to surpass 50% of the state’s population by 2020, according to a city-commissioned study. Councilwoman Thelda Williams stressed that the vote Wednesday marked the furthest the project has been able to get in 17 years and warned against further stalling.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the state attorney general’s request to prohibit a judge who demonstrated against the death penalty from handling any cases involving her office. In a 4-3 decision, justices rejected the request by Attorney General Leslie Rutledge to remove the cases from Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen’s court. The court did not elaborate on the reason for its decision. Griffen was prohibited from handling execution cases in 2017 after he participated in an anti-death penalty demonstration the same day he blocked the state from using a lethal injection drug. Rutledge asked in September that the order on execution cases be expanded to include all civil cases involving her office. She accused Griffen of regularly yelling at attorneys from her office when they appeared in his court. Griffen has denied any claims of bias.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The governor on Wednesday blamed the Trump administration for withholding data needed to release $650 million in state aid to combat homelessness. California’s cities and counties have been waiting since June for the money approved by the Legislature. But state law says the money can only be distributed based on federally approved homelessness counts for 2019. Most California communities submitted their homeless counts months ago. But the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has not yet approved them. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the delay “politicized roadblocks put up by the Trump administration.” Instead of waiting, Newsom said his administration has collected preliminary homeless data from California communities. Based on those numbers, Newsom said the state will open applications involving as much as $500 million of the money.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State transportation officials unveiled plans Wednesday for a bus system that will shuttle skiers and snowboarders from Denver to three resorts in an effort to ease traffic congestion exacerbated by a recent population boom. Gov. Jared Polis said during a ceremony at Denver’s Union Station that the “Snowstang” service, which begins Dec. 14, will be “really convenient” and “super easy.” “We know that by providing more alternatives for people to go in buses or other ways of getting there, we can also have an impact on reducing traffic during peak times,” he said, standing across the street from three 51-seat buses equipped with restrooms, power outlets, Wi-Fi and luggage racks. The Colorado Department of Transportation will run the service to Loveland Ski Area, Arapahoe Basin and Steamboat on Saturdays and Sundays throughout winter, as well as the Martin Luther King Jr. and Presidents Day holidays.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Over a dozen people gathered Wednesday in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the city to protest the nearly 2-year-long detention of a Connecticut immigrant marked for deportation. Mayor Luke Bronin joined the wife of Bakhodir Madjitov and others to support the Uzbek immigrant and father of three children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. “I’m living in pain with broke bones since my third child was born; I can neither work nor live peacefully,” his wife, Madina Madjitov, said at the rally. “I don’t think I can provide normal life without my husband for my children.” Diana Blank, one of the man’s lawyers, said he was granted in November two temporary emergency stays of removal by federal courts. He originally had a final order of removal of no later than Dec. 2. It’s unclear now how soon he could be deported.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A bear has caused an uproar after running through the streets of the First State’s biggest city. Police spent part of Thursday morning trying to catch the animal while bystanders rushed to get a look. Some residents were told to shelter in place. But by 11:15 a.m., police said the bear had left their jurisdiction. It’s unclear where the animal went, but it caused widespread excitement in a city and a state that rarely see bears. During the morning, the bear was seen in a backyard and in an alley. People later spotted it on railroad tracks behind a grocery store and then moving toward a park. Wilmington police said they had planned to tranquilize the bear. But they also warned that they might have to shoot it if the animal came to close to people. The sighting in Wilmington comes after drivers reported seeing a bear crossing major highways earlier in the week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new D.C. Council proposal looks to create equity among parent teacher organizations in the district, WUSA-TV reports. Councilmember David Grosso has introduced a bill that would create an equity fund to benefit PTOs in the D.C. public school district. The bill’s language dictates that after a PTO expends more than $10,000 in a school year, it will be charged an “equity fee” of 10 cents for every additional dollar it spends. The monies collected from those fees will then go toward the equity fund, which would then be equally distributed to other PTOs in the district. PTOs often raise funds on the behalf of schools to finance field trips and extracurricular activities. According to Grosso’s office, last year 75% of D.C. elementary schools did not report having any PTO revenue.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: It took artist Leandro Erlich two years and 330 tons of sand to create his largest work of art to date – a giant traffic jam, made entirely of sand. Erlich was commissioned by the city of Miami Beach to create the work, which was unveiled during Art Basel. The surreal traffic jam depicts 66 life-sized sculptures of cars and trucks stuck in an imaginary traffic jam on the oceanfront of popular Lincoln Road. The installation is meant to suggest a future relic, like a contemporary Pompeii, and alludes to Miami’s fragile position in the large universal canvas, touching on climate crisis and rising sea levels. The installation cost over a million dollars, but the city paid $300,000 thanks to sponsors and donations. It will remain on display until Dec. 15.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some Georgia State University students are demanding that the mayor remove a prominent downtown statue of a 19th century newspaper editor who called for maintaining white supremacy in the South. Henry Grady advocated for a “New South” after the Civil War. A plaque on the statue, erected in 1891, describes him as a patriot. But Grady also campaigned against equality for freed slaves, saying that “the supremacy of the white race of the South must be maintained forever.” “Let us be clear in recognizing that Grady, as a journalist, promoted racism,” several student groups wrote in an editorial Tuesday in Georgia State’s student newspaper. “Grady, as an orator, promoted racism. And Grady was certainly no patriot – he was simply a racist.” They want the statue relocated to the Atlanta History Center, but if Georgia law won’t allow that, they’ll accept a new marker explaining Grady’s beliefs.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State health officials have investigated dozens of adult residential care homes in the state after receiving reports that the facilities were operating without licenses. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports that the state Department of Health has received 114 complaints about unlicensed homes, and 74 remain open. Officials say state legislators passed a law last year authorizing the department to investigate and enter unlicensed care homes amid plans to crack down on these facilities. State officials say they have entered and inspected 52 homes so far with plans to issue 13 notices of violation to illegal operators. Officials say some residents of these homes have lost thousands of dollars because health insurers do not cover unlicensed facilities. Department officials say there likely are not enough licensed facilities for residents.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is the least-regulated in the nation, Gov. Brad Little said Wednesday. The Republican said he’s cut or simplified 75% of Idaho’s administrative rules this year and leapfrogged ahead of South Dakota as the least-regulated state. State officials said they base the state’s least-regulated status on information collected by George Mason University. Little said he’s eliminated more than 30,000 restrictions and some 1,800 pages of regulations. Little had sweeping authority to eliminate thousands of rules after state lawmakers fought over the administrative rules process and failed to renew them before adjourning in April. Little said the cuts to regulations will help the economy. “Folks, when you reduce friction on entrepreneurs, good-paying jobs will follow,” the governor declared.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Hundreds of artifacts belonging to Abraham Lincoln and his family will remain in the state’s hands with the refinancing of a loan used to buy them. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Foundation says it has refinanced the 2007 loan it used to purchase 1,500 items from collector Louise Taper. The foundation voted last year to seek an auction house to prepare selling some of the items in the collection, which includes a stovepipe hat purportedly belonging to Lincoln, if it couldn’t pay off the $9.2 million remaining on the loan by this fall when the note came due. But the foundation says it negotiated a three-year extension with Lake Forest Bank and Trust at a lower interest rate. In addition to the hat whose authenticity has been challenged, the collection includes the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University President Mitch Daniels apologized Wednesday for recent remarks in which he described an African American scholar as “one of the rarest creatures in America.” “I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students,” Daniels wrote in a letter sent to the Purdue chapter of the NAACP, Purdue’s Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff, the Black Student Union and other groups. “The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved.” Daniels made the comment Nov. 20 after a meeting with Purdue Student Government leaders when students asked Daniels to follow up on his thoughts about what Purdue was doing to promote diversity on campus and to make underrepresented minority students feel welcome.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A man convicted of delivering meth two decades ago should have been added to the state’s database of felons banned from voting, but an embarrassing clerical error instead listed the police force that busted him. The inclusion of the Des Moines Police Department among the names of murderers, drug dealers and other disenfranchised criminals is just one glaring example of the mistakes, wrongful additions and omissions that make the 103,000-entry database unreliable, a review by the Associated Press found. “Holy cow!” Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek said as he was alerted to the error. “You would think there would be an audit with something as important as voting.” The database, which is part of the state’s 14-year-old voter registration system, helps determine a person’s eligibility to cast a ballot, run for public office or serve as a public official.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Death typically brings two options – burial or cremation – but a third option could be on the horizon in the state. The Kansas City Star reports that something called promession, the creation of a Swedish biologist, would allow the body to be cryogenically frozen and vibrated into tiny pieces. Proponents say it holds the potential to make burial more environmentally friendly. Promession has been used on pigs but so far has not been tried on humans. Still, the company pursuing the idea sees Kansas as fertile ground for the new method. That company, Promessa, has one of its few U.S. representatives based in Overland Park. Meanwhile, a state lawmaker may introduce a bill in 2020 to clear the way for the new method.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Abbey of Gethsemani has been added to the Kentucky Natural Areas Registry. The Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves said in a statement that it was recognizing the abbey’s historic stewardship of more than 1,500 acres of land in Nelson County. The voluntary designation is designed to recognize stewardship and awareness of the ecological significance of a property, state officials say. Landowners don’t relinquish any rights but agree to protect the area as best they can. Abbot Elias Dietz said he looks forward to collaborating with state officials to preserve and enhance natural areas such as grasslands and glades. Properties on the registry must have habitat for plants or animals that are rare or have a declining population, or they must contain an outstanding example of a Kentucky ecological community, such as an old-growth forest, wetland, glade or prairie.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A parish commission has approved funding to remove a Confederate monument during a special budget meeting. The Caddo Parish Commission allocated $500,000 to remove the 30-foot-tall marble and granite Confederate monument in downtown Shreveport that was erected in 1905 on the north side of the Caddo Courthouse lawn. Although the commission has the funding to remove the statue, there’s still a legal battle brewing between the parish and the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The organization filed a temporary restraining order against the parish and the commission, halting the removal of the statue, and during Tuesday’s meeting continued speaking out in opposition of the statue’s removal. A judge ruled Nov. 29 that neither the parish nor the commission could move the statue, for now. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 13.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s independent U.S. senator says blueberry growers need help from the federal government to survive the Trump administration’s trade battle with China. Sen. Angus King says the value of Maine’s wild blueberry exports to China is on pace to drop by nearly 97% since 2017. Maine is America’s producer of wild blueberries, which are smaller than cultivated blueberries and are widely used in frozen and processed products. King says it’s unfair that Maine wild blueberry growers haven’t been included in President Donald Trump’s farm bailout programs. He says the blueberries are “an iconic Maine agricultural product” that has “lost a piece of its future.” The Maine wild blueberry industry is facing other difficulties outside the trade dispute with China. Prices for the fruit have been much lower than they were earlier this decade. The size of the harvest last year was also the lowest in more than a decade.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Four chambers of commerce in the state are endorsing a plan to build a $10 billion high-speed maglev train between Baltimore and Washington. The chambers of commerce for the city of Baltimore, Baltimore County, northern Anne Arundel County and Prince George’s County voiced support for the first phase of the project Wednesday. The high-speed train would help economic development and local business opportunities, the groups say. It could connect the two cities in 15 minutes along a 36-mile route. The project is currently under review by federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Federal Railroad Administration. The four chambers of commerce serve more than 1,500 member organizations, representing cities, agencies and businesses throughout portions of central Maryland.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A proposed ballot question that would overhaul the state’s electoral system has cleared another hurdle on the way to next year’s ballot. The group Voter Choice for Massachusetts is pushing what is called a ranked-choice voting system. On Wednesday, the group said it has submitted more than enough voter signatures to move the question along. Under the proposed system, voters have the option of ranking candidates on the ballot in order of their preference. If a candidate garners a majority of first-place votes, that candidate wins. If no candidate receives a majority of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who ranked the eliminated candidate as their first choice will have their vote count instantly toward their second choice. The process repeats until one candidate receives a majority of the vote and wins.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state is opening its surplus store for a one-day sale Saturday. The shelves will be stocked with goods from police, airports and colleges, and property no longer needed by state government. The goods include computers, phones, knives, sporting goods, desks, chairs and even fashion accessories. The store in Lansing will be open from 8 a.m. to noon. Cash and credit cards will be accepted. More information is available online. Online shoppers can bid 24 hours a day at Michigan.gov/MiBid.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State budget officials projected a $1.332 billion surplus in the current two-year budget period Thursday, setting up contentious debates for the 2020 legislative session on whether to save the extra money or spend it, possibly to cover tax cuts. Budget Commissioner Myron Frans credited the surplus to a better-than-expected finish to the last budget period, a rosier revenue forecast and a modest decrease in estimated spending. He said the extra revenue will also boost the state’s separate budget reserve – a cushion against economic downturns – to $2.359 billion. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic legislative leaders joined Frans in urging a cautious approach to using the money, given that the forecast predicts slower economic growth over the next four years and doesn’t account for inflation in program costs. But they agreed the forecast shows the state can afford to pass a sizable public works borrowing package.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: William Carey University is waiving tuition for a professional development course in an effort to combat the state’s teacher shortage. The university said in a statement that the course can be used to renew a Mississippi Educator License. It begins in January and lasts five weeks, news outlets report. The class will be taught online, Dr. Teresa Poole told WHLT-TV. Poole says anyone can apply, but preference will be given to practicing teachers and those who have licenses that are about to expire. There is a $85 application fee. The deadline to apply is Jan. 8, and the course begins the following Monday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri has received a $500,000 grant that will help it restart a law clinic dedicated to investigating possible cases of wrongful conviction. KMIZ reports the grant from the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice will fund the MU Innocence Clinic. The money will pay for DNA tests on evidence involved in cases where eyewitnesses may have misidentified a suspect. Law professor Rodney Uphoff says the school will partner with the Midwest Innocence Project, a law firm that specializes in exonerating inmates who may actually be innocent. Students in the clinic will review cases of the firm’s clients to interview witnesses in the case and identify possible pieces of evidence for testing. Eight students will work in the clinic during the 2020 spring semester.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: National park officials have announced plans for the selective slaughter of between 600 and 900 Yellowstone bison this winter to help manage population numbers. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports the officials expect most of the animals to be taken by hunters or shipped to slaughter. Some would stay alive in corrals or under park quarantine. Officials say the exact number of bison expected to be culled out of the estimated 4,900 depends on the winter migration. State, federal and tribal agencies managing bison say the winter plan was finalized Tuesday under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, a day after a judge rejected an attempt to block bison hunts this year. Officials say the plan includes putting 110 bison into brucellosis quarantine to produce disease-free bison.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Madonna Rehabilitation Hospitals is planning a $57 million expansion on its Lincoln campus and expects to begin construction in the spring. The project is a planned three-story, 112,000-square-foot patient wing that will also add 59 new rooms to replace ones that were built in the early 1970s, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Madonna currently has 120 patient rooms, about half of which were upgraded and modernized in 2000. Hospital officials said at a news conference Wednesday that the new rooms will be bigger and more modern than current ones, allowing patients to be more independent and providing more room for staff and families. Construction will develop in phases and is expected to be completed by January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s two public universities saw significant spikes from 2017 to 2018 in reports of sexual violence, according to annual data going to the Nevada System of Higher Education board. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the tally says rape, fondling, stalking, and domestic and dating violence went up at the University of Nevada, Reno and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Police chiefs from both campuses attributed the numbers to an increase in reporting by students. “We’ve gone too long with people not feeling comfortable with reporting,” said Todd Renwick, police director at UNR, Truckee Meadows Community College, Western Nevada College and the Desert Research Institute in Reno. He said an Office on Violence Against Women grant was used to hire an in-house coordinator to field sexual assault cases, help victims file police reports and Title IX complaints, and connect with outside resources.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is taking steps to salvage federal money for schools that provide mental health counseling, speech therapy and other services to students, Gov. Chris Sununu and other state officials said Wednesday. The Medicaid to Schools program allows schools to be reimbursed by the federal government for services provided to Medicaid-eligible students. While it once applied only to special education students, the state expanded the program in 2017, and it now covers thousands of students from virtually every district. The program is in jeopardy, however, because under new federal guidance issued in July, those providing the services must be licensed by a medical board, not just credentialed by the state Department of Education. To address that issue, Sununu signed an executive order Wednesday to temporarily speed up the licensing process, and bipartisan legislation is being drafted to create a permanent change.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The Ocean Casino resort has hired a female CEO, one of a small handful of women leading casinos or casino companies nationwide. Terry Glebocki was named CEO this week after serving in the job in an interim capacity since August. She has more than 30 years of financial management experience and recently served as the casino’s chief financial officer. Glebocki previously worked for Tropicana Entertainment and Trump Entertainment Resorts. Ocean is the only one of Atlantic City’s nine casinos to be led by a woman. Glebocki says maintaining profitability and increasing revenue are her top goals. She also says she reads every social media post she can find from customers about the casino.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Commerce Department is awarding the city a $1.2 million grant to help with redevelopment of its historic rail yards. Commerce Department officials were joined by Mayor Tim Keller and others in announcing the funding Wednesday. They say the award is expected to create more than 300 jobs and generate $9 million in private investment. The federal grant will be matched by local funds. Efforts to revitalize the rail yards began more than a decade ago with the creation of a special advisory board, and the city adopted a master plan for the 27-acre site in 2014. One portion is now used for a popular weekend market that features local vendors.Aside from attracting new retail, office and hospitality businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the grant could lead to expansion of Albuquerque’s film industry.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: One of the brightest signs of the holiday season has come to light. The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree was officially turned on Wednesday night, at an event featuring celebrities including Idina Menzel, Lea Michele and Ne-Yo among the performers. The tree, a Norway spruce that’s more than 60 years old, stands 77 feet tall and was lit up in colorful Christmas lights before 10 p.m. It was on the property of Carol Schultz in the village of Florida, New York, and was cut down last month. The tree was decorated with miles of lights, with a huge Swarovski crystal star at the top. It stays in place until Jan. 17, when it will be taken down and donated to Habitat for Humanity to help build homes. There’s been a tree in Rockefeller Center at Christmastime since 1931. The holiday lighting has been broadcast since 1951.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: A second town in the state has canceled its Christmas parade over concerns about possible protests of a float celebrating the Confederacy. Leaders in Wake Forest had said last week that the town’s parade would go on and include the Sons & Daughters of the Confederacy despite a planned demonstration. That decision changed once police learned that the number of expected protesters had grown from 10 to 200 people, Police Chief Jeff Leonard says. The entire parade has now been canceled for safety reasons. This would have been the 72nd year of the parade, news outlets report. “We aren’t happy telling kids they can’t attend or participate in this year’s parade – but it’s better than trying to explain to a parent whose child was injured despite so many warning signs,” the chief said. The town of Garner also canceled its Christmas parade this year over fears that a float sponsored by the Sons of Confederate Veterans would be “targeted for disruption.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Burleigh County will hold a special meeting next week to take comments on whether it should resettle additional refugees. County commissioners postponed action on the matter at a meeting Monday after an overflow crowd showed up to address the issue. A recent executive order by President Donald Trump stated that new efforts to resettle refugees would have to receive permission from state and local governments. Gov. Doug Burgum announced last month that the state would continue to receive refugees as long as local governments agreed. The public will be able to voice opinions next Monday on whether to allow Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota to continue resettling refugees in the county. Commissioners could vote on the matter at the special meeting Monday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The governor wants lawmakers to drop bills that would prohibit local governments from forbidding the use of plastic bags. Gov. Mike DeWine opposes a pair of bills offered by fellow Republicans that would forbid municipalities and counties from banning single-use plastic bags by groceries and other stores. Some local governments, including Cuyahoga County and the Columbus suburb of Bexley, are trying to regulate the use of plastic bags in an effort to reduce litter and plastic waste in landfills. Some lawmakers and business groups say the local bans make it harder for grocers and other businesses to operate. DeWine said Wednesday that it would be a mistake for state lawmakers to override local government decisions. State government should allow allow local communities to do “what they think is best,” the governor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The State Department of Health has asked for less money in its proposed budget. Oklahoma Commissioner of Health Gary Cox asked legislators this week to decrease his agency’s funding by 1.5%. The Oklahoman reports the current state budget allocates $60.8 million to the department. Cox says he needs $56.2 million for fiscal 2021. Cox says he aims to minimize administrative costs and maximize services. He says he will eliminate unnecessary jobs and combine employee duties. He also notes that he plans to add nurses and other positions to work at local health departments. Lawmakers grilled Cox during Monday’s budget hearing, saying his proposal is confusing and counterintuitive because the public needs the funds. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Cox in September to lead the department.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Conservationists have successfully bred the extremely rare, federally threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly in captivity, a potential breakthrough for saving a species that once was found in coastal regions from California to British Columbia but is now reduced to five isolated populations, the Oregon Zoo says. The captive breeding resulted in 269 silverspot caterpillars that will be released into the wild once they transform into butterflies. “This is a really exciting breakthrough,” says Tia Perry, a keeper in the butterfly conservation lab. Perry says wild silverspots lay their eggs in the Oregon Zoo lab each year, but this is the first time a female butterfly bred in captivity. At the request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the zoo’s lab held back 22 pupae from this year’s butterfly release, and one of the resulting female butterflies mated in captivity with a wild male.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Owners of alligators and other dangerous reptiles will be required to register their pets with the city under an ordinance approved this week. The ordinance requires owners of alligators, crocodiles and venomous snakes to store and transport their pets in escape-proof containers. The owners must also provide the city with a list of each reptile they own. Rooms and buildings housing the animals also must be posted with notice that they contain reptiles. City Councilwoman Darlene Harris, who sponsored the bill, said regulations are needed, particularly after a number of loose alligators appeared in the city in recent months. At least four alligators were captured from May to October in the city and surrounding municipalities, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports. First-time violators could face a $300 fine per reptile. Repeat offenders could be assessed a fine of $10,000 per reptile.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: The University of Rhode Island’s College of Business has received the largest gift in the institution’s history, school officials announced Wednesday. Former Hasbro Inc. Chairman and CEO Alfred J. Verrecchia made a donation of $15 million with his wife, Gloria, to his alma mater to create a scholarship for students, a fund for students seeking competitive internships, a faculty chair and professorship, and an emerging technology fund. The gift will offer support to students who have secured internships but do not have the financial backing to pursue them. The faculty position will focus on artificial intelligence and business analytics. The technology fund is intended to provide the tools students will need to prepare them for their careers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A recently discovered letter that could implicate a former Greenville County sheriff and his team in the 1975 murder of a deputy and his father is missing. Greenville police found the letter in a stack of documents while cleaning out storage lockers at the Law Enforcement Center in April 2018 and subsequently lost it, according to a statement the department sent Thursday. The letter appeared to be addressed to late Sheriff Cash Williams from one of his mistresses and indicated he was involved in the murder of Frank and Rufus Looper, as well as framing the man ultimately convicted in the slayings, Police Chief Ken Miller told the Greenville Public Safety Review Board during a July meeting. In a statement sent Thursday, the Greenville Police Department said it has been unable to find the evidence after searching investigator work stations, case files, and storage areas.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem’s husband has reached another milestone in his role as first gentleman, albeit a very small one. Bryon Noem has been memorialized in the First Spouse Doll Case, where dolls are displayed with the attire that the spouse – and, in one instance, sister – of every South Dakota governor wore at their inauguration. The dolls date all the way back to one showing the dress worn by Margaret Wylie, the wife of South Dakota’s first governor, Arthur Mellette. Every doll is displayed in a series of cases in the South Dakota State Capitol. Bryon Noem’s doll is the first one not to be wearing a dress, instead sporting a miniature tuxedo and bow tie. It is also the only doll with a head, which Sandy Rhoden, who spearheaded the project, said had no special meaning.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennesseans are invited to visit the governor’s mansion this holiday season for self-guided tours. This year’s decorations are themed “Songs of the Season,” with each tree decorated to represent a different classic Christmas carol. Visitors may also bring donations to benefit several nonprofits from around the state. “Bill and I consider it a great privilege to be celebrating our first Christmas at the Tennessee Residence,” first lady Maria Lee said in a news release. “We are delighted to open the doors of Tennessee’s home and share in the joys of the season with our fellow Tennesseans.” The free holiday tours begin Friday. Reservations are required. More information about the tours and suggested donations for charity can be found online.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of children adopted from the state’s foster care has reached a four-year high, and just over half of the kids were adopted by family members, according to data released Wednesday by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. “This is certainly great news and affirmation that our year-round adoption efforts are paying off,” said Kristene Blackstone, an associate commissioner for Child Protective Services, an arm of DFPS. All told, more than 20,000 children left Texas foster care during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 1. However, only 6,107 found permanent homes through the adoption process. Of those, 3,095 were placed with family members. Both numbers are all-time highs, officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A massive open-pit copper mine in the Oquirrh Mountains southwest of the city will remain open through 2032 after the owners announced a new $1.5 billion investment. Rio Tinto announced Tuesday that it will invest $1.5 billion in the Bingham Canyon Mine due to increasing demand for copper in electric vehicles and renewable power technologies. Closures of other mines have also affected supply and made the investment make sense, Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a news release. The investment will extend the mine’s operations an additional six years beyond the previously anticipated shutdown in 2026. A 2013 landslide at the mine that carried enough rock, dirt and debris to bury New York’s Central Park under 66 feet of rubble set back production and triggered layoffs. The mine still employees 1,900 people.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has announced his annual State of the Union essay contest for the state’s high school students. It’s the tenth annual contest in which students describe a major issue facing the country and how to address it. The contest coincides with the president’s annual State of the Union speech to the joint session of Congress each January. Students must submit their 250-500 word essays by Jan. 8. A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers will judge the essays. The 10 finalists’ essays will be entered into the Congressional Record. Finalists also will be invited to be interviewed about the topic they covered. “We need our students to help find solutions for the problems that face our country as they are our future leaders,” Sanders says.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A commission assigned to research racist laws from the state’s past recommended Thursday that dozens of them be repealed, including measures that resisted desegregation, prevented black voters from casting ballots and prohibited interracial marriage. While most of the measures are outdated and “have no legal effect,” they are still enshrined in law, the nine-member commission of attorneys, judges, scholars and community leaders wrote in an interim report. Although “some of these acts were rendered null and void by an amended Virginia Constitution, by landmark civil rights cases or legislation, it’s clear that they are vestiges of Virginia’s segregationist past that still sit on the books,” Chief Deputy Attorney General Cynthia Hudson, who chairs the commission, said at a news conference in Richmond. “We should not afford them the distinction of that official status.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a voter-approved $30 car tab measure will remain on hold while a legal fight over the initiative’s constitutionality plays out. The Washington State Attorney General’s Office filed an emergency motion Monday saying Washington voters’ wishes were being “stymied” by a King County Superior Court judge’s decision to stop Initiative 976 from taking effect. On Tuesday, initiative sponsor Tim Eyman and his allies filed their own request to vacate the lower court’s injunction and move the case to the state Supreme Court. That was dismissed by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Voters last month approved I-976, the statewide measure that calls for lowering many vehicle registration fees to $30, rolling back car-tab taxes that fund Sound Transit and doing away with local car-tab fees. Much of the measure had been set to take effect Thursday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: After a photo surfaced of state correction officer trainees giving what appears to be the Nazi salute, state officials quickly suspended some employees, and the governor ordered the firing of those involved. The image, showing a more than two dozen trainees with their arms raised and faces blurred, was released Thursday by the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. Before the photo was made public, the agency’s secretary, Jeff Sandy, released a memo describing the image of Basic Training Class Number 18 as “distasteful, hurtful, disturbing, highly insensitive, and completely inappropriate.” He wrote that the picture “betrays the professionalism I have seen time and time again displayed and practiced by our brave correctional employees.” Sandy’s memo ordered all copies of the picture destroyed or taken out of circulation to prevent them from spreading.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: Workers will install a Christmas tree outside Pine Grove Cemetery’s Grand Avenue gate, a symbol of hope and resilience as the cemetery and the community contend with deep grief. The tree honors Patty Grimm, the cemetery’s general manager, who was shot and killed there Oct. 3. But cemetery leaders hope the tree can be used to help everyone in the community cope with loss during the holidays. Two others were wounded at the scene. Rosemelia Short, who is related to an employee at the cemetery, was hospitalized, treated and released shortly after the incident. William Buhse, who oversaw the cemetery’s work crew, was seriously wounded and is now undergoing long-term rehabilitation, says Pat Haskin, who is volunteering to help manage the cemetery until a new manager is hired to replace Grimm.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The U.S. Department of Energy has announced plans to partner with the University of Wyoming for further research on how to trap carbon dioxide before it leaks into the atmosphere. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the federal agency and university researchers plan to study the economics and technology behind carbon capturing at two of the state’s coal-fired power plants. Officials say research would begin at the Dave Johnston power plant in Glenrock and the Naughton power plant in Kemmerer. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon says he has remained committed to the state’s coal assets, as it produces about 40% of the nation’s coal despite declining demand nationwide and increasing interest in renewables and natural gas. Gordon says he encouraged the Legislature in January to support advancements in post-combustion carbon dioxide reduction technologies.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/23/space-squid-confederate-time-capsule-commutings-return-news-around-states/117191794/", "title": "Space squid, Confederate time capsule: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The city is ordering most of its water customers to use less, saying a leak in a key water line is reducing how much water it can pump out. Mayor Walt Maddox on Sunday ordered conservation measures for areas south of the Black Warrior River, including the University of Alabama, the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant and four rural water systems outside the city limits. City officials said they believed pipes that carry untreated water from Lake Tuscaloosa to a water treatment plant were leaking somewhere along a 2-mile stretch. But floodwaters from Tropical Storm Claudette were covering much of the low-lying areas where the pipes run. Maddox said it could be several days before workers found the leak. Water treatment capacity had fallen from 40 million gallons a day to 22 million gallons, the mayor said. He ordered people to turn off sprinkler systems, not wash cars, not wash pavement and not fill swimming pools until further notice. “That should sustain us with water conservation,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: An Alabama museum will return works of art to two Alaskan Native American tribes that requested the items back in 2017, decades after they were acquired for collections. A vote by the Birmingham City Council cleared the way for the Birmingham Museum of Art to return items to the Tlingit and Haida tribes, WBHM reports. The groups requested the return of pieces under a 1990 law that requires institutions which receive federal funds to return Native American cultural items to the respective tribes. The director of the museum, Graham C. Boettcher, told the council that the museum no longer had a “a moral, ethical or legal claim under federal law” to the art. The museum has several Tlingit items as part of its collection, including several spoons, baskets and bentwood boxes. Nearly all of them were purchased by the museum in 1956. The museum also lists three works by Haida artists, including two screen prints by Freida Deising and a Reg Davidson totem pole, all of which were acquired in 1994. Members of the Haida Nation and the Tlingit Nation live in southeastern Alaska. A central tribal government represents more than 32,000 Tlingit and Haida members, according to the groups’ website.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: House Democrats refused to show up at the state Capitol on Tuesday, blocking debate on a budget and a major tax cut primarily benefiting the wealthy. The move kept the House short of the number of lawmakers required to conduct business, forcing Republican House leaders to delay budget work until Thursday, when all GOP lawmakers are expected to be at the Capitol. House Democratic Leader Reginald Bolding said Democrats and the public need more time to review proposed changes Republicans released shortly before the budget debate was scheduled to begin. “You can’t simultaneously ignore the wishes of half the state and then take us for granted to pass a partisan budget,” he said in a statement. Denying a quorum is a tactic increasingly being weaponized by the minority parties of state legislatures in an era of intense partisanship. That hasn’t previously been an issue in Arizona, where a quorum requires the presence of only a simple majority of lawmakers. But on Tuesday, several Republicans planned to vote remotely under rules created during the pandemic, allowing Democrats to exploit the absences.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Monday announced he is creating an office that will focus on outdoor recreation in the state. Hutchinson said the new office of outdoor recreation will be part of the state Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism under the direction of Secretary Stacy Hurst, who will soon start a search for a director to lead the office. The Republican governor said he’s also creating a 10-person advisory board to help guide the new office. At a news conference with U.S. Rep. French Hill, Hutchinson also said the 459-acre Blue Mountain Natural Area site will be part of the state’s inventory of outdoor recreation sites, putting Arkansas in charge of all three mountains in the chain of Maumelle Pinnacles, along with Pinnacle Mountain and Rattlesnake Ridge. The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission partnered with the Nature Conservancy to purchase Blue Mountain from PotlatchDeltic, a timberland owner and lumber manufacturer. Hutchinson also announced the state has signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government to offer expanded recreation opportunities at Camp Ouachita and Lake Sylvia.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: COVID-19 vaccination rates for police and firefighting personnel in the city and for prison employees across the state are significantly lower than the average for other adults, raising concerns among medical ethicists and public safety leaders about whether unvaccinated first responders could become a threat to public health. While about 72% of adult Californians and 64% of Los Angeles residents 16 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, only about 51% of LA firefighters and 52% of the city’s police officers are at least partially vaccinated, the Los Angeles Times reports. Less than 30% of Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department staff have received vaccine doses through employee clinics, and about 54% of state corrections employees are at least partially vaccinated. The extent of the low vaccination rate is unclear because not all agencies keep track of who got their doses, whether through their workplace or elsewhere. Law enforcement analysts and ethicists said public safety workers should be allowed to make independent decisions about their health. However, they said the reluctance to get inoculated is a matter of public concern because they work in close spaces, such as jails and courthouses, and interact with some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis has signed three of six gun bills passed in the latest legislative session into law. The Denver Post reports the bills were all announced following a mass shooting at King Soopers in Boulder on March 22, when 10 people were killed. Earlier this year, Polis signed two other bills, setting regulations for safe storage of guns in homes and requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms. One other gun bill, meant to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, awaits the governor’s signature. The three bills signed Saturday will require an expanded background check before a person can buy a gun; give about $3 million to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment for the first year to create the state’s first Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which will be tasked with promoting efforts to reduce gun violence; and reverse a ban that keeps local governments, such as cities and counties, from creating their own gun regulations. Local jurisdictions can only make ordinances that are stricter, not more lenient, than state law. Any regulations currently in place that are less restrictive are overturned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration unveiled an $8 billion to $10 billion plan Monday that aims to reduce commuter rail times from Connecticut to New York City by as much as 25 minutes by 2035, while pledging in the meantime to make the trip from New Haven to the Big Apple 10 minutes faster as early as 2022. The announcement came on the same day Metro-North Railroad returned eight trains to the New Haven Line, as demand for commuter rail service increases as the region emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another service increase is planned in August. “Connecticut is coming back from COVID-19. Commuters are returning to the rails,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said during a news conference held at the Stratford Train Station to announce the Time for CT plan with Lamont and other officials. While much of the initiative is dependent upon passage of a massive federal infrastructure bill in Washington, state Department of Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti said the state has already received enough federal funding to embark on some of the work needed to alleviate long-standing slowdowns along the rails. That includes improvements to signalization systems and movable bridges, as well as the creation of new sections of track that allow trains to pass one another.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s minimum wage is expected to rise to $15 an hour by 2025. The Democrat-led state House voted along party lines Thursday to give final approval to a bill raising Delaware’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. Democrats approved the measure after defeating half a dozen Republican amendments, including proposals to allow small businesses and nonprofits to pay 85% of the minimum wage and to require the controller general’s office to submit annual reports regarding the fiscal impact of the wage increases on the state budget and more broadly on the state economy. Democrats also rejected a proposal by one of their own party members, Rep. Sherae’a Moore of Middletown, to delay each of the annual wage increases for one year for businesses employing 20 or fewer workers. The bill was sent to Democratic Gov. John Carney, who is expected to sign it. The measure was one of the legislative priorities for several left-leaning progressives who were elected last year and were able to get veteran Democrats to sign on to their cause. “In the last 15 years, we’ve made 15 attempts to raise the minimum wage. Only three of them bore fractional (fruit),” said Wilmington Democrat Rep. Gerald Brady, chief House sponsor of the bill.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Public Schools is combining graduations and vaccinations this week. The district plans to hold pop-up COVID-19 vaccine clinics at all its commencement ceremonies this week at Audi Field, WUSA-TV reports. While the class of 2021 gets to walk across the stage to receive diplomas, the graduates, friends and family can take time before and after the ceremony to get COVID-19 shots. The clinics are open to any graduate and their guests over the age of 12. On Friday, the district’s health department announced it’s giving away $51 gift cards to those who get their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at select clinics. And the district also launched a new task force last week to encourage residents to get their shots.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Crime was down overall in the Sunshine State during 2020, but violent crime rose, according to statistics released by the state Monday. There were 1,285 murders in Florida last year, an increase of 260, or 14.7%, from 2019. Of those, 1,025 were committed with a gun, up 20.2% from the year before. Murders committed with a gun made up nearly 80% of the state’s total, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s annual crime report. In a year when many people worked at home or stayed home more often during the coronavirus pandemic, burglaries, robberies and larcenies dropped significantly. There were 13,439 robberies, a drop of 17% from 2019; 51,928 burglaries, down 17.8%; and 291,923 larcenies, down 18.5%. Florida also saw a drop in the number of reported rapes, from 8,439 in 2019 to 7,650 in 2020, or a decrease of 9.3%. Motor vehicle thefts also slightly dropped. Aggravated assaults increased by 9.5% from 55,333 in 2019 to 60,567 last year. Overall, factoring in the state’s growth in population, all crime was down 15.7% in 2020.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: The Sons of Confederate Veterans group has sued to return a 30-foot-high obelisk to a site in front of a courthouse in what a lawyer for the city calls “a lost cause.” The monument was taken down and moved to storage last year after a judge agreed with the city’s argument that it had become a threat to public safety during protests about racism and police brutality. The suit was filed Wednesday, two days short of a year after the monument’s removal, news outlets report. The group suggests city officials colluded to get around a state law protecting historic monuments, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. It contends the monument was not found to be a public nuisance. DeKalb County Judge Clarence Seeliger said in his ruling last year that it was “a figurative lightning rod for friction among citizens.” In his final order, in September, Seeliger said the obelisk should never be returned to the square. But “the world is full of controversy,” attorney Walker Chandler, who filed the lawsuit, told WXIA-TV. “And if we were to say anything that causes controversy is a public nuisance, that’s an endless road to go down.” In an email to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Decatur City Attorney Bryan Downs called the suit a “tardy, vexatious attack on properly entered rulings by a Georgia court of law. ... In short, it is a lost cause.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Dozens of baby squid from the state are in space for study. The baby Hawaiian bobtail squid were raised at the University of Hawaii’s Kewalo Marine Laboratory and were blasted into space earlier this month on a SpaceX resupply mission to the International Space Station. Researcher Jamie Foster, who completed her doctorate at the University of Hawaii, is studying how spaceflight affects the squid in hopes of bolstering human health during long space missions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The squid have a symbiotic relationship with natural bacteria that help regulate their bioluminescence. When astronauts are in low gravity, their body’s relationship with microbes changes, said University of Hawaii professor Margaret McFall-Ngai, under whom Foster studied in the 1990s. “We have found that the symbiosis of humans with their microbes is perturbed in microgravity, and Jamie has shown that is true in squid,” McFall-Ngai said. “And, because it’s a simple system, she can get to the bottom of what’s going wrong.” The Kewalo Marine Laboratory breeds the squid for research projects around the world. The tiny animals are plentiful in Hawaiian waters and are about 3 inches long as adults. The squid are slated to come back to Earth in July.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Less than half of nursing home workers in the state have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency said 47.5% of Idaho nursing home workers were fully vaccinated by May 30, compared to more than 82% of residents in the facilities. The Post Register reports Idaho had the 17th-highest resident vaccination rate but 15th-lowest staff vaccination rate among states and territories. About 38% of Idaho’s 2,100 COVID-19 deaths are linked to long-term care facilities. Of all COVID-19 deaths in the state, 93% were among people 60 and older. About 75% of Idaho residents age 65 and over are at least partially vaccinated. Almost half of all Idaho adults are at least partially vaccinated, compared to 65% of all Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new podcast from the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum features conversations about legendary Illinois musicians and bands, sometimes with the performers themselves. The State of Sound podcast is a companion to an exhibit launched earlier this year at the Springfield-based museum, called “The State of Sound: A World of Music from Illinois.” It showcases the achievements and contributions of Illinois artists, including Muddy Waters, Earth Wind and Fire, and Chance the Rapper. The podcast is another way for people to explore the history of the state’s music, museum officials said. Episodes available now include discussions with Kevin Cronin from REO Speedwagon, Tim McIlrath from Rise Against, and Rosanna Goodman, daughter of singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. A new, official gallery guide includes dozens of photos of artifacts such as a red trumpet that belonged to Miles Davis and mementos John Prine carried on stage to help with his performance anxiety. “This exhibit is packed with sound, pictures and stories that we wanted to share with as many people as possible,” said Christina Shutt, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “The podcast will give people around the world a chance to hear those stories.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Bloomfield woman plans to plead guilty Wednesday for her role in the U.S. Capitol riot after appealing to the court that she has since learned “what life is like for others in our country” from movies and books, including the films “Schindler’s List” and “Just Mercy.” Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, has agreed to plead guilty to one of her pending federal charges in the Jan. 6 insurrection in exchange for three years’ probation, $500 in restitution and community service. In a letter to the judge, Morgan-Lloyd apologized for entering the U.S. Capitol and said she feels “ashamed” about how the march turned violent on that day, which she previously described on Facebook as “the most exciting day.” She attached movie and book reports to her letter, summarizing “Schindler’s List” and “Just Mercy,” movies she said her attorney recommended. “I’ve learned that even though we live in a wonderful country things still need to improve,” Morgan-Lloyd wrote. “People of all colors should feel as safe as I do to walk down the street.” In “Schindler’s List,” protagonist Oskar Schindler diverts hundreds of Jews from sure death by employing them in his factory in Nazi-occupied Poland. In “Just Mercy,” Bryan Stevenson recalls his career representing disadvantaged clients and establishing the Equal Justice Initiative in 1989.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: The city recognized LGBT Pride Month for the first time Monday with an official proclamation at a City Council meeting. According to Indianola Mayor Pamela Pepper’s proclamation, “Pride Month is an opportunity for people to embrace who they are and to celebrate acceptance of diversity,” and the city should value everyone regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. LGBTQ Pride Month is recognized annually through the month of June to honor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other voices related to gender and sexuality, as well as to draw attention to the issues members of the community still face. Pepper has recently issued proclamations recognizing other holidays and months not normally recognized or celebrated by the city, including one to recognize Juneteenth ahead of the holiday’s official commemoration over the weekend. Pepper said recognizing more holidays makes clear that the city welcomes all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender. She said the act is a small step the city can take amid efforts to reestablish a human and civil rights commission that was dissolved around 1998.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Country Stampede returns this weekend after being canceled in 2020. The three-day festival will be held Thursday through Saturday at Heartland Motorsports Park. National and local country musicians are expected to play, and stampede president Wayne Rouse said this is the best lineup yet. “I hope people come out and enjoy all the great music,” Rouse said. “There will be a lot of great vendors out there.” Country Stampede officials learned a lot in 2019 about what works and doesn’t work for the venue where the festival takes place. And a year off because of the pandemic allowed for officials to make needed changes that will enhance festivalgoers’ experience. In 2019, muddy grounds caused by several inches of rain created a mess. Rouse said a new layout, an additional 300 acres and a larger festival area are all improvements made based on knowledge gained from that year. This year’s festival grounds have been designed to drain in the event of rain. Country music lovers will see performances from some of the biggest up-and-coming artists in the industry, including Ashley McBryde, Maddie and Tae, Mitchell Tenpenny, Blanco Brown and Gabby Barrett. Luke Combs, Sam Hunt and Riley Green will each headline one night of the festival. Hunt replaced Morgan Wallen, who’s been mired in controversy in the past year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A man has sued his father’s estate over the effects of secondhand smoke on his health, five years after being left out of the will when his dad died. Hugo J. “Joe” Bobzien Jr. amassed a sizable fortune as president and CEO of American Commercial Barge Line, the nation’s largest barge operator. When Bobzien died March 30, 2016, at age 81, he left his estate to three of his children but gave nothing to his oldest child. The other siblings later speculated their father didn’t like how Michael treated his wife and a daughter, according to court filings. But now Michael Bobzien is trying to get his piece of the pie. In a lawsuit whose trial began Tuesday in Jefferson Circuit Court, Michael J. Bobzien, 63, says his father destroyed his health by chain-smoking Lucky Strikes, Carltons and cigars. In what is believed to be the first secondhand-smoke lawsuit filed by a child against a parent, Bobzien claims he is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other ailments caused by being “forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically and recklessly” subjected to his father’s ever-present cloud of smoke while growing up in Louisville. Bobzien, an occupational therapist before he was disabled by his diseases, is seeking as much as $50 million for his pain and expected shortened life span.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state continues to see major racial gaps in which students take high school classes for college credit, an education consultant told public school and college leaders. The Advocate reports the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Board of Regents received a report showing 22% of Black students take dual enrollment courses, compared to 42% of white students. The percentage of students enrolled in the classes drops as the percentage of Black students in a school rises, according to the data from Adam Lowe, a consultant with Education Strategy Group. The first annual report on dual enrollment came in a meeting between the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which oversees K-12 public schools, and the Board of Regents, the state’s higher education policy-making panel. “To develop talent and eliminate equity gaps in higher education, much greater intentionality and commitment is needed from all high schools, school systems, colleges and universities in harnessing these successful programs for the benefit of students of color, those from low-income households, first-generation students and special education students,” the report said. Louisiana has long lagged other states in the number of high school students who earn college credentials, The Advocate reports.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state will investigate potential new uses for its dormant rail corridors. Gov. Janet Mills recently signed into law a proposal that directs the Maine Department of Transportation to evaluate possible uses for the state-owned corridors. The department will eventually submit a report to the Legislature. Democratic Rep. Art Bell of Yarmouth, who proposed the bill, said Monday that he is “hopeful that it will provide an opportunity to reimagine the way we interact with miles of dormant, state-owned rail corridors, lying fallow.” Democrats in the state said the transportation agency will create a transportation plan that will serve as a framework as it looks to create new opportunities for outdoor recreation in Maine. That plan will include potential uses for the rail corridors.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has once again delayed implementing its ban on single-use plastic bags. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is now giving retailers until Oct. 1 to comply with the ordinance. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said more time is needed to distribute reusable bags and to educate community members. “Now that Baltimore is beginning to emerge from the pandemic and recover from its impacts, we recognize that retailers and residents could benefit from additional time to adopt this important change,” Scott said in a news release. This is the second time the ban has been pushed back. In January the effective date was moved to July 9 because of the economic hardships created by the coronavirus pandemic. The ban requires shoppers at grocery stores, restaurants and other retailers to bring their own reusable bags. Otherwise, they must purchase a paper or compostable bag for 5 cents. “We had hoped that by summer, everything would have been more amenable to the rollout,” said the city’s director of sustainability, Lisa McNeilly. “But what we’ve seen is that there continued to be some concerns from retailers about using reusable bags and having the capacity for it.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The area’s notoriously frustrating traffic dried up in March 2020 as many people started working remotely from home, and businesses closed. Now, it’s pretty much back to pre-pandemic levels. “Traffic, for all intents and purposes, is back to about 2019 levels on most roadways in Massachusetts at this point,” Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver said in a presentation to the state Department of Transportation’s board Monday, The Boston Globe reports. Traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike is still “running a little bit lower” than before COVID-19 hit, Gulliver said, particularly closer to Boston. And fewer vehicles are traveling through the tunnels to and from Logan International Airport. The morning and evening rush hours are still crowded, but Gulliver said they do not last as long as they did before the pandemic. “I think we’re in for a really major adjustment period that’s going to occur throughout the fall and early winter before things settle,” Gulliver said. The use of ride-hailing services plummeted last year, with such companies providing about 35 million rides that started in Massachusetts – a 62% drop statewide from the 91.1 million rides started in 2019, according to reports released by the state Department of Public Utilities.\n\nMichigan\n\nMeridian Township: The state is fully open again. After facing 15 months of capacity restrictions and being hit by the country’s worst surge of coronavirus infections this spring, restaurants, entertainment businesses and other venues can operate at 100% occupancy – instead of 50% – as of Tuesday. Limits on large indoor gatherings such as weddings and funerals are gone. So is a broad requirement that the unvaccinated be masked indoors, a rule that remains in about a dozen states. Unvaccinated teen athletes will no longer have to undergo weekly coronavirus testing. Michigan is among the last states to lift gathering caps, which has frustrated the business community. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and public health officials have said the restrictions were needed until enough people could be vaccinated in a state with about 21,900 suspected virus-related deaths. Last year, the governor faced an alleged plot to kidnap her over COVID-19 rules after drawing the ire of then-President Donald Trump, who tweeted calls to “LIBERATE” Michigan. “It’s time to play. It’s time to have fun again,” said Jordan Munsters, co-founder and president of High Caliber Karting and Entertainment, an indoor action park near Lansing where adults can race go-karts, throw axes and smash stuff to smithereens.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has requested funding to outfit Minnesota State Patrol troopers and officers working at the state Capitol with body cameras. The $7.5 million to buy and maintain the cameras for the officers and troopers is contained in a transportation funding package that could come up for a vote later this week. The bill also includes funding to add nearly two dozen state troopers and a dozen additional Capitol security officers to the detail, Minnesota Public Radio reports. Body cameras are standard for many local police departments, but the state has been slower in adding them to its forces. Capitol security has been a serious concern over the past year. A tall, chain-link fence surrounded the building as protests turned violent in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in May 2020. Crews took down the fence earlier this month, and the Capitol reopened to the public for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March 2020.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The city is now part of a trail commemorating what was then a nationwide tour by a French general who had participated in both the American and French revolutions. The Marquis de Lafayette visited Natchez on April 18, 1825, during the second and final year of a tour made at the invitation of President James Monroe and the U.S. Congress. During those two years, Lafayette stopped at 320 cities and towns in the 24 states then in the union, Lafayette Trail founder James Icher said. He said he hopes eventually to have 175 markers, including one at Le Havre, the port from which Lafayette departed to return to France. About 40 markers have been approved since the project started in 2017, with about 25 installed in 13 states so far, he said. A marker describing Lafayette’s stay in Natchez was unveiled last week at a lot overlooking the Mississippi River, The Natchez Democrat reports. The Historic Natchez Foundation and the Daughters of the American Revolution worked with The Lafayette Trail Inc. on the project. Two families offered the property, foundation executive director Carter Burns said. When Lafayette made his tour, the 50th anniversary of the American Revolution’s end was nearing. Lafayette, who had been 19 when he first came to America, was “the last surviving general of the Continental Army,” Icher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Changes in the way the city’s police record crime statistics have prevented the department from publicly publishing crime data for nearly six months, officials said. The problem is related to a switch the department made in December to a new way of tracking crime, the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the change was made to comply with new reporting requirements from the FBI which has said it required the change to help it improve the statistics it keeps and offer a more complete picture of crime. The city is still working on a way to resume publishing monthly incident data. Switching to the new reporting system required an overhaul of the department’s records software. The city started taking bids on that job in 2019 and hired a company to install new software in 2019. Police department spokeswoman Michelle Woodling said the project to report data publicly using the new system is behind schedule. But she said anyone can still request crime data under public records laws. Researcher Christopher Prenner, who is a sociologist at St. Louis University, said the department used to have better transparency than most other police agencies in the region.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission governing wolf hunting in the state is considering new wolf management rules that would make it easier to take the animals after the Legislature passed several laws earlier this year to encourage additional wolf hunting. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks already expects the number of wolves in the state to decrease from about 1,150 to between 900 and 950 wolves following a particularly successful hunting season. Over 320 wolves were harvested during the 2020 hunting season – significantly more than the preceding eight-year average of 242 wolves per year, according to a report released by the department. Still, the department believes the state’s wolf population can support increased wolf hunting without leading to adverse biological effects, according to the report. The fish and wildlife commission – which governs hunting regulations – is expected to meet Thursday to hear public comment on proposed rules released last week to implement laws passed by the Legislature. The department proposed adopting several new measures, including increasing the number of wolves an individual can hunt to between five and 10, allowing snaring during trapping season and night hunting on private lands, using baits for hunting and trapping, and extending the season dates.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of new COVID-19 cases continued to decrease last week in the state, which currently has one of the lowest rate of new cases in the nation. For the eighth week in a row, Nebraska reported fewer coronavirus cases than the week before, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The state reported 168 new COVID-19 cases last week, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is down from 234 cases the week prior and 254 the week before that. At the peak last fall, Nebraska reported 16,740 new cases during the week of Nov. 20. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 40 new cases per day June 6 to 31.14 new cases per day Sunday. Over the past two weeks, Nebraska reported 21.61 new cases per every 100,000 people in the state, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The only states with lower rates of new cases over that period were Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Vermont. The number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 continues to slowly increase in the state. As of Friday, 63.4% of Nebraska’s population 18 and older had received at least one dose of a vaccine. That’s up from 63% the week before.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: Rural residents and local law enforcement over the weekend celebrated decisions by two county commissions to become members of a group that believes sheriffs have the final say on any given law’s constitutionality. Hundreds of people gathered for festivities in Elko City Park on Sunday as the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association presented Elko and Lander county commissioners with a plaque to honor their membership, making them the first local governments to join, the Elko Daily Free Press reports. “You know what I train sheriffs to do? Kick ’em the hell out of your county,” association founder Richard Mack told an applauding crowd, referring to criticism of federal government and the Internal Revenue Service. Mack, a former sheriff from rural Arizona who is also involved in the Oath Keepers militia movement, denounced white supremacy and compared sheriffs’ bucking of federal laws to Rosa Parks’ civil disobedience on a bus in 1955. Founded in 2011, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association believes county sheriffs have a duty to interpret and uphold the Constitution that supersedes other elected officials up to the president. It is against federal gun laws and COVID-19 restrictions and sees sheriffs as a final defense against government overreach.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As children get ready for summer camp, federal COVID-19 response funds are being used to offer mental health training for camp counselors. The Department of Education is partnering with the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Mental Health Association to provide the training. Also, the 10 community mental health centers around the state will have staff on site at camp locations weekly to provide mental health support for children. The effort is a part of the department’s “Rekindling Curiosity: Every Kid Goes to Camp” program, which offers families camp-tuition support. “In spite of the heroic efforts by so many over this past year, so many children across New Hampshire have experienced anxiety and trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Frank Edelblut, commissioner of education, said in a statement Tuesday. “The Rekindle Curiosity program will simply give many of our children the opportunity to be a kid again and build some childhood memories.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state is investing $200,000 in a center to help Atlantic City and New Jersey become a national hub for the billion-dollar competitive video game industry, known as esports. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority and Stockton University on Tuesday signed an agreement to establish an esports Innovation Center at the university’s Atlantic City campus. The authority will provide staff support for the Innovation Center, which will also include leaders in the esports industry. It was the latest manifestation of New Jersey’s interest in being not just a player but a leader in the fast-growing field. Newzoo, a research firm that tracks the esports industry, projects it will generate $1.08 billion in global revenue this year, an increase of 14.5% over last year. “I was shocked when I saw the numbers,” said Brian Sabina, the authority’s chief economic growth officer. “It’s the fastest-growing college sport in America. Nearly 500 million people tune in to watch esports events.” The center is designed to create new academic and workforce development opportunities and to support local economic development. It plans to identify industrywide technology development opportunities and to host “hack-a-thons” and similar coding challenges focused on creating innovative solutions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlamogordo: Officials in southern New Mexico are seeing an increase in pets surrendered and expect numbers to keep rising. In 2020, Alamogordo Animal Control took in 1,260 animals, saw 563 adopted and euthanized 36, according to Alamogordo Police Department data. The Otero County Animal Shelter took in 1,605 animals, saw 542 adopted and euthanized 364 last year, according to the shelter’s own data. Officials with both organizations expected the number of surrendered animals to increase post-pandemic as pet owners find their way back to offices and away from home. “It’s post-COVID-19 stuff; everyone was home and had time for the dog, and now everyone is going back to work, and we’re getting the same stories, you know?” Alamogordo Animal Control Manager Dwaine Martinez said. He said a surge in pet surrenders was already noted. Alamogordo Animal Control and Kitty City hold regular adoption events at White Sands Mall nearly every other Saturday. “We’ve seen a little bit of returns, but I don’t think it’s been any increase of what it would have been without COVID-19,” Kitty City Director Kathy Denton said. Under the rescue’s return policy, it works with the adopter to find out what issues may have arisen, Denton said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed legislation requiring general hospitals to seek input from nurses and other staff in creating staffing plans that are to include specific guidelines on how many patients each nurse is assigned. The new law requires hospitals to form committees composed of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, ancillary staff members providing direct patient care, and hospital administrators to form the staffing plans. Hospital staffing committees must adopted their first staffing plans and submit them to the state health department by July 1, 2022. It’s unclear how the law will play out in non-unionized workplaces. Lawmakers passed the legislation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which put a strain on staffing and resources at many hospitals throughout New York. Supporters of the law want to boost staffing levels. The original bill would have mandated statewide minimum staffing levels, but those were negotiated out. “This legislation requires hospitals to create committees that include the very same staff who treat patients on the ground every single day and come up with plans that take their concerns into consideration when allocating staff,” Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans in the state Senate unveiled a two-year state budget proposal Monday that sticks to earlier spending limits even with recent news of a massive revenue windfall. They instead earmark billions more now for savings, with plans for deeper tax cuts and more construction projects to follow the rest of the decade. The measure also offers pay raises and one-time bonuses to public school teachers and state employees, although the permanent raises fall short of what Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper proposed in his budget in March. The bill, which is expected to pass through the chamber by Friday, seeks to spend $25.7 billion in state funds in the year starting July 1 and $26.6 billion the following year, in keeping with a spending cap that senators settled on with House Republicans this month. However, state economists predicted last week that the state would have $6.5 billion more at its disposal over the next two years above and beyond what was anticipated, beginning with an extra $1.9 billion in state coffers by June 30. Still, senators say they’re committed to the cap – otherwise concerned that much of the cash influx attributed to a resurgent post-pandemic economy can’t be counted on in the long term to pay for permanent initiatives.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legislative leaders on Tuesday dismissed criticism of new limits on emergency spending by a governor-led panel, saying they have no interest in repealing or amending the law. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said in an interview that criticism that the new law could hamper the state’s ability to address emergency spending is unwarranted. “I don’t think this is a life-or-death thing,” Wardner said. “We can live with this.” The law, passed shortly before the GOP-led Legislature adjourned in April, effectively furthers an ongoing battle between Gov. Doug Burgum and the Legislature, which has long argued that it decides spending matters and that the second-term Republican has stepped too far onto its turf. The Legislature easily overrode Burgum’s veto of the bill that he said “clearly violates the separation of powers doctrine” and would be unconstitutional. Burgum has declined to say if he would challenge the law in court. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said in an interview that she supports the law. “It is OK for us to do this,” she said. “Otherwise, we don’t know what’s being spent where.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The coronavirus pandemic appears to have triggered more smoking among smokers in the region and prompted 1 in 10 former smokers to light up again, a newly released survey shows. Tobacco use by Cincinnati area adults had declined for more than 20 years, from 35% in 1999 to 19% in 2018. “But the COVID-19 pandemic stalled progress,” officials at Interact for Health said in a news release Tuesday. The percentage of adult current smokers in the region was fairly stable between 2018 (19%) and 2020 (21%), the organization said. In the wake of the new poll results, Interact for Health, a Norwood-based nonprofit that partnered with the University of Cincinnati Institute for Policy Research on the survey, is offering grants for tobacco-use cessation projects in the Cincinnati area. The Greater Cincinnati COVID-19 Health Issues Survey found that 23% of responding smokers said they smoked more frequently during the pandemic and that 9% of those who had quit started smoking again last year. The survey, conducted between Oct. 7 and Nov. 17, 2020, polled a random sample of 879 adults from the Cincinnati region, including an oversample of Black residents, interviewed by phone. The potential margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points, researchers said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A big boost is coming to efforts to “restart the arts” in Oklahoma, as nonprofit cultural organizations struggle to overcome the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kirkpatrick Family Fund has announced a $1 million commitment to Allied Arts over a three-year period to assist local nonprofit arts organizations recover and regain forward momentum. “As we emerge out of a pandemic year, the Kirkpatrick Family Fund is committed to helping restore the educational, visual, and performing arts that are vital to a thriving society and economy,” Kirkpatrick Family Fund President Christian Keesee said in a statement. Allied Arts found staggering financial losses when it surveyed 39 central Oklahoma cultural organizations about their operations between March 2020 and February 2021. The local impact of the pandemic was more than $21.2 million in revenue losses for these nonprofits, even after the groups received almost $12 million in COVID-19 assistance. “And that’s not even including the ripple-effect spending, which is looking at the true economic impact,” Allied Arts President and CEO Deborah McAuliffe Senner said. “It’s for those special events and occasions that people are getting their nails done, their hair done, a new dress. All of that was lost.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: With the state and federal eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of June, lawmakers passed an added safety net for struggling tenants Tuesday that will “pause” some evictions. Under the “Safe Harbor” amendment on Senate Bill 278, tenants who are unable to pay their July or August rent would not be evicted for 60 days if they provide proof to their landlord that they’ve applied for rental assistance through Oregon Housing and Community Services. The amended bill, which passed in the House 56-2 and in the Senate 26-3, was sent to Gov. Kate Brown’s desk to be signed. An eviction moratorium has been in place in Oregon since April 2020. In addition, last month lawmakers voted to extend the grace period for past due rent during the moratorium, allowing tenants to have until Feb. 28, 2022, to pay back rent. While the governor announced earlier this month that she was extending the state’s mortgage foreclosure moratorium through September, she said she did not have the authority to extend the eviction moratorium. “That means, by law, Oregon’s eviction moratorium will expire on June 30,” Brown said. Officials had warned that as the moratorium expired, the state would likely see a mass wave of evictions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state locks up far too many first-time and low-level youth offenders, with Black youth in particular disproportionately yanked from their homes and prosecuted as adults, according to a governmental task force that made recommendations Tuesday to reform juvenile justice in the state. “Serious racial disparities pervade Pennsylvania’s juvenile justice system,” the bipartisan Pennsylvania Juvenile Justice Task Force said in its report, adding that changes are urgently needed to make the state’s juvenile justice system more fair and more effective. A substantial percentage of young people who commit a minor crime and are considered at low risk of reoffending are nevertheless removed from home and placed in a residential facility, the group found in its 16-month review. The practice is widespread despite research showing that out-of-home placement is “generally not effective at reducing recidivism for most youth – and can instead be counterproductive,” the report said. Policymakers found widespread geographic and racial disparities in how youth offenders are treated, with Black youths more likely than white youths to be removed from home and prosecuted in adult court.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank has approved a $400,000 loan to help in the redevelopment of a brownfields site in Pawtucket. The loan will finance environmental remediation work as part of the larger Nexus Lofts project that will include 27 affordable market-rate apartments with ground floor office and retail space, the bank said in a statement. “This $400,000 loan for site remediation work at the Nexus Lofts project will help catalyze further development in the surrounding buildings,” infrastructure bank CEO Jeffrey Diehl said in a statement. Co-developer Michael Leshinsky called the loan a critical part of the project. The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank is the state’s central hub for financing infrastructure improvements for municipalities, businesses and homeowners.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers are considering a bill to let mental health professionals refuse to provide care that violates their religious beliefs in response to an ordinance banning conversion therapy for minors in the capital city. The Senate Medical Affairs subcommittee heard testimony on the legislation Monday but didn’t take a vote. The state already has such medical conscience protections in place for doctors and other health care providers, allowing them to opt out of providing nonemergency services to people when it contradicts their religious, moral, ethical or philosophical beliefs or principles. The legislation would expand those protections to mental health professionals, said bill sponsor Sen. Josh Kimbrell, R-Spartanburg. The bill is a direct response to Columbia’s new ordinance barring attempts by licensed therapists and counselors to change the sexual orientation of minors. Opponents say the bill would harm LGBTQ individuals and make health care more difficult to access for many marginalized and rural South Carolinians. Kimbrell previously asked South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson to block the Columbia measure, which was passed last week and is reported to be the first of its kind in the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s largest health care providers proposed Monday that lawmakers drop part of the requirement for people seeking medical marijuana identification cards to obtain a physician’s recommendation to use the drug. Under the proposal, physicians would still need to certify that patients have conditions such as severe pain, seizures or multiple sclerosis that would qualify them for a medical marijuana ID. But they would not need to specifically recommend that medical marijuana be used to treat the condition. The proposal was welcomed by medical marijuana advocates, who have worried that patients will have a difficult time getting medical pot recommendations. Doctors have expressed hesitancy about recommending medical marijuana as the state prepares to legalize it. Although a voter-passed law legalizing medical marijuana takes effect July 1, the full medical cannabis program is still in flux. The state has until November to start issuing ID cards, meaning people wouldn’t be able to legally buy medical cannabis until then. In the meantime, legislators are planning changes to the law. Sarah Aker, director of fiscal policy at the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said doctors might be more comfortable writing certifications if they didn’t specifically recommend using cannabis.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Justin Timberlake was back in his hometown, virtually, as he videoconferenced into a workshop with students of the Stax Music Academy. Timberlake and a team of his associated producers, musicians and industry figures helped guide a two-month creative class and mentorship program. Eight Stax Music Academy students, working as teams, were invited to take part in the “All Star Song Lab.” On Thursday evening, the Memphis-born pop star celebrated the program’s completion with the students and their parents during an event in which the songs they wrote and recorded as part of the program were played. Although Timberlake had conducted a similar workshop in 2019 in person at the academy, the pandemic forced this year’s more expansive effort to take place through computers. Two summers ago, as part of a Levi’s funded initiative, the company and Timberlake installed a creative space called “The Song Lab” in the Stax Music Academy building in South Memphis. That August, Timberlake surprised students with a two-day workshop that also featured noted producers Timbaland and Rob Knox and Memphis guitarist Elliot Ives. Timberlake also pledged to contribute $100,000 toward a scholarship fund for SMA students.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The veto period from the regular legislative session has ended with Gov. Greg Abbott blocking 20 bills from becoming law, including efforts to protect dogs from dangerous restraints and allow police to issue citations for trespassing. Abbott also vetoed legislation requiring middle schools and high schools to provide instruction on preventing child abuse, family violence and dating violence. Though the subjects are important, Senate Bill 1109 “fails to recognize the right of parents to opt their children out of the instruction,” Abbott said in a statement accompanying his veto. “I have vetoed similar legislation before on this ground, because we must safeguard parental rights regarding this type of instruction.” The governor also took exception to SB 474, which sought to prohibit owners from tethering unattended dogs outdoors without providing access to adequate shelter, shade and water, among other protocols. “Texas is no place for this kind of micromanaging and overcriminalization,” Abbott wrote, saying that animal cruelty laws already protect dogs. The Texas Humane Legislative Network spent six years working toward passage of the bill, and its members were devastated by the veto, Executive Director Shelby Bobosky said.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Arches National Park is on track to have its busiest year ever, and that increase in visitation has caused the park to close its gates more than 80 times so far in 2021. Two other popular national parks in the West – Rocky Mountain and Yosemite – implemented reservation systems last year due to the pandemic. Both brought reservations back this summer in anticipation of record visitation. Park advocates along with Moab and Grand County officials say a similar system could help alleviate congestion and protect Arches. But efforts to implement a timed-entry system there have failed in the past. Lines and closures have been a problem at Arches since about 2016, according to Joette Langianese, director of a nonprofit called Friends of Arches and Canyonlands Parks that helps raise funds and advocate for both parks. Visitation dropped a bit last year because of the pandemic, but she said tourists are back in full force this year, and they’re wreaking havoc on the park, littering and wandering off paths. Langianese said those are the kinds of things rangers are supposed to monitor, but the sheer number of visitors is making it hard. She said a reservation system would spread visitors out over the course of the day during the high season so that the park isn’t swamped. “Let’s just try it, see how it works,” Langianese said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is ending its pandemic-related emergency housing in hotels and motels for some of the homeless population because the program is not sustainable, hotel capacity is shrinking, and it was never meant to be a permanent solution, Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said Tuesday. Roughly 700 people, or about a third of the homeless people put up in motels during the coronavirus pandemic, will no longer be eligible July 1, officials estimate. “This was possible because the public health and travel restrictions essentially closed Vermont tourism, and hotels and motels stepped up,” Smith said during the governor’s weekly coronavirus briefing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is reimbursing the state for the nearly $79 million cost of the program, he said. It was projected to rise to $108 million in fiscal year 2022 if changes weren’t made while federal reimbursement is uncertain, he said. The Legislature asked the Human Services Agency to create a work group to come up with a transition plan, Smith said. The plan was accepted by the Legislature and includes a more expansive program than before the pandemic – estimated to cost $41 million, compared to $6 million pre-pandemic, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: If a court clears the way, the state expects to remove not just a soaring statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s historic Monument Avenue but also a little-known piece of history tucked inside the massive sculpture’s base: a 134-year-old time capsule. Historical records and recent imaging tests suggest the presence of the time capsule, which some have speculated might contain a rare, valuable and historically significant photo of deceased President Abraham Lincoln. “Anyone who has an interest in Civil War history or Richmond history would be very intrigued by this item,” said Dale Brumfield, a local historian and author who has conducted extensive research on the aged copper receptacle and rumored photo. The removal work is contingent on the resolution of two still-pending lawsuits seeking to keep the monument in place. The bronze equestrian statue of Lee was one of five enormous Confederate tributes along Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. Like many other cities across the South, Richmond removed the figures on its monuments last summer amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and criticism that the statues are symbols of white supremacy that should not occupy public places.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The medical school at Washington State University has received full accreditation, the final step in an academic journey that took nearly six years. The Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, in Spokane, on Tuesday received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which accredits medical degree programs in the U.S. and Canada. “Achieving full accreditation marks the culmination of a journey that began the day we started the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine,” said John Tomkowiak, founding dean of the medical school named for the late WSU president. The effort started in 2015, after Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill that gave WSU authority to create a medical school. That overturned a previous law that had been in place for nearly 100 years prohibiting the creation of a new public medical school in the state. In 2016, the LCME granted preliminary accreditation to the WSU College of Medicine, which allowed the college to begin recruiting students and accepting applications for the college’s inaugural class of 2021. The college was granted provisional accreditation in 2019. Accreditation is a peer-review process that determines whether a medical school’s program meets established standards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers will convene Thursday to take up $250 million in spending proposed by Gov. Jim Justice after a “tremendous” budget surplus. The Republican governor has suggested moving the millions to a wide variety of state departments, from tourism to natural resources. There are proposed upgrades to correctional facilities and expansions to some West Virginia State Parks. The Legislature will meet at noon to act on the funds. Earlier this month, lawmakers met to pour federal funds and extra state cash into road repairs, health care and education programs such as school lunches. Those efforts included about $902 million in federal funds received through pandemic relief legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden. Much of that funding came through grants directed by the federal government to be spent on programs such as substance abuse prevention, aid for needy families and child care services. Another $150 million from a state budget surplus was dedicated to fund 702 miles of road paving and projects on 40 bridges across all 55 counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Federal officials have designated a huge swath of the state’s Lake Michigan coastline as a National Marine Sanctuary to protect historic shipwrecks in the area, Gov. Tony Evers’ office announced Tuesday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will publish regulations designating 962 square miles from Kewaunee County south to Ozaukee County as a sanctuary, Evers’ office said. The designation will protect 36 shipwrecks, 21 of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Evers’ office said research suggests the area may include as many as 60 additional shipwrecks. The designation is subject to congressional and gubernatorial review. Evers said his administration is “really excited” about the designation, according to comments posted on NOAA’s website. The shipwreck sanctuary would become the 15th marine sanctuary NOAA has established. The network encompasses more than 600,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters. Then-Gov. Scott Walker nominated the Lake Michigan area as a sanctuary in 2014. Boats would be prohibited from anchoring on shipwrecks in the sanctuary, and the sanctuary could draw tourists to the area, but beyond that the designation appears to have little practical effect.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Drivers were caught speeding less last year in Wyoming, but those who got nabbed were going faster than usual. Citations for speeding fell 15% in 2020, but there were 29% more citations for people driving over 100 mph, according to the Wyoming Highway Patrol. While highway traffic was down during the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers out there “felt that they could be going faster,” patrol Capt. David Wagener said. Law enforcement gave out nearly 1,500 citations in the state last year for “excessive speeding,” defined as going 15 mph or more above the posted speed limit. That was more than 300 more tickets for excessive speed than the number issued in 2019, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Driving too fast, especially in foul weather, is a leading factor in Wyoming’s serious accidents. More than 1,600 such crashes in the state in the last decade involved excessive speeding.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/16/holocaust-survivor-concert-tiger-king-auction-crab-meat-shortage-news-around-states/117044680/", "title": "Holocaust survivor concert, Tiger King auction: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A production line that makes many of Hyundai’s North American vehicles is being halted this week due to a parts shortage. The shutdown will leave about 1,000 regular workers temporarily unemployed for seven days. The problem is that Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama hasn’t been able to get enough parts because of a semiconductor shortage. As a result, production at the plant will be suspended until June 21. “No other downtime for this reason is expected,” said Robert Burns, vice president of human resources and administration. The company “will continue to work with Hyundai Motor Group’s global purchasing team to allocate microchips to its U.S. manufacturing plant to optimize production in the coming weeks and months,” Burns said. About 3,000 people work at the Montgomery plant. Most of them will continue to work this week. That includes maintenance workers, employees processing completed vehicles, and engine shop employees building engines to be delivered to Kia’s plant in Georgia. The plant produces the Sonata and Elantra sedans as well as the Santa Fe and Tucson SUVs. It began rolling out the new Santa Cruz pickup earlier this month after finishing a $410 million expansion. The company will help workers file unemployment claims, Burns said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Wildlife Troopers do not intend to issue a citation to a man recently seen lifting a baby moose over a guardrail in south-central Alaska, though it is illegal to “handle any wild animal in a similar fashion,” an Alaska State Troopers spokesperson said Thursday. Spokesperson Austin McDaniel said Alaska Wildlife Troopers “strongly advise people to stay a safe distance from all wildlife, including moose calves, as the animal may react aggressively towards humans.” Anyone who sees a wild animal that may need help should call the nearest law enforcement agency or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, McDaniel said in an email. Alaska’s News Source reports an Anchorage man, Joe Tate, was driving home Sunday from a fishing trip with friends when he saw a line of cars and a moose in the road on the Kenai Peninsula. Tate said a mother moose was pacing in the road, and a young calf struggled to scale a guardrail to join her. He estimated watching for about 30 minutes. He said he considered calling wildlife officials or law enforcement but worried an accident could occur in the time it would take for them to arrive. Friends with a trailer got between the mother and the calf, breaking the line of sight, Tate said. Another vehicle positioned itself similarly on the opposite side of traffic.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Worm Farm, focused on “turning garbage into food,” is growing produce sustainably in the desert. Worms eat food waste produced by the south Phoenix farm and elsewhere, including a brewery, diverting organic scraps from landfills. The invertebrates turn that into nutrient-rich compost that goes back into the ground and helps plants grow. The farm produces 40,000 to 50,000 worms a week and eliminates 1,000 pounds of waste from Phoenix landfills alone. The food it grows can feed its 10 employees with enough to donate to St. Mary’s Food Bank each week. All branches of the farm form a circle of life. “I’m trying to produce the garden of Eden,” Zach Brooks said. He was in the middle of his second master’s degree in sustainability at Arizona State University when he decided to start the farm, realizing he could put what he was learning into practice as easily as he could buy the materials online. “We didn’t invent anything that’s here on the farm,” he said. “Everything that’s necessary to live a zero-waste life is just a matter of doing it.” The site was the remnants of a cotton farm, its soil difficult for growing fruits and vegetables. “We couldn’t even get weeds to grow,” Brooks said. Nowadays, the soil is wet just beneath the surface, even after days without watering. “I dare you to go any place in Arizona and dig up a square of soil, and you won’t find that kind of life,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Abortion rights supporters asked a federal judge Monday to prevent the state’s near-total ban on the procedure from taking effect while the groups challenge its constitutionality. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the ban, set to take effect July 28. The groups filed a lawsuit last month challenging the ban, which prohibits abortions except those to save the life of the mother. The groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of Little Rock Family Planning Services, a Little Rock abortion clinic, and Planned Parenthood’s Little Rock health center. The groups are also representing a doctor who works at the Planned Parenthood clinic. “Absent an order from this Court, (the ban) will inflict on plaintiffs’ patients significant and irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law,” Monday’s filing said. Amanda Priest, a spokeswoman for Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, said the groups’ motion “should not come as a surprise to anyone.” “Attorney General Rutledge will be reviewing the latest action and will proceed,” she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A popular trail in Big Sur flanked by redwood trees that leads down through a gorge to a 60-foot waterfall is set to open to the public this week after a 13-year restoration needed when a wildfire destroyed access to it, officials announced Monday. After a $2 million renovation that fixed bridges, retaining walls, railings, steps and signage, the Pfeiffer Falls Trail will open Friday for the public to enjoy, said officials with the California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League, a San Francisco conservation group. To protect sensitive habitat, California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League officials replaced more than 4,150 square feet of asphalt and concrete and seven stream crossings, with the newly aligned trail and a 70-foot-long pedestrian bridge that spans the Pfeiffer Redwood Creek ravine and offers dramatic views, officials said. The Basin Complex Fire damaged the 0.75-mile trail, which connects with the Valley View trail to form a 1.5-mile loop that was the most popular hiking trail in Big Sur before the blaze. A subsequent fire, landslides, and a long closure of Highway 1 delayed the renovation and long-awaited reopening, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has rejected a request by the state’s Republican congressional delegation to stop paying jobless residents $300 extra a week in federal pandemic relief. The GOP representatives argue the payment, scheduled to run through Sept. 6, is hurting business by deterring unemployed workers from seeking jobs. U.S. Reps. Doug Lamborn, Ken Buck and Lauren Boebert noted in a Friday letter to Polis that Colorado restaurants and numerous other firms are struggling to hire workers. Many states led by Republican governors have ended the supplemental benefit. “We have to stop paying people that should be working to sit at home on the couch,” Boebert said in a statement. “It’s well past time for the government to end COVID bonuses and stop disincentivizing work.” Colorado Politics reports that Polis rejected the proposal, arguing in part that the benefit is helping business. “If Colorado ended these benefits prematurely, it would harm individuals, business owners, and the broader economy,” he wrote. Colorado is offering its own cash incentives for job-seekers. A “Jumpstart” program rewards those getting hired by month’s end with up to $1,600 in incentives. The state labor department reports some 3,800 new claims for regular state benefits were filed last week, the lowest level since the pandemic began.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools that still use Native American nicknames and mascots could take a financial hit if they continue to use those images without written consent from a state- or federally recognized tribe in their region, according to a provision tucked into a massive state budget implementation bill that’s up for a vote Monday. Municipalities face the prospect of losing their allotment of revenue from the Mashantucket Pequot/Mohegan Fund, an account that’s funded with the state’s 25% share of slot machine revenues generated at the two casinos owned and operated by the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Tribes. The provision was included in the budget bill by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the co-chairman of the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee. “Towns around this state have been told year after year by Connecticut’s Native American tribes that their nicknames and mascots are horribly offensive,” Osten said in a statement. “If certain cities and towns won’t listen to their fellow citizens, then they can certainly do without the tribal money that they are showing such disrespect toward.” It’s estimated that about a dozen schools in Connecticut still use Native American names or images. Some communities have already changed the names of their athletic teams in recent years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Crab cake lovers have something to be, well, crabby about this summer: It might be harder and more expensive than ever to fill up on their favorite shellfish. A bevy of Delaware restaurants have begun limiting crab cake sales and even temporarily suspending “crab nights” because of a shortage of picked crab meat, as well as a sharp increase in prices to meet the growing demand. One reason for the shortage is that businesses are having a hard time finding employees to pick the sweet meat out of the crabs’ sharp shells. This year, just like last summer, restaurants and shops in beach resort towns did not get a stream of annual seasonal foreign workers because of travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic. According to Seafood News.com, crab meat prices have been rising and are at a high because of a lack of inventory, exacerbated by supply limitations in Asia due to COVID-19 and logistic constraints. And, locally, another problem, at least for now, could be there are fewer male crabs in the Chesapeake Bay. A survey from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Virginia Institute of Marine Science estimates the total abundance of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay in 2021 was 282 million crabs, a below-average total for the 32 years of survey results.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The owners of a bar said Monday that they are investigating a weekend incident in which security guards were seen dragging a Black woman down a staircase and throwing her out of the establishment. Nellie’s Sports Bar’s owners also said on Facebook that they have “terminated, with immediate effect, the independent security vendor hired to protect our guests during Pride Week.” Video posted on social media early Sunday shows a bouncer dragging the woman – identified by local media as Keisha Young, 22 – down the stairs as observers scream, “Oh my God!” Some patrons are then seen fighting with the guards. On a video call Monday with her lawyer, Young said: “I feel like, even just separating race from it, no man should ever handle a woman in that way. That should never be OK,” according to Washington’s WRC-TV. A crowd gathered outside Nellie’s Sunday night to protest Young’s treatment. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday: “Obviously, entrepreneurs enforce rules in their restaurants. But they’re not allowed to assault anybody.” Nellie’s owners said the bar “will be closed this week as we evaluate this regrettable situation,” and they vowed to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis visited a South Florida Jewish temple to denounce anti-Semitism and stand with Israel on Monday as the Republican governor cloaked himself in religion while signing a bill into law that would require public schools in his state to set aside at least one minute of silence for children to meditate or pray. His visit to the Shul of Bal Harbour, a Jewish community center in Surfside, had the air of a campaign event. DeSantis seemed to blush when the Rabbi Sholom Lipskar introduced him as a “great governor and future world leader.” It has been speculated that the governor, who is running for reelection next year, might run for president in 2024. DeSantis visited the temple to sign two bills into law. One would expand the role of volunteer ambulance services, while the other makes Florida one of at least 15 states, according to a legislative analysis, that would compel public schools to hold moments of silence. The state had already been among roughly 18 other states that gave schools the option to do so. “The idea that you can just push God out of every institution and be successful – I’m sorry, our Founding Fathers did not believe that,” DeSantis said. The ambulance bill allows some volunteer first responders, including those run by faith-based groups, to use emergency lights and sirens when responding to emergencies. Some Orthodox Jews rely on these volunteer ambulance services to help overcome religious sensitivities that prevent some people form using traditional emergency services.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is establishing a therapeutic foster care program to provide specialized treatment for children with an assortment of behavioral, mental and developmental challenges. Georgia is providing $6.7 million to begin the program that Tom Rawlings, director of the Division of Family and Children Services, called a pilot initiative that he hopes will expand in the future. A similar program existed over a decade ago, and Rawlings and other advocates see its return as a major step toward strengthening welfare services for children with intense treatment needs. “There is this, I believe, very special population of children with very severe emotional issues, often co-occurring autism spectrum and mental health issues, and we as a state really have to develop a more specialized system,” Rawlings said. “And I think that this is a major step toward that.” Therapeutic foster care differs from traditional foster care in several ways. Children placed in a therapeutic care home have individualized care needs that often arise from past trauma. Foster parents in a therapeutic program are trained to handle these challenges and provide around-the-clock care. Children in this program also receive crucial treatment services, usually involving therapy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. is giving Native Hawaiians surplus land as compensation for acres that were meant for homesteading but used instead by the federal government. The land transfer also attempts to help right wrongs against the Indigenous people of Hawaii, officials said Monday. The 80 acres in Ewa Beach formerly used for the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center will eventually provide up to 400 homes while helping fulfill terms of a settlement authorized by Congress in 1995 to compensate Native Hawaiians for 1,500 acres that were set aside for homelands but subsequently acquired and used by the federal government for other purposes, officials said. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s voice choked with emotion while making the announcement Monday. “Yes, it’s a happy day, but it’s also a sad day because we remember the tragedy that befell the Native Hawaiians throughout their tumultuous history,” said Haaland, the first Native American woman to lead a U.S. Cabinet agency. “Since that time, our country has learned a great deal. And now we are in an era where we recognize the importance of healing the generational traumas that caused pain and heartache.” The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 was meant to provide economic self-sufficiency to Hawaiians by allowing them to use land to live on, with a 99-year lease for $1 a year.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Four housing organizations in the state are getting coronavirus relief funding to help cover the cost of emergency housing vouchers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $2.4 million total to the Housing Authority of the City of Pocatello, the Boise City Housing Authority, the Southwestern Idaho Cooperative Housing Authority, and the Idaho Housing and Finance Association, the Idaho Press reports. The money will cover 217 vouchers and related administrative costs, according to a prepared statement from HUD, and is part of $1 billion being awarded to housing organizations nationwide. As of January 2020, Idaho had about 2,300 people “experiencing homelessness on any given day,” according to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. “Addressing our nation’s homelessness crisis is a top priority for HUD,” HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement. Deanna Watson, the executive director of the Boise City/Ada County Housing Authority, said increases in rent levels have a lot of people getting priced out of the market. The vouchers will work by subsidizing rents in a place with fair market rents, Watson said. In addition, there’s assistance in some of the fees that come with finding houses, security deposits and case management.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A cave system closed more than a decade ago is reopening to the public. The state Department of Natural Resources announced last week that Illinois Caverns in Monroe County would reopen Wednesday. Officials closed the southern Illinois cave in 2010 as a precaution for bats who live there due to the spread of a fatal disease called white-nose syndrome. WNS is named after the white fungus found on the muzzle, ears and wings of infected bats. White-nose syndrome cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals, but officials feared humans exploring caves could spread it from one location to another, endangering more bats. Joe Kath, the department’s Endangered Species Program manager, said the disease’s prevalence in bats hibernating within Illinois Caverns has been relatively low since the closure compared to other locations in the state. “The caverns – one of the state’s scenic wonders – attracted visitors from across the state, which is why the decision was made to close them,” Kath said. “Our biologists felt that proactively closing Illinois Caverns, and other state-managed caves across the state, was the best option to protect the state’s bat population from (white-nose syndrome).” Illinois Caverns will be open Wednesdays through Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and seasonally from April through October.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Two legal organizations are suing the state to prevent Gov. Eric Holcomb from pulling out of a federal unemployment program that’s paying benefits to hundreds of thousands of residents. Macey Swanson Hicks & Sauer law firm and Indiana Legal Services, an organization that provides legal assistance to low-income Hoosiers, filed a joint civil lawsuit in Marion County Superior Court, claiming the end of the benefits would hurt their clients and people across the state. The organizations argued that Indiana law requires the state to procure federal insurance benefits to its citizens. “These benefits have provided life-sustaining and crucial assistance to many Hoosiers during the pandemic,” Jon Laramore, executive director of Indiana Legal Services, said in a statement. “The legislature passed a law creating a right to these benefits, and we’re asking Governor Holcomb to follow the law.” The Republican governor announced last month he was ending the federal benefits June 19 because many businesses in the service industry are struggling to fill jobs. While economists are skeptical that unemployment benefits are the reason people aren’t returning to low-wage jobs, Holcomb is banking on the benefits cut to drive more people back to work.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials at the city’s public water system on Monday asked customers to begin using water wisely and cut lawn irrigation by 25% as water usage reached new highs and drought conditions slowed the flow of rivers. The combination of high demand and low water flow resulted in Des Moines Water Works demand reaching 90% of capacity Friday. The utility that serves 500,000 customers in central Iowa said it delivered nearly 90 million gallons of water that day. “We have taken proactive steps to ensure we have enough water for customers, but the Raccoon River is low enough that you can walk across it. Now, we are asking our customers to do their part and use water wisely,” CEO Ted Corrigan said. The flow rate in the Raccoon River, which is a major water source for the DMWW, is down to less than 300 cubic feet per second compared the median flow of 4,000 cubic feet per second. The average high temperature for Des Moines for the first 13 days of June was 88, significantly above the normal of 79.9, according to the National Weather Service. The city has had 0.02 inches of rain this month. The average is 5.26 inches. In Iowa, 46% of the state is classified as in moderate drought, up from 29% the week before, said the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is going to struggle to vaccinate more residents, a top aide to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said, and thousands of families will lose extra food aid because top Republican legislators on Tuesday ended a state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic. Will Lawrence, the governor’s chief of staff, said the state will no longer be able to use its National Guard to distribute vaccines or personal protective equipment, and addressing COVID-19 is “just going to be more difficult.” Senate President Ty Masterson announced the cancellation of a meeting of eight leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature set for Tuesday afternoon. A law enacted in late March required the legislative leaders to sign off on an extension, and Masterson’s announcement meant the state of emergency was to expire at the end of Tuesday after being in place since March 2020. Kelly accused Republicans of “political obstruction.” She told reporters last week that she wanted the state of emergency to continue at least through August. “A state disaster response has never been, and should not be, political,” Kelly said in a statement. But “it is time for Kansas to return to normal,” Masterson, R-Andover, said in a joint statement with two other GOP leaders, Senate Majority Leader Larry Alley, of Winfield, and Vice President Rick Wilborn, of McPherson.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State residents now have the option of getting their driver’s license renewed online. The service launched Monday, with Kentucky Transportation Secretary Jim Gray saying it would lead to “greater efficiency, greater security and more choices” for drivers. Online renewal is available for those with standard-issue or Real ID licenses that will expire within six months or have been expired for less than a year, officials said. Renewals must also maintain the same card version as well as the same name and address as their current license. Applications for a replacement license or a license with a name or address change must still be made in person. Online renewal is among the options available due to the phased transfer of licensing services to the Transportation Cabinet’s regional offices from local offices of the circuit court clerks, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: People caught with small amounts of recreational marijuana will soon face a misdemeanor fine and no possibility of jail time, under a bill that Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday he has signed into law. The measure sponsored by state Rep. Cedric Glover, D-Shreveport, won narrow, bipartisan support in the legislative session that ended Thursday. With the Democratic governor’s signature, the new law will take effect Aug. 1. Glover’s bill makes possession of up to 14 grams of marijuana – a half-ounce – a misdemeanor crime carrying a fine up to $100 with no possibility of jail time, even for repeat offenses. “This is not a decision I took lightly,” Edwards said in his statement announcing the bill signing. He described the legislation as another step in Louisiana’s “criminal justice reform efforts.” “In addition to carefully reviewing the bill, I also believe deeply that the state of Louisiana should no longer incarcerate people for minor legal infractions, especially those that are legal in many states, that can ruin lives and destroy families, as well as cost taxpayers greatly,” Edwards said. Several municipalities around Louisiana already had switched to fines rather than arrests for possession of small amounts of recreational cannabis, and the state has a legal medical marijuana program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state House voted Monday to eliminate Maine’s secretive “fusion center” created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure data is shared among law enforcement agencies. The 88-54 vote followed a whistleblower lawsuit and legislative scrutiny of the center, which was accused of gathering and storing intelligence on gun buyers, power line protesters, and employees of a camp for Israeli and Arab teens. Further votes would be necessary to close the center, which is an arm of the Maine State Police. The proposal provoked fierce debate – and rare bipartisan support – with lawmakers invoking George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” and even making comparisons to Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union. Another lawmaker countered by suggesting the bill was a veiled attempt to defund the police. Rep. Jeffrey Evangelos, an independent from Friendship, said the goal of sharing information about foreign-based terrorism was admirable but said there was “mission creep” beyond the center’s original purpose. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Charlotte Warren, D-Hallowell, said the operator of the fusion center couldn’t demonstrate that it was an effective use of taxpayer dollars or that it offered something new that other law enforcement agencies didn’t already provide.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Maryland’s COVID-19 state of emergency will end July1, more than 15 months after the deadly coronavirus made its first appearance in the state in March 2020. All remaining health restrictions will end on that date, Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday, including mask mandates. “The battle’s not over,” Hogan said. “We’re transitioning from a state of emergency to an ongoing operation.” That operation will include continuing to vaccinate thousands of Marylanders who still need COVID-19 shots and caring for the shrinking number of people sickened by the virus. Over the course of the pandemic, Maryland has seen more than 460,000 cases of COVID-19. Nearly 9,500 people have died, many of them elderly and vulnerable. Hogan said Tuesday that Maryland’s health metrics have improved significantly since the worst peak of the pandemic in the winter. “We have finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel,” Hogan said. There will be a 45-day grace period after July 1 to allow Marylanders to adjust to the end of emergency regulations, Hogan said. That includes an extra 45 days to renew driver’s licenses and an extension to the state’s eviction moratorium. Ending the state of emergency does not affect Maryland’s access to federal funds, Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is giving away five $1 million cash prizes and five $300,000 college scholarships to residents who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. The aim of the so-called VaxMillions Giveaway, modeled after a similar program in Ohio, is to drive up the state’s vaccination rate, already one of the best in the nation, he said. About 4 million Bay Staters are already fully vaccinated, according to the Department of Public Health. “So if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines and thinking about getting vaccinated but for whatever reason haven’t, here’s another reason for you to come forward, protect yourself, your friends, your co-workers and your neighbors by getting vaccinated here in the commonweath,” the Republican governor said at a news conference. All legal residents who have been vaccinated in the state are eligible to register for the lottery prizes by going to mass.gov/VaxMillions starting July 1. Residents ages 18 and older are eligible for the $1 million prizes, while residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for the scholarships, which are in the form of grants via a 529 College Savings Plan managed by the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority. The state will hold weekly drawings for five weeks starting July 26.\n\nMichigan\n\nAllendale Township: Community leaders in western Michigan have voted to keep a statue of Confederate and Union Civil War soldiers with a Black child kneeling between them. The Allendale Township board voted 5-2 on Monday, despite a recommendation from a group that the statue be replaced by one with Union soldiers who are Black, Native American and white. “It’s been made very clear to me that the majority of our residents wish for the Civil War statue to remain in the garden of honor,” said Jody Hansen, township clerk and board member. Dozens of people attended the meeting, which was held outdoors at a park bandshell, 15 miles west of Grand Rapids. “What better lesson can we teach our children than by being able to say, ‘We had this thing. We thought it was OK. We have since learned that we were wrong,’ ” said area resident Cathy Seaver, who wants the statue removed. Trustee Barb VanderVeen, who opposed keeping the statue, asked if the child, which represents a slave, could at least be removed. Trustee Candy Kraker said the artist indicated that removing it would damage the structural integrity.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A group representing landlords announced a lawsuit Tuesday to force an end to the eviction moratorium imposed by Gov. Tim Walz, saying his order makes it all but impossible for property owners to remove disruptive tenants. The Minnesota Multi Housing Association said the governor’s executive order, which was issued in the early days of the pandemic, has become unworkable as it was originally written and is no longer needed. “Over the past year it has become clear that property owners are expected to wait until there is evidence that a person has become so dangerous that other residents have to call the police or move out, or that the rental unit is completely destroyed,” according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court Monday. The association’s CEO, Cecil Smith, told reporters at the Capitol that the lawsuit had been in the works long before legislative leaders agreed Monday to a 15-week “off-ramp” for ending the moratorium. The negotiators said the bipartisan agreement offers strong protections for renters and clear timelines for Minnesotans who owe back rent to secure rental assistance, which is paid directly to landlords. Landlords would be required to send notices to tenants who are behind on their rent 15 days prior to eviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nWater Valley: A former state lawmaker was found shot to death over the weekend in a rural area outside the burned home where her sister-in-law was found dead after Christmas. Ashley Henley, 40, was a Republican who served in the state House from January 2016 to January 2020 from a district in DeSoto County. The North Mississippi Herald was first to report that Henley’s body was found Sunday night in rural Yalobusha County, about 70 miles south of DeSoto County. Her body was outside the home where the body of her sister-in-law Kristina Michelle Jones was found Dec. 26. The Herald published a photo of a homemade sign at the site with photos of Jones under the phrase, “I was murdered.” Yalobusha County coroner Ronnie Stark told the Commercial Appeal on Monday that the time of Henley’s death had not yet been determined. Stark told WMC-TV that Henley had been mowing grass at the home before she was killed. Henley was a teacher before she was elected to the state House, and she often took her young son to the state Capitol during legislative sessions. She sought a second term in November 2019 and lost by 14 votes to a Democrat. Henley challenged the outcome, saying she believed she had found voting irregularities. A committee in the GOP-controlled House held a hearing and denied Henley’s petition.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson enacted a new law Tuesday limiting the duration of local public health restrictions and barring governments from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public facilities and transportation. The law took effect immediately upon Parson’s signature, but it may have little immediate effect because most local officials already lifted their coronavirus restrictions on businesses and public gatherings and have not been checking people’s vaccination status. Parson, a Republican, said the law still is important for the future. “Then next time we do get in a crisis, we’re going to have a little bit more safeguards for the general public to make sure they have more transparency and more of a voice in the process,” he said. When under a statewide emergency declaration, the new law limits local orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by a majority vote of the local governing body such as a city council. If there is no state emergency declaration, then local orders closing entire classifications of entities or activities could last for only 21 days, unless extended by a two-thirds vote of the local governing body.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Public review has begun for a proposal to boost radio and cellphone service in Glacier National Park, park officials said. The deadline to comment is July 11. The proposal calls for upgrades to communications from the National Park Service, which uses outdated technology or can’t reach remote areas of the park, the Missoulian reports. Currently, cellphone service is only available in the western part of the park at Apgar and the eastern part of the park because of commercial cell towers outside the park borders. “While recognizing that national parks provide disconnected space for many visitors, the plan also proposes a strategy for commercial cellular and/or internet access for public and NPS use in certain developed areas,” such as Many Glacier, Rising Sun, Two Medicine and Lake McDonald Lodge, park spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The proposal would prohibit large-scale cell towers and commercial telecommunications gear in the backcountry, despite visitors and employees alike relying more on internet access. Signal strength would be limited as much as possible to the four developed areas mentioned in the proposal, Kerzman said, although some spillover might be unpreventable.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state is approaching having 70% of its adult population vaccinated against COVID-19, but the pace of distribution of the shots continues to slow. The state may be close to President Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% or more of all adults with at least one dose of the vaccine by July 4. About 63% of Nebraskans 18 and older had received at least one shot as of Friday, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate ranks 24th among all the states. Nebraska has 57% of its adults fully vaccinated. Vermont leads the nation with 84% of its adults having received at least one shot, and 14 states have exceeded Biden’s goal. The CDC said roughly 31,000 shots were distributed in Nebraska last week, which was down from 37,000 the week before and well below the mid-April peak of 150,000 in a week. The number of new virus cases reported in the state continues to fall. Nebraska reported 234 new cases last week, down from 254 the week before and 378 two weeks ago. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 44.86 new cases per day May 30 to 28.43 new cases per day Sunday. Nebraska has reported 223,888 virus cases and 2,258 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Advocates are building momentum toward setting aside a wide desert area rich with biological diversity and Native American cultural significance for permanent environmental protection. The southern Nevada site would be called Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and encompass a Spanish Colonial Revival house that once belonged to 1920s-era Hollywood actors Clara Bow and Rex Bell on their historic Walking Box Ranch. The rugged and dry landscape is dotted with Joshua trees between mountain ranges west of Searchlight. At more than 594 square miles, it covers an area larger than San Francisco Bay. “There are threats to the sort of peace and the environment that we’re in right now,” Gabriel di Chiara, a Nevada Conservation League organizer, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “And we believe establishing this monument will preserve this land and this way of life for future generations, and it’s vitally important.” Conservation advocates providing a tour of the 5,000-square-foot homesite June 9 said they saw hope in President Joe Biden’s administration, a federal conservation plan that aims to protect 30% of American lands and water by 2030, and the appointment of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland as the first Native American head of a presidential Cabinet post.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As the number of COVID-19 cases has fallen and restrictions have been dropped in the state, drug overdoses are on the rise in some cities. Suspected overdoses in Manchester and Nashua rose by 26% in May, according to American Medical Response. The 72 suspected overdoses was the most in a single month since June 2019, WMUR-TV reports. Overdoses decreased during the pandemic since more people were inside, said AMR Regional Director Chris Stawasz. “It gives us concern that in the summer months, which we typically see as higher overdose months, we’re going to be back probably at levels we have not seen in several years,” he said. More people now have access to the overdose reversal drug Narcan, officials said. There was record use of Narcan in May in Manchester.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Fifteen months after they were shuttered at the height of the pandemic, adult day care centers will be allowed to reopen due to a sharp decline in COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and cases, state officials said Monday. The centers, which provide activities for those suffering from dementia, were closed to protect the elderly March 20, 2020, when there were only 890 cases and 11 confirmed COVID deaths in the state. Since then, New Jersey has tallied more than 890,000 cases and 26,000 COVID-19 deaths, the vast majority of which have been among seniors. The adult centers are some of the few facilities that are still closed due to COVID-19, while most other venues have been reopened for more than a year, and mask-wearing and social distancing have been relaxed. Safety guidance on how to return to operations such as requiring screenings for staff was to be sent out to the centers Monday, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Among the procedures: Staff must wear masks regardless of vaccination status. Participants can engage in close group activities if everyone is vaccinated. An isolation room is needed for a sick participant. And windows and doors should remain open to promote better ventilation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is urging cities and counties to consider banning the sale of fireworks ahead of the July Fourth holiday. She issued an executive order Monday, pointing to the drought that has blanketed much of the state and the fire restrictions that already are in place across New Mexico’s five national forests. While state statutes prevent the governor from imposing a statewide ban, the governor’s office is encouraging municipalities to take action to limit fire danger by adopting fireworks restrictions over the coming weeks. Rio Rancho and Farmington have warned residents that only permissible fireworks will be allowed – such as cone fountains, crackling devices and sparklers – and only in paved or otherwise barren areas. Dona Ana County recently approved restrictions that will span the holiday. “We want to prevent fires in the dangerous conditions we are experiencing,” County Fire Chief Shannon Cherry said, referring to the dry and windy weather. Farmington’s proclamation also will remain in effect for 30 days, but officials said the City Council may extend it if extreme conditions continue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dozens of Holocaust survivors clapped, sang and danced Monday at a concert held in their honor in Brooklyn in the first large gathering for New York-area survivors after months of isolation during the coronavirus pandemic. The concert by popular Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey was organized by the Nachas Health and Family Network and other groups that help the more than 35,000 Holocaust survivors estimated to live in the New York City metropolitan area. “It’s extremely good for the soul, for the heart, to see people coming out once again and socializing,” said Dolly Rabinowitz, who sat in the front row of the Yeshivah of Flatbush auditorium joined by other Holocaust survivors and students of the Modern Orthodox Jewish school. The survivors, most now in their 80s and 90s, suffered unspeakable horrors in concentration camps. In the past year, many remained isolated at home because they were at a high risk from the fast-spreading virus. “To be out once again is like reviving ourselves. To sit among our children and grandchildren is heartwarming,” said Rabinowitz, who lived through Auschwitz and the Death March. Some held hands and choked back tears when they heard an instrumental version of “Ani Ma’amin,” sung by many Jews herded into cattle cars on their way to concentration camps.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Constitution Party of North Carolina and North Carolina Green Party have failed to garner enough signatures to remain official political parties in the state for now, an election official said Monday. The State Board of Elections determined earlier this year that the two small parties had fallen short of candidate support thresholds from last November. But the board said the parties would be recognized again to field candidates starting later this year if each collected about 13,900 signatures of registered voters by Saturday. Neither party reached that goal, board spokesman Noah Grant wrote in an email. That means their parties’ registrants – totaling 9,600 between them – will now be re-designated as unaffiliated voters. The confirmed signatures so far – over 2,800 for the Constitution Party and fewer than 10 for the Green Party – will roll over into petitions to field candidates in the November 2022 election, Grant said. The groups would need to be meet the thresholds by next June 1 to qualify. For now, the state will recognize just three official political parties: Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s taxable sales and purchases for the first quarter of 2021 fell nearly 10% over the same period the previous year. Taxable sales and purchases for January, February and March totaled $4.1 billion, a 9.9% decrease over the three-month span in 2020. Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger said the drop was due to the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the state’s economy. Despite the decline statewide, Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks and Minot all reported increases, led by Fargo at 17.6%. Ten of the 15 major industry sectors reported declines over the year. The mining and oil extraction sector decreased by $438 million, or about 59%. The wholesale trade sector decreased by $250 million, a 23.5% drop. North Dakota’s taxable sales and purchases are a key indicator of economic activity in the state. They also are used to forecast state budgets.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans receiving food stamps would have to undergo a new “asset test” that measures total worth, including the value of cars owned by anyone in a household, under a provision in the Senate’s version of the state’s upcoming two-year budget. The goal of the test is to be sure needy recipients of SNAP benefits get what they deserve, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. “There are a lot of folks who can afford to pay for a variety of things who are still receiving these benefits,” Huffman said this month. The measure incorporates elements of stand-alone legislation introduced earlier this year in the GOP-controlled Senate. Dozens of people representing food banks, legal aid groups and health care advocacy groups have testified against it. Opponents of that bill, pending in the Senate Government Oversight and Reform Committee, say it comes at the worst possible time, as emergency federal benefits enacted during the coronavirus pandemic expire. Those include maximum allotments for food stamp recipients, a $300 weekly unemployment supplement, and a moratorium on evictions. “It will force low-income Ohioans to choose between having food and owning a car to get to work or saving money to prepare for an emergency,” said Kelsey Bergfeld, director of Columbus-based Advocates for Ohio’s Future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: “Tiger King” Joe Exotic is selling items seen on the hit Netflix series that elevated the big cat handler into a household name. The auction will also include NFT versions – digital “non-fungible tokens” – of those items and artwork. Exotic, real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, will be selling 3D renderings of cult collectibles sold alongside real-life tangible items seen on the show, as well as digital artworks for fans. Items include Exotic’s Smith & Wesson revolver, a fringed leather jacket and images autographed from prison. Online auction house Mintable will present the auction Friday at officialtigerkingnft.com. Also up for bid are the Tiger King’s black leather jacket and pants set, a bikini worn by adult film actress Rachel Starr, digital trading cards and artwork, and audio recordings of Exotic made from federal prison, where he’s serving a 22-year sentence for hiring someone to murder nemesis Carol Baskin. He was already somewhat of a celebrity in Oklahoma before Netflix launched the “Tiger King” series last year. For years, he ran an exotic animal park near Wynnewood, offering guests an up-close experience with big cats like his namesake tigers. He unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party’s nomination for governor in 2018, two years after campaigning for president.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 4 in 10 Oregonians strongly or somewhat agree with statements that reflect core arguments of white nationalist and other far-right groups, according to a new statewide survey. DHM Research and the Oregon Values and Beliefs Center, both independent nonpartisan organizations, surveyed 603 Oregon residents in a 15-minute online questionnaire Jan. 8-13. They estimate the margin of error is between 2.4% and 4.0%. To recruit respondents, DHM used a professionally maintained panel. It also set demographic quotas and weighted data to ensure a representative sample. Survey results indicated that, compared to a DHM Research panel in 2018, fewer Oregonians believed in protecting and preserving the country’s multicultural heritage. More agreed America “must protect and preserve its white European heritage.” It’s a “disturbing” revelation, said Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at Western States Center, the progressive nonprofit organization that commissioned the research. She said the 4 in 10 represent a growing population in the state that is vulnerable to messages commonly used by white nationalists like the ones posed in the survey, including the “white heritage” idea and that “white people in America face discrimination and unfair treatment on the basis of their race.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A ban on employers mandating vaccines for their workers inched ahead in the state House on Tuesday with a committee vote supported by all Republicans and opposed by every Democrat. The main sponsor, Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, called it “a very simple question of workers’ rights.” Diamond has been a fervent opponent of coronavirus mitigation policies and has been publicly skeptical of mask-wearing and vaccines. Labor and Industry Committee Chairman Jim Cox, R-Berks, said lawmakers were responding to increasing reports that employers are requiring COVID-19 vaccines, forcing some workers to choose between the jab or losing a job. An amendment by Cox took out a provision in Diamond’s bill that would have ended employer-mandated tests for marijuana. Diamond said after the meeting that the marijuana testing language lacked support. The bill would let workers or prospective workers avoid workplace-mandated vaccinations by putting into writing that their doctor has concerns it might harm their health; that they have religious or “strong moral or ethical” convictions against a vaccine; that they already contracted COVID-19; or that they are concerned because tge vaccines have not been fully approved by federal regulators.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State officials are proposing to build a new laboratory to replace the one run by the Health Department, which is the only Level 3 biosafety facility in the state. Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott is advocating for spending $82 million to replace the State Health Lab that she said had limited capacity to expand testing needed during the coronavirus pandemic because the building’s systems are outdated. “When it came to testing, for example, where we were leaders, we ultimately were inhibited by our ability to expand just because of the confines of the building and the electrical supply for the building,” Alexander-Scott said. “With the next pandemic, we are going to need the ability to expand and shift and streamline.” The medical examiner’s office, state crime lab and environmental testing labs are also located in the same building as the State Health Lab in downtown Providence across from the state Capitol. Gov. Dan McKee included the allocation for the new lab in the proposed budget. If the Legislature approves the spending, it would come from the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief that the state is getting. The new fiscal year starts July 1, and a final budget bill is expected this month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: It may just be loose change, but parking meters are helping to show how tourism is booming along the state’s most popular beach after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted. Myrtle Beach collected as much in parking fees in May as it does in a typical June, Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Office Executive Director Brian Schmitt told The Post and Courier of Charleston. “2021 has just been nuts,” Schmitt said. “In March, we did April numbers. In April, we did May numbers. … If that trend continues, then we hit June with July numbers – which July is typically our best month, our $360,000 month – we expect to maybe see that continue.” The city no longer just collects coins from meters. There are parking lot terminals that take debit and credit cards and a mobile app called ParkMobile that allows drivers to stop their cars and pay with a click of a smartphone, officials said. More traditional ways of measuring tourism are also up in Myrtle Beach. The Chamber of Commerce said hotel occupancy rates are up this summer compared to 2019. The officials don’t use 2020 numbers to compare because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge on Monday criminally charged three members of the U.S. Marshals Service with contempt of court and obstructing justice after a dispute with a marshal who refused to disclose her COVID-19 vaccination status and removed prisoners from a courthouse. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow May 10, after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19, the Aberdeen American News reports. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann gave the U.S. Attorney’s Office until Friday to decide whether to charge the marshals, including Daniel Mosteller, the head of the agency in South Dakota, and Stephen Houghtaling, the state’s chief deputy. Kornmann said he was determined to find another prosecutor if the U.S. attorney declined to prosecute the case. Kornmann moved in March to require vaccinations for courthouse employees, but Mosteller told the judge the Marshals Service was not requiring employees to get vaccinated and would not provide their vaccination status to the court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal courts released 18% of Tennessee prisoners who requested compassionate release in 2020, a new report from the federal Sentencing Commission shows. At the height of COVID-19 last year, thousands of motions asking for reduced sentences were filed in courts across the nation, according to the commission. Most of those were filed by the defendants themselves. Combined, 336 federal defendants in Tennessee districts filed motions for compassionate release. The courts released 61 of them. The Sentencing Commission tracks federal sentencing trends and policy, regularly releasing reports on that data. The June 10 report focuses only on compassionate release cases. Nationally, a total of 2,549 defendants were compassionately released, their sentences ending, according to the commission. That number is 21% of those who tried. “Compassionate release” is a broad term, usually related to sentencing laws that allow the court to find “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to warrant an early release. At least 6,654 people in Tennessee Department of Corrections custody had contracted COVID-19 as of last week, and 42 of them are believed to have died from the disease.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: On the cusp of summer, the electric power grid manager for most of the state on Monday issued its second conservation alert since the deadly February blackout, calling on users to dial back energy consumption through Friday to avert an emergency. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas said many forced generation outages and record June demand have squeezed the power supply. It appealed to users to set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees and avoid using large electric appliances until demand decreased late in the day. ERCOT predicted a peak demand load on its system of 73,000 megawatts, far above the June record of 69,123 megawatts set between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. June 27, 2018. However, as of 2:30 p.m. Monday, 12,178 megawatts of the grid’s 86,862 megawatts of generating capacity were offline, ERCOT said, leaving a razor-thin margin of reserve capacity of about 2,000 megawatts. “We will be conducting a thorough analysis with generation owners to determine why so many units are out of service,” Woody Rickerson, ERCOT vice president of grid planning and operations, said in a statement. “This is unusual for this early in the summer season.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Transportation officials have reported nearly twice as many people died in alcohol-involved crashes on the state’s roads last year compared to the year before, despite less commuter traffic during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Transportation said there were 61 fatal crashes involving alcohol last year compared to the 32 crashes in 2019, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Department officials said there was also an 11% increase in traffic fatalities in the state from 2019 to 2020, which includes fatal alcohol-involved crashes. Nationally, there was a 7% increase in traffic fatalities over the past year and a 9% increase in alcohol-involved fatalities, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Robert Miles, director of traffic and safety for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it’s too soon to know why fatal crashes increased. He said the pattern has surprised everyone, including traffic experts. “I think … most people thought if there is less traffic on the street there will be fewer fatalities; there will be fewer crashes,” he said. “We saw fewer crashes, but we saw more fatal crashes.” Miles said it is possible people began taking more risks while driving because of extra road space created by reduced traffic. But he also said not every type of fatal crash increased in the past year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Now that the state of emergency imposed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in Vermont is ending, meetings of public bodies must be held in person, Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos said. During the pandemic, public boards were authorized to hold those meetings remotely. Condos said boards can still allow people to attend remotely, but a physical meeting location must be provided, and those bodies must physically post notices of the meetings. “Vermont’s public servants have made it clear that our government can still operate and make critical decisions during a public health emergency without sacrificing the right of Vermonters to know how their government is making those decisions and their right to participate in the process,” Condos said in a statement Monday. “As we transition towards our shared ‘new normal,’ it is vital that we use the many successes, best practices, and lessons learned from the last 15 months to improve how we, as trusted public officials, best serve the public.” On Monday, after the state vaccinated just over 80% of the eligible population, Gov. Phil Scott lifted all COVID-19 restrictions. The state of emergency that allowed the remote meetings expired at midnight Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A dental student at Virginia Commonwealth University has been awarded $10,000 by her school to develop a prototype for her invention to help those wearing braces floss between their teeth. Student Christina Gordon first developed her idea for the Proxy-Flosser when she was 10 years old and looking for a better way to complete the tedious task. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports she put something together akin to a floss pick and didn’t think much else about it until she enrolled in dental school. She said she was shocked to learn that a better product still hadn’t been invented, and she began making inquiries about whether her Proxy-Flosser was marketable. She won $10,000 from VCU’s Innovation Gateway, which helps faculty and students commercialize their innovations. Because her idea has not been patented, she is not publicly disclosing the details of her invention.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a law that will require meal-delivery apps to sign agreements with restaurants instead of listing restaurants on the apps and taking orders without permission. Council President M. Lorena Gonzalez, who sponsored the law, said it will protect restaurants, simplify work for delivery-app drivers and give customers more reliable service, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-0 on Monday. Mayor Jenny Durkan hadn’t reviewed the law yet to determine whether she’ll sign it or let it become law without her signature, her office said. Council staff noted the law could result in some restaurants paying delivery fees they’re not paying now, possibly less work for drivers and fewer options for customers. Gonzalez said restaurant industry groups such as Seattle Restaurant Alliance backed the measure, and labor groups and delivery apps were consulted. Delivery apps Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats didn’t immediately comment. Brianna Megid, a spokesperson for DoorDash, said restaurants should have the power to make choices affecting their businesses. DoorDash removes restaurants, when requested, she said. Under the status quo, delivery apps can use online menus and other information to list restaurants without permission. Restaurants may not even know they’re listed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hundreds of demonstrators outraged with Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to a sweeping overhaul of U.S. election law marched through the capital city Monday evening. The Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, denounced the influential moderate Democratic senator and called for a diverse coalition of working people to apply pressure on Manchin, who recently opposed a $15 minimum wage and the price tag of President Joe Biden’s initial $2 trillion infrastructure plan. “West Virginia needs a real senator,” Barber told the crowd at a Charleston park. Then they marched a mile to Manchin’s office. Unable to meet with the senator – an aide told Barber he was in Washington – leaders of the demonstration affixed a poster-sized protest letter to the front doors of the office building. Rallygoers took turns signing their names on it. When Manchin’s aides offered comment cards to collect protestors’ grievances, Barber waved them away: “We don’t want to talk to the staff.” The protest was spurred by Manchin’s decision to oppose a landmark reform of U.S. election law, a proposal known as For the People Act. Manchin said last week that passing reform on a party-line vote risked further stoking partisan divides.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The superintendents of the state’s five largest school districts told members of the Legislature on Tuesday that they’re “dismayed” that $2.3 billion in federal aid is at risk because of low funding for K-12 schools. Superintendents of the Milwaukee, Madison, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay school districts urged lawmakers in a letter to set aside partisan differences and do what’s best for schools. The state budget being written by the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee does not include enough funding for K-12 schools to ensure that Wisconsin would be able to keep $2.3 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. Republican leaders have repeatedly said they will ensure the funding wouldn’t be lost. The budget committee plans to complete its work this week. As it stands, the new budget would include $128 million more in state funding for K-12 schools than the current one, which is about one-tenth of what Democratic Gov. Tony Evers requested. Evers and Democrats have urged lawmakers to spend more on K-12 schools, especially in light of rosier projections showing the state will collect $4.4 billion more in taxes than originally expected.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A recycled wooden sculpture of an enormous troll now lounges in Rendezvous Park. It’s the brainchild of Copenhagen artist Thomas Dambo, who has built trolls all over the world. Their whimsical construction beckons spectators to clamber aboard and, in the case of R Park, serves as a bridge to ferry the fun from the park to a nearby miniature island, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Dambo named the Jackson Hole troll “Mama Mimi,” for her motherly guidance – plus, he said, Mimi is a “good, strong” Scandinavian name. “I’m super happy with it,” the artist said of his 80th piece. Mimi is one of the few female trolls in Dambo’s small army, and apart from one tucked in a fjord, she’s the first to interact so closely with water. Mimi’s face and feet were assembled at the artist’s Denmark workshop, but everything else was mapped out and assembled on site. Her hair is made entirely of driftwood roots found washed up on the banks of the Snake River. Rather than buying lumber that’s been shipped across the country, he used leftover pallets from Osprey Beverages, saving them from the dumpster. Mimi’s signature stone necklace was sourced from the river and a team member who offered up an old, oversized rope as a band. Set back a quarter-mile or so from the bridge, Mimi won’t be collecting any toll money from travelers, but she did cost a pretty penny: roughly $50,000 raised by an army of #Trollbackers, plus another $50,000 from private donors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/13/met-opera-cat-catch-slender-man-news-around-states/118816660/", "title": "Met Opera, cat catch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission will ask lawmakers to revise the state’s medical marijuana law in order to get plants in the ground next year and make the products available to patients sooner, Al.com reports. The commission also voted to offer State Treasurer John McMillan the job of executive director of the new agency that will run the medical cannabis program. McMillan – who served two terms as state agriculture commissioner and is a former commissioner of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources – told the news outlet he expects to accept the job, which would require him to resign as state treasurer. Al.com reports Commission Vice Chair Rex Vaughn said he has been in discussions with lawmakers about moving up the start date for licensing cultivators from Sept. 1, 2022 to early 2022. The time required to grow the plants, which will be raised in greenhouses, is 90 to 110 days. The 14-member commission oversees a new agency that will license and regulate cultivators, processors, secure transporters, testing laboratories and dispensaries of medical marijuana products. It will be a seed-to-sale intrastate program, with products made from plants grown in Alabama. A special legislative session is expected this fall on redistricting. Another might be held on prison construction.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said President Joe Biden’s push to require millions of U.S. workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is “ill conceived, divisive and un-American.” “At a time in which we are called to work together, forced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty,” the Republican governor said Friday. Biden on Thursday outlined plans to mandate that employers with more than 100 workers require their employees to be vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus weekly. When asked Friday about critics who might sue over the plan, Biden said: “Have at it.” Dunleavy has faced some criticism for not issuing a statewide mask mandate and for not implementing a new disaster declaration to deal with a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. He has instead asked lawmakers to act on legislation intended to address staffing concerns raised by health care facilities. In a letter to legislative leaders this month, he said the virus is now “endemic,” and his administration is “adapting and proposing changes that make the response to the challenge more durable, and not subject to the whims of 30-day proclamations or health orders.” Still, in his statement, Dunleavy said it is “clear from the data and empirical evidence over the last year that the vaccine is the most effective way to fight COVID-19.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sold off $93 million in Unilever bonds and plans to sell the remaining $50 million it has invested in the global consumer products company over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories, the latest in a series of actions by states with anti-Israel boycott laws. The investment moves state Treasurer Kimberly Yee announced last week were mandated by a 2019 state law that bars Arizona government agencies from holding investments or doing more than $100,000 in business with any firm that boycotts Israel or its territories. Arizona appears to be the first of 35 states with anti-boycott laws or regulation to have fully divested itself from Unilever following Ben & Jerry’s actions. While Ben & Jerry’s, based in Vermont, is owned by London-based Unilever, it maintains its own independent board, which Unilever said makes its own decision on its social mission. Ben & Jerry’s announced July 19 that maintaining its presence in the occupied territories was “inconsistent with our values.” The Arizona law enacted in 2016 and revised in 2019 had broad, bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. He tweeted that the Ben & Jerry’s decision “is discrimination.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An appeals court has reversed a lower court judge’s order that the city must reinstate a police officer who was fired for fatally shooting a Black motorist. The Arkansas Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday reversed Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s decision last year regarding the firing of former Officer Charles Starks over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired his gun at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February 2019. Fox reversed the Little Rock Civil Service Commission’s decision to uphold Starks’ firing and instead imposed a 30-day suspension and reduction in salary. Starks resigned in September and accused the police chief of making his working conditions “intolerable” after his reinstatement. Starks pulled over Blackshire because the car he was driving had been reported stolen, though Blackshire’s family has said he borrowed it from a friend. Surveillance and dashcam footage showed that Starks instructed Blackshire to exit the parked car. Instead, Blackshire began to slowly drive away and bumped Starks, who fired into the windshield four times. The car briefly stopped, and Starks got onto its hood and fired at least 11 more times into the car as it continued to move.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers have approved what advocacy groups say are the nation’s strongest protections against falsely labeling items as recyclable when they in fact are destined for landfills. The measure sent late Thursday to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for his consideration would reserve the “chasing arrows” recycling symbol for items that actually can be recycled. The bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Ben Allen, said in a statement that it will force truth in advertising and “will reduce contamination in the recycling stream and improve the sorting process, thereby saving cities and ratepayers money while empowering consumers to make more informed decisions.” It’s among efforts in several states to ease confusion about recycling and increase recycling efforts. A Consumer Brands Association report recently asserted that confusion has led to “a broken recycling system in America.” A coalition of 14 opposition groups countered that the bill would have “resounding impacts” on the state’s goal to divert 75% of trash from landfills and hinder efforts to recycle packaging. The bill would likely require regulators to create a list of eligible items that “is extremely limiting,” potentially including just 15, the groups said – eight types of paper materials, two forms of glass, two types of metals, two types of plastics and one type of colored plastic.\n\nColorado\n\nGolden: Security workers will accompany nurses and staff members of Jefferson County Public Health’s three mobile vaccine units for the foreseeable future after months of harassment and abuse. One weekend this month, the agency was forced to pull vans off the street after a driver in Gilpin County, which contracts Jefferson County’s health agency, drove toward and destroyed signage around the van. Others “verbally abused” staff members Sept. 4, said Dr. Dawn Comstock, the agency’s executive director. These types of attacks have been going on for months, she said, but they’ve escalated to a higher degree. For instance, last month someone threw live fireworks into a tent of nurses and staff members, the Gazette reports. Despite the ongoing barrage of attacks and harassment, the county was still set to hold its COVID-19 vaccine events. “JCPH will not be intimidated out of its public health mission,” Comstock said. “We’ve arranged additional security measures to keep staff safe and will be working with our law enforcement partners to assure these handful of extremists are not allowed to infringe on the rights of those who want to be vaccinated.” Each incident has been reported to law enforcement, but each time the perpetrator has left the scene before officers arrived.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Tourism officials plan to spend more money than usual promoting the state’s fall foliage in an attempt help the industry rebound from the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont helped launch the $1.4 million “Full Color Connecticut” marketing campaign Friday, which he said will link leaf peeping to other attractions across the state. Tourism officials said the play on the fall colors is meant to highlight other colorful destinations in the state, “from the golds of corn mazes and the pinks of cotton candy to the blues of coastline sails and the ambers of craft beer.” The campaign’s budget is nearly triple the amount typically invested in a fall marketing program, officials said. It is designed to reach about 33% of the market in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island – compared to 10% in recent years – and expand into other markets, such as Philadelphia. The campaign also will take advantage of the state’s high COVID-19 vaccination rates, which tourism officials have said helped bring visitors to Connecticut this summer. The campaign will run through Nov. 20 and feature hundreds of tourism-related businesses, from the state’s parks and orchards to its casinos and shops.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Decades of structural defects and water damage have put a 30-year-old condominium complex at risk of collapse, but disagreements among condo owners over annual fees have prevented repairs from moving forward. “The buildings are deteriorating. We’ve been paying through the nose,” Michael “Mick” Donnelly said, comparing the situation at Le Parc, where he’s lived since 2009, to that of a condo that collapsed in June near Miami. “It’s been a nightmare situation similar to Surfside because the buildings are nearing condemnation and the people here don’t deserve it.” The fatal collapse of the 12-story condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, put many Le Parc residents on edge. Most of the issues found to have contributed to the collapse of the over 130-unit Champlain Towers South on June 24 mirror long-standing problems Le Parc owners have endured. Le Parc Condominiums – consisting of three four-story buildings housing 76 units – has faced similar issues to those at Champlain Tower South, including shoddy construction practices, design flaws, the developer going bankrupt, and decades of deterioration and water infiltration. While some emergency work was done, a permanent fix – estimated to cost $4.5 million – has been on hold nearly five years due to a lack of funds and financing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education, joined D.C. middle school students and families Friday, welcoming them back to classrooms and honoring the educators who made it all possible, WUSA-TV reports. The first lady spoke at Brookland Middle School and delivered words of encouragement while acknowledging the challenges of the past year and a half during the coronavirus pandemic and highlighting goals to come. “We are going to partner with you because we don’t always know what the future holds, but we do know what we owe our children,” she said, while affirming that the administration will ensure schools like Brookland have the resources and support to continue in-person learning. “We owe them a promise to keep their schools open as safe as possible. We owe them a commitment to follow the science. We owe them unity so that we can fight the virus, not each other.” Meanwhile, the president emphasized the necessity of COVID-19 shots. “Parents, get your teens vaccinated – you’ve gotten them vaccinated for all types of other things,” he said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, easy and convenient.” Biden also celebrated D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s vaccination efforts and her success in setting up 20 inoculation sites at local schools\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Gardens: The most notable catch in Saturday’s NCAA football game between Miami and Appalachian State didn’t happen on the field. It wasn’t even a football. It was a cat. The animal somehow got into Hard Rock Stadium, then got caught by one of its paws off the facade of the upper deck in the first quarter. It eventually fell to the lower level of the stadium, where fans using an American flag as a makeshift net were able to safely break its fall and catch it before it was carried off to safety. “They were trying to grab it from above, and they couldn’t reach it, but they were scaring it downward,” said Craig Cromer, a facilities manager at the University of Miami and season ticket holder who with his wife, Kimberly, brings the flag to each home game. “It hung there for a little while with its two front paws, then one paw, then I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s coming soon.’ ” That’s when the Cromers unhooked the flag from the railing and hoped for the best. The petrified cat fell, bounced a bit off the flag, and eventually was secured by some in the student section before being brought away by stadium security. “I’ll tell you, if the cat will help us in our red-zone offense, I’m going to see if we can give it a scholarship,” Miami coach Manny Diaz said. Some videos of the incident were posted on Twitter, tagged #HardRockCat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s transit authority is soliciting public input for the exterior graphic design of new railcars. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is encouraging current and potential future riders to vote for one of four design options through its website or on its social media pages. All four designs include MARTA’s traditional color scheme and are inspired by “the dynamism and movement of trains,” according to a news release. The transit authority says more than 1,300 people participated in a similar crowdsourcing effort in the spring that sought input on the interior design of the railcars. Those votes and comments revealed that the most popular interior features are digital maps, next station and destination displays, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessible seating and signage, the release says. “We were thrilled with the response we received on the interior features and are eager to see what riders think of the exterior design options,” MARTA General Manager and CEO Jeffrey Parker said in the release. The new railcars are slated to arrive in stations in 2023.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige is requiring government contractors and visitors to state facilities to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. Ige’s executive order issued Thursday takes effect Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. State contractors must attest to their employees’ vaccination status or provide weekly tests for unvaccinated staff. Contractors also must wear masks and maintain physical distance while on state property. The order also applies to visitors to state facilities. It does not apply to beaches or outdoor state properties. Inmates at correctional facilities, patients at state hospitals, and children under 12 or students attending state public or charter schools are exempt. Travelers arriving at airports are also exempt. The order says it is intended for the “safety of the government workforce during this ongoing escalation in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths resulting from the delta variant.” Last month, Ige issued an executive order requiring state and county employees to be either vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Northern Idaho’s long, deep streak of anti-government activism has confounded attempts to battle a COVID-19 outbreak overwhelming hospitals in the deeply conservative region. A deadly 1992 standoff with federal agents near the Canadian border helped spark an expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country, and the area was for a long time the home of the Aryan Nations, whose leader envisioned a “White Homeland” in the county that is now among the hardest-hit of the pandemic. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so packed with COVID-19 patients that authorities announced last week that facilities would be allowed to ration health care. “This is extremism beyond anything I ever witnessed,” Tony Stewart said of people who refused to get vaccinated and wear masks. Stewart is a founding member of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, which battled the Aryan Nations for decades and helped bankrupt the neo-Nazi group. “I’m almost speechless in seeing so many people have lost concern for their fellow humans.” Anti-government sentiments are strong in northern Idaho. State Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, refused an interview request, saying reporters were liars. She has promoted mask-burning protests and is among lawmakers who have frequently pushed COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Lawmakers are considering whether to put a statue on state Capitol grounds of Ronald Reagan, the Illinois native who served as the country’s 40th president. Members of the House Statue and Monument Review Task Force met Wednesday to discuss Reagan’s legacy and whether to memorialize him at the statehouse in Springfield, where there are statues of two of the four U.S. presidents who were either born in or launched their political careers from the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant are represented on the Capitol grounds, but not Reagan or Barack Obama, who started his political career in the Illinois Legislature. Reagan was born in Tampico and raised in Dixon. He later had an acting career in Hollywood before becoming governor of California. Rep. Mary Flowers, D-Chicago, the chairwoman of the task force, said that “whether we agree with his policies or not … (Reagan) had a profound impact on the direction of this country.” She noted Reagan’s “made-for-TV” presidency produced images and ideas that remain with the U.S. today – for better or worse. His “It’s Morning Again in America” campaign ad created an idealistic vision of the country, she said, but he also is credited with the offensive phrase “welfare queen.” The task force will continue to take public comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nLogansport: The body of a Marine who was among 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing during the U.S.-run evacuation at Afghanistan’s Kabul airport was returned Sunday to his northern Indiana hometown. A military procession marked the beginning of memorial services for Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto Sanchez, 22, of Logansport. Sanchez’s body arrived Sunday morning at Grissom Air Reserve Base. The procession then headed about 20 miles to Logansport. People lined the route to show their respects, many with American flags, and jets flew overhead as the procession approached downtown Logansport. It stopped briefly downtown, where the hearse carrying Sanchez’s body paused under a garrison flag. The procession included Indiana State Police and vehicles carrying Sanchez’s family, followed by thousands of motorcycles. Sanchez was among 17 members of his Logansport High School class who joined the military after their 2017 graduation. He died in the Aug. 26 attack in Kabul, where he had been transferred after serving as a U.S. embassy guard in Jordan, according to his obituary. A public visitation is scheduled for Monday at LifeGate Church in Logansport. The funeral is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the church. Burial will follow at Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge declined Friday to halt enforcement of a law that prohibits school boards from enacting mask requirements, saying there is no evidence that any school board would immediately impose a mask mandate if the law weren’t in effect. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Frances Parr, a mother of twin boys from Council Bluffs. She sued the state, Gov. Kim Reynolds and several state officials last month in Polk County District Court, seeking an order halting enforcement of the law. Judge Celene Gogerty, who was appointed to the bench by Reynolds in November 2018, said Parr has presented no evidence that a temporary injunction would alleviate Parr’s alleged harm caused by the law. Parr has asserted the law violates her constitutional rights. Her sons were set to start first grade in the Council Bluffs Community School District this fall, but she is teaching them at home over fears for their safety because the school cannot require other students to wear masks. Parr also has asked Gogerty to issue an order for a universal mask mandate for all students and school personnel until a voluntary plan can be implemented that separates mask-wearing students and staff from those who refuse. That request has not yet been argued before the judge but is another available remedy, Gogerty said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hospitals across the state will receive $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds for extra pay for nurses to keep them on the job but will be required to report monthly on how many nurses they’ve lost and why, under a plan a state task force approved Friday. Kansas law required a bipartisan pandemic response task force to spell out how the $50 million would be spent, and the task force added the reporting requirement. The task force’s meeting came a day after President Joe Biden imposed new vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans. Republican officials in Kansas and across the nation strongly criticized Biden’s mandate. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, proposed the reporting on nurses who’ve been terminated. He called Biden’s new federal vaccine requirements “dictatorial edicts.” “We’ve had front-line workers – I mean, you can call them heroes – on the front lines for the last year and a half,” Masterson said. He also said he worries that “we’re gonna get some of them premium pay, and we are going to give some others a pink slip.” Earlier in the week, Masterson proposed to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives – a proposal that failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Lawmakers grabbed the quarterback role to direct the response to COVID-19, but when it came time to lead, the GOP-led Legislature “punted” the decision on mask-wearing in schools to local boards, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. A day after a special legislative session ended, Beshear gave a blistering response to the Legislature’s decision to halt statewide mask mandates to combat Kentucky’s worst surge of the coronavirus pandemic. He declared that the Legislature “owns this pandemic moving forward.” Legislators passed bills Thursday that scrapped a statewide mask mandate for public schools and imposed a ban on any statewide mask rules until June 2023. Beshear vetoed the mask-related language, but Republican lawmakers overrode him before ending their three-day session. “The masking decision the General Assembly made was wrong. And it was also a punt,” Beshear told reporters. “I’ve been willing to make the calls, to take the hits, to make the plays. And the Legislature asked to go in … at QB. And what did they do? They punted on first down. When you’re in charge, it means you’ve got to make the decision. This one was to push the decision to others.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Supply trucks are once again delivering beer on Bourbon Street, and the landmark Cafe Du Monde is serving beignets, fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar, even though there aren’t many tourists or locals around to partake of either. With almost all the power back on in New Orleans nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ida struck, the city is showing signs of making a comeback from the Category 4 storm, which is blamed for more than two dozen deaths in the state. More businesses are opening daily, gasoline is easier to find, and many roads are lined with huge debris piles from cleanup work. Thousands are still struggling without electricity and water outside the metro area, and officials say oppressive heat is contributing to health problems and misery. It could still be weeks before power is restored in some areas, and many residents who evacuated haven’t returned. “It is not lost on anybody here at the state level and certainly not on our local partners just how many people continue to suffer,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. “While things are getting better, and we can be thankful for that … this is going to be a very long-term recovery.”\n\nMaine\n\nPhippsburg: A group wants to create an oyster reef off the town’s coast to improve water quality, protect a shoreline from storm surges and act as a habitat for other smaller shellfish. The oyster reef is part of the fight against “the immense amount of change” that’s taking place because of climate change in waters off the Maine coast, Marissa McMahan, a senior fisheries scientist at Manomet, a Brunswick-based conservation nonprofit, told the Times Record. The project is the continuation of a two-year pilot program the Nature Conservancy began in 2017. The conservatory’s goal was to see if an oyster reef could be grown on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than 99% of the world’s large bodies of saltwater, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Phippsburg group is growing oysters in bags that float on the surface of the water. They’ll eventually be released into the ocean with a hope that they’ll attach to one another and grow as a vertical structure. Oysters benefit the environment because they filter algae, creating clearer, cleaner water that can support underwater grasses used for habitat by crabs, scallops and fish. They also can break up waves and reduce shore erosion.\n\nMaryland\n\nBethesda: Activists are calling for the return of a Black cemetery to a church decades after it was erased by development. The Rev. William J. Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the Poor People’s Campaign, spoke by Zoom to participants at a Friday rally, which organizers said included descendants of those buried at the Moses African Cemetery and members of the Macedonia Baptist Church. The church plans to restore the cemetery and build a monument and museum on the site. The Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition sued Montgomery County’s Housing Opportunities Commission last month claiming that part of the cemetery is beneath the parking lot of the Westwood Tower Apartments, news outlets report. The housing agency owns the property and apartment building and uses the rental income to cover costs of the agency. An estimated 500 bodies of enslaved people or relatives of the enslaved rest at the cemetery, the lawsuit says. The plaintiffs argue that selling the parcel that was used as a burial ground without court approval violates state law. Last week, a Montgomery County judge temporarily blocked the $51 million sale of land that includes the Westwood Tower Apartments, WTOP-FM reports. The temporary restraint forbids the sale until a Sept. 27 hearing on the matter.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: The body of a U.S. Marine killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan returned home Saturday in a solemn procession through Massachusetts on the 20th anniversary of the attacks that led to America’s longest war. Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo died in the Aug. 26 bombing near the Kabul airport where people were being evacuated amid the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A dozen other U.S. service members and 169 Afghans were killed as people struggled to get into the airport and on flights out of the country. Dignitaries including Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Kim Janey and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey paid their respects to Rosario Pichardo’s family as her body arrived at Boston’s Logan International Airport. In her hometown, Lawrence, people lined highway overpasses and streets waving American flags as the vehicle procession made its way through the city near the New Hampshire state line. A Marine honor guard carried the flag-draped draped casket into the Farrah Funeral Home as police, firefighters and others stood and saluted. “We will never forget her name,” Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez said afterward. “We are proud to have her home.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill that would have restricted state officials’ ability to use the Public Threat Alert System to announce new laws or executive orders. The Democratic governor, whose veto had been expected, said the system has only been activated once in the five years since it was created, for an active-shooter situation. The state used a different, federal system last year to send alerts to wireless devices about Whitmer’s stay-at-home and mask orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. That angered GOP lawmakers who said it should only be activated for “immediate” threats. That system would not have been affected by the state legislation. In a letter to legislators, the governor said the bill “would add complexity to the administration of the state’s public threat alert system, making it harder for law enforcement officers to do their jobs and making Michiganders less safe. … There is no need to further limit or complicate its use.” The measure had cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature mostly along party lines. The federal Wireless Alert System allows four types of messages: presidential alerts, imminent threat alerts, AMBER alerts and – as of 2019 – public safety messages designed to save lives or safeguard property. People can opt out of the latter three.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: Authorities said Sunday that a vast majority of the Greenwood Lake wildfire in northern Minnesota is contained, one month after lighting ignited the blaze in the Superior National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service reported that the nearly 27,000-acre fire was 67% contained as of Sunday morning. The Forest Service had said last week that the fire was nearly half under control as hundreds of firefighters were still being dispatched to the area. “I think the team is feeling really good about how things are looking out there. There’s been a lot of great work done and progress made taking advantage of this cooler weather,” Fire Service spokeswoman Stefani Spencer said. “The containment is pretty much growing every day.” Spencer added that the public is happy to have roads open, including all traffic opened along Highway 2. She said the closure was an inconvenience and frustration for folks traveling to Ely and the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Star Tribune reports. The fire started Aug. 15 about 10 miles southwest of Isabella has destroyed 14 cabins and homes along with 57 outbuildings. Some residents in the affected area who were evacuated have recently been allowed to return to homes and cabins after the fire lost intensity.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Physicians who spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines could now have their licenses to practice medicine suspended or completely revoked, according to a new policy adopted by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. The policy, adopted Sept. 7, says doctors have an “ethical and professional responsibility” to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and share factual and scientifically grounded information with them. “Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,” the policy says. Whether physicians “recognize it or not,” they possess a high degree of public trust due to their specialized knowledge and training, giving them “a powerful platform in society,” it says. The policy specifically warns doctors against spreading misinformation on social media and strongly recommends physicians separate their personal and professional content online. “Physicians must understand that actions online and content posted can affect their reputation, have consequences for their medical careers, and undermine public trust in the medical profession,” it says.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: Thieves in the Kansas City area have in the past month have taken two churches’ fruit harvests. Hosanna! Lutheran Church in Liberty had planned to harvest grapes it grows after a Sunday worship service earlier this month, WDAF-TV reports. But members discovered that all 1,500 pounds of grapes had been stolen, apparently cut off their vines. The church has for about 15 years had the grapes bottled for communion wine. The harvest is a big annual event, especially for children in the congregation. The grapes were valued at $1,500. “This wasn’t really about theft of grapes,” said Pastor Mike Kern. “We don’t care about the value. It was more of a theft of joy.” Kern’s church was not alone. St. Peter and All Saints Episcopal Church in Kansas City reported that four of its apple and pear trees were recently picked clean, too. The anticipated harvest was three or four years in the making. The Rev. Jonathan Frazier said the Episcopal church donates its fruit to a nearby food pantry and a downtown homeless shelter. “So it’s just really sad because for somebody to take that quantity of fruit, they’re probably going to sell it,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Glacier National Park’s reservation system for Going-to-the-Sun Road, which ended last week after a three-month trial run, caused countless headaches for locals and outsiders who struggled to secure $2 tickets, but park officials say it worked as intended, alleviating traffic congestion inside the park and preventing long lines of cars from spilling onto U.S. 2. “Generally we do feel it was a success because it met our major goals,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Kerzman told the Daily Inter Lake. Kerzman noted the park never had to close the west entrance, as it has been forced to do in past seasons, and there were never more than about 15 cars backed up on the highway. In recent years, she said, traffic jams have stretched for miles from West Glacier to Coram. Additionally, the reservation system helped ensure that many visitors could find parking and access their desired trailheads and campsites. “We feel that we were able to manage the number of visitors and be able to ensure a good experience for everybody,” Kerzman said. Of course, not everyone was enamored by the new approach to crowd control. One recent review on tripadvisor.com called the reservation system “a disgrace” that made it “impossible” to access the park and prompted the author to cancel their visit, losing money on a hotel booking.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Starting in early 2022, public transit will be more widely available in the city and surrounding communities. To address the increasing demand for public transit in Northeast Nebraska, the newly renamed North Fork Area Transit announced new services that will provide “safe, efficient and affordable” public transportation. A new flexroute bus service called “Forklift” will provide rides along three routes and the addition of almost 100 bus stops across the community, said Steve Rames, Norfolk’s public works director. The Norfolk Daily News reports that Forklift, which will operate seven days a week, will also allow anyone who lives within three-quarters of a mile from any marked bus stop to schedule curbside service. The flexroutes will run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The system will likely rotate on 30-minute cycles during peak times and one-hour cycles during non-peak times, Rames said. The North Fork Area Transit’s existing call-ahead ride service will continue but under a new name, “Telelift.” With Telelift, riders are able to schedule a ride 24 hours in advance. Service is available up to 30 miles around Norfolk, seven days a week, Rames said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A change in newly issued Nevada driver’s licenses means airport security screeners may have to manually check the credentials because their scanners can’t read the bar codes, officials said. The Transportation Security Administration hasn’t yet updated its scanning system to account for a minor change to the bar code on the state’s new license design, said Kevin Malone, a state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman. TSA agents at U.S. airports can manually inspect a license if the scanning system won’t read the bar code, TSA Lorie Danker spokeswoman said. The state began issuing licenses with the new design in July. A note on the DMV’s website recommends that travelers allow extra time to complete airport security screening.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBrentwood: Dozens of families have challenged mask-wearing policies in New Hampshire school districts during the coronavirus pandemic, with two cases in court Friday calling for injunctions to stop enforcing them. A lawyer representing families in the Epping, Londonderry and Timberlane districts argued at a Rockingham County Superior Court hearing that mask mandates violate the parents’ rights to make health care and medical decisions for their children, and they are illegal restraints under a state law that limits the use of child restraint practices in school. “Their children have difficulty breathing with these masks on,” attorney Robert Fojo said. “It’s causing them to be afraid; they suffer anxiety and stress as a result of wearing these masks, experiencing lightheadedness and trouble concentrating. Masks irritate their skin, cause acne. It exacerbates already inherent problems that they have, such as asthma, difficulty with speech, learning-related disabilities, and obviously a distraction. They inhibit social interaction, which is what these children should be doing in school.” Attorneys for the school districts have argued for the case to be dismissed, saying the districts have been following a “tool kit” for schools from the state Department of Health and Human Services that recommends mask-wearing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Four more counties have received a major disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paving the way for residents of Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Union counties to access federal assistance in the wake of the remnants of Hurricane Ida, Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed. The declaration comes after Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic and Somerset counties received declarations from the White House last Monday. The declaration allows for assistance with needs like grants for temporary housing and home repairs, among other things that will help residents and business owners in the aftermath of Ida. There also will be federal funding available to all levels of government as well as some nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work to repair or replace facilities damaged by the storm in the designated counties. Many in Essex County had been pushing for a disaster declaration after the area got crushed by Ida. Montclair officials had hoped for FEMA to include the county after the storm brought “devastating” flooding. In Montclair, which received 7.5 inches of rain, at least 50 drivers were rescued from cars and countless more ruined, more than 150 basements needed to be pumped out, officials said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Native American communities across the state are putting the finishing touches on proposed redistricting maps aimed at greater self-determination in future public elections, as competing plans wind their way toward the Legislature for consideration. Participants in a redistricting commission for New Mexico’s Indigenous pueblo communities said Friday that map proposals may be finalized as soon as this week. The maps will be submitted to a seven-member Citizen Redistricting Commission that is reviewing and vetting redistricting maps for the Legislature, which can adopt recommendations or start from scratch. The seven-seat commission has no Native American representation. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, whose growing political clout is reflected in the election of Laguna Pueblo tribal member Deb Haaland to Congress in 2016 and her promotion this year to secretary of the interior. Attorney Joseph Little is working with a broad alliance of Native American communities to turn redistricting principles into action using results of the 2020 census to track population changes. Major redistricting changes are most likely in the heavily Native American northwest region of the state and an oil-producing region in the southeast.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: For the first time in 550 days, an audience was inside the auditorium at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday night, attending a Metropolitan Opera performance of Verdi’s “Requiem.” The night of multiple extended standing ovations was in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but in fact marked much more. The company was performing in its home for the first time since hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic, including Met violist Vincent Lionti, assistant conductor Joel Revzen and chorister Antoine Hodge. It also marked the first performance in the house since the death of conductor James Levine, the Met’s towering figure of the last half-century. He died in March at 77, a little over three years after was he was fired for sexual improprieties. Levine’s successor as music director on the podium is 46-year-old Yannick Nezet-Seguin. The pandemic caused the Met to cancel more than 275 performances, including its entire 2020-21 season, plus an international tour. The gap was the longest since the company began in 1883. A series of Broadway shows will start opening this week. The New York Philharmonic begins Friday at Alice Tully Hall, while David Geffen Hall undergoes reconstruction expected to last another year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judge has set a mid-October deadline for state lawmakers to follow a court-ordered plan to provide full funding for improving public education, or he will take action himself. State Superior Court Judge David Lee said he was “very disheartened” that the General Assembly is funding a small part of a plan calling for at least $5.6 billion in new education funding by 2028, news outlets report. Lee has scheduled a court hearing Oct. 18 and said if the plan isn’t fully funded by then, he will consider options on how the court can resolve the matter. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, also accused Lee of overstepping his authority, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Lee’s warning marks the next stage in the Leandro school funding case first filed in 1994 by low-wealth school districts to get more state funding. The case is named after a Hoke County student who has since graduated from college. The North Carolina Supreme Court assigned Lee to oversee the case after Judge Howard Manning retired. Over the years, the state’s highest court has ruled that the North Carolina Constitution guarantees every child “an opportunity to receive a sound basic education” and that the state wasn’t meeting that standard.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agriculture officials have confirmed a second case of cattle anthrax in Kidder County. The case was confirmed by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on Friday, according to the state Agriculture Department. The first case was reported in August. Officials say producers in the county and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax. The disease is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as drought. Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Two cases of anthrax were reported in North Dakota in 2020. In 2005, more than 500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported, with total livestock losses estimated at more than 1,000.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Police Department is pledging to increase recruitment of female officers to reach the goal of a force composed of 30% women by the year 2030. The department announced it is joining the New York University School of Law’s “30x30 Pledge.” In addition to recruitment, Cincinnati police also want to improve the retention and promotion of women in policing. According to a memo from the Cincinnati City Manager’s Office, the force is currently 22.7% female, compared to the national average of 13%. Officials say about 100 departments throughout the country have signed the pledge. “The goal of the pledge is not only to inform agency progress but also to identify and understand barriers to progress such as resources, capacity or authority,” the manager’s office reported. Officials said the police force should also be representative of the population it serves, which is 51% female.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has rejected a request to remove two members of the state’s Pardon and Parole Board from a high-profile death penalty case. The court’s brief ruling Friday denied a prosecutor’s request to remove Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle from considering the commutation request of Julius Jones, who was sentenced to death for the 1999 killing of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. The ruling came after a lawyer for District Attorney David Prater argued before a court referee that unless members Luck and Doyle were barred from taking part in the decision, the five-member board would likely recommend that Jones’ sentence be commuted following a hearing Monday. Prater, who argued that Luck and Doyle have a conflict of interest because of their work with released inmates, said in a statement that he respects the high court’s decision. “This is the system I operate in every day and I believe in it, though decisions don’t always go as I desire,” Prater wrote. He said his office is prepared to present “the truth of the circumstances” surrounding the fatal shooting of Howell during a carjacking. “If the Board objectively considers the truth, they will quickly vote to deny the killer’s commutation request,” Prater wrote.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Transportation Commission has granted conditional approval to a plan to expand Interstate 5 through Portland’s Rose Quarter as well as build a cap over the freeway to allow for the redevelopment of a Black community destroyed when the interstate was first built. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the commission’s unanimous decision Thursday follows the recommendation of Gov. Kate Brown that the Oregon Department of Transportation pursue “hybrid option 3.” That plan would essentially tunnel the freeway and provide economic opportunity for the region’s Black community in an effort to reclaim the Albina district. Supporters say the idea is to remediate historic harm caused by the freeway’s original construction and displacement of community members. Approval of the hybrid 3 model is contingent upon ODOT providing a thorough analysis of the project’s cost structure and funding sources by December. It also requires ODOT and its contractors to update its diversity and subcontracting plans and to reevaluate the project’s initial environmental impact study. The project’s cost has risen significantly from its initial price tag of between $715 million and 795 million to upward of $1.18 billion.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Some physicians are offering stock doctor’s notes for use by parents wishing to have their children exempted from wearing masks in school, according to state health officials who say they have referred the matter for possible disciplinary action. A statewide, universal mask mandate for Pennsylvania schools went into effect Tuesday as the Wolf administration seeks to keep school buildings open for in-person learning amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The acting health secretary’s face covering order contains an exemption for students for whom wearing a mask would cause or worsen a medical condition. But parents in districts that require a doctor’s note or other medical documentation have complained it’s been difficult to find a physician who will sign off. The Health Department said some doctors are pushing stock exemptions available to anyone. “The administration is aware that some physicians have indicated that they intend to offer blanket ‘exemptions’ to individuals with whom they have no treatment relationship, and regardless of whether the individual’s physical condition required an exemption,” the department said in a statement. Those doctors “have been and will be referred to the appropriate licensing boards for possible disciplinary action.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: A pond has been closed to shellfish harvesting after seven people reported becoming ill after consuming raw shellfish harvested in the area last month. The state departments of health and environmental management said Saturday that Potter Pond in South Kingstown will be closed until further notice. The agencies said two of the sickened individuals tested positive for Campylobacter Jejuni. People with Campylobacter infection usually have diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps as well as nausea and vomiting, the agencies said. The symptoms usually start after two to five days and last about one week. The agencies advise anyone who consumed shellfish from the area and is feeling ill to seek medical attention, as more serious complications can develop. Health officials say they’ve contacted all commercial harvesters in the area to ensure that any product harvested during the time frame under investigation is not sold at restaurants and markets. They’re also urging recreational harvesters who collected shellfish between Thursday and Saturday in the pond to either discard them or avoid consuming them raw or undercooked. Officials say quick steaming isn’t sufficient to prevent illness, but cooking the shellfish until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce risk.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawsuit filed in federal court is asking a judge to overturn a requirement in state ethics laws that makes it illegal for anyone who files a complaint against a public official from talking about it unless the complaint is found valid. The lawsuit is filed by a whistleblower who says a state lawmaker broke ethics laws by voting in favor of a special interest that paid the legislator $108,000 over three years through contracts with firms with ties to the lawmaker. The State Ethics Commission rejected the complaint after discussing it behind closed doors, saying the lawmaker taking money from a subsidiary of the special interest didn’t affiliate him with the interest, the whistleblower’s lawyer said in a lawsuit obtained by The Post and Courier. In the lawsuit, attorney Chris Kenney called the finding a “legal absurdity.” Kenney, who works in state Sen. Dick Harpootlian’s law firm, told the newspaper he can’t further identify the lawmaker or the special interest without a ruling in his favor from the court. Ethics laws prevent people who file a complaint from talking about it publicly before the complaint is heard and also if the commission rules against it, even on a technical issue. Critics of that provision have said it violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The first sporting bets have been wagered in the city, bringing to fruition an effort that began several years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned commercial sports gambling. Four casinos in Deadwood opened sports betting Thursday: Tin Lizzie, Cadillac Jack’s, Gold Dust and Mustang Sally’s. Betting is only allowed at licensed facilities in Deadwood. People can place their bets with tellers at a window, at a digital kiosk or, soon, through an app on their phone. The app will only work within the facilities. The South Dakota Commission on Gaming issued a final ruling Wednesday on a list of sporting events on which gamblers will be able to place bets, including Olympic events and professional and college-level sports, the Rapid City Journal reports. Deadwood Gaming Association Executive Director Mike Rodman said Thursday’s opening was a success. “We’re very pleased that we got to this point,” he said. “And it’s been a long haul getting there. We’re happy to be there today.” In 2019, the Deadwood Gaming Commission attempted to get the Legislature to legalize it but came up three votes short. In 2020, South Dakota voters legalized sports gambling with about 58% approval, and the Legislature passed the gaming laws in 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The federal Environmental Protection Agency is proposing the addition of a former munitions factory just outside the city to a list of prioritized Superfund toxic cleanup sites, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen said. The EPA has proposed adding the National Fireworks site in the Memphis suburb of Cordova to its Superfund National Priorities List for removal of toxic chemicals detected in groundwater, Cohen, D-Memphis, said in a statement Thursday. National Fireworks made flares, grenades, incendiary bombs and large caliber rounds for the U.S. Army and Navy from 1942 to 1945, the EPA said. Metals and chlorinated solvent contamination have been identified in the soil and groundwater on the Superfund site, the EPA said. The 260-acre site was redeveloped in 1986 as an industrial park. The listing would make the site eligible for cleanup funding as one of the nation’s highest priority contamination sites. The site is “dangerously close to Memphis’ Shaw Wellfield that provides drinking water to 79,000 people,” Cohen said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The CEO of Salesforce said the company will help employees leave the state, and he did so while retweeting a story linking the offer to concern about Texas’ new anti-abortion law. Salesforce, which sells customer-management software, joins a small number of companies that have reacted against the law. CNBC reported that the San Francisco-based company told employees in a Slack message that it will help them move “if you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state.” On Friday night, CEO Marc Benioff retweeted a post about the story, adding: “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice.” Ohana is a Hawaiian term for family. The company did not return messages for comment. The Texas law passed the Republican-controlled Legislature and was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May but didn’t go into effect until this month. It bans most abortions after six weeks, before many women know whether they are pregnant, and lets private residents sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. By a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the law. Last week the U.S. Justice Department sued Texas to block the law.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Thirteen Utah hospitals will postpone many nonemergency surgeries starting this week as health care workers are overwhelmed by another surge in coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant, a major health care company said Friday. Intermountain Healthcare announced that the hospitals will postpone non-urgent procedures for several weeks starting Wednesday. The announcement comes a week after state hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to curb the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. Hospital utilization in Utah is nearing its previous peak in December, when intensive care units were 104% full, and 606 COVID-19 patients in hospitals. There were 516 people hospitalized for COVID-19, and ICUs were 93% full as of Thursday, state data shows. About 62% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Thursday. Utah reported 10 new deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,703. Several Utah hospitals postponed nonemergency surgeries at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to alleviate some of the strain on health care networks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city’s annual marathon has been shortened so that fewer health care professionals will be needed at the race next month amid a surge in COVID-19 infections, organizers said. The People’s United Bank Vermont City Marathon & Relay will be a half marathon and modified relay event Oct. 24, RunVermont said. “After extensive review and discussions with professionals associated with the health care field, RunVermont believes it would be insensitive to ask those professionals to step aside from their duties to attend to the needs of the race at a time when the medical community is under some significant strain,” the organization said in a statement. Marathon runners can switch to a half marathon, select a virtual marathon option or defer the race until May 2022, organizers said. They can also chose to enter one of three races on a complimentary basis if space is available: the Mad Marathon in Vermont on Sept. 12; the Adirondack Marathon in upstate New York on Oct. 3; or the Eversource Hartford Marathon in Connecticut on Oct. 9.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Arrests on marijuana-related charges have fallen dramatically this summer in and around the capital city since a new law legalized possession of small amounts of pot and residents keeping a few cannabis plants, according to a newspaper report. Twenty-five marijuana-related arrests occurred in Richmond and in Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico counties in the first seven weeks after the law took effect July 1, compared to 257 arrrests during the same period last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing local law enforcement data. “A 90% reduction in marijuana arrests indicates that the public policy is performing as intended and in a manner that is consistent with post-legalization observations from other states,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The law legalized possession by adults age 21 and over of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the cultivation of four pot plants per household, among other decriminalization provisions. Selling marijuana remains illegal until the state launches a regulated market in 2024 and issues licenses. A regulatory board will help carry out the details.\n\nWashington\n\nLa Conner: The Swinomish Tribe is threatening to sue the federal government to speed up estuary restoration and salmon preservation on the Skagit River delta. Much of the estuary has been drained and closed off with tide gates to facilitate agriculture, but such habitat is crucial for juvenile salmon. The tribe says that under an agreement reached in 2010 – following a prior lawsuit – the Army Corps of Engineers isn’t supposed to grant construction permits to dike districts for work on the tide gates unless they first restore estuary habitat. But for the past five years, the Corps has been doing just that, the tribe says. During that time, at least 660 acres should have been restored. The restoration efforts are now behind the agreement’s schedule, which calls for restoring 2,700 acres by 2035. At the current pace, it will take a century to complete that, tribal scientists say. The tribe notified the Army Corps last week that it intends to sue within 60 days, saying the agency has allowed the dike districts to violate the Endangered Species Act. Skagit River Chinook salmon are protected under the law. The Army Corps and NOAA Fisheries said they are reviewing the tribe’s claims.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University is expanding its mask mandate to include all indoor campus spaces, officials said Friday. Masks will be required beginning Monday in all buildings and facilities regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status through Oct. 6, when public health conditions will be reevaluated, the school said in a statement. Last month, the university began requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The numbers of cases and quarantines involving university employees and students remain manageable, but officials said they decided to take the precautionary step due to the recent, significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the state. The mask requirement won’t apply in personal office spaces, small gatherings in residence halls, or while eating or exercising, officials said. Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that cases in West Virginia are still rising, and there are a record number of patients in intensive care units and on ventilators. He continued to urge residents to get vaccinated. “This thing is running rampant right now,” he said. “These vaccines are incredibly safe, and they’ll stop this.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A woman who admitted to helping stab a classmate to please online horror character Slender Man will be freed Monday from a mental health institution under strict conditions, a judge ruled Friday. Anissa Weier, 19, will be released after spending almost four years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh. A conditional release plan calls for her to live with her father, submit to around-the-clock GPS monitoring and receive psychiatric treatment, among other things. She won’t be allowed to use the internet except at home, and the state Department of Corrections will monitor her online activity. Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Payton Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Geyser stabbed Leutner multiple times as Weier urged her on. Leutner suffered 19 stab stab wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren said the conditions of Weier’s release were fair, and the plan “provides for the protection of the community” as well as for Leutner and for Weier herself. Weier, dressed in a dark suit and smiling occasionally, said nothing during the 20-minute proceeding. “She looks forward to moving on into a productive life,” her attorney, Maura McMahon, told the judge.\n\nWyoming\n\nSheridan: Artifacts found this summer at Medicine Lodge Archaeological Site are slated for radiocarbon dating, which could tell researchers more about when the Crow, or Apsaalooke, people came to the area, according to the state archaeologist. “This summer, we found Crow ceramics, as well a range of things, from thousands and thousands of flakes and 10 arrow points (or arrowheads) and preforms to make arrowheads to animal bone from bison as well as bighorn sheep, as well as obsidian,” Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton said. “We really hoped to find Crow ceramics to radiocarbon date, to have a better idea of how old those ceramics are.” Sharon Peregoy, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who represents the Crow Agency, said this type of work may help date early people of the area, preserving – or recovering – history that can otherwise be lost. “It helps dispel the concept that the Crow, Apsaalooke, people were new transplants to the area,” she said, adding that in this context, “new” means an arrival of 500 years ago. “The findings of these types of excavations and research correlates with our Crow oral history, which dates from time immemorial … prehistoric,” Peregoy said. “History is important to preserve a homeland for future generations.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/09/conch-contest-golf-tree-geena-davis-news-around-states/111409522/", "title": "Conch contest, golf tree: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would ban gender therapies such as prescription hormones or gender confirmation surgery for minors. The legislation would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19 or to perform gender confirmation surgery on minors. The bill, sponsored by Trussville Republican Sen. Shay Shelnutt, passed 22-3, news outlets report. The legislation now moves to the state’s House of Representatives, where a similar bill was also approved by a health committee last month. Proponents have said it would stop “vulnerable children” from getting medical procedures and medications with uncertain long-term effects. LGBTQ activists and opponents of the bill have countered it is discriminatory and spreads misinformation. The American Academy of Pediatrics advised in 2018 that such treatments can be part of certain care models for children.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Shoppers will no longer see a blue-sticker label on Gulf of Alaska cod after its sustainability certification is suspended starting in April. The label designates which fish are sustainably caught. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for sustainable fishing, will suspend the label starting April 5. Gulf of Alaska cod have had the certification for about 10 years. The impacts of losing certification are unclear. An independent audit found there were not enough young cod entering the gulf fishery, which led to the suspension. But auditors blame a climate change-caused heatwave from 2013 to 2016 for reducing gulf cod by more than half and pushing them to near-overfished status last year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The U.S. Forest Service has given final approval to a project to replace and upgrade a ski lift at the Arizona Snowbowl. The Forest Service’s decision allowing replacement of the current chairlift is based on an environmental assessment published in October. Forest officials concluded that replacing the new lift would not significantly impact the land and environment, despite claims that it would affect Native American cultural values, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Arizona Snowbowl is located on the Coconino National Forest on the west side of the San Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff. Arizona Snowbowl said the current chairlift will be replaced with a high-speed combination version that includes enclosed eight-person gondola cars and open-air six-person chair seats. The new lift will be installed in time for the 2020-21 season, the ski area said.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A film festival co-founded by Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis announced Friday that it’s moving to later in the year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. The Bentonville Film Festival, in northwest Arkansas, announced it will move this year’s festival, originally scheduled for April 29-May 2, to Aug. 5-8. The festival said it will honor passes and badges that have already been purchased for the festival. The official lineup will be announced by June, organizers said. “Our number one concern is the safety of our content creators and our community of attendees,” Davis, who is also the festival’s chairwoman, said in a statement. The Bentonville Film Festival began in 2015 and last year screened 162 films. Arkansas has not had any cases of coronavirus, which causes the illness called COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles International Airport will experiment with a limited restoration of taxi pickups in the central terminal area beginning later this month. Taxi drivers have been pushing to resume pickups there since taxi and ride-hailing pickups were moved to a lot outside the terminal loop last fall to ease traffic amid major construction. Airport officials said one taxi pickup location will be established in a parking structure near the Tom Bradley International Terminal and adjacent Terminal 3. Another taxi stand will be put back into service for travelers passing through Terminals 7 and 8. Last October, the airport moved all taxi and ride-hailing pickups from curbside to a satellite lot, dubbed LAX-it. Airport officials said the move was necessary to reduce traffic for construction of an automated people-mover train and its stations, as well as redevelopment of every terminal. Passengers can walk there or take constantly circulating shuttles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The owner-operator of a Denver-area oil refinery will pay $9 million to settle air quality violations dating to 2017, state officials announced Friday. The settlement with Calgary-based Suncor Energy is the biggest leveled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to resolve air pollution violations. The Colorado Sun reports the settlement was announced by John Putnam, the agency’s environmental director, at a news conference. Suncor’s Commerce City refinery produces about a third of gasoline used by motor vehicles in Colorado and most of the jet fuel used at Denver International Airport. It processes about 98,000 barrels of oil daily, most of that from drillers along Colorado’s Front Range. On Dec. 11, the refinery released an ashy substance that blanketed adjacent neighborhoods. Suncor called the clay-like material catalyst and said it wasn’t hazardous.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: The state’s wine and spirits industry has joined forces with environmentalists to reduce litter, especially mini bottles of wine and spirits known as nips. The anti-litter partnership, known as Three Tiers for Connecticut, plans to launch the retail portion of its “Don’t Trash Connecticut - Nip it in the Bin!” campaign Tuesday. The campaign will focus on signage at retail locations, urging consumers to properly dispose of the bottles. A news conference is planned Tuesday at CT Beverage Mart in New Britain. The partnership has already held two community cleanup events in Norwalk and West Haven. More more cleanups and initiatives are scheduled for the coming year. Wine and spirits companies and organizations in Connecticut formed the partnership last year with the group Live Green CT, a statewide environmental organization that’s dedicated to eradicating land-based litter by 2025.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit against the state’s largest hospital system. The lawsuit filed by former Christiana Care compliance officer Ronald Sherman and backed by the federal government alleges that the hospital system defrauded taxpayers by funneling Medicaid payments to independent doctors as kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The judge denied Christiana’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit after holding a hearing Friday. Christiana Care argued that Sherman had no standing to file the lawsuit because he had previously executed a release discharging all causes of action against the hospital system when he was terminated in 2014. Christiana also argued that Sherman, on behalf of Christiana Care, had disclosed the allegations contained in his complaint to the government through compliance disclosure logs submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A federal magistrate on Friday excoriated the government for refusing to turn over its investigative file in the death of a Virginia man shot by U.S. Park Police. The files are sought by the family of Bijan Ghaisar, who died in 2017 after he was shot by Park Police officers multiple times at the conclusion of a stop-and-go chase on the George Washington Parkway. Ghaisar’s family is suing the government and the officers who shot Ghaisar. At a hearing Friday, U.S. Magistrate Ivan Davis said the government had no right to withhold the file from the Ghaisar family’s lawyers. He ordered the government to turn over the entire file by next Friday. Government lawyers said they have been delayed in turning over the file because the material in the file is sensitive and voluminous. Judge Davis, though, was unsympathetic. “You’re required to produce, period,” Davis said. “You do not decide unilaterally for yourself” whether material should be turned over.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A woman who plays the French Horn in the Royal Canadian Navy took top honors in Key West’s 58th annual Conch Shell Blowing Contest on Saturday. Alliszon Zaichkowski of Victoria, British Columbia, won the women’s title performing excerpts from several melodies including composer Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She’s such a fan of the quirky “instrument” that she had a large conch shell tattooed on her arm. “I like to think of the conch shell as my travel horn because I can’t bring my French horn everywhere, and you also don’t want to be playing a French horn at the beach,” she said. “So I always just take my conch shell with me, and that’s my vacation instrument.” In the men’s division, Vinnie Marturano of Big Pine Key tooted his way to victory by playing a portion of Aram Khachaturian’s “Sabre Dance.” The fluted, pink-lined conch shell, an enduring symbol of the Florida Keys, has been used as a signaling device in the islands for centuries. Today, native-born residents are known as Conchs, and the Keys island chain is often called the Conch Republic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some students at a private school have been suspended indefinitely after a video surfaced showing them conducting an apparent mock lynching of another student with toilet paper in a school bathroom, officials said. Several boys at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School were seen on video wrapping toilet paper around their heads and cutting holes for their eyes, news outlets report. Some were also seen wrapping what appears to be a toilet paper noose around another boy’s neck as he appears to pull up on a bathroom stall support beam as if being hanged. Officials at the college preparatory school acknowledged the incident Thursday. They said the act was reprehensible and wouldn’t be tolerated. They also said the students were suspended indefinitely while the school investigates. A school statement didn’t say how many youths were suspended, and the races of those involved weren’t immediately disclosed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A million trees could be planted in the state each year under a proposed program to increase the number of noninvasive trees. The Legislature is considering backing the tree-planting project started by University of Hawaii geography professor Camilo Mora to offset carbon emissions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Carbon Neutrality Resources initiative is responsible for planting thousands of trees in Hawaii. The most recent project involved 2,000 volunteers planting 11,000 trees in December, Mora said, adding that he hopes to increase to 100,000 this year and plant a million in 2021. The bill would place the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in charge of a program to plant a million native trees statewide each year. It was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and passed its first reading in the House on Thursday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The FBI is investigating after hackers stole as much as half a million dollars of state payments that were intended to go to contractors. Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf’s office revealed the theft in a statement late Friday afternoon, saying the hackers posed as state vendors and then changed the vendor’s banking information, diverting the payments into the hackers’ bank accounts. The fraud was first noticed by a controller’s office employee Feb. 26, according to the office. Few details were released about exactly how the thefts occurred, but officials said the hackers were able to change the banking information by “navigating state procedures.” “Regular payments made to those vendors by 20 state agencies were then diverted and stolen,” the release said. “The State has recovered some of the funds to date, however, the total amount of funds diverted is under $550,000.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials from the city and the NHP Foundation celebrated the opening of a renovated historic housing unit offering affordable single-room occupancy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that restoration of the Mark Twain on Chicago’s Near North Side will help keep the city affordable. The city teamed up with the NHP Foundation, a nonprofit real estate organization dedicated to preserving and expanding affordable housing, in a $54 million rehabilitation of the building. It created 148 affordable apartment units with private bathrooms and added private kitchenettes. It has all new plumbing and electrical systems, a rooftop deck, a restored vintage facade and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The Chicago Housing Authority will provide rental assistance to the Mark Twain’s occupants. Fifty residents who lived there before the renovation have returned; the rest of the units will be leased to people on the authority’s waiting list.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The city will start supplying free feminine hygiene products in all city building restrooms, including men’s and gender-neutral restrooms. The decision came after Purdue University’s move to offer an assortment of menstrual care products for free in campus bathrooms. After the City Council approved a similar resolution, Mayor John Dennis said West Lafayette was ready to start stocking feminine products in all restrooms in city facilities, including the $31.5 million Wellness and Aquatic Center scheduled to open in early 2021. City Council members Shannon King and Kathy Parker sponsored the resolution. “The mayor gave us a thumbs up, and he really had our back,” King said. During a pilot project in restrooms at Purdue, the faculty-led University Senate found the building averaged $27 a month to restock menstrual care products used from seven dispensers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of three nominees to fill a vacant state Supreme Court seat have been passed to Gov. Kim Reynolds, who now has 30 days to appoint one of them as the high court’s next justice. The Judicial Nominating Commission on Friday afternoon announced the finalists: Mary Chicchelly, District Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District out of Cedar Rapids; Matt McDermott, an attorney at Belin McCormick, P.C. in Des Moines; and David May, an Iowa Court of Appeals Judge in Polk City. The commission, composed of eight individuals elected by Iowa lawyers and nine commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, interviewed 15 applicants Friday to fill the seat that will be left empty upon former acting chief justice David Wiggins’ retirement in the coming weeks. The finalist will be Reynolds’s fourth appointment to the court since taking office in May 2017.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple hundred million years ago, an ocean covering Kansas teemed with prehistoric life. Yet for millennia, Kansas has been a dry, sometimes even dusty place. The ocean is long gone, but traces of that long-ago aquatic life were captured for the ages in fossil form. Now, paleontologists from the University of Kansas have an app they hope will help motivate people to go out and find that evidence, reports the Kansas News Service. The Digital Atlas of Ancient Life app was created by a group of paleontologists and researchers led by KU ecology and evolutionary biology professor Bruce Lieberman. The app boasts an extensive database with detailed pictures of fossils common to Kansas. KU owns thousands of fossil specimens, especially trilobites, cephalopods and ancient clams. The app is one way to share all of that information to smartphones around the world. If it motivates people to go out and find some of their own, Lieberman said, all the better.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House overwhelmingly passed its version of a new two-year budget Friday, but some lawmakers said the unwillingness to tap into more revenue sources would shortchange many of the state’s pressing funding needs. The GOP-crafted spending plan drew bipartisan support in clearing the House 86-10. The measure now goes to the Republican-dominated Senate, which will put its imprint on the budget. The differences will likely be ironed out by legislative leaders in a conference committee. The House version changed Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposed pay raise for teachers to spread it to other school employees. It boosted school-security funding to hire hundreds of counselors. The House plan also scaled back Beshear’s proposal to add more social workers but offered salary enhancements to hire and retain more of them working in child protective services. The only new revenue source to help support the House spending plan would come from new taxes on vaping and tobacco productions, which would raise nearly $50 million over two years.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The opening of an urban park is being delayed because the nonprofit organization behind the project has obtained more money for additional features. Lafayette Central Park Inc. initially hoped to open Moncus Park this spring, but with an extra $5 million in money raised, the organization is planning to open later in the year. Features already completed include a dog park. Features being added this year are an amphitheater and a “family area,” which includes a tree house, splash pad and playground. The nonprofit has received some contributions earlier than expected. For example, plans for the amphitheater were put into motion when Iberia Bank advanced a pledge of $1 million to the park, which wasn’t expected for another three years. With the additional money, the nonprofit and its board had to consider whether to push back the park’s opening date; use sporadic openings of sections; or have construction underway while the park is open.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A historical museum that is part of the state’s popular Acadia National Park will be closed to the public this season as it undergoes rehabilitation work. The Islesford Historical Museum has been in the midst of rehab since November 2019. The National Park Service said the work will “allow for the protection and longevity of a historic building and for the safe exhibition of historical objects.” The museum is on the National Register of Historic Places and opened in the summer of 1928. The rehab work will include replacement of the original slate roof. The park service said money for the $1.1 million rehab is coming from entrance passes purchased at Acadia National Park and the service’s repair and rehabilitation funds. The service said the museum is scheduled to reopen during the following season with an exhibit about the Cranberry Isles.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A comprehensive education measure that will cost billions of dollars over the next decade with the goal of making the state’s K-12 schools among the world’s best was approved by the House of Delegates on Friday night. The House voted 96-41 for the bill, which still needs Senate approval. The legislation, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, is based on the recommendations of a state commission that worked for three years on the proposal. The plan focuses on five policy areas: expanding early childhood education like pre-K; increasing teacher salaries; college and career readiness; aid for struggling schools; and accountability in implementation. The proposal would be phased in over a 10-year period. It would cost an additional $4 billion in fiscal year 2030, with a majority of the cost paid by the state while local governments also contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWestborough: Fish and wildlife officials have started stocking the state’s ponds, lakes and rivers with more than 500,000 trout raised in five hatcheries. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocking program began last week with bodies of water on Cape Cod, as well as in southeastern Massachusetts and areas west of Boston. Some of the places stocked with rainbow trout include Spectacle Pond in Sandwich, Lake Cochituate in Natick and Houghton’s Pond in Milton. Other bodies of water will be stocked with brook, brown and tiger trout raised in hatcheries in Sandwich, Palmer, Belchertown, Sunderland and Montague. These fish, coupled with the more than 60,000 stocked last fall, will provide some excellent fishing in the coming months, the agency says. Most of the trout are longer than 12 inches, with more than 600 brown trout and 500 brook trout over 18 inches.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Five people who worked in a wildlife disease lab have been diagnosed with a latent form of tuberculosis, a spokesman said Friday. The Department of Natural Resources’ lab processes thousands of deer heads during the annual hunting season to check for chronic wasting disease and bovine TB. An illness caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, TB can be fatal, although a latent form shows no symptoms, doesn’t make people feel sick and is not contagious, according to federal health experts. It typically involves treatment to prevent full-blown TB. The DNR learned about the infections last year, including three people in June and two later in the summer, spokesman Ed Golder said. He said it was the department’s “working assumption” that the workers got TB from infected deer, “but we can’t say for sure.” The lab is located at Michigan State University.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Overall graduation rates for the state’s high school students have hit a historic high. The state Department of Education released data Thursday that shows a graduation rate of 83.7% for the class of 2019. That’s up half a percentage point from the prior year and up nearly 1.5 points over the past five years. Minnesota Public Radio News reports black and Hispanic students made the biggest gains, with improvements of more than 3 percentage points for Hispanics and more than 2 points for black students. Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, with graduation rates higher for white students than they are for students of color. The data shows the rate for Native American students fell slightly this year. The rate remains the lowest among Minnesota high school students at just over half.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators have killed bills that would either ban or regulate kratom, an herbal drug that can be used for pain relief. Kratom is currently unregulated in most parts of the United States but has been outlawed by a few local governments in Mississippi amid concerns that it can be harmful. Kratom is derived from a tree that’s native to Southeast Asia. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says the leaves can be crushed and then smoked, put into capsules, or taken with water or other liquids. The DEA characterizes kratom as one of its “drugs of concern.” The agency says people have used it to relieve muscle strains and as a substitute for opium; the drug has also been used to manage withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Bills to either ban or regulate kratom died Tuesday when committees did not consider them before the first big deadline of the legislative session.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: More than 170 firearms seized or recovered by police during an eight-month period last year were purchased from a single St. Louis-area pawn shop, federal authorities said in announcing charges against three men connected to the shop. Carlos Jones, 31; Robert Thornton, 36; and Steven Johnson, 44, were charged Thursday with unlawful transfer of firearm to a convicted felon and making false statements on firearm records. All three men worked at Piazza Jewelry and Pawn in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The federal complaint said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced 170 seized and recovered guns to sales at the pawn shop, with 102 of those guns recovered in the city of St. Louis. ATF Special Agent Chad Foreman wrote in an affidavit released Thursday that six of the confiscated guns were used in homicides, four in robberies and 20 in weapons offenses and were found in 36 cases in which a prohibited person was in possession of a firearm.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A landslide was blocking a BNSF Railway freight line in eastern Montana on Friday. The slide happened about 10 p.m. Wednesday about 10 miles west of Miles City, BNSF Railway spokeswoman Maia LaSalle said. Dirt covered about 800 feet of railway that runs along the Yellowstone River. Crews were still working Friday to clear the tracks, but the slide activity had not been stabilized, LaSalle said. Freight traffic was being rerouted around the blockage on Montana Rail Link tracks. The track that is blocked is part of a path that connects trains from North and South Dakota to southern routes through the Powder River region into Wyoming, The Billings Gazette reports. No trains were in the area at the time of the slide, and no injuries have been reported, BNSF said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state game and parks commission will vote March 20 on banning both alcohol possession and consumption at Lake McConaughy and neighboring Lake Ogallala in western Nebraska. The alcohol ban in the state-controlled areas is among several agreements the state worked out with local leaders to avert drastic cuts in access, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The commission had been considering access restrictions following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The proposed changes, which would have taken effect later this year, were meant to address the overcrowding on the lake’s beaches. But the commission delayed action in January after hundreds of people showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules. Most said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Social media comments about protecting bears that were posted by Lake Tahoe activists and referred to a longtime wildlife biologist as a murderer constitute “good faith communications” protected as free speech, the state Supreme Court says. The recent opinion doesn’t end a lawsuit filed in Washoe County District Court in Reno. But it settles a key legal question in the dispute between Carl Lackey, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist, and Carolyn Stark, who administers a Facebook page that posts criticism of the state’s bear control tactics. The lawsuit is the latest development in a years­long legal and public relations battle between the agency and a group of activists who oppose state methods for managing bears. In 2018, a judge issued a protective order to keep Stark away from another state biologist who says Stark stalked her in a dispute over the capture of nuisance bears.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has written to congressional leaders asking for continued funding of the State Opioid Response Grant program, which helped New Hampshire create a new “hub and spoke” caregiver system. The state used its $45.8 million share of funding to set up its Doorway program of nine regional recovery centers. Sununu, in his letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the program served more than 7,300 people in 2019 and provided more than 3,200 clinical evaluations to identify needed services. Of that group, over 2,400 people had opioid-related needs, and more than 5,000 referrals were made to medication-assisted treatment, outpatient, residential and peer recovery services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Residents in a Jersey Shore town that hates its new sand dunes will get a chance to say whether they support building a boardwalk. Margate’s government decided late Thursday to authorize a nonbinding referendum during the November general election asking voters whether they support building a boardwalk in the wealthy town south of Atlantic City. The proposal arose from widespread unhappiness with a beach replenishment project completed in 2017. Mayor Michael Becker said Friday that the town is not committing itself to building one if the vote goes that way. Rather, he said, there needs to be a mechanism for the town’s voters to clearly express their preference, and the commission will then weigh the pros and cons before deciding. Margate had a boardwalk in the early 1900s; it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMagdalena: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is canceling group tours of its Very Large Array to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The observatory said Friday that the visitor center and gift shop will remain open, and self-guided walking tours will continue. But a semi-annual open house, guided tours and special tours for school groups will be put on hold between March 15 and May 31. The move is meant to protect visitors and the workers who keep the facility running, Tony Beasley, the observatory director, said in a news release. “Our first priority is the safety and health of our visitors and our staff, and these cancellations are being done to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus,” Beasley said. Astronomers use the Very Large Array to observe natural radiowaves from distant stars and planets.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Video showing New York City police officers arresting a young black man sparked outrage and elicited questions about the amount of force used to make the arrest in a city where mistrust of police remains high more than five years after Eric Garner’s death from an officer’s chokehold. Fitzroy Gayle, 20, pleads for help in the video, recorded by a woman who then tweeted it, as several officers wrestle him into submission Wednesday evening on a Brooklyn sidewalk. When Gayle asks a lone plainclothes officer why he was being stopped, the officer does not appear to answer before uniformed backup rushes in. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said he was ordering an internal investigation. The man in the video had fled officers who approached him and another man as they were smoking marijuana in a park about 7 p.m., Shea said. The officers were responding to an automated alert to gunshots, Shea said. Both men were later apprehended, but there is no indication they were linked to the gunfire, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s residents are getting more site-specific information this year about the air that they breathe and whether it might make sense to keep inside. The state Division of Air Quality announced last week that daily air-quality forecasts will now be issued for 91 of the state’s 100 counties and two mountain ridge zones. In the past, forecasts have been regional. A website provides real-time air quality index measurements, while next-day and extended forecast products will be posted each afternoon and updated in the morning. Index readings correspond to a color-coded advisory system that describes when the air can be unhealthy for some or many. Last week started what’s considered the ozone season, or when concentrations of the gas can be highest in the air as days get warmer. The division says ozone concentrations have been declining due to emission reductions from power plants, cars and industry.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: New rules for the state’s presidential caucuses are likely to drive up turnout and could shrink Bernie Sanders’ organizational advantage over Joe Biden when the state’s Democratic voters get their say this week in what has essentially become a two-man race. North Dakota is the smallest prize of the six states holding caucuses or primaries Tuesday, with only 14 pledged delegates at stake. As a result, it hasn’t gotten much attention from either candidate. What’s new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is more like a primary than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump. And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A tree that appeared overnight during the 1979 U.S. Open to become a part of golf lore has met its end. The Black Hills spruce known as “The Hinkle Tree” was partially uprooted by a gust of wind last week at Inverness Club in Toledo and was cut down. The tree dated to the 79th Open, when a journeyman pro named Lon Hinkle came up with a way to outsmart the course during the first round. Hinkle noticed he could take a shortcut by hitting through a gap of trees near the eighth tee and drive his ball on the adjacent 17th fairway, shaving 75 yards off the dogleg hole. It made for an easy birdie, but U.S. Golf Association officials were not amused. The USGA dispatched the course’s greens chairman to bring in a tree from a nursery and block the shortcut. Overnight, the Black Hill spruce, about 20 feet tall, appeared in the gap. But during the next round, Hinkle and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, decided to hit their tee shots over the tree.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A man who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2018 has been found guilty of assault and battery for shooting a process server trying to give him legal documents. Jurors on Thursday rejected Christopher Jonathan Barnett’s argument that he shot and wounded the man who came to his Tulsa home in July in self defense. On the stand, Barnett asserted the process server presented a threat to him, though he conceded the man never pointed a weapon at him. Jurors recommended Barnett be sentenced to 32 years in prison and fined $10,000. A judge will sentence Barnett in April. The Tulsa World reports video and audio evidence presented to the jury showed the process server just flashed legal documents at Barnett, who kept his front door closed while they spoke. Defense attorney Jason Lollman said he plans to appeal and believes the sentencing recommendation was too harsh.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has reached an agreement with private health insurance companies to waive co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for Oregonians who undergo testing for COVID-19 at a facility that’s within their insurance network, Gov. Kate Brown announced. The agreement also will apply to a vaccine for the virus if one becomes available, she said in a statement Thursday. The state is pursuing the same agreement with self-insured health plans and also seeking clarification from the federal government about exceptions to cost-sharing for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as health savings account-eligible high-deductible health plans, she said. “No one should have to ask if getting a COVID-19 test is something they can afford. I hope this agreement sets a framework that other states can follow nationwide,” Brown said in the statement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEphrata: A small family-owned pharmacy chain is closing its five central Pennsylvania stores after a 141-year run. Royer Pharmacy in Lancaster County calls itself one of the oldest continuously operating independent pharmacies in the nation. It’s been operated by two families since a young pharmacist named George Royer bought the business in 1879. Company officials cited the age of the owners and decreasing insurance reimbursements that made it difficult to remain in business. “It’s been a great run,” Royer President Donald Sherman said in a news release. Royer said patient files will be transferred to CVS after the stores close by March 18, and employees would be considered for jobs at the nationwide chain. Royer had locations in Ephrata, Lancaster, Akron and Leola.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s highest court has refused to hear a strip club’s appeal of a punishment the city had levied against it over allegations of prostitution. The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Wild Zebra’s bid to have its adult entertainment license restored. The court did not explain why it would not consider the appeal. The Providence Board of Licenses heard testimony in January from two detectives who said that while undercover at the Wild Zebra Gentlemen’s Club in May dancers offered to have sex with them or perform sexual acts on them in exchange for money. The club denies the allegations of prostitution. An attorney for the club didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Providence Journal. The Providence board stripped the Wild Zebra of its liquor and adult entertainment licenses. A state regulatory department gave the club its liquor license back while it pursues its appeal, but it has remained closed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With spring just around the corner, emergency officials in the state say it’s time to begin preparing for severe weather. Gov. Henry McMaster declared this week South Carolina Severe Weather and Flood Safety week. Emergency officials will work all week with the National Weather Service to give safety and preparation tips for floods, tornadoes and severe storms that became more likely as the weather warms. On Wednesday, there will be a statewide tornado drill as schools and businesses across the state are asked to take shelter under their tornado safety plans and as forecasters test weather radios and other devices programmed to go off when a tornado warning is issued. Emergency officials are also pushing for flood safety. Flash floods after massive rains in October 2015 killed 19 people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State wildlife officials have decided to scale back Gov. Kristi Noem’s program that pays bounties for predators that raid migratory birds’ nests. KELO-TV reports the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission voted 6-2 on Friday to extend the program for a second year. But the commission reduced the spending cap from $500,000 to $250,000. It also reduced the size of the bounty from $10 per tail from a raccoon, striped skunk, opossum, red fox or badger to $5 per tail. Bounties will now be paid regardless of whether the predator is shot or trapped; last year bounties applied only if a predator was trapped. The program starts April 1 and runs through July 1. Only South Dakota residents can participate. Chairman Gary Jensen and Mary Anne Boyd were the only two commissioners who voted against continuing the program. Jensen said science doesn’t support the program, and it’s designed to help trappers, whom he says are doing well anyway.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to move toxin-laden coal ash from a retired plant in the city to an off-site landfill, at the cost of roughly $300 million, the federal utility said Friday. TVA is considering six landfills in the South after it decided to move 3.5 million cubic yards of coal ash – the byproduct of burning coal for power – from the old Allen Fossil Plant in south Memphis, rather than keep the material in place. The TVA said it prefers taking the coal ash to an offsite landfill rather than moving it to a processing facility because construction and operation of the facility would delay economic development of the Allen site and lead to issues with air and noise emissions, safety risks and public disruption, the TVA said in an environmental impact report. Removal would cost about $300 million and take about seven to 10 years, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said.\n\nTexas\n\nSanta Fe: A teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a high school in 2018 was able to buy more than 100 rounds of ammunition online because his age was not verified, according to a lawsuit alleging the website involved broke federal law. Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a 17-year-old junior at the time of the May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School. Federal law prohibits minors from purchasing handgun ammunition and bars licensed gun companies from selling handgun or shotgun ammunition to minors or anyone they have reason to believe is under the age of 21. According to an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Pagourtzis initially ordered 50 rounds of hollow-point handgun ammunition and 105 rounds of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition, the Houston Chronicle reports. Two weeks later, he purchased an additional 35 rounds of shotgun ammunition – both times from the website Luckygunner.com that did not require him to make an account, submit proof of age or set-up a secure two-step authorization, the filing said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A slimmed-down version of a measure to require warning labels on pornography passed the state Senate on Friday. The proposal would now mandate a one-sentence warning label for online or print material deemed legally obscene, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. A relatively small slice of porn is considered obscene, but that hardcore material has fewer constitutional protections. The label would say that “exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.” A website could also embed in its metadata the searchable text, “utahobscenitywarning.” The porn industry has objected to the plan, saying it could have constitutional problems and open the floodgates for lawsuits. If it does not appear on a print publication or is not displayed for 15 seconds online, producers could be fined $2,500 for each civil violation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three out of about a dozen Vermont towns passed resolutions on Town Meeting Day to become Second Amendment “sanctuary” towns, supporting gun rights and opposing more state and federal gun control laws, organizers said. About a half-dozen towns where the resolution was proposed did not take up the measure on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday because officials did not feel it was appropriate for the setting, said Eric Davis, president of Gun Rights Vermont. Lowell, Eden and Whittingham passed the resolution, he said. The town of Barton rejected the proposal. The voice vote Tuesday was close, Town Clerk Kristin Atwood told the Caledonian Record. Select boards in the towns of Holland and Pittsford adopted the resolution to become sanctuary towns earlier this year. The resolutions are not legally binding.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Three black astronauts joined hundreds of other mourners Saturday at a memorial service for pioneering African American mathematician and NASA researcher Katherine Johnson. Johnson, who calculated rocket trajectories and Earth orbits for NASA’s early space missions and was later portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” about pioneering black female aerospace workers, died Feb. 24 at the age of 101. More than 700 people turned out for Saturday’s memorial service at the Hampton University Convocation Center. “I think about the journey that she’s going on now,” astronaut Leland Melvin said. “We can’t calculate the speed that she’s traveling to get to heaven.” Melvin was joined by fellow astronauts Yvonne Cagle and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space. Johnson was remembered not just as a pioneering researcher but as a faithful church leader and family matriarch. “Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited,” grandson Michael Moore said. “And because of you, I have no bounds.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has become the 10th to prohibit homicide defendants from claiming a defense based on panic over a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Thursday. It takes effect in June. Nine other states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have already banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington state measure is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reports. It was approved with bipartisan support in the state House and the Senate, though some lawmakers questioned if the legislation was necessary since a panic defense has never been used in Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents who adopt children with special needs may soon get more money under a wide-ranging proposal passed Friday by the state Senate to reduce the state’s overburdened foster system. Senators voted unanimously to approve the proposal. It now moves back to the House of Delegates for that chamber to approve the Senate’s amendments. The measure directs state officials to expand a tiered system that would give higher payments to people who take in children with emotional, behavioral or intellectual problems. It sets aside $16.9 million for the payment system. The tiered system would have to be up and running by July 2021. Child-placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago may stay open after all. The board of the School of Architecture at Taliesin announced in January that the school would close in June because the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the school’s biggest financial supporter, had failed to come up with a way to keep the school open. The foundation said then that the school lacked a sustainable business model. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the board voted Thursday to keep the school open in light of new funding. The decision to remain open is still subject to approval by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The foundation issued a statement Friday saying it has little information about the new funding sources. Board Chairman Dan Schweiker said new supporters have come forward.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Jackson Hole’s largest elk herd is thriving and appears to have grown slightly over the past year after hunters had a historically tough time finding animals and filling tags. Wyoming Game and Fish Department harvest data for 2019 estimates that 794 hunters who targeted zones roamed by the Jackson Elk Herd found success and filled their freezer, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “That’s about half of what it normally is,” Game and Fish wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch said. “Usually, there’s more like 1,500 or 1,600 elk harvested, both bulls and cows.” The 30-year average harvest in the Jackson Herd is 2,098 elk, though the kill hasn’t surpassed 2,000 since the early 2000s – when the herd size started shrinking by design. Fall 2019 elk hunts were slow across the board.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/09"}]}

Cars, seafood, electronics and holiday goods are among the other products that may be squeezed in a port strike.\n\nFlashback:Wilmington is port of call for a world of fruit\n\nPort operators blame the union for the standoff and have filed a complaint over what they allege is a bad-faith break in negotiations. The union calls this a \"publicity stunt\" and says what's at stake is both fair wages and an existential threat to jobs in the form of artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nHere's what we know about the looming labor strike at the East Coast's largest ports.\n\nWhen is the contract deadline and how likely is a strike?\n\nThe union and port operator group the United States Maritime Alliance must reach an agreement by midnight Monday to avoid a walkout.\n\nOtherwise, the ILA has said it's prepared to strike.\n\nBoth sides are publicly playing hardball, and it's not clear an agreement is near. The Maritime Alliance representing port operators filed a complaint on Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the union had illegally broken off negotiations.\n\nThe two sides have reportedly not met in person since June after the ILA said they discovered that a port gate in Mobile, Alabama, had violated the current ILA agreement by using automated technology to process trucks without union workers.\n\nBut the union publicly derided at the notion they were the ones negotiating in bad faith and called the port operators' labor complaint part of a \"weak publicity campaign designed to fool the American public.\" Union president Harold Daggett said in September he fields \"low-ball\" offers from the port operators \"several times each week.\"\n\nHe began warning of a potential strike as early as July.\n\n\"As we get closer to our contract deadline, you may hear more about the possibility of a strike,\" wrote Daggett's son, union vice president Dennis Daggett, in a July statement. \"We want you to know that we are doing everything in our power to reach a fair agreement without disrupting the flow of goods you rely on. But in all honesty, we are prepared to stand up for what is right, even if it means taking drastic measures.\"\n\nWhat are workers asking for in a new contract?\n\nIn part, the usual thing: money.\n\nWorkers at East Coast ports have noted publicly that they are ill-paid compared with their counterparts on the West Coast, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Under the latest West Coast contract, longshoremen top out at a reported base pay of nearly $55 an hour, compared with $39 an hour for East Coast employees, according to the contract set to expire Oct. 1.\n\nUnion president Daggett has signaled his union is seeking a $5 increase in hourly rate each year, over the six-year life of the contract.\n\nUnlike the West Coast port workers' union, the ILA is also holding out against automated technologies already in use at West Coast ports. Safeguards against automation that threatens jobs are one of the main public sticking points in ILA negotiations with port operators.\n\n\"We will never allow automation to come into our union and try to put us out of work as long as I’m alive,\" said union president Daggett in a July statement.\n\nAt the Port of Wilmington, workers for multiple unions serving the port told nonprofit news organization Spotlight Delaware that hours and jobs had been cut since port operator Enstructure took over the port in 2023.\n\nHow is Wilmington's port responding to a potential strike?\n\nOfficials from port operator Enstructure didn't devote much time to a potential strike in their public report to Delaware's Diamond State Port Corp. on Friday. Instead, they touted the port's success at bringing in expanded port shipments since taking over port operations in July 2023 – and in handling the increased ship traffic after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore this spring.\n\nHowever, Enstructure has begun preparations for a potential work stoppage, according to spokespeople.\n\n\"Over the next few days, Port Wilmington is preparing for a possible work stoppage impacting major ports on the East and Gulf Coasts beginning on Tuesday, October 1,\" reads a statement from the company. \"Port Wilmington will continue to operate business as usual until the potential work stoppage. If an ILA strike occurs, we will continue to provide support services for our customers until regular operations resume.\"\n\nWhat products would be affected by an East Coast port strike?\n\nThe ILA has said its workers will continue to handle all military ship traffic, and that cruise ships would also not be affected by a strike. As storm clouds began to gather, retailers such as Costco have also been scrambling to expedite shipments.\n\nBut broad swaths of the economy would likely be drastically snarled up by a lasting East Coast port strike, according to industry observers – particularly among holiday goods that have yet to arrive on these shores.\n\n“A supply chain disruption would undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and would impact consumers’ ability to find the toys they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead,” Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,\" UCLA professor and supply chain expert Chris Tang told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nElectronics, like cellphones and computers, now come from Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, according to Tang.\n\nPharmaceuticals. Though air shipping is possible, drug shortages may result if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so, Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. East Coast ports surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, according to Michigan State University's Jason Miller. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations that call the First State home.

One increased the number of required parking spaces off the street for homes designed with more than three toilets; a five-toilet home, for example, would need to shoehorn four parking spaces onto its lot. The commissioners chose to delay a vote on that toilet-parking nexus until August at the earliest.\n\nThe second ordinance contained a laundry list of tweaks to the zoning code to increase rear-yard setbacks, require more green space in front yards and cap the size of residential homes at 6,000 square feet in some zones and 4,500 square feet in others. That ordinance passed in a 6-1 vote, with Commissioner Kathy McGuiness voting no.\n\nWith the ordinance passed, 50 percent of the area in lots where new or vastly remodeled homes are sited in Rehoboth will have to remain natural and unbuilt – lawns, trees, garden beds. The previous requirement had been for 40 percent of lots to have natural cover.\n\n\"We will be making changes to it,\" Commissioner Bill Sargent said of the ordinance. \"But in total it is so much better than what we have today.\"\n\nMayor Sam Cooper and some other commissioners say they have been implored to act by residents concerned about large groups of renters, noise around outdoor pools, and parking crunches. Supporters of the ordinances urged the commissioners to approve both of them, calling them the natural culmination of months of work to manage development trends in Rehoboth.\n\n\"They're nice houses owned by nice people, but sometimes you'll see 15 cars parked in front of them,\" said John Hughes, 74, a lifelong Rehoboth Beach resident, of the bulked-up homes in his neighborhood. \"I think that's destructive to our neighborhood values. I think that's short-term prosperity at the expense of long-term prosperity. We've got something here; don't give it away to speculators. They don't look past the next sale.\"\n\nPeople who spoke critically of the ordinances, meanwhile, said the commissioners were blind to the real-world impacts of the changes they would bring.\n\n\"You're taking porches away; you're taking patios away. People are going to give up what they're not sleeping, eating and bathing in,\" said Brian Barry, a contractor who builds houses in Rehoboth.\n\nIf the laws passed, Barry said during the public hearing, clients wanting six-bedroom homes would come to settle on boxy designs with driveways on both sides of the property.\n\n\"Why are we being forced to build something that is unattractive?\" Barry said. \"It's a foolish ordinance.\"\n\nA homeowner of 22 years, Barbara Collins, said she had been working with a designer for a year on a five-bed, four-and-a-half-bath home to replace her cottage, built in 1904. The planned home would look modest – \"it's not a McMansion,\" she told the commissioners – and her property would have a bigger backyard than it does now.\n\nBut because Rehoboth staff could not approve building permits for homes that would violate the proposed zoning laws once they had been introduced for possible passage, Collins said, her plans have been sidelined. \"Three weeks ago it would have passed in a heartbeat. Now I've wasted a year with my designer and $13,000,\" Collins said.\n\nShe urged the commissioners to vote down the zoning changes; more than a dozen other people who spoke up at the meeting urged the same, in the name of preserving property rights.\n\nBut a Stockley Street resident, Lou Boghosian, who spoke in favor of the zoning ordinances, said they were a needed check against the influence of property investors, whom some accused of building \"mini-hotels\" in the guise of houses.\n\n\"They want to protect their portfolios. We want to protect the character of Rehoboth Beach,\" Boghosian said.\n\nContact James Fisher at (302) 983-6772, on Twitter @JamesFisherTNJ or jfisher@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2024/02/15/wilmington-airport-gets-millions-from-faa-to-expand-terminal/72614220007/", "title": "Wilmington Airport gets $5.6 million from FAA to expand terminal", "text": "Wilmington Airport received $5.6 million in federal infrastructure funding to update and expand its terminal, according to an announcement from the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday morning.\n\nThe money comes as part of a nearly $1 billion investment in airports across the country, spanning 114 airports in 44 states and three territories. As part of the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden administration had pledged to hand out $5 billion over five years as part of its Airport Terminals Program, designed to \"address the aging infrastructure of the nation’s airports.\"\n\nThe money was hailed by Delaware Sen. Tom Carper as a \"win-win for Delawareans and our economy.”\n\nHis counterpart, Sen. Chris Coons, called it \"part of a string of successes for air travel in Delaware.”\n\nThe Wilmington Airport had missed out on two previous rounds of federal airport funding, according to Stephen Williams, director of airports for the Delaware River and Bay Authority, the bistate agency that manages Wilmington Airport.\n\n\"Third time's the charm,\" he said earlier this month when asked how he liked Wilmington's chances for federal funding in 2024.\n\nHe wasn't wrong, apparently.\n\nThe grant will help expand service at the airport and will support 60 temporary construction jobs, as well as up to 100 jobs with commercial carriers at the airport, according to a letter of support sent to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttegieg in October by Delaware's congressional delegation of Coons, Carper and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.\n\nAirport expansion:Here are the details on Wilmington Airport's ambitious $13 million expansion plans\n\nFederal money will fund Wilmington Airport terminal expansion\n\nThe $5.6 million in federal money will help fund an ambitious terminal expansion at Wilmington Airport beginning this year, one that would expand the passenger boarding area's footprint by 6,000 square feet and upgrade onsite facilities such as bathrooms.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal first reported the details of these plans in early February.\n\n“I’m pleased to see the Delaware River and Bay Authority receive this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law grant to expand the terminal at the Wilmington Airport,” said Gov. John Carney of the funding. “This will allow the airport to be able to handle more than one flight at a time.\"\n\nThe DRBA, banking on receiving at least some federal funding, had already allotted about $2 million of its 2024 budget and $6.6 million overall toward terminal expansion plans.\n\nThe federal money will provide half the anticipated project costs, according to DRBA spokesperson James Salmon, for ambitious plans that include 6,000 square feet for passenger holding and boarding area, additional TSA screening, expansions to airport concessions, restroom and baggage upgrades and additional boarding capacity for airplanes.\n\nCurrently, Wilmington Airport can allow only one plane to board and depart at a given time, meaning flights must be scheduled 90 minutes apart. This also limits the airport to a single carrier, which has led to wildly swinging fortunes for the airport as airlines came and went over the years.\n\n“We’re talking about the footprint of this 1955 building that has never changed,\" said DRBA's Williams in early February. \"We've never improved its capacity.”\n\nWork will begin as early as this year, said Salmon at the DRBA.\n\nThe DRBA will also spend about $3 million this year demolishing a Quality Inn & Suites Skyways hotel and vacant restaurant on airport lands, adding additional parking and potential future amenities such as car rentals or retail. These funds came from airport revenues, said Williams in early February, including the sale of airport land to Citibank in 2021.\n\nPassenger and plane capacity is a new issue for an airport that has seen vast expansions in commercial passenger service over the past year. Parking lots filled over the holiday season, and the airport has broken record after record for air service at the airport, after Avelo Airlines began service in February 2023. Avelo completed more than 2,100 flights and flew nearly 286,000 passengers to Puerto Rico or states in the American South during its first 12 months, according to DRBA numbers.\n\nIn the meantime, New Castle County and the DRBA appear near a deal for another 30-year lease.\n\nMoney received for Philadelphia and other regional airports\n\nThe funding for Wilmington Airport is part of a national push to modernize regional airports, though larger airports received larger individual rewards.\n\nAround the region, the Philadelphia airport received $74.4 million that will go toward energy-saving upgrades to the airport's HVAC system, as well as construction or renovation of dozens of restrooms that will amount to 13,000 square feet of new restroom space, including gender-neutral restrooms. Other facilities, like lactation rooms and service animal facilities, are also part of the funding.\n\nThe Harrisburg airport will receive $13 million to upgrade its baggage handling system, while the airport in Lancaster will get $2.7 million to expand its passenger screening and waiting area. Atlantic City's airport will net $4.8 million for the construction of two boarding bridges.\n\nFederal officials also touted the jobs that come along with infrastructure upgrades.\n\n“Today’s funding not only helps modernize airports to meet the needs of travelers today and for years to come but also creates good-paying job opportunities in communities both large and small,” saidFAA Associate Administrator for Airports, Shannetta R. Griffin.\n\nIn a statement, DRBA executive director Thomas Cook thanked Delaware's congressional delegation for helping secure Wilmington's share of the funding and pledged a first-time amenity for Wilmington Airport passengers, a TSA pre-check lane.\n\n\"We also appreciate the passionate assistance of Governor Carney and New Castle County Executive Meyer who helped us get over the hump with their strong backing of the grant submission,\" Cook wrote.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all the things that touch land and money.

Total recommendations across positions would reach about $232 million over four years.\n\nLast week, lawmakers got to dig in.\n\nMembers of House and Senate Education Committees called attention to local school district responsibility, meeting jointly last Thursday afternoon, while expressing concerns that all districts could foot the bill lined out in Public Education Compensation Committee's report. This comes as the state would be responsible for 70% of the salary swells, while districts handle the remaining 30%. Members also discussed increasing incentives within the process.\n\nDEEPER:Delaware lawmakers are headed back to Dover. Here's what they're focusing on in 2024\n\nThe recommendations come across education jobs, with pay adjustments that bump salaries with annual raises and stipends. Teachers and professional staff could see a 2% increase plus a $1,875 stipend, while paraprofessionals see a 1% increase and stipends ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. More examples, from food service to IT, fill the committee report.\n\n\"We anticipate that when the Governor’s recommended budget comes out in just a few weeks that some of this will possibly be addressed,” said Secretary of Education Mark Holodick as he presented the report.\n\nThe hope is to see Delaware regionally competitive, meeting ongoing efforts to strengthen an educator pipeline. Lawmakers can accept some, all or none of the report's points.\n\nGov. John Carney is expected to announce his budget plans this month.\n\nDelaware State, Wilmington University land millions from the Longwood Foundation\n\nThe Longwood Foundation calls itself a catalyst for nonprofits.\n\nBy the end of last year, its grantees in education included Wilmington University and Delaware State University affiliates — with gifts totaling nearly $4 million combined.\n\nFor Delaware's HBCU, that includes the Delaware State University Foundation's receiving $1.75 million to support the expansion of the Department of Nursing, according to Longwood's announcement, aimed at growing the number of nursing and allied health graduates.\n\nStill down in Dover, Longwood awarded $1.2 million toward \"Braven,\" helping to launch student-support programming at Delaware State. Braven partners with colleges, universities, and employers aiming to offer a \"career-accelerating experience\" through a credit-bearing college course and a post-course opportunity after graduation.\n\nWilmington University saw $1 million given to support the expansion of its Brandywine Campus.

From there, they cycled through Europe, Turkey and Kazakhstan, sometimes flying to make connections.\n\nThe couple had planned on biking through eastern Asia before heading back to the Americas but never got a chance. On July 29, they and two others were killed in an attack that has since been attributed to the Islamic State, according to media reports.\n\nThey were part of a group of seven cyclists hit by a car.

Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful and kind. No greater revelation has come from our journey than this.\"\n\nThe couple's last post, on July 11, was from Kyrgyzstan.\n\nBefore the trip, Austin worked for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Originally from New York, he studied international relations at UD before getting his master's degree from Georgetown University.\n\nHe managed to earn his bachelor's in just two years.\n\n“I initially did not think he could do it,” his former adviser Alice Ba told UDaily, the university's online news source.\n\n“But of course, I soon knew better,\" said the political science and international relations professor. \"Jay was always so very, very prepared. He consulted with me constantly. He brought spreadsheets, plans and prospects. He checked and double checked.

He embraced his experiences, clearly to the very end — on the road, exploring the world and what it had to offer. May his spirit triumph over the worst among us.”\n\nAustin was also a minimalist, who believed in environmental sustainability. He and his 140-square-foot \"tiny house\" were featured in the Netflix documentary \"Minimalism.\"\n\nOn official documents and applications, he referred to his occupation simply as “real human being.”\n\nGeoghegan, who grew up in California, studied government, Spanish and Arabic at Georgetown University and interned twice with U.S. Rep.

She said Austin always thought that getting hit on his bike on his way to work would be a far greater tragedy than failing to pursue his dreams and getting injured that way.\n\nThe couple did make trips to the hospital, were ill and were hit by cars on the trip, but aware of the dangers he was facing, Austin wrote his will before he left, requesting that no suits or ties be worn to his funeral, Santovasco told UDaily.\n\n\"I knew there was a very good chance I'd get a call,\" she said in an interview with The News Journal Friday, knowing how dangerous it could be for two \"skinny white kids\" to traverse the globe.\n\n\"But I never thought terrorism,\" she said. \"That just wasn't on my scope. I thought maybe they'd fall off their bikes, or they'd be victims of robbery.\"\n\nShe still can't believe that they're gone.\n\n\"I can't wrap my head around it,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"The more time that goes by, the more real it becomes.\"\n\nShe's hoping their passion won't be forgotten.

Flood warnings were in effect Friday morning.\n\nMore snow accumulation is expected before puttering out Friday night; the National Weather Service predicted 2 more inches as of 6:35 p.m. The agency warned drivers about slippery conditions.\n\nPower outages\n\nHigh-velocity winds, blowing as high as 70 mph, have cut power for about 180,000 Delmarva Power customers in the region, a company press release said.\n\nThe electric company has activated its Emergency Response Organization to restore service as safely and quickly as possible.\n\nElectrical lines and equipment have been damaged by falling trees and tree limbs, the company said. Restoration is suspended until crews can assess the damage.\n\nDelmarva Power recommends customers to prepare for outages with the following tips:\n\nHave a flashlight with fresh batteries on each floor of your home.\n\nHave a supply of bottled water and easy-to-prepare, nonperishable foods available.\n\nCharge cellphones and other mobile devices.\n\nTo report downed power lines and outages, call (800) 898-8042.\n\nSTORM:Airlines cancel 2,200+ flights as nor'easter snarls travel\n\nProperty damage\n\nA 75-foot tree fell on a neighboring house in the first block of Cherokee Drive in Ogletown damaged it.\n\nIn Maryland, high winds damaged the Days Inn Ocean City Oceanfront, on Baltimore Avenue near 23rd Street. The hotel had noticeable damage Friday afternoon, with a gaping hole exposing the inside stairwell.\n\nAffected roads\n\nThe Delaware Emergency Management Agency said its Emergency Operations Center is at an \"enhanced activation level\" due to weather conditions. The state Department of Transportation lowered the speed limit on I-495 from 65 to 55 mph because of the weather, and the state warned drivers about downed trees, branches, and power lines statewide.\n\nThe speed limit on I-495 has been reduced from 65 mph to 55 mph.\n\nAnother downed tree and wires in the road have also closed the Del. 1 exit ramp to Del. 299.\n\nThe department also said Centerville Road is closed between Hillside Road and Barley Mill Road due to multiple trees down.\n\nCecil County Sheriff's Office has issued an alert warning people to avoid driving apart from a medical emergency. The alert also stated that Hatem and 95 bridges remain closed and the situation will not improve for several hours.\n\nImpacted locals\n\nAnd trains weren't the only business impacted by the storm. Men like Mike Hunter, who works in roofing and siding, said the weather prevents them from getting work done.\n\n\"Business is pushed back,\" he said. \"A roof was supposed to get done today now it won’t get done until Monday or Tuesday.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can’t have anybody on the roof today because of the wind. It’s too dangerous.\"\n\nSea level shifts\n\nDelaware is also under a coastal flood warning until 2 a.m. Sunday. Surges could reach up to 1 foot Friday and another 2½ feet Saturday.\n\nAt sea, there is a storm warning, with wind speeds expected to be between 28 and 40 mph, increasing to 34 to 46 mph with gusts as high as 69 mph.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted waves could reach up to 7 feet Friday and 12 feet Saturday. Erosion is expected.\n\nFarther down the coast, the search for a downed plane off Assateague Island has been halted due to high winds. Dive teams at the site were successful in recovering a body at about 5 p.m. Thursday but then suspended the search at 6 p.m., according to Maryland State Police. The body recovered appears to have been the pilot, according to police.\n\nThe weather is expected to improve Saturday, with highs in the upper 40s that will remain into the coming days. Saturday's forecast also includes some sunshine, but remain partially cloudy, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Snow and rain is subsiding tonight, as well as instead of winds up to 50mph like today, they will only get up to 40 to 45 mph,\" Joe Miketta, a weather service meteorologist said.\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

Williams took office in January 2013. Winfrey-Brown, like every other new city employee, has to live in Wilmington, according to an ordinance first adopted in 1974. As finance director, she serves on a city review board responsible for enforcing Wilmington's residency requirement for new employees.\n\nBut last Tuesday night, she answered the door of her Bear home, where she and her husband live.\n\n\"I meet my residency requirements,\" Winfrey-Brown said while standing in the doorway as the family dog peeked around her left leg at visitors. \"I'm in the city typically Monday through Friday, and I'm in Newark on the weekends.\"\n\nThe next evening, Winfrey-Brown walked into her daughter's residence on West 25th Street in Wilmington after a long day that included teaching bible study class after work. This is the home she declares as her Wilmington residence to comply with the law that requires new city employees who don't live in the city to make their move within six months of being hired. Employees can seek a six-month extension if they run into problems, such as difficulty selling their home.\n\nA property records search by The News Journal shows that some of the top city staff who came in with Williams own houses outside the city. But they argue they fulfill the city's residency law because they list another home in Wilmington as a residence.\n\nOther top city staff who came in with Williams and who own family homes outside Wilmington are cultural affairs director Kenneth Briscoe and city solicitor Michael Migliore. Briscoe owns a house on the 500 block of Bluebill Drive in New Castle, while Migliore owns a house on Stoney Run Road north of the city, according to property records.\n\nMayoral spokeswoman Alexandra Coppadge said Winfrey-Brown and other top managers hired by Williams comply with the city's residency requirements. They can meet the law's terms by owning a home, renting or staying at a residence owned by someone else in Wilmington, Coppadge said.\n\n\"To date, the city's Personnel Department has not received any evidence or complaints that the aforementioned individuals have not met the residency requirement,\" Coppadge wrote in an email response.\n\nCity employees are free to own or rent multiple homes, but the personnel department considers their residence to be the home the employee lives in most of the time, she said. Employees, however, can only declare one home as their residence when they file their annual residency declarations with the city, she said.\n\nSome council members don't think the living arrangements made by some of the mayor's top brass fulfill the residency requirement. Councilwoman Loretta Walsh said owning a house outside the city while claiming a city address is \"skirting\" the law.\n\n\"If four or five employees move in together, rent a house or sign a lease and then go back home, I think it's actually a flagrant misuse of the law,\" she said. \"I think it's manipulating the law to suit you.\"\n\nFor Winfrey-Brown, selling her Bear home when she got her Wilmington job was not an option.\n\n\"My husband and I have been married 25 years. He's retired and he did not want to move to the city,\" she said.\n\nShe said she returned to her Bear home Tuesday night to check on her dog because her husband was out of town.\n\n\"I cleared everything with HR. I cleared everything with internal audit,\" she said. \"Every one of my neighbors can tell you, I'm not typically here during the week.\"\n\nDefining residency\n\nUntil the late 1990s, anyone hired by the city had to live in Wilmington. The law was later amended and now mandates new hires to live in the city for five years.\n\nWinfrey-Brown, who uses the Wilmington house owned by her daughter as the address on her voter registration and driver's license, said she stays in Wilmington on weekdays and usually returns to Bear on weekends.\n\nWinfrey-Brown said she and her husband didn't want to give up their home.\n\n\"I'll be retired in five years,\" she said. \"I'm in Newark on weekends, I'm in Wilmington on the weekends, I'm in New Castle on the weekends. I'm all over Delaware on the weekends.\"\n\nFormer Mayor Jim Baker said renting an apartment or staying with a relative in Wilmington while owning a house outside the city \"doesn't count\" as meeting the residency law.\n\n\"It's actually a secondary residence,\" he said. \"Now, if you owned a house outside the city and rented it out to someone and had an apartment or townhouse in the city, then that's OK.\"\n\nBaker said if employees can show their house outside of Wilmington is not their primary residence, then they would comply with the residency law.\n\n\"But you just can't say, 'I rent a house in Wilmington … but I own a house outside, and my wife and children live there.' That's not sufficient grounds for residency,\" he said.\n\nA tough market\n\nBriscoe, Wilmington's cultural affairs director, was reached at his New Castle home on a Wednesday evening. He said he also stays at a house his mother owns on the 300 block of West 39th Street in Wilmington.\n\nBriscoe said he visits his New Castle home a few times a week to check on his wife and son before returning to his mother's house in Wilmington to sleep.\n\n\"It was tough on my wife, but she was like, 'Listen. You got to do what you got to do. You took the job, you got to owe up to the obligation,'\" he said.\n\nAmong other challenges, Briscoe said the housing market has made it tough for him to move his family to Wilmington.\n\n\"I do have plans to officially move, but until we can get this house out of the market, with the market the way it is, we just can't,\" Briscoe said last week.\n\nMigliore acknowledged last week that he owns the home on Stoney Run outside the city, but he also uses an address on Barrett Street in Wilmington. He declined to comment further on his residency.\n\nAn issue unaddressed\n\nTonya Richardson took a job with the city in the fall, now working on the public relations and media team with Coppadge. On a Wednesday evening, she was approached at her parent's home on Windflower Drive in Milltown, an address she listed on a recent voter registration as her primary residence.\n\nShe said she was visiting her parents for a belated Father's Day gathering, and now lives at an apartment in Wilmington.\n\nA more recent voter registration lists an address for Richardson at an apartment on the 200 block of North Market Street.\n\nCouncilman Mike Brown said he also is concerned that some of the city's top officials don't live in Wilmington as required. Brown said he's heard of other city employees who don't meet the residency requirement.\n\nHe said he tried to address the issue last year but couldn't get enough support from council to initiate a review of residency for employees who may not meet the law.\n\n\"We have had one or two people who quit because they didn't conform to residency,\" Brown said.\n\nEconomically questionable\n\nBaker disagrees with the current residency requirement of five years because it doesn't make economic sense for someone who lives minutes away from Wilmington to uproot their lives for the brief period.\n\n\"Why would I want to buy a house for five years, or rent this place for five years?\" Baker said. \"How do you make these economic choices in a five-year period? I don't think people will buy a home under the circumstances they're in. Then a lot of people will just get a place and say, 'Let me call this my permanent residence.'\"\n\nBaker said the residency law was initially enacted to soften the effects of suburban sprawl on Wilmington during the latter part of the 20th century. He said leaders at the time wanted to keep its employees in Wilmington to help keep the city from stagnating.\n\n\"It was saving the city from losing a lot of people to the suburbs. It was basically economic,\" Baker said. \"People were saying, 'Geez, we're paying them and they move outside the city. They're not even paying taxes.'\"\n\nBut Baker said he thinks the city will consider removing the residency law in the future. He said it's hurt the administration's ability to grab the best talent.\n\nBaker said the problems city leaders worried about in the 1970s are much less evident now. He said Wilmington has been able to maintain its economy through developments, such as the apartment and condominiums on the Riverfront.\n\nBrown said he's considering asking council to review the residencies of certain employees by calling them in for a hearing.\n\n\"And be prepared to show me, or show committee, that you live where you say you live at,\" he said. \"Don't tell me you live with your brother, your momma's house. Tell me where you get your mail at. Tell me where you wake up in the morning at. Show me a driver's license, a utility bill with your name on it.\"\n\nWalsh said it's important for city employees to follow the residency requirement.\n\n\"If you live where you work, nine out of 10 times, you're doing everything there. You're spending your money there, sending your children to school there. You're part of the community,\" she said.\n\nCouncilman Bud Freel said he's not sure if owning a home outside the city and staying in Wilmington during the week breaks the residency law. He said he's not saying that city employees can't own a home outside the city and rent an apartment in Wilmington.\n\n\"I don't know if there's a definition of living, to be honest,\" Freel said. \"If I thought they were working and living in the city all week long, then staying with family on the weekend, that might meet the requirement.\"\n\nContact Yann Ranaivo at (302) 324-2837, yranaivo@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @YannRanaivo.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/10/26/wilmington-delaware-residency-law-city-council-vote/71299412007/", "title": "Wilmington's residency law is up for vote again by city council Monday", "text": "Recent efforts by Mayor Mike Purzycki's administration to remove the five-year residency requirement completely was met with pushback by some council members and city residents.\n\nA vote to remove the residency law was tabled at a recent council meeting, prompting a new ordinance to be drafted that would keep the five-year requirement.\n\nThe new proposal would keep the residency requirement and establish a residency working group to find ways for residents to fill job vacancies and help financially assist with moving expenses.\n\nCouncil members will meet in committee beginning at 6 p.m. Monday to discuss the new ordinance.\n\nEditor's Note: Wilmington City Councilperson Chris Johnson is no longer a co-sponsor of the residency legislation proposed by council member Shane Darby.

A special meeting of the full council will follow immediately after.\n\nGET INFORMATION ABOUT MONDAY'S MEETING\n\nCity leaders, residents at odds on residency law\n\nWilmington’s residency law was targeted for removal during a recent City Council meeting, but action was tabled after dozens of residents came out in opposition to the law’s removal.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki’s administration said the residency requirement has “undermined the efficiency” of government and prevented the city from filling critical jobs.\n\nBACKGROUND:Why Wilmington is looking to remove residency requirements for new employees\n\nThe administration and proponents of the law’s removal argued new hires can’t find affordable housing in Wilmington and, in many cases, aren’t willing to relocate families, thus removing the residency requirement would open the applicant pool.\n\nProponents of the law’s removal say the residency requirement has “undermined the efficiency” of government and prevented Wilmington from filling critical jobs.\n\nThose in favor of the law, however, say requiring employees to live in the city increases loyalty among those employees, enhances the community’s tax base, fosters better community relations and preserves the “character and quality of life” that Wilmington residents value.\n\nMany residents also pointed to the 2,100 unemployed city residents who could fill the 92 job vacancies facing the city. Those vacancies span multiple departments from police officers and sanitation workers to engineers and planners.\n\nCompromise to residency removal\n\nCouncilmembers Vincent White, Zanthia Oliver and Darby, along with Council President Ernest “Trippi” Congo, had gathered outside City Hall prior to the council meeting to warn residents of the law’s impending removal and urge colleagues to postpone any action and come up with a compromise.\n\nRELATED:Wilmington council tables vote on ordinance that would remove residency law for new hires\n\nIt wasn’t until after roughly three hours of public comment that the ordinance’s sponsor, councilperson Al Mills, decided to table the legislation to allow for further discussion.\n\nDarby’s legislation represents a whole new ordinance amendment that affirms the five-year residency requirement, establishes the city’s boundaries and outlines the formation of a residency working group.\n\nThe working group will include nine members, three of them appointed by the mayor and the rest by the council president. Working group members will consist of one person from the human resources department, one from the administration and three from the public who live in the “geographical boundaries of the city.”\n\nThe group will identify ways for residents to fill vacancies; create incentives to move into Wilmington; and find ways to ease the financial burdens for renting and buying in the city, according to the ordinance.

Therefore, removing the residency requirement would open the applicant pool.\n\nThose in favor of the law, however, say requiring employees to live in the city increases loyalty among those employees, enhances the community’s tax base, fosters better community relations and preserves the “character and quality of life” that Wilmington residents value.\n\nRELATED:Why Wilmington is looking to remove residency requirements for new employees\n\nWhat the ordinances say\n\nDarby’s ordinance affirms a five-year maximum residency requirement for new hires in Wilmington.\n\nIt also provides the framework for a working group that would include nine members, three of them appointed by the mayor and the rest by the council president.\n\nThe group would be tasked with identifying ways for residents to fill vacancies, creating incentives to move into Wilmington and finding ways to ease the financial burdens of renting and buying in the city, according to the ordinance. A final report would be due July 1, 2024.\n\nDarby’s legislation also opens the door to establishing a geographical boundary for the residency requirement.\n\nBracy’s ordinance seizes upon that by offering New Castle County’s geographical lines as the boundaries for Wilmington to use for new hire residency.\n\nETHICS INVESTIGATION:Wilmington City Council member subject of ethics complaint for second time this year\n\nNew Castle County has an estimated population of 575,494 people, eclipsing Wilmington’s estimated 71,569 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2022 estimates. The county stretches as far south as Smyrna, a nearly 45-minute drive from Wilmington.\n\nNew Castle County's unemployment rate also remains low at 4.1%, the same as the state. Meanwhile, Wilmington's unemployment rate is 6.2% with total unemployed numbers in the city at 2,136 in September, according to the Delaware Department of Labor's unemployment statistics. New Castle County's total unemployed numbers for September was 12,462.\n\nBoth pieces of legislation will be discussed during the City Council’s joint meeting of the Intergovernmental and Finance & Economic Development committees scheduled for 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nGot a tip?

But on Monday, council members decided to move forward with an ordinance that maintains the requirement.\n\nAfter a fiery, four-hour Wilmington City Council committee meeting, council members ultimately upheld the city’s five-year residency requirement for new hires.\n\nDozens of Wilmington residents once again filled City Hall on Monday to voice their support for the employee residency requirement, which has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after Mayor Mike Purzycki’s administration informed the legislative body that the city no longer believed the residency law was on the books.\n\nBack in July 2022, the city asked the Delaware General Assembly to give the City Council the power to create a residency requirement. The administration contended that since the City Council failed to act after being given that power by the General Assembly, it effectively nullified the five-year residency requirement outlined in the City Code.\n\nThe joint Intergovernmental and Finance Committee meeting on Monday spent hours debating a proposal by council member Latisha Bracy to expand the city’s residency boundaries to encompass all of New Castle County. A limited 3-mile radius outside the city also was proposed by council member Michelle Harlee.\n\nBACKGROUND:This decadeslong debate still divides Wilmington leaders, residents. Can it be solved?\n\nAt one point, the debate got so heated that Finance Committee Chairman Chris Johnson threw out one resident in the crowd for heckling. This led to shouting among council members who condemned Johnson for the move.\n\nDespite the disagreements, committee members ultimately defeated Bracy’s proposal to expand the residency boundaries and moved council member Shane Darby’s ordinance to maintain the five-year residency requirement out of committee.\n\nCOUNCIL SPEAKS OUT:Why Wilmington is looking to remove residency requirements for new employees\n\nWhat happened to the expanded boundary proposal?\n\nBracy chose not to withdraw her proposal to expand the city residency boundaries to all of New Castle County, and it was defeated by committee members in a 4-3 vote.\n\nRELATED:Wilmington bill expands residency to New Castle County, shifting new hire dialogue\n\nJohnson cast the vote that led to the ordinance’s demise, explaining that the testimony heard from residents Monday prompted him to change his stance.\n\nWhat proposal moves to a full council vote?\n\nThe issue has been constantly evolving since an amendment was proposed by Councilperson Al Mills in October to eliminate the residency law altogether, and even the alternative proposals pitched by Darby and others have changed daily.\n\nOCTOBER MEETING:Wilmington council tables vote on ordinance that would remove residency law for new hires\n\nDarby’s ordinance approved Monday maintains a five-year residency requirement for new hires, gives preference to hiring city residents, gives new hires a year to move into Wilmington, and establishes a residency assistance fund to help new hires afford housing.\n\nDarby’s ordinance was amended Monday to add a residency working group, which will examine the root causes for departments’ struggle to find employees, identify ways for residents to fill vacancies and find ways to ease the financial burdens of renting and buying in the city.\n\nThis plan will be before the full City Council for a vote on Thursday, Nov. 16.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/29/delaware-governor-orders-out-state-travelers-quarantine-14-days/2937109001/", "title": "Delaware governor orders out-of-state travelers to quarantine for 14 ...", "text": "All out-of-state travelers arriving in Delaware must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus, Gov.

On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville. This prompted a Delaware State Police search for a man who found the gun while collecting recyclables outside the store and − several years later − drew federal prosecutors' attention back to the form.\n\nWhy is that allegedly a crime?\n\nBiden faces three firearms felonies.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase the gun, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat must prosecutors prove to the jury?\n\nFor the first charge, prosecutors must generally convince the jury that:\n\nBiden filled out the form and that he made a false statement, specifically that he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knew that statement was false.\n\nThat the statement was meant to deceive the salesman on a fact material to the sale. In other words: the sale would not have occurred had he answered otherwise.\n\nThe second charge is similar. Prosecutors need to show that Biden knowingly made a false statement, but need not show the statement was material to the transaction.\n\nFor the third charge, prosecutors need to prove:\n\nBiden was either an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knowingly possessed the firearm.\n\nThat he knew he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat is a user and an 'addict'?\n\nTo find Biden was an unlawful user of controlled substances or addicted to drugs, the jury must have a common definition of what those terms mean in order to apply the evidence to the question. This has been a hotly litigated topic in pretrial motions and continues to be where defense attorneys are concentrating their litigation days ahead of trial.\n\nLast week, Judge Maryellen Noreika granted the prosecutors' motion barring defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that they must show Biden used controlled substances the day of the firearm purchase in order to get a guilty verdict.\n\nProsecutors successfully argued that relevant definitions dictate they need to simply show that the \"unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nRecent: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHowever, the debate on the issue continues as of Wednesday in litigation over what definitions jurors will work with. On Wednesday, defense attorney submitted arguments seeking a more constrained definition of \"addict\" and unlawful user than what prosecutors have sought in their proposed jury instructions.\n\nAmong other requests, defense filings request specific instructions telling the jury that if they do not find that Biden knew himself to fit the definition of drug user or \"addict\" at the time he purchased the gun, the verdict must be not guilty.\n\nHow the judge decides these definitions and instructions could be key to how Biden defends himself at trial.\n\nWhat evidence and witnesses will prosecutors use?\n\nRegardless of what definitions are ultimately presented to the jury, prosecutors have a mountain of evidence showing Biden's drug use.\n\nA primary vein of evidence will be Biden’s own words exploring his drug use in his 2021 memoir “Beautiful Things.” In it, he said he was in active addiction for four years leading to March 2019 and speaks about rehab and relapses, according to excerpts identified by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors will also lean on his text messages: missives like, “I was sleeping in a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nThe book: Hunter Biden says he was 'smoking crack every 15 minutes', more jaw-dropping moments from memoir 'Beautiful Things'\n\nAdditionally, they will call close family witnesses including what court documents indicate are his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Biden’s brother and Hunter Biden’s former lover. In court, prosecutors said these witnesses will testify to Biden’s conduct, as well as verify digital communications entered as evidence in the trial.\n\nProsecutors also intend to call witnesses from the gun shop to testify about the purchase of the revolver.\n\nWhat will Biden's defense argue?\n\nSo far, defense attorneys have unsuccessfully sought to toss the case using arguments that the charges are legally defective.\n\nAs trial looms, his attorneys have hinted at a defense that emphasizes the requirement that prosecutors show that Biden knowingly lied about his status as an unlawful drug user when he filled out paperwork to purchase the gun.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Biden's primary defense attorney, has sought permission to introduce at trial expert testimony from a specialist who can testify regarding a person with addiction’s understanding of and state of denial about their own addiction.\n\n“Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,” Lowell wrote in court documents filed earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Lowell submitted paperwork to admit that witness too late, asking the judge to bar such testimony.\n\nSecondarily, Lowell has hinted he may seek a line of questioning that attacks the credibility of the gun shop employees responsible for keeping the form on which Biden is accused of lying.\n\nThis avenue was opened by the fact that the form was altered between when it was first emailed to federal authorities in 2018 and when the original was turned over to federal investigators years later. Employees at the gun shop added another form of identification verification to the form after the fact that may not have actually been submitted by Biden, according to court documents.\n\nIn court, Lowell said the alteration calls the credibility of the shop employees to question and presents questions over whether the witnesses are obtaining a benefit from prosecutors since they appeared to have, like Biden, written false information on the form.\n\nWho will decide whether Biden is guilty?\n\nA jury of 12 picked from residents of New Castle County will evaluate the evidence and be tasked with rendering the verdict. Because of the high-profile nature of the defendant, hundreds are being called into the courthouse for jury selection on Monday.\n\nThe court will use pre-decided questions to cull potential jurors who can't be impartial down to a smaller pool. Then, prosecutors and defense attorneys will have the choice to strike a certain number of prospective jurors. This process could take days.\n\nWhere is this happening and how long will it take?\n\nAfter jury selection, each side will present opening statements and prosecutors will begin to call witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case. Lowell, Biden's attorney, indicated he will possibly also present a case and said if he does, it won't take double the time prosecutors have projected for their own.\n\nIn all, the court expects the case to last about two weeks.\n\nThe trial will take place in the federal courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington.\n\nA piece of trivia: The court is housed in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972 to launch his political career in Washington D.C.\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nFederal Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case.\n\nHer career before the bench centered on civil litigation: intellectual property cases and corporate litigation in federal and state courts. Later on, she'd gain experience representing children in Delaware's Family Court.\n\nIn 2017, Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons put forward Noreika and Colm F. Connolly to fill judicial vacancies in the Delaware District. Then-President Donald Trump nominated Noreika and Connolly, and she was confirmed the following year.\n\nThe judge:Biden gun charges remain before judge who questioned plea deal, placing spotlight on her\n\nHer political affiliations and contributions have been mixed, according to past reporting.\n\nNoreika gained national attention last year when a plea deal for Biden fell apart under her pointed questioning of the parties. Both sides went into the hearing having agreed to a deal that would have resolved both the gun case, as well as pending tax charges against Biden with a misdemeanor plea and recommended sentence of probation only.\n\nFailed plea deal: Here's how Hunter Biden's expected plea deal fell apart, leading to his not guilty plea\n\nHowever, Noreika repeatedly complained that both parties wanted her \"rubber stamp\" on the \"unusual\" agreement and subjected them to hours of questions. Her line of inquiry ultimately exposed differences in each side's interpretation of the deal and led to her ordering further legal briefings that prompted the sides to abandon the deal.\n\nCould the president's son go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\nWhat about Biden's taxes?\n\nSeparately, Biden faces tax evasion charges in a California case now set to go to trial this fall.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}]}

The tip, which was then forwarded to the FBI, stated that a user later identified as Kealty possessed child sexual abuse material on his account.\n\nA search warrant executed by the FBI found that Kealty accessed the Snapchat account on both his personal and work iPhones. He sent multiple images from the account, court documents state, and messaged others about his sexual interest in girls between the ages of 14 and 16.\n\nHe also told another user in November 2022 that he was working a high school football game as overtime \"if ya wanted me to try and sneak ya some pics lol.\"\n\n\"Won’t be nothing crazy but maybe some cute asses,\" Kealty wrote.\n\nConversations with minors\n\nKealty directly solicited child sexual abuse material from a minor in 2021 after grooming her for six months, according to court records.\n\nThe FBI said it found sexual conversations that Kealty had with a 16-year-old girl from April 2021 to October 2021, which included him asking for explicit photos of her. When she said she wasn't comfortable sending him pictures, court records show that Kealty asked for photos of her friends or sister since she didn't want him to masturbate to pictures of her \"like I want to.\"\n\nThe search through Kealty's Snapchat account also found disturbing language that the FBI said indicated he \"loves\" rape and used racist and vulgar language when referring to Black and Latina women and girls.\n\n\"I'd rape that slutty [racial slur] like my ancestors did in NC back when America was great,\" Kealty wrote in one message.\n\nPrevious investigation into Kealty\n\nCourt documents also revealed a prior CyberTip related to \"jasonkyle221,\" Kealty's Snapchat username.

We could use three or four right now, and I think everybody is in the same boat,\" Carey said. \"We can't get around it. Our people put in a lot of hours of overtime and work a lot Saturdays and Sundays.\"\n\nCarey said the workforce just isn't there, especially in the Mid-Atlantic region where there is a need for technicians to work on both marine and truck engines.\n\nHe believes educating more people is the answer, but said there are very few schools in Delaware and surrounding states that offer training for diesel mechanics and technicians.\n\n\"We need to educate more people into this trade because the equipment being built today is more complicated and takes more time to work on,\" he said. \"There just aren't enough people to keep up with the work.\"\n\nDelaware Tech has recognized the shortage of diesel mechanics and technicians in the state for years and has been trying to find a solution.\n\nDelTech president Mark Brainard believes the partnership between the college and Middletown that has been in the works for more than a year will be a good start.\n\nThe problem Delaware Tech has faced is the the funding needed to build additional classroom and lab space.\n\nMiddletown offered a solution to the space problem when it offered to lease DelTech the old National Guard Armory on the town's north side to retrofit for classrooms and labs.\n\nThat partnership will bear fruit with the anticipated Jan. 1, 2019, opening of the two vocational-technical programs, Brainard said.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for us,\" Brainard said. \"We've desperately wanted to be in that market for a long time, but we have some critical deferred maintenance needs, so it has been hard to even think about any new square footage in the state.\"\n\nBrainard thinks it makes sense for Delaware Tech to have a presence in Middletown, which has seen huge growth in population and industry.\n\nHe said data collected from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Research Analytics Labor Market, and requests from the business community indicate that the need for qualified diesel technicians is at an all-time high.\n\nStatistics show that 502 people are currently employed in Delaware as bus and truck mechanics and diesel engine specialists. An additional 249 are employed in the Eastern Shore region of Maryland.\n\nThe projected rate of growth for diesel mechanics from 2016 through 2026 in the Delaware and Eastern Shore region (17 percent) will exceed the rate of growth for the United States (14 percent), data shows.\n\nAnnual openings are projected to total 89,460 nationwide through 2026, or about 8,946 per year across the United States. In Delaware and the Eastern Shore region, annual openings are expected to total 267, or about 27 per year through 2026.\n\n\"There is a desperate need on the entire peninsula for diesel mechanics, so our intent is to as quickly as possible put diesel mechanic and heavy equipment operator programs in Middletown,\" Brainard said. \"That should support the construction and some of the larger companies that are in that area as well.\"\n\nAccording to salary.com, the annual base salary for diesel mechanics in Delaware is higher and varies from $54,954 in Seaford to $56,164 in Harrington, Lewes and Milford.\n\n\"These will be programs that are going to create a lot of pretty high-paying jobs here and in the state,\" said Middletown Mayor Ken Branner. \"There is no downside.\"\n\nMiddletown currently uses the front end of the old armory to house its maintenance and inspections departments, but the entire back of the building, which includes a large parade area and basketball court will be used for classrooms and lab space.\n\nAn added bonus is two acres of land behind the old armory that can be used for hands-on training for the heavy equipment operator program.\n\nBranner said that with a large two-bay garage and thousands of square feet in which to build, DelTech can design the space to fit the needs of the two programs.\n\n\"We talked at one time about this building as a home for the Boys & Girls Club, but the location wasn't ideal,\" the mayor said. \"It's perfect for what Delaware Tech wants to do.\"\n\nCarey is thrilled that the partnership between DelTech and Middletown is moving forward.\n\n\"We're desperate for people all of the time,\" he said. \"We have to sometimes share our work with other businesses. It will be good to be able to hire more people in the near future.\"\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

So, imagine what opening a new restaurant in the middle of a pandemic is like.\n\n\"It hasn't been the way we planned,\" said owner Tony Bomba about his first restaurant, Dorcea, an upscale American grill, that has taken over the spot of the former Domaine Hudson in Wilmington.\n\nBut Bomba is marching forward.\n\nDorcea, at 1314 Washington St. near Wilmington Hospital, began takeout and curbside pickup on April 9, and, Bomba says business has been steadily growing.\n\nGov. John Carney has restricted dine-in services at Delaware's more than 1,900 eating and drinking establishments since March 16 due to the coronavirus. It is not yet known when restaurants will be allowed to reopen as full-service operations.\n\nSPRING CLEAN-UP:Kid Shelleen's closing after this weekend for repairs\n\nWhile offering takeout alone by no means makes up for the on-premises sales losses, the National Restaurant Association said the proportion of consumers using off-premises food service has remained relatively constant the last several weeks.\n\nAccording to surveys the organization has conducted for the past seven weeks, roughly 6 in 10 adults said they ordered takeout or delivery from a restaurant for their dinner meal.\n\nIn addition, the National Restaurant Association says nearly 4 in 10 adults said they ordered takeout or delivery for lunch – a level that also remained generally steady through the coronavirus crisis.\n\nBomba, who worked as a bartender for 20 years at the nearby Washington Street Ale House, purchased Domaine Hudson in early December with his business partner John Ratliff, a friend for more than two decades.\n\nBomba's wife, Lindsay, and his brother Michael, a chef who has created the menu and worked for seven years in the kitchen at the Ale House, also are involved in the operation.\n\nDomaine Hudson was a critically acclaimed fine-dining restaurant that had been a part of Delaware's dining scene since 2005. It was known for its expansive wine cellar and high-end, innovative dishes.\n\nBomba said they kept the Domaine Hudson name through the bustling 2019 holiday season. Then, the partners closed in January to remodel into a more casual eatery and give the business a new name.\n\nThey've added TVs to the 70-seat dining room and a new draft beer system. A private dining room has seating for up to 18 people.\n\nAnother Wilmington fine-dining restaurant, the Green Room at the Hotel du Pont just blocks away, also closed recently for a revamping.\n\nThe historic restaurant that has served customers since the Hotel du Pont opened in 1913 is scheduled to get a more casual concept makeover. Last month, construction was still taking place at the site.\n\nThe space was scheduled to reopen as Le Cavalier at the Green Room before Mother's Day, but that date could change due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe restaurant's Facebook page continues to feature photographed \"teasers\" of dishes that chef/owner Tyler Akin planned to offer.\n\nDomaine Hudson was founded by wine lover Tom Hudson and his then-wife, Meg. It was a wine bar in the true sense of the word and at one time offered 45 wines by the glass and 425 labels by the bottle.\n\nThe kitchen has had strong and talented leadership over the years, beginning with Jason Barrowcliff, who is now in charge at Brandywine Prime in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Other chefs have included Robert Lhulier and Patrick D'Amico.\n\nThe restaurant scored big in 2012 when young chef JD Morton was a semifinalist for a James Beard Award as one of the country's rising young chefs. Former Domaine Hudson executive chef Dwain Kalup was recognized by the country's most prestigious culinary organization as one of the best chefs in the Mid-Atlantic region in 2017.\n\nBomba said he and his partner had initially planned to unveil Dorcea in early March, but the coronavirus pandemic changed everything.\n\nGET YOUR CAFFEINE FIX:BrewHaHa! reopening some of its cafes\n\nEarlier this month, they decided \"the heck with it,\" and quietly opened the doors and began takeout. Bomba said it is an approach that's similar to a restaurant \"soft opening,\" which is an opening that showcases a new restaurant to a limited group of people.\n\nDorcea co-owner John Ratliff said opening during a pandemic \"isn't ideal,\" but he said it is giving the partners a chance to build the restaurant's brand and develop customer loyalty and relationships. He said that since renovations were completed, \"it made sense to open and not leave it sitting there idle.\"\n\nBomba said five people are working to produce the menu that, right now, is about 35% of what Dorcea will eventually offer.\n\nDishes include soups, small dishes such as spicy calamari ($11), and chicken wings ($11), as well as \"big plates\" such as crab cakes ($25), char-grilled meatloaf ($14) and grilled salmon with gochujang sauce ($22).\n\nBomba says Dorcea also has an extensive selection of to-go wines, bottled and draft beers, and \"old-school\" cocktails.\n\nTakeout and curbside delivery are available from 11:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday-Friday and 4 to 8 p.m. Saturday. Customers can order online. The restaurant is closed on Sunday.\n\nBomba says he was encouraged by customer response to Dorcea – dinners were flying out of the door last Friday – and he plans to continue takeout.\n\nHe hopes to be open as a full-service restaurant in about a month, though it will depend on when Gov. Carney removes dine-in restrictions.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2015/02/21/eagles-cornerback-safety-prospects-come-caveats/23813323/", "title": "Eagles' cornerback, safety prospects come with caveats", "text": "Martin Frank\n\nThe News Journal\n\nINDIANAPOLIS – It's been widely assumed that the Eagles would target a cornerback or a safety if they were to stay at No. 20 instead of trying to move up to take Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota.\n\nBut two of their prospects, both from the University of Washington, come with caveats.\n\nCornerback Marcus Peters was kicked off the team after a conflict with his coaches. And Shaq Thompson insists that he's a linebacker despite the fact that NFL Network draft analyst Mike Mayock projects him as an NFL safety.\n\nWhat if a team tells Thompson that they want him to play safety?\n\n\"I'm going to put it out there that I want to play linebacker, but I can't say no to that,\" Thompson said.\n\nIt seems like a matter of semantics.\n\nThompson is 6 feet, 228 pounds, about the same height and weight as Seattle safety Kam Chancellor. Thompson said he likes playing inside linebacker because he likes being close to the line of scrimmage. That essentially is Chancellor's role with the Seahawks.\n\nThat would also enable Thompson to be on the field as an extra defensive back, playing a glorified linebacker position, in either the nickel or dime packages.\n\nIf the Eagles are in those sub-packages about 40 percent of the game, anyway, then Thompson can be a significant contributor.\n\nBut Mayock said Thompson also could play strong safety, or close to the line of scrimmage, in a base defense, although that would seem to go against the versatility that Eagles coach Chip Kelly and defensive coordinator Bill Davis like in their safeties.\n\n\"I think the value of Shaq Thompson as a defensive player is you don't put a label on him because he's going to be a three-down player,\" Mayock said. \"It doesn't really matter where you line him up because he's going to be a good three-down player.\"\n\nMayock, meanwhile, has Peters ranked second among the cornerbacks in the draft. Peters spent most of his press conference explaining his dismissal from the Huskies.\n\n\"[Teams] want to know the character,\" Peters said. \"Am I a hothead? Which is false. I made some immature decisions, and I learn from them and I grow as a man.\"\n\nThere are other possibilities for the Eagles at corner. Michigan State's Trae Waynes is considered the top corner and will likely be taken by the time the Eagles pick. But Mayock said LSU's Jalen Collins is someone who might be available if Peters and Waynes aren't.\n\nMarcus Smith musings\n\nCornerback Charles Gaines is one of 11 Louisville players taking part in the combine. So he's fully aware of the trials and tribulations that his former teammate Marcus Smith went through as the Eagles' first-round pick (26th overall) last season.\n\nSmith played just 74 snaps all season while moving from outside linebacker to inside linebacker and back to outside. But Gaines said Smith never got frustrated over his lack of playing time and constantly changing positions when they talked.\n\nBesides, Gaines has seen Smith make that transition before. Smith came to Louisville as a quarterback before moving to defensive line, then outside linebacker.\n\n\"He always stayed positive, like I've always known him to be, a positive person,\" Gaines said. \"I've seen him go from one position to another and make it the best opportunity for him. ... I think whatever they throw at him, he'll adjust to. He's just got to slow the game down. Don't think too much, just go out and do what he had been doing, follow up on the little things, study a little more.\"\n\n\"When the season comes along, he'll make sure everything goes good, and everything will work out in his favor.\"\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

(More than 60 shows are expected to be on the schedule when the bookings stop.)\n\nThe anniversary concert, which sold out in less than a week, will feature a trio of longtime favorite cover acts headlined by Mr. Greengenes, which retired in 2013. Also on the bill: Love Seed Mama Jump, who are celebrating their 25th year this summer, and Jefe, former lead singer of Burnt Sienna.\n\nWith a new wave of cover bands dominating the Cork's stage in recent years, it will be a blast-from-the-past-type show for fans like Hockessin's Dane Ciarlo.\n\nWhen he heard about the anniversary show, he went online the moment the $40 tickets went on sale and bought 20, knowing that a ton of friends would want to go.\n\n\"I only have one left,\" says Ciarlo, 45, who estimates he's seen Mr. Greengenes about 50 times over the years.\n\nBut for country fans, it's the cherry-picking of would-be Big Barrel acts like Clare Dunn (Aug. 11), the Eli Young Band (July 6), A Thousand Horses (June 16) and The Lacs (June 15) that helps soften the blow of the state losing both Big Barrel and the Delaware Junction Country Music Festival since last summer.\n\nCork owner Highway One Group along with Live Nation co-produced Delaware Junction, which debuted in Harrington last summer and is also not coming back. Even so, Cole Swindell and The Cadillac Three, both of whom played Delaware Junction last year, will be at the Cork this summer. Swindell is July 8 and The Cadillac Three is June 22.\n\nPair those country acts with the fast-selling country singer Kane Brown's show June 26 and the already sold-out Old Dominion concert June 24 and country will undoubtedly be alive and well in Dewey this summer.\n\nWalls has successfully booked up-and-coming country acts for years, having had everyone from Miranda Lambert and Eric Church to Jason Aldean and Ryan Bingham.\n\nOld Dominion's show might fall into that category since the Nashville country rock five-piece is touring stadiums this summer with Kenny Chesney, Lambert and more. Old Dominion's Dewey show is squeezed between Chesney tour stops in Virginia Beach and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field on June 25.\n\nTickets for all shows are on sale now at deweybeachlife.com, except for Swindell, whose on-sale is expected to be sometime next week.\n\nIn addition to country radio favorites, Walls has also lined up several acts that she has been trying to book for years, including a trio of singer/songwriters: Lucinda Williams (Aug. 31), Alejandro Escovedo (July 20) and Anders Osbourne (Aug. 16).\n\nOther first-time Cork acts this summer include rockers Buckcherry, whose \"Crazy Bitch\" dominated Dewey cover band setlists in 2006.\n\nAmong the returning favorites is 79-year-old blue dynamo Buddy Guy (July 25), who is making his third appearance, and funk/soul act Robert Randolph & the Family Band (July 27), who will get the crowd dancing for the eighth time in Dewey.\n\nThe Cork also regularly hosts a few tribute acts each summer and some familiar names are on the bill this year, including a pair of Grateful Dead-filled shows by Dark Star Orchestra (Aug. 8, 9), Badfish doing the songs of Sublime (June 29) and Who's Bad: The Ultimate Michael Jackson Experience (July 14).\n\nBut it's the wave of country music at the Cork that will give Big Barrel and Delaware Junction fans some solace.\n\nWalls knew the acts that were announced for this year's Big Barrel would be traveling through the area and jumped on the opportunity.\n\nLos Angeles-based Goldenvoice, which puts on Dover's Firefly Music Festival with Chicago's Red Frog Events and founded Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, told The Desert Sun in April that Big Barrel was not canceled because it didn't do well financially.\n\nIt simply didn't have \"magic.\"\n\n“If they don’t work, you should get rid of them,” Goldenvoice president Paul Tollett told the Palm Springs, California-based newspaper. “Almost every single festival we’ve had has lost money in the beginning – for two, three, five years. But, sometimes you start a festival and it just doesn’t have any magic. So it needs to go away.”\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Though some robots are better at one particular type of terrain or other, the idea for EELS is the ability to do it all,” said JPL’s Matthew Robinson, EELS project manager. “When you’re going places where you don’t know what you’ll find, you want to send a versatile, risk-aware robot that’s prepared for uncertainty – and can make decisions on its own.”\n\nIf it finds a crack in the ice, its sensor-packed \"head\" navigates the break and creates a circular path to make its way down through the crust. If it finds a space too narrow, it burrows and drills down into the ice like a screw into wood. If it finds an ocean, well … you get the point. It knows how to adapt to its surroundings.\n\nOther space news:Artemis II crew in D.C., lunar lander and 'cosmic matter': This week\n\nMore:Star Wars-like volcanic planet discovered orbiting red dwarf star\n\nBlue Moon:NASA awards multibillion-dollar lunar lander contract to Blue Origin for Artemis program\n\nScience Objective\n\nThe Cassini probe, launched from the Space Coast in 1997, has provided vast amounts of data on Saturn and its moons. Among its findings, data indicates that Enceladus, one of those moons, possesses a liquid ocean beneath its icy crust.\n\nPlumes of vapor erupting from its surface are conduits directly to liquid water, potentially making this the easiest path to a habitable liquid ocean. Scientists have hypothesized environmental conditions informed by eruption models.\n\nThese models have driven every aspect of the EELS architecture to make it adaptable to the challenges the probe could face on this journey from the surface to the ocean. And the probe’s adaptability opens other destinations such as Martian polar caps, Jupiter’s moon Europa and even ice sheets on Earth.\n\nThe current effort includes working with scientists to identify high-priority, high-impact scientific investigations here that will also demonstrate the capabilities of EELS on a different celestial body.\n\nMission to Enceladus\n\nWhile there is no set launch date for the EELS probe, scientist hope to finalize the robot's concept and prove functionality by the fall of 2024. That means any mission is likely years away from launching, and then you have the travel time. The Voyager probes reached Saturn after about three years and two months. The larger, heavier Cassini probe took longer: six years and seven months to reach the ringed planet.\n\nNASA Study:Oceans likely orbiting Uranus\n\nStill going:NASA scientists add years to Voyager 2 power supply\n\nEELS Architecture\n\nThe EELS robot weighs about 220 pounds and is 13 feet long. It’s composed of 10 identical segments that rotate, using screw threads for propulsion, traction, and grip. The team has been trying out a variety of screws: white, 8-inch-diameter 3D-printed plastic screws for testing on looser terrain, and narrower, sharper black metal screws for ice.\n\n“We have a different philosophy of robot development than traditional spacecraft, with many quick cycles of testing and correcting,” said Hiro Ono, EELS principal investigator at JPL. “There are dozens of textbooks about how to design a four-wheel vehicle, but there is no textbook about how to design an autonomous snake robot to boldly go where no robot has gone before. We have to write our own. That’s what we’re doing now.”\n\nCapability\n\nEELS creates a 3D map of its surroundings using four pairs of stereo cameras and a system similar to radar but employs short laser pulses instead of radio waves. With the data from those sensors, navigation algorithms figure out the safest path forward.\n\nBenefit\n\nThis system can further ocean world exploration by its diverse adaptability to various types of terrains. EELS allows for deeper exploration into areas that were once unattainable.\n\nLook for more space industry news at floridatoday.com/space\n\nRob Landers is a veteran multimedia journalist for the USA Today Network of Florida.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nMysterious, icy worlds in our solar system should be an exploration priority going forward, according to a new report published Tuesday.\n\nThe planetary decadal survey recommends the first dedicated Uranus Orbiter and Probe as the next large NASA mission. The spacecraft would conduct an orbital tour of the ice giant during flybys and deliver a probe to explore the atmosphere of the seventh planet from the sun. And a launch in 2031 or 2032 “is viable,” according to the authors of the report.\n\nLooking for evidence of life on Saturn’s moon, Enceladus, should be the second priority for NASA, according to the report. Enceladus contains a liquid ocean beneath an icy crust, and the Enceladus Orbilander would both orbit the moon and land on the surface, studying plumes of water that rise up through cracks in the ice shell.\n\nThe survey, produced by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, also identifies other scientific priorities for the decade ahead, including planetary defense against near-Earth objects, a new approach to studying Mars, and exploring and sampling other worlds. This report differs from the Astro2020 decadal survey, released in November, which is more focused on unlocking the secrets of the universe and identifying worlds outside of our solar system.\n\n“The report sets out an ambitious but practicable vision for advancing the frontiers of planetary science, astrobiology, and planetary defense in the next decade,” said Robin Canup, assistant vice president of the Planetary Sciences Directorate at the Southwest Research Institute, and co-chair of the National Academies’ steering committee for the decadal survey, in a statement.\n\nBeneath the ice\n\nThe authors of the report see the Uranus Orbiter and Probe as a way of revolutionizing the knowledge astronomers have of ice giants in general. Our solar system is home to two – Uranus and Neptune – both made of ice, methane and ammonia with a small rocky core. Only one mission has previously flown by the two planets: NASA’s Voyager 2 in 1989. The rest of what scientists know about these distant planets has been collected using telescopes like Hubble.\n\nBut no mission has studied Uranus up close and in detail.\n\nIt’s a bit of an oddball, rotating on its side. It has 13 rings, 27 moons and a signature blue-green color from the methane in its atmosphere. The planet doesn’t have a true surface since the majority of its composition is swirling fluid.\n\nScientists are interested in learning about its atmospheric dynamics, complex magnetic field, and what led to the creation of its extreme tilt and rings. And some of the larger moons orbiting the planet could potentially be ocean worlds.\n\nThe Uranus Orbiter and Probe could gain more insights about the planet’s origin, interior, atmosphere, moons and rings.\n\nMeanwhile, planetary scientists have hoped for years to fly a spacecraft through the active plumes of gas and particles that erupt from Enceladus’ interior ocean. The Enceladus Orbilander could directly study if the moon’s ocean is habitable.\n\nThe Enceladus mission would search for evidence of life and determine if it could exist on the ocean world. If the mission were to launch later this decade, it would likely arrive at the distant moon in the early 2050s. There is also a suggestion for a separate mission that could conduct multiple flybys of Enceladus if the Orbilander isn’t feasible.\n\nOther destinations\n\nThe report also recommends that NASA send missions to return samples from the dwarf planet Ceres as well as the surface of a comet. The Ceres mission could assess if the dwarf planet, which can be found in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is habitable.\n\nOther missions on the list include a Venus explorer, a probe to fly through the atmosphere of Saturn and an orbiter around Saturn’s moon Titan. Titan is of interest to researchers because its dense atmosphere is home to prebiotic molecules, which is a feature similar to how Earth’s atmosphere started out before life appeared. The Titan mission would investigate if the moon could harbor life.\n\nThe report suggests sending an orbiter and lander to one of the Centaurs, or primitive small icy bodies found between Jupiter and Neptune.\n\nWhen it comes to Mars, the authors recommend continuing with the current rover program and multistep mission to return samples from Mars to Earth. But they also encourage creating the Mars Life Explorer, a mission that would look for existing life and determine if it’s possible that life exists on Mars today.\n\nThere is also a desire to make sure that scientific endeavor is maximized as humans return to the moon through NASA’s Artemis program, collecting lunar samples and setting up instruments on the surface that can reveal more about its history.\n\nUnderstanding more about near-Earth objects, like tracking and detecting space rocks that could pose a threat to Earth, is a clear priority. The authors recommend that NASA develop and launch the NEO Surveyor, an infrared mission that could provide a better foundation for modeling and predicting the movements of near-Earth objects. In turn, this information would help in the design of deflection missions.\n\nOnce NASA’s existing DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, and NEO Surveyor provide data, the next steps would be a rapid-response reconnaissance mission to target a near-Earth object between 164 to 328 feet (50 to 100 meters) in diameter. These objects have the highest probability of causing mass destruction should they collide with Earth.\n\n“This recommended portfolio of missions, high-priority research activities, and technology development will produce transformative advances in human knowledge and understanding about the origin and evolution of the solar system, and of life and the habitability of other bodies beyond Earth,” Canup said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960392/juice-the-european-space-mission-to-find-life-on-jupiters-moons", "title": "Juice: the European space mission to find life on Jupiter's moons ...", "text": "Mike Sori, assistant professor of planetary science at Purdue University explains how this week’s European Space Agency launch could be one of the most important in recent history.\n\nOn April 13, 2023, the European Space Agency is scheduled to launch a rocket carrying a spacecraft destined for Jupiter. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer – or JUICE – will spend at least three years on Jupiter’s moons after it arrives in 2031.

But perhaps the most exciting information will have to do with water. Three of Jupiter’s moons – Europa, Ganymede and Callisto – are home to large, underground oceans of liquid water that could support life.\n\nMeet Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto\n\nJupiter has dozens of moons. Four of them in particular are of interest to planetary scientists.\n\nIo, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are, like Earth’s Moon, relatively large, spherical complex worlds. Two previous NASA missions have sent spacecraft to orbit the Jupiter system and collected data on these moons. The Galileo mission orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003 and led to geological discoveries on all four large moons. The Juno mission is still orbiting Jupiter today and has provided scientists with an unprecedented view into Jupiter’s composition, structure and space environment.\n\nThese missions and other observations revealed that Io, the closest of the four to its host planet, is abuzz with geological activity, including lava lakes, volcanic eruptions and tectonically formed mountains. But it is not home to large amounts of water.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nEuropa, Ganymede and Callisto, in contrast, have icy landscapes. Europa’s surface is a frozen wonderland with a young but complex history, possibly including icy analogs of plate tectonics and volcanoes. Ganymede, the largest moon in the entire solar system, is bigger than Mercury and has its own magnetic field generated internally from a liquid metal core. Callisto appears somewhat inert compared to the others, but serves as a valuable time capsule of an ancient past that is no longer accessible on the youthful surfaces of Europa and Io.\n\nMost exciting of all: Europa, Ganymede and Callisto all almost certainly possess underground oceans of liquid water.\n\nOcean worlds\n\nEuropa, Ganymede and Callisto have chilly surfaces that are hundreds of degrees below zero. At these temperatures, ice behaves like solid rock.\n\nBut just like Earth, the deeper underground you go on these moons, the hotter it gets. Go down far enough and you eventually reach the temperature where ice melts into water. Exactly how far down this transition occurs on each of the moons is a subject of debate that scientists hope to resolve with JUICE and Europa Clipper. While the exact depths are still uncertain, scientists are confident that these oceans exist.\n\nThe best evidence of these oceans comes from Jupiter’s magnetic field. Saltwater is electrically conductive. So as these moons travel through Jupiter’s magnetic field, they generate a secondary, smaller magnetic field that signals to researchers the presence of an underground ocean. Using this technique, planetary scientists have been able to show that the three moons contain underground oceans. And these oceans are not small – Europa’s ocean alone might have more than double the water of all of Earth’s oceans combined.\n\nAn obvious and tantalizing next question is whether these oceans can support extraterrestrial life. Liquid water is an important piece of what makes for a habitable world, but far from the only requirement for life. Life also needs energy and certain chemical compounds in addition to water to flourish. Because these oceans are hidden beneath miles of solid ice, sunlight and photosynthesis are out. But it’s possible other sources could provide the needed ingredients.\n\nOn Europa, for example, the liquid water ocean overlays a rocky interior. That rocky seafloor could provide energy and chemicals through underwater volcanoes that could make Europa’s ocean habitable. But it is also possible that Europa’s ocean is a sterile, inhospitable place – scientists need more data to answer these questions.\n\nUpcoming missions from ESA and NASA\n\nJUICE and Europa Clipper are set up to give scientists game-changing information about the potential habitability of Jupiter’s moons. While both missions will gather data on multiple moons, JUICE will spend time orbiting and focusing on Ganymede, and Europa Clipper will make dozens of close flybys of Europa.\n\nBoth of the spacecraft will carry a suite of scientific instruments built specifically to investigate the oceans. Onboard radar will allow JUICE and Europa Clipper to probe into the moons’ outer layers of solid ice. Radar could reveal any small pockets of liquid water in the ice, or, in the case of Europa, which has a thinner outer ice layer than Ganymede and Callisto, hopefully detect the larger ocean.\n\nMagnetometers will also be on both missions. These tools will give scientists the opportunity to study the secondary magnetic fields produced by the interaction of conductive oceans with Jupiter’s field in great detail and will hopefully give researchers clues to salinity and volumes of the oceans.\n\nScientists will also observe small variations in the moons’ gravitational pulls by tracking subtle movements in both spacecrafts’ orbits, which could help determine if Europa’s seafloor has volcanoes that provide the needed energy and chemistry for the ocean to support life.\n\nFinally, both craft will carry a host of cameras and light sensors that will provide unprecedented images of the geology and composition of the moons’ icy surfaces.\n\nMaybe one day, a spacecraft will be able to drill through the miles of solid ice on Europa, Ganymede or Callisto and explore oceans directly. Until then, observations from spacecraft like JUICE and Europa Clipper are scientists’ best bet for learning about these ocean worlds.\n\nWhen Galileo discovered these moons in 1609, they were the first objects known to directly orbit another planet. Their discovery was the final nail in the coffin of the theory that Earth – and humanity – resides at the center of the universe. Maybe these worlds have another humbling surprise in store.\n\nMike Sori, Assistant Professor of Planetary Science, Purdue University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft is gearing up for the first of a series of close encounters with the most volcanic place in the solar system. The Juno spacecraft will fly by Jupiter’s moon Io on Thursday, December 15.\n\nThe maneuver will be one of nine flybys of Io made by Juno over the next year and a half. Two of the encounters will be from a distance of just 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) away from the moon’s surface.\n\nJuno captured a glowing infrared view of Io on July 5 from 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometers) away. The brightest spots in that image correspond with the hottest temperatures on Io, which is home to hundreds of volcanoes — some of which can send lava fountains dozens of miles high.\n\nNASA's Juno mission captured an infrared view of Io in July. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM\n\nScientists will use Juno’s observations of Io to learn more about that network of volcanoes and how its eruptions interact with Jupiter. The moon is constantly tugged by Jupiter’s massive gravitational pull.\n\n“The team is really excited to have Juno’s extended mission include the study of Jupiter’s moons. With each close flyby, we have been able to obtain a wealth of new information,” said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, in a statement.\n\n“Juno sensors are designed to study Jupiter, but we’ve been thrilled at how well they can perform double duty by observing Jupiter’s moons.”\n\nThe spacecraft recently captured a new image of Jupiter’s northernmost cyclone on September 29. Jupiter’s atmosphere is dominated by hundreds of cyclones, and many cluster at the planet’s poles.\n\nJupiter's northernmost cyclone, seen to the right along the bottom edge of image, was captured by Juno. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSSImage\n\nThe Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016 to uncover details more about the giant planet and is focused on performing flybys of Jupiter’s moons during the extended part of its mission, which began last year and is expected to last through the end of 2025.\n\nJuno flew by Jupiter’s moon Ganymede in 2021, followed by Europa earlier this year. The spacecraft used its instruments to look beneath the icy crust of both moons and gathered data about Europa’s interior, where a salty ocean is thought to exist.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Explore where the search for life is unfolding in our solar system\n\nThe ice shell that makes up Europa’s surface is between 10 and 15 miles (16 and 24 kilometers) thick, and the ocean it likely sits atop is estimated to be 40 to 100 miles (64 to 161 kilometers) deep.\n\nThe data and images captured by Juno could help inform two separate missions heading to Jupiter’s moons in the next two years: the European Space Agency’s JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and NASA’s Europa Clipper mission.\n\nThe first, expected to launch in April 2023, will spend three years exploring Jupiter and three of its icy moons — Ganymede, Callisto and Europa — in depth. All three moons are thought to have oceans beneath their ice-covered crusts, and scientists want to explore whether Ganymede’s ocean is potentially habitable.\n\nEuropa Clipper will launch in 2024 to perform a dedicated series of 50 flybys around the moon after arriving in 2030.

(AP) — A tiny, ice-encrusted ocean world orbiting Saturn is now a hotter-than-ever candidate for potential life.\n\nNASA's Cassini spacecraft has detected hydrogen molecules in the geysers shooting off the moon Enceladus, possibly the result of deep-sea chemical reactions between water and rock that could spark microbial life, scientists announced Thursday.\n\nNASA and others are quick to point out this latest discovery does not mean there's life on Enceladus (ehn-SEHL'-uh-duhs), but that there may be conditions favorable for life.\n\nA liquid ocean exists beneath the icy surface of Enceladus, which is barely 300 miles (500 kilometers) across. Scientists have long known about the plumes of water vapor spewing from cracks at the moon's south pole, thanks to Cassini . The heavy presence of hydrogen suggests chemical reactions between the warm water and ocean-floor rock that could support life.\n\nCassini uncovered the hydrogen during its final close flyby of Enceladus in 2015, when it dove deeper than ever through its plumes of vapor and particles. The researchers reported that the hydrogen, along with carbon dioxide that was also found, could mean that undersea microbes are producing methane as they do in the bowels of our own oceans and waterways.\n\n\"It really represents a capstone finding for the mission,\" said Cassini's project scientist, Linda Spilker, noting that the spacecraft has been circling Saturn for more than a decade.\n\n\"We now know that Enceladus has almost all of the ingredients that you would need to support life as we know it on Earth,\" she said at a NASA news conference.\n\nA press conference viewer, asking questions of the scientists via Twitter, asked if NASA was talking about bacteria or algae — or giant squids.\n\n\"Most of us would be excited with any life,\" said Mary Voytek, an astrobiology senior scientist for NASA. \"We're going to start with bacteria and, if we get lucky, maybe there's something that's larger.\"\n\nThe findings were reported Thursday in the journal Science by a team from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.\n\nLaunched in 1997 and now finally running low on fuel, Cassini is drawing ever closer to its demise. The spacecraft will duck through the gap between Saturn and its rings 22 times before spiraling out of control and vaporizing in the sky above Saturn this September.\n\nCassini has no instruments that can detect life, so it will be up to future robotic visitors to seek out possible life on Enceladus, the scientists said.\n\nEuropa, an ice-covered moon of Jupiter also believed to have a subsurface ocean, may have water vapor jets spewing into space as well, similar to Enceladus. The Hubble Space Telescope has observed what looks to be plumes emanating from Europa. A spacecraft under development called the Europa Clipper, to launch sometime in the 2020s, could shed more light on the matter.\n\nVoytek said her money is still on Europa for potential life, versus Enceladus, since Europa is much older and any potential life there has had more time to emerge.\n\nWhile questions remain, Thursday's news represents \"an important advance in assessing the habitability of Enceladus,\" Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Jeffrey Seewald wrote in a companion article.\n\n\"We still have a long way to go in our understanding,\" said Seewald, who was not involved in the study. \"Future missions to explore oceans beyond Earth will answer many of these questions.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nNASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/tech/axiom-space-spacex-launch/index.html", "title": "What is Axiom Space? Meet the 'middle man' in the budding space ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a historic first, a crew of four civiliansare set to launch to the International Space Station this week as part of an inaugural mission for the commercial spaceflight company Axiom Space.\n\nThey’ll be riding on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and docking at the station via a SpaceX Dragon capsule, but don’t get Axiom confused with Elon Musk’s private spaceflight company. It serves a different purpose entirely. Axiom is less focused on building rockets than re-thinking the future of space stations.\n\nThe four crew members – three paying passengers and a former NASA astronaut there to serve as commander – taking part in the mission, dubbed Ax-1, will taxi to the ISS via SpaceX vehicles as part of the 10-day trip. Axiom has arranged with NASA for them to spend eight days aboard the orbiting laboratory managed by a team of international government-backed agencies. While on the ISS, the civilians are slated to assist with more than two dozen scientific experiments, as well as help pave the way for the development of Axiom’s plans to build the first commercial space station.\n\nAxiom, SpaceX and NASA announced Sunday evening that they are now targeting no earlier than Friday at 11:17 a.m. ET for the launch, which is set to lift off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If the launch goes as planned on Friday, docking of the SpaceX Dragon capsule to the station is scheduled for early Saturday morning. Those interested in watching the launch can tune in via NASA and Axiom Space’s live coverage of the event on Friday morning.\n\nThe Ax-1 Crew (left to right): Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nThe commander of the first-ever private astronaut mission to the ISS is Axiom’s Michael López-Alegría, a veteran Spanish-American NASA astronaut with four previous spaceflights under his belt, and who now has the professional title of Vice President of Business Development for Axiom. He will be joined by three fee-paying crewmates – Larry Connor of the United States, Eytan Stibbe of Israel and Mark Pathy of Canada – who each dished out an estimated $55 million to Axiom in order to take the journey into orbit. (Axiom did not publicly disclose the specific financial details of the trip.)\n\nHere is what you should know about the upcoming Axiom spaceflight, whichcomes as a handful of private companies are seeking to commercialize the space beyond our planet’s surface.\n\nWhat is Axiom Space?\n\nAxiom Space, the Houston-based company overseeing the entire mission, does not build launch vehicles or rockets like some of the other players in the emerging private spaceflight industry such as Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic.\n\nThe company arranges so-called “private astronaut” missions to the ISS, which includes seventeen weeks of training and custom itineraries based on the individual goals of those wealthy enough to afford the trip. Ax-1 is the company’s first of these planned trips to the ISS, and late last year NASA and Axiom announced Ax-2 is targeting to launch between fall 2022 and spring 2023. In addition to its human spaceflight services, Axiom also offers on its website opportunities for companies and individuals seeking to access space for research purposes.\n\nThe Ax-1 Crew during Zero-G flight training. Courtesy Axiom Space\n\nNASA uses the term “private astronaut missions” to refer to “missions that are privately funded, fully commercial spaceflights on a commercial launch vehicle for the purpose of enabling tourism, outreach, commercial research, and approved commercial and marketing activities on the space station.” Referring to ultra-wealthy thrill seekers with the title of “astronaut,” however, has spurred heated debates over its definition online in recent years.\n\nIn January 2020, NASA selected Axiom to provide at least one habitable commercial module to be added to the ISS’s Harmony node in 2024. Axiom said it has plans to have its module be ready to detach from the station by late 2028, and operate as the first building block of a private commercial space station.\n\nAxiom’s lofty plans to build the first private space station and pioneer the commercialization of low-Earth orbit are what it sees as setting itself apart from others in the budding private space industry. The company even touts the Ax-1 mission as “an important step toward Axiom’s goal of constructing a private space station in low-Earth orbit that can serve as a global academic and commercial hub.”\n\nBuilding a commercial destination in low-Earth orbit\n\nAxiom CEO Michael Suffredini, a 30-year veteran of NASA who served as the ISS program manager from 2005 to 2015, described Ax-1 during a pre-launch news conference last week as a “precursor mission” to the company’s plans of eventually assembling and launching its fully commercial space station in orbit.\n\nWhile Axiom is partnering with SpaceX to launch its private astronauts, “SpaceX is just a taxi,” John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs, told CNN Business of the role of Musk’s company in this Axiom mission.\n\nLogsdon, who was the founder and longtime director of GW’s Space Policy Institute, added that he sees Axiom’s inaugural private astronaut mission as “the first step in a process that could result in one or more private space stations doing a variety of things in low Earth orbit.”\n\n“We’ve had the International Space Station in orbit, with people aboard, since the year 2000,” Logsdon added. “NASA says it will de-orbit itin 2030 or so and turn over the use of low-Earth orbit to the private sector.”\n\nAx-1 Crew (left to right) Mark Pathy, Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe in SpaceX Crew Dragon during training. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nAxiom Space “is the first of the private sector ventures getting ready for that transition,” according to Logsdon. He noted that construction of the first Axiom space station modules are already underway abroad, and it is slated to be shipped to Houston for final assembly next year ahead of their tentative launch in 2024.\n\n“Like all entrepreneurial investments, there’s a high risk of failure, but a possibility, a very real possibility, of success – success in terms of economic payoffs from doing things in space,” Logsdon said. In February 2021, Axiom said it raised some $130 million from investors, adding that the “new financing will accelerate the growth of Axiom’s workforce and construction of its privately developed space station.”\n\nWhile private astronauts seeking to venture beyond Earth’s surface can potentially strike a launch deal directly with SpaceX – as billionaire Jared Isaacman did last year for his self-funded Inspiration4 mission – Logsdon says the purpose of Axiom’s mission is “fundamentally different than Inspiration4.”\n\nLogsdon said these trips are the first step in the process toward Axiom’s primary goal of constructing a commercial space station to replace the ISS. The Inspiration4 mission was “basically a tourist ride,” he added.\n\nWhile it will likely be years before opportunities to visit a commercial space station become available to more than just the wealthy, Logsdon notes that a private space station could provide benefits beyond vacations for the rich – especially if the ISS is retired as planned and scientists, engineers and other researchers look for alternatives.\n\nThe privatization of human spaceflight is becoming an increasingly crowded sector amid the rise of a handful of space tourism ventures. However, Axiom CEO Suffredini said during last Friday’s news conference that he thinks the company’s plan of creating the first commercial space station – and launching the first commercial module to be added onto the ISS in 2024 – gives the company a novel “business plan.”\n\n“We think it does put us in a good place relative to the competition, but we’re happy that there are others that are going to help us grow the LEO [low-earth orbit] economy along the way,” Suffredini said.\n\nLogsdon said he has been watching human spaceflight launches for decades and was at the Kennedy Space Center for the Apollo 11 launch that put the first humans on the moon back in 1969. While the private sector’s foray into spaceflight has muddled some of the initial intrigue, he said he’s still planning on tuning in for the launch.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}]}

That's especially the case for Maine and parts of western Washington and Oregon.\n\nAcross the South and much of the Atlantic coast into southern New England, the forecast calls for greater chances of a wetter than normal winter, said NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. Parts of the Northwest, Mountain West and Great Lakes could see greater chances of below-normal precipitation.\n\n“El Niño is here and still growing stronger,” said Robert Rohde, lead scientist for Berkeley Earth, an independent nonprofit focused on climate analysis. The naturally occurring climate pattern occurs when trade winds weaken over the tropical Pacific Ocean and push warmer water east toward South America.\n\nThe combination of El Niño and the ongoing abnormally warm temperatures in the oceans and atmosphere make it harder to accurately predict what may happen in the months ahead, meteorologists and climate scientists said this week.\n\nHow does El Niño typically impact winter in the US?\n\n◾ The southern third of the U.S. typically experiences wetter-than-average conditions, while the northern third sees higher chances for below-normal precipitation.\n\n◾ Conditions can be much wetter on the Gulf Coast and in Florida.\n\n◾ Wetter than normal in parts of California.\n\n◾ Drier than normal in Ohio Valley and the Northwest.\n\n◾ Increased chances for tornadoes in Central and South Florida.\n\nWarm temperatures may interfere with El Niño pattern\n\nLingering warm ocean temperatures make the forecast for the coming months particularly challenging this year, meteorologist Scott Handel, the climate center’s head of forecast operations, wrote in a Monday forecast.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña are two phases of a multiyear cycle that takes place near and along the equator in the Pacific Ocean. Both can have widespread influence over weather in the U.S. and around the globe. Temperature differences influence the positioning of the jet stream that controls much of the nation's weather, with drier air to the north and wetter weather across the South during El Niño winters. But that influence isn't always the same.\n\nGraphics: El Niño could return in 2023; what that means for the world&#39;s weather\n\nDiscerning how conditions might respond to El Niño and the record warmth in many locations is one of the “major forecast challenges,” Rohde said. “El Niño effects will play a large role on weather patterns in coming months, but the unusual conditions in other ocean basins may make weather patterns this year harder to predict than in other El Niño years.\"\n\nCombined, they're also contributing to a rise in global temperatures that is even faster than we would expect from an El Niño transition alone, Rohde said Tuesday.\n\nEarlier this year, seasonal hurricane forecasters expected El Niño to increase wind shear over the Atlantic Ocean and break apart tropical storms and hurricanes. But evidenced by the fact that the season could see its 17th named storm later this week, scientists say record warm ocean temperatures outweighed much of the typical El Niño influence on tropical cyclones. The official season total of 18 includes an unnamed system in January.\n\nA similar phenomenon may occur this winter, with lingering warm temperatures having an outsized influence, forecasters said.\n\nThere's a lot going on in the global atmosphere and ocean sphere, Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in his Weather West, a California weather and climate perspectives blog last week. \"With record-breaking ocean warmth and a strong or very strong El Niño in place through the winter, it raises the risk of worsening drought in the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii. But it increases the odds of a wetter than usual winter in California.\"\n\nThe latest forecast shows the South with equal chances of above or below-normal temperatures this winter.\n\nEl Niño strengthening\n\nHere's the latest from seasonal forecasts:\n\n◾ There's a 95% chance El Niño will linger through March.\n\n◾ Chances for a strong El Niño by late fall and into January have climbed to 70%.\n\n◾ Chances for a \"very strong\" El Niño have climbed to 30%.\n\nWhat does El Niño and other warmth mean for global average temperatures in 2023?\n\nWith the boost from El Niño, it is likely that 2023 will have the warmest global annual average since instrumental measurements began in 1850, Rohde told USA TODAY.\n\n“The Earth right now is far warmer than the previously measured record for this time of year,” he posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Even with a growing El Niño, the pace and size of the uptick that we've seen this year is pretty shocking.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2024/01/11/winter-storm-iowa-blizzard-live-updates-be-prepared-parking-511-national-weather-service-forecast/72189570007/", "title": "Blizzard hits Iowa with snow, gusty winds; extreme cold expected", "text": "While the last of blizzard conditions are expected to end Saturday night in Iowa, what's expected to be one of the longest periods of sub-zero temperatures in decades is setting in, with life-threatening wind chill.\n\nHere are the latest updates.\n\n5:15 p.m. Some actual good news about the weather\n\nThe National Weather Service included a long list of bad news/good news in its latest forecast guidance on Sunday. It acknowledged that little of it, such as a Wednesday \"warm up\" that can only be described as such because the temperatures will finally rise somewhat above zero, was arguably all that good. But there was one undeniably positive nugget at the end of the list: Late in the weekend of Jan. 20 and 21, the weather appears likely to take a turn for the better.\n\n\"There is a consistent signal for a pattern change arriving around next Sunday and Monday, Jan 21-22 that may result in much warmer temperatures,\" it said.\n\nThe guidance added that it's too early for a forecast of just how much higher temperatures will go.\n\n\"That is in the day 7-8 time range and not all included in this forecast,\" it said. \"Until then, stay warm!\"\n\n3:20 p.m. Return to normal will be slow on Iowa roads, IDOT says\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation in a Facebook posting says condition on the state's roads have improved since Saturday, when sections of Interstate 80 and other highways around the state were impassable because of ice and blowing snow. But there are still trouble spots.\n\n\"We'll be using snow blowers to move the snow further back away from the road, but this is a slow process,\" IDOT said, adding \"It could take up to a week to get the mess cleaned up because ditches are full and high winds will continue to cause drifting snow.\"\n\nIt cautioned motorist to slow down, use extra caution and pay attention to what's on the road ahead.\n\n2:15 p.m. Where was it coldest overnight?\n\nThe National Weather Service says the lowest temperature it recorded before dawn Sunday was in Pocahontas in northwest Iowa, with a reading of 21 degrees below zero. Here are other lows from around the state on a day when the high in Des Moines is slated to reach just minus 9 degrees:\n\nAmes -17\n\nBoone -20\n\nCedar Rapids -18\n\nCouncil Bluffs -17\n\nDavenport -15\n\nDes Moines -17\n\nDubuque -15\n\nFort Dodge -18\n\nIowa City -16\n\nMason City -15\n\nOttumwa -20\n\nWaterloo -14\n\nWind chills ranged as low as 45 degrees below zero.\n\n1:30 p.m. Authorities clear path through storm for mom in labor\n\nFrom the Marshall County Sheriff's Office comes an account of how deputies and other first responders worked in blizzard conditions to ensure a woman in labor got the care she and her baby needed.\n\nA news release from the sheriff's office said the call for help came at 11:20 p.m. Saturday, while a blizzard warning remained in effect, and deputies were dispatched to the woman's home. Unable to reach her home because of road conditions, they hiked a half mile to reach her as Marshall County communications center personnel remained in contact with her, it said.\n\nThe Clemons Fire Department, meanwhile, was able to secure a tractor to clear a path so a Unity Point ambulance could reach the home, the release said. It said the woman gave birth at 12:38 a.m. and she and the baby were taken to the hospital.\n\n8:30 a.m. A very low high in Iowa\n\nThe overnight temperature at Des Moines International Airport on Saturday into Sunday, minus 17 degrees, didn't set a record, but the forecast daytime high today could match the one for a Jan. 14: 9 degrees below zero, last seen in 1888, 136 years ago, Allan Curtis, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Johnston, said Sunday morning. With gusty winds, the wind chill could hover around minus 40.\n\nAnd even the low is impressive, if not record-breaking: It's the lowest temperature recorded for a Jan. 14 in Des Moines since 1901 ― 123 years ago ― and tied for second place after a reading of minus 19 in 1888.. It's also the lowest for a January day, or any winter day, since a minus 20 reading in January 2019 ― five years. Wind chill, a more modern statistic, bottomed out at minus 43 degrees just before midnight.\n\nBrace for more. The overnight low for Sunday into Monday is forecast to be only slight less low, at minus 17, with a high on Monday, Iowa Caucuses day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, of minus 5 degrees. The temperature is expected to fall to minus 11 degrees Monday night, with a wind chill of minus 30.\n\nThe low temperature isn't expected to return to positive territory until Wednesday, when it will be 5 degrees.\n\n\"That'll feel awfully warm and balmy by that point,\" said Curtis.\n\nAnother wave of sub-zeros lows is forecast to arrive Thursday and Friday, at minus 3 and minus 12, respectively.\n\nWant some good weather news? At least the blizzard warning is gone in Iowa. It expired at midnight for the 17 counties in which it remained in effect.\n\n10:05 p.m. Another reel of weather photos from the Iowa State Patrol\n\nHere's yet another Facebook collection of shots from Iowa State Patrol troopers patrolling the state's icy roads in a historic winter storm.\n\n10 p.m. Saturday overnight could be worst of cold snap\n\nThe latest National Weather Service forecast has dropped tonight's overnight low to 18 degrees below zero ― the lowest expected in a period of frigid arctic air that's not expected to produce a low temperature above zero until Wednesday, and then only barely. The low and accompanying wind chill of 45 degrees below zero ― yes, you read that right ― is expected around 3 a.m.\n\nThis is the kind of weather when pipes can freeze and burst. If you haven't already taken precautions, here are some things you can do:\n\nLeave faucets slowly dripping to keep water flowing through the pipes. The water can be captured in a bucket and used for other purposes around the home, like watering plants and washing dishes.\n\nOpen under-sink cabinets to allow warm air to circulate near your pipes.\n\nWhat if there’s no water coming out of your faucets? Check your water meter. If water is leaking or spraying from your meter or the bottom is cracked, your water meter is frozen. Feel for frozen pipes. Pipes located along exterior walls are most susceptible to freezing. To thaw pipes, contact a licensed plumber or use hot towels or a hair dryer. Never use an open flame.\n\nAlso, if you can, get your car into a garage or at least under a carport. Extreme cold is murder on the battery. Even a few degrees can make a difference.\n\nAnd above all, stay inside if you can. Even if tonight is the coldest, it won't be much warmer Sunday or Monday nights.\n\n7:30 p.m. Another speeder on slippery roads\n\nFor the second time in a matter of hours, the Iowa State Patrol reported that a trooper had stopped a vehicle traveling at more than 90 mph on roads so slick with snow and ice that travel was not advised. In a posting on Facebook, it said the SUV, clocked at 94 mph, was stopped on Interstate 80 near Council Bluffs on Saturday morning. The other car, traveling at 92 mph, had been stopped Friday in northwest Iowa.\n\n\"Most people would say that 94 MPH is unbelievable during a blizzard,\" the state patrol commented. \"Unfortunately, these speeds are still happening...\"\n\n7 p.m. Blizzard warning extended to midnight\n\nThe planned 6 p.m. conclusion for a National Weather Service blizzard warning came and went, but the blizzard conditions didn't.\n\nThe weather service instead chose to continue the warning for 17 Iowa counties until midnight. It said up to an inch of additional snow is expected in the affected area along and north of Highway 30, mainly in the state's northwest but also including Story and Boone counties in central Iowa. Winds will continue to gust up to 40 mph, above the 35 mph threshold for blizzard conditions, and visibility will fall to a quarter mile or less, another blizzard criterion.\n\nThe winds are expected to abate somewhat after midnight, the weather service said, and the focus is turning to the extreme cold building over the state. It said in forecast guidance that the temperature at its Johnston office was zero just before noon Saturday and fell to 5 below by 2 p.m. Maurice in far northwest Iowa reported a temperature of minus 15 and if certain conditions align, the Nishnabotna River valley in western Iowa also could see temperatures plummet, it said.\n\nThe wind chill warning blanketing all but the northeasternmost portion of Iowa will remain in effect until noon Tuesday, with the forecast calling for lows of minus 16 both Saturday and Sunday nights in Des Moines and minus 11 on Monday, Caucus Day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The high that day is expected to be minus 3, and only on Wednesday night will the forecast low creep back above zero, at 3 degrees.\n\nThroughout, wind chills will be life threateningly low: 40 below on Saturday and Sunday nights and 35 below on Monday night.\n\nAnother round of deep subzero temperatures is expected to begin Friday.\n\n6:10 p.m. Despite historic storm, crime goes on in Des Moines, keeping police busy\n\nDes Moines police said they have received more than 778 calls for service since Friday morning during the blizzard. But three-quarters of them weren't for what you'd expect: weather-related crashes and stalled vehicles.\n\nInstead, police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek said in a Facebook posting, the calls involved the sorts of cases that officers handle whether or not there's bad weather: multiple thefts, assaults, stabbings and a shooting report.\n\nAmong them:\n\nAn alleged violent attempted theft of a car. Parizek said a motorist picked up a pedestrian who seemed to need assistance shortly after 6 a.m. Friday, and that the man, identified as Jermaine Shetworth Ware, 28, began to assault the 50-year-old in an attempt to steal the car. When Ware failed, Parizek, said he flagged down another motorist on Interstate 235 and stole that car. The Iowa State Patrol stopped the car after a brief chase north of Des Moines and arrested Ware, Parizek said. Ware remained in the Polk County Jail late Saturday.\n\nA hit-and-run accident shortly after 1 p.m. Friday at Southeast 14th Street and Park Avenue. A patrol officer witnessed the accident but because of the weather was unable to pursue the driver, who sped away. A short time later, Parizek said, the apparently intoxicated driver was found with his vehicle stuck in a snowdrift not far from the accident scene. He said the man, 42, was charged with OWI and hit and run.\n\nA stabbing around 2:30 p.m. in the 2300 block of Dean Ave. The victim was taken to a hospital in serious condition was expected to survive, Parizek said. A suspect was identified and the investigation continues.\n\nA report of gunshots just after 10 p.m. Friday in the 6100 block of Winona Ave. Officers called to the scene found evidence of gunfire, Parizek said, but no one apparently had been wounded. He said detectives continue to investigate.\n\n6 p.m. Johnson County requests no travel until noon Sunday\n\nCiting continued poor travel conditions, despite the lifting of a blizzard warning, Johnson County officials are asking resident and visitors to stay put and remain off roads until noon Sunday.\n\n\"Road conditions remain poor and light snow and blowing snow is expected to reduce visibility and road conditions in the overnight hours,\" they said in a news release. \"Whiteout conditions and significant blowing and drifting snow is occurring in open areas and this will create dangerous conditions. These coupled with the danger(ous) temperature and wind chill are not safe for anyone to be outdoors.\"\n\nThey cited not only the risk to stranded motorists, but to the law enforcement and emergency services dispatched to rescue them.\n\n\"There will be enough emergencies in these conditions, please stay home to reduce the potential to create more,\" they said.\n\nMotorists are encouraged to utilize the Iowa DOT 511 site, https://511ia.org\n\nto evaluate road conditions. If you have an emergency and must travel, please dress appropriately and prepare your vehicle with first aid and winter travel supplies.\n\nThe priority message from the Johnson County Emergency Management –\n\nDo your part; stay home, stay safe, and help keep Emergency Services off the roads.\n\n3:40 p.m. West Des Moines extends parking ban\n\nThe city of West Des Moines has extended its emergency parking ban until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThe ban, which began on Thursday at 10 p.m., applies to all streets in West Des Moines. Parking while under the ban could result in a $50 fine and towing.\n\n3:25 p.m. Des Moines metro out of blizzard warning\n\nThe National Weather Service has lifted the blizzard warning for the Des Moines metro, reducing it to 17 counties, including Story and Boone, through 6 p.m. Most are in northwest Iowa.\n\nThe lifting of the warning, which had been in effect since Friday, came as wind gusts dropped below the 35 mph threshold for blizzard conditions. But roads remain extremely hazardous, with slippery conditions, occasional whiteouts and plenty of accidents. And the forecast calls for unfavorable conditions to continue, with gusting winds through at least Monday night.\n\n1:45 p.m. I-80 finally passable\n\nImpassable since Friday evening, the stretch of Interstate 80 from Victor in Iowa County to Tiffin in Johnson County is now more-or-less drivable, the Iowa 511 road conditions site reports. But the Iowa State Patrol and other police agencies, including Des Moines police, continue to advise against any unnecessary travel. And numerous other parts of Iowa's road system, including a stretch of I-80 from Stuart to west of Brayton and Interstate 35 from Highway 5 in West Des Moines to Van Wert, remain in sketchy shape, covered with snow.\n\nEarlier, several cars were stuck for five hours in blowing snow on I-80 after semitrailers jackknifed in the slippery roadway, blocking traffic and leaving 100 vehicles trapped, according to The Associated Press. Altogether, state troopers handled 86 crashes and 535 motorist-assist calls since Friday, State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla told the AP on Saturday afternoon.\n\n1:15 p.m. Des Moines firefighters: Please lend a hand\n\nThere's nothing much more challenging than fighting a fire in the middle of heavy snow and extreme cold. So in a posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Des Moines Fire Department has a request for residents: If you're out shoveling and see a fire hydrant buried in a snowbank, please clear it off.\n\n11:45 a.m. Des Moines Catholic diocese says mass not obligatory in dangerous weather\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines on its home page says parishioners are not obligated to attend weekend masses amid blizzard conditions and dangerous wind chill. Some pastors may choose not to hold mass, it said.\n\n\"While situations differ across the diocese, canceling a Mass is a legitimate option for pastors during such weather,\" it said. \"If someone is concerned about making it to Mass on Sunday because of the weather and road conditions, know they are not obligated to do that which is unsafe.\"\n\nOther churches and religious institutions also may be canceling in-person services, so check before setting out.\n\n11:30 a.m. Grimes and Waukee have a message for drivers: Don't\n\nGrimes and neighboring Waukee in Saturday news releases are advising residents to stay off the roads.\n\n\"The Iowa DOT is still listing roads in the metro as 'travel not advised'. Please stay home unless you have to leave for an emergency and check the latest road conditions at 511ia.org,\" Grimes said in its message, adding that it is extending its snow ordinance banning parking on city streets to 8 p.m. Sunday.\n\n\"Our crews are still out, but the winds are continuing to cause significant drifting,\" it said. \"They will be able to clear more extensively tomorrow.\"\n\nWaukee's message was similar.\n\n\"Blizzard conditions continue. Stay home and off the roads unless it absolutely necessary to be out,\" its release said. \"Lots of cars are getting stuck in the snow which slows down the plows and makes roads more hazardous. Wind gusts will continue to make travel dangerous with low visibility and drifting snow.\"\n\nIt said a street parking ban has been extended to 5 p.m. Sunday to keep thoroughfares clear for plowing. Violators will be fined $25 and/or towed, it said.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools announced they were canceling all Saturday activities.\n\n10:10 a.m. Despite warnings, motorist getting stranded; speeder clocked at 92\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation's Iowa 511 road conditions page posts warning about roads that are impassable. Despite that, the Iowa State Patrol says, motorists continue to attempt to traverse those roads and are becoming stranded. Meanwhile, temperatures across the state are in single digits and dropping.\n\nThe recklessness was even more extreme in one case: The state patrol reported stopping a driver on Interstate 35 in northern Iowa who was going 92 mph in the winter storm. \"Ridiculous and unacceptable,\" it commented on Facebook.\n\n8:45 a.m. Cancellations, flight delays continue at Des Moines airport\n\nAfter a day of flight delays and cancellations Friday because of blizzard conditions, the flight disruptions continued early Saturday at Des Moines International Airport. The airport's online flight status page showed cancelations beginning at 6 a.m. with an American Airlines flight to Washington and a United Airlines flight to Houston.\n\nThe airport said its crews were working to keep runway clear, and urged travelers to consult their airline's website or app before leaving to catch flights.\n\n7:30 a.m. Blizzard warning ends for much of Iowa, but continues in Polk, Story, other counties; I-80 has detour\n\nThe National Weather Service early Saturday reduced the blizzard warning that had blanketed most of Iowa, leaving it in place until 6 p.m. for 22 counties including Polk and Story.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect throughout the state, with a winter weather advisory for extreme northeast Iowa.\n\nThe weather service said in forecast guidance that the eastern portion of the state can expect blizzard-strength winds, with gusts above 35 mph, to \"level off,\" and visibility to improve to 1 mile through the early afternoon, above the quarter-mile limit of blizzard conditions.\n\nIt said the other counties also will see some lessening of wind speeds, but that with another inch of snow expected, it was not enough to warrant lowering the blizzard warning.\n\nThe wind chill forecast remained unchanged: For the Des Moines metro, an early morning high of 3 degrees Saturday, falling to temperatures below zero by about 3 p.m. and bottoming out overnight around 14 below, with wind chill as low as minus 40.\n\nConditions are expected to be similar on Monday, Iowa Caucuses day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, with a midafternoon high of minus 2 and an evening low of 14 below, accompanied by life-threatening wind chill of 30 or more below zero.\n\nTravel remains hazardous, but the Iowa Department of Transportation reported that a portion of Interstate 80 from Victor to Tiffin, impassable because of blowing snow and accidents, could be bypassed via U.S. 6. Still, it warned on its Iowa 511 website that that route also is snow-covered, and \"travel is not advised.\"\n\n3 a.m. Travel remains extremely hazardous, but some improvement expected\n\nThe historic onslaught of winter weather continues across Iowa.\n\nThe Iowa 511 website shows both east- and westbound Interstate 80 remain impassable from Victor in Iowa County to Coralville in Johnson County because of blowing snow. Even with less-than-expected snowfall north and west from Audubon to Hampton, wind gusts to 45 mph and whiteouts are expected to continue to make travel throughout most of Iowa hazardous throughout the day Saturday.\n\nAs of 10 p.m. Friday, the Iowa State Patrol said on its Facebook page it had provided 436 motorist assists and responded to responded to 72 crashes, including one in which a trooper's cruiser was damaged by a semi unable to stop on I-80 near Williamsburg because of icy conditions. The trooper was uninjured.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Johnston says blizzard conditions are expected to abate later Saturday morning in east and northeast Iowa, where the blizzard warning will be lowered to a winter weather advisory. But it said that from I-35 west and I-80 north, the warning will continue, and travel should be restricted to emergencies only.\n\nThe chief hazard will gradually shift to life-threatening cold. The temperature is forecast to fall continually over the next 24 hours, hitting a low of minus 14 degrees in Des Moines early Sunday, with a windchill of nearly 45 degrees below zero. Sunday's high is expected to be minus 6 degrees. Another inch-plus of snowfall is expected, adding to what already is projected to be the second-greatest accumulation in a five-day period recorded in the state.\n\n\"The period of extreme, life threatening wind chill will continue Sunday night into Monday with late morning and afternoon wind chills rising to the 20 to 30 below, only to fall to 30 to 35 below Monday evening,\" the weather service said in 3 a.m. forecast guidance, adding, \"Our only day of respite from the cold will be Wednesday as a weak wave tracks southeast from the Northern Plains.\"\n\n7:35 p.m. Road conditions deteriorate across Iowa; I-80 impassable\n\nConditions on Iowa roadways deteriorated dramatically as the blizzard intensified across the state.\n\nInterstate 80 west of the I-80/Interstate 380 interchange near Victor was impassable in both directions due to drifting snow, icy conditions and crashed vehicles, according to the Iowa Department of Transportation.\n\nThe DOT in a news release traffic should avoid that section of Iowa's main east-west highway until conditions improve.\n\nSurrounding roadways like I-380 and U.S. 218 also were experiencing significant amounts of drifting snow, which the DOT said may make them \"difficult or impossible to travel on as the night progresses.\"\n\nThe Iowa 511 traffic conditions page also reported numerous other Iowa roadways as blocked or impassable because of accidents and drifting snow and recommended against travel on I-80 and Interstates 235 and 35 in Des Moines, as well as much of U.S. 65.\n\nSeveral counties, including Johnston and Story, and cities, including Urbadale and Altoona, suspended snowplowing, say high winds and drifting snow made the work too hazardous to continue.\n\n6:45 p.m. Storm close to record\n\nThe National Weather Service says the snowstorm that began Thursday and the one that preceded it this week have dumped snow at a nearly record-setting pace.\n\nMeteorologist Chad Hahn at the weather service's Johnston office said Friday night that by the end of the current snowstorm, an estimated 21.3 inches of snow that will have fallen in the past five days.\n\nThat would about an inch-and-a-half shy of the all-time record for Iowa and ahead of the second-place snowfall, making it the most five-day snowfall in 82 years.\n\nThe current top five-day snowfalls are:\n\n22.7 inches from Dec. 28, 1941, to Jan. 1, 1942. 20.2 inches from March 14-18, 1923. 17.7 inches from Dec. 5-9, 2009\n\n5:18 p.m. Latest snowfall totals\n\nThe National Weather Service says 8 inches of snow had fallen in Des Moines by 5 p.m. in the latest storm, on top of 11.2 inches that fell in the previous winter storm that concluded Tuesday. Other totals include 8 to 10 inches in the Iowa City area, 10.5 inches in Osceola, 11 inches in Davenport, 11.5 inches in Council Bluffs, about 12 inches around Washington and Clinton, 13 inches in Muscatine, and, tops for the state, 14 inches around Fairfield.

On Dec. 24, Des Moines had a high temperature of 58 degrees, 15 degrees above average. Now, within about a week in January the NWS has issued almost every type of winter weather watch or warning, except for an ice storm warning. In the last week the NWS has issued a blizzard warning, winter storm warnings, winter storm watches, winter weather advisories, wind chill warnings, wind chill watches and wind chill advisories.\n\nOn Wednesday night the weather service even issued a rare snow squall warning when a snow squall hit the Des Moines Metro area. The snow Friday will make travel conditions dangerous, but sub-zero temperatures will settle in through at least Tuesday, according to the NWS. Arctic air will spill into the Midwest, and could lead to record low temperatures of negative 20 degrees or negative 30 degrees, according to an NWS forecast.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools, others cancel classes for Friday ahead of blizzard; Some city buildings close.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools announced Thursday afternoon that classes will be canceled for Friday due to the forecast. All activities are canceled, and Metro Kids Care is closed. All offices will be closed.\n\nOther large metro school districts including Johnston, Southeast Polk and Waukee have also canceled Friday classes. Urbandale had a previously scheduled professional work day without classes on Friday. Staff will work remote and child care will not be available.\n\nStory County offices and buildings will be closed on Friday because of the snow. Grimes also announced its buildings were closed.\n\nNWS issues blizzard warning for most of Iowa on Friday\n\nA blizzard warning will be in effect from 10 a.m. Friday until 6 a.m. Saturday in northwest and central Iowa, according to the National Weather Service. In eastern Iowa, a blizzard warning starts at 5 p.m. Friday and extends until noon on Saturday.\n\nWind gusts as high as 40 mph are expected Friday afternoon and night, which will blow around snow and reduce visibility. Travel is expected to be very difficult, and is recommended to be avoided if possible.\n\nWhat's the difference between a blizzard warning and a winter storm warning?\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued for frequent gusts greater than or equal to 35 mph accompanied by falling and/or blowing snow, according to NWS. Blizzards frequently reduce visibility to less than 1/4 mile for three hours or more.\n\nA blizzard warning means severe winter weather conditions are expected — as in the case right now — or already occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely, leading to whiteout conditions making travel extremely difficult.\n\nNWS recommends Iowans not travel during a blizzard warning. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle and wait for help to arrive.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued for a significant winter weather event that includes snow, ice, sleet or blowing snow or a combination of these hazards. Travel is often difficult or impossible when winter storm warnings are in effect. If a winter storm warning is in effect, you should consider delaying your travel plans until conditions improve.\n\nDes Moines Performing Arts postpones STOMP performances\n\nPerformances by musical group STOMP, originally scheduled Jan. 12-14 at the Des Moines Civic Center, have been postponed due to “anticipated weather conditions,” according to a Thursday evening press release.\n\nAccording to the release, all four performances have been rescheduled for June 21-23.

There is also a chance of freezing rain in the morning on Friday.\n\nHow much snow will Iowa get?\n\nThe NWS says significant snow will come to most of the state. Snow could fall at as much as an inch an hour during the overnight hours on Thursday. Wind gusts of 35-45 miles per hour will create \"near-blizzard\" conditions and could create whiteout conditions.\n\nMost of the state is looking at 5-10 inches of snowfall with the heaviest areas landing around Des Moines, Ames and Carroll. Heavier pockets are also possible around Waterloo and Dubuque.\n\nDes Moines has gotten a lot of snow this week. Will it set another record?\n\nMaybe! The official total at the Des Moines International Airport from the first snowstorm this week was 11.2 inches.\n\nThe current 5-day record in Des Moines is 22.7 inches (Dec. 28, 1941 - Jan. 1, 1942), according to a post from the NWS. If Des Moines gets 10 more inches, we won't break that record. But, we could break the second-place record of 20.2 inches (March 14-18, 1923).\n\nDART expects bus service delays as snow approaches\n\nWinter weather will likely delay metro bus services Thursday evening through Saturday, and especially on Friday, according to a news release from the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority.\n\nThose using DART Paratransit, On Demand, or Flex Connect services, should prepare for ride delays depending on the amount of snowfall and blizzard-like conditions, DART officials said. DART officials will not be able to pick up or drop off passengers in parking lots that have not been plowed.\n\nHere are the possible service delays depending on the amount of snowfall, according to DART:\n\n2 to 3 inches of snow: Pick-up times could be delayed by 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nPick-up times could be delayed by 30 to 60 minutes. 3 to 5 inches: Pick-up times could be delayed by 60 minutes or more.\n\nPick-up times could be delayed by 60 minutes or more. 5 to 8 inches: Pick-up times could be significantly delayed by more than 60 minutes. Customers with non-critical trips are asked to reschedule trips for another day.\n\nBuses running more than 20 minutes late will be posted on ⁠DART's website.\n\nHow cold will temperatures get in Iowa?\n\nThe winter storm will also be accompanied by bitter cold temperatures.\n\nHighs across the state will be in the teens to mid-20s on Thursday and will drop into the single digits by Saturday.\n\nWind gusts will be in the 30-40 miles per hour range through the weekend. Wind chills will reach their lowest levels on Sunday with ranges in the -20 to -45 range across the state.\n\nAre snow ordinances and parking bans in place in central Iowa?\n\nParking restrictions automatically kick in for most cities in central Iowa once 2 inches of snow have fallen.

When the water cools at least 0.9 degree Fahrenheit below average for three straight months, a La Niña is declared.\n\n\"While this may sound like a small change in temperature, it can cause significant changes in the weather patterns around the globe,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Brian Lada.\n\nMore:Early forecast says summer 2024 is set to be unusually hot across most of USA\n\nIt is one of the main drivers of weather in the United States, especially during the late fall, winter and early spring. It's the opposite to the more well-known El Niño, which occurs when Pacific Ocean water is at least 0.9 degree warmer than average for three months.\n\nThe most recent El Niño peaked in December and will go down as one of the five strongest in history, the World Meteorological Organization said.\n\nCan La Niña worsen the Atlantic hurricane season?\n\nAccording to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña can contribute to an increase in Atlantic hurricane activity by weakening the wind shear over the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic basin, which allows storms to develop and intensify.\n\nIt's one of the reasons forecasters have predicted a \"hyperactive\" hurricane season in the Atlantic basin this year, with one forecast expecting as many as 33 named storms. An average year sees 14.\n\nWind shear refers to the change in wind speed and direction between roughly 5,000 and 35,000 feet above the ground, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Strong vertical wind shear can rip a developing hurricane apart, or even prevent it from forming. This is what can happen in the Atlantic during an El Niño when Atlantic hurricane activity is often suppressed.\n\nWhile La Niña tends to increase hurricanes in the Atlantic, it also tends to decrease their numbers in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean basins.\n\nWhat does La Niña mean for weather in the US?\n\nLa Niña and El Niño typically have minimal impact on summer weather in the U.S., other than the effect on hurricanes. Winter is the one season when they have the most impact.\n\nA typical La Niña winter in the U.S. brings cold and snow to the Northwest and unusually dry conditions to most of the Southern states, according to the Climate Prediction Center. The Southeast and mid-Atlantic also tend to see higher-than-average temperatures during a La Niña winter.\n\nMeanwhile, New England and the Upper Midwest into New York tend to see lower-than-average temperatures, the Weather Channel said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/10/20/tennessee-winter-2023-2024-outlook-el-nio/71252698007/", "title": "What NOAA winter 2023-2024 outlook means for Tennessee on El ...", "text": "Brrrr – did someone turn on the air conditioning? No, that's just winter creeping in.\n\nThis year, winter is going to be a little different than it has been in the past few years. December to February is expected to have varying weather all across the United States, and Tennessee gets to be a part of that weather change too.\n\nBack again after a few years, an El Niño weather pattern is here to stir up the winter season and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's winter outlook is predicting wetter conditions compared to previous years. In short, this means chillier conditions during the next few months.\n\n“An enhanced southern jet stream and associated moisture often present during strong El Nino events supports high odds for above-average precipitation for the Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast states this winter,” said Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of the Climate Prediction Center.\n\nHere is everything you need to know:\n\nIs 2023 an El Niño year?\n\nIn short, yes. El Niño is around again for the first time since the 2018-2019 winter. It officially started on June 8 and is expected to last through February. This means that some people in the U.S. will have wetter than usual winters and some people will have drier winters than usual.\n\nWhat happens during El Niño?\n\nAccording to NOAA, trade winds weaken during El Niño. Warm water is pushed back east, toward the west coast of the Americas. This warmer water causes the Pacific jet stream to move south compared to where it lies during La Niña. As a result of this shift, areas in the northern U.S. and Canada are dryer and warmer than usual, but the Gulf Coast and Southeast have wetter than usual periods with increased flooding.\n\nHow long does El Niño last?\n\nEl Niño will last from December 2023 to February 2024. During these three months, the weather is skewed from traditional respects. El Niño comes around every two to seven years. There is no way to predict when the next one arrives until we are in the cycle.\n\nHow will El Niño affect winter in Tennessee?\n\nNOAA predicts wetter-than-average conditions for northern Alaska, portions of the West, the southern Plains, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast and the lower mid-Atlantic. Tennesseans should make sure to get those ice scrapers and shovels out. A wet winter means the snow is likely to stick more. Snow can stick to itself and pile up more, but it can also stick more to roads and cars making travel dangerous. Wet snow is also heavier than regular snow, meaning that it will be heavier to shovel than regular, dry snow.\n\nThe forecasts do not predict how much precipitation will happen during winter, only that it is predicted to be heavier than usual.\n\nDespite the wet winter meaning the cold weather clings to you more, temperatures are predicted to be a little above in parts of Tennessee. However, this does not mean this winter will be shorts and shirts weather. The wetter atmosphere means the cold weather is going to chill more compared to dry weather, so make sure to get your coats, hats, and mitts out.\n\nWill it snow in Tennessee?\n\nThis winter forecast does not specify how much precipitation will fall as rain, snow or ice, only that more or less is likely overall. Snow forecasts depend upon the strength and track of winter storms, which generally cannot be predicted more than a week in advance, the center has said in the past.\n\nUSA Today contributed to this report.

But the readers of the blog, which is free, are much more varied, including people from sectors such as agriculture, emergency management, wildlife management, public works, snow plow operators, media and many others.\n\nAccording to Cohen, the snow that falls this month in Siberia will help determine the severity of our winter weather, especially in the central and eastern U.S. Cohen says the forecasts that include Siberian snow have been right about 75% of the time over more than two decades.\n\nHere's why Cohen's forecasts make the connection and when data for this winter will be available:\n\nHow would Siberian snow affect our weather?\n\nSnow reflects about 70% to 80% of the sun's warmth back into space, while a bare ground reflects only 20%. October is when Siberia and the entire Eurasian region sees its greatest expansion of snow cover, sometimes increasing as much as six million square miles, larger than the total land area of the U.S., including Alaska.\n\nJust how snow-covered Siberia gets in fall helps Cohen formulate his forecast because that icy cold air over the region will slowly slosh into Europe and eventually into North America by mid-winter. Essentially, more snow in Siberia equates to colder air and the potential for more snow than normal in the U.S.\n\nWhat is the polar vortex?:In-depth look at how it can affect winter weather in the US.\n\nThe cycle also affects large-scale climate patterns, with more snow cover often resulting in the infamous polar vortex more frequently spilling unspeakably frigid air down into the eastern U.S., or dipping temperatures even lower in a single cold spell.\n\nIt also tends to turn the Arctic Oscillation climate pattern \"negative,\" another sign of a colder winter in the East.\n\nCohen's research on these complex interactions continues to evolve. Recently, he's been researching what happens when the polar vortex becomes elongated, stretching out like a rubber band. \"When the PV stretches, the likelihood of severe winter weather in the U.S. greatly increases,\" he said.\n\nNot a western US forecast\n\nSiberia's snow doesn't typically affect the West's winter forecast because the cold air it helps funnel down from the Arctic tends to get blocked by the region's mountains, and it doesn't play a role in precipitation there either.\n\nCohen, whose research is funded by the National Science Foundation, said he found the link between Siberia's snow cover and U.S. weather by accident. As a postdoctoral fellow, he ran global climate modeling experiments to determine the influence of unusual North American snow cover over other large-scale climate patterns.\n\nInstead, he found the strong relationship that now forms the basis of his predictions, which he says have been 75% accurate since he began including Siberian snow cover as a factor in winter forecasts in 1999.\n\nLast winter, he correctly predicted the mild winter that most of the eastern U.S. experienced. \"The one region that we may have missed were the cool temperatures in the southwestern U.S.,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nCohen's winter weather forecast will be posted to his blog on the last week of November.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/10/19/noaa-winter-forecast-cold-temperatures/71214343007/", "title": "NOAA winter 2023-24 forecast: How cold will it be? What about El ...", "text": "Ready or not, winter is coming − but how bad is it going to be? Federal forecasters from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center gave us their answer Thursday in an annual winter outlook.\n\nNOAA said the U.S. winter of 2023-24 will probably be dominated by the effects of what could be a powerful El Niño. That means a mild, dry winter is likely on tap for much of the northern tier of the U.S., while the southeastern U.S. should see a wetter-than-average winter.\n\nThe center's forecast covers December, January and February, which is known as meteorological winter.\n\nWhat's the forecast for winter?\n\nWarmer-than-average temperatures are favored across the northern tier of the U.S. and much of the far West, NOAA said. The greatest odds for warmer-than-average conditions are in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and northern New England. No parts of the nation are forecast to to be colder than average, according to the forecast.\n\nAs for precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions are most likely in northern Alaska, portions of the West from California to the south-central Rockies, the southern Plains, the Gulf Coast, the Southeast and the lower mid-Atlantic, NOAA predicts.\n\n“An enhanced southern jet stream and associated moisture often present during strong El Niño events supports high odds for above-average precipitation for the Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast states this winter,” said Jon Gottschalck, of the Climate Prediction Center.\n\nThe wet conditions across the South should help ease the drought in the region: \"El Niño, with its enhanced precipitation, is expected to provide drought relief to the southern U.S. during the next few months,” the Climate Prediction Center's Brad Pugh said.\n\nAs for where a dry winter is likely, the greatest odds for drier-than-average conditions are forecast in portions of the northern Rockies and central Great Lakes region, especially for Michigan and northern Ohio and Indiana.\n\nWhat role does El Niño play in our winter?\n\nThe main factor federal climate scientists use to forecast winter weather is the strength of El Niño or La Niña, climate patterns that affect weather in the U.S. and around the world. The entire natural climate cycle is officially known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which swings between warmer and cooler seawater in the tropical Pacific Ocean.\n\n(El Niño is unusually warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean; La Niña means cooler-than-average water in the Pacific.)\n\nThis El Niño, which began in June, is predicted to last through the winter. It could be a \"historically strong\" one, the Climate Prediction Center said, potentially rivaling those in 2015-16 and 1997-98.\n\nLet it snow?:Winter predictions start as El Niño strengthens. Here's what forecasters say.\n\nWhat about snowstorms and blizzards?\n\nThe forecast released Thursday predicts only where above- or below-normal temperatures – and above- or below-normal precipitation – are most likely.\n\nThis winter forecast does not specify how much precipitation will fall as rain, snow or ice, only that more or less is likely overall. Snow forecasts depend upon the strength and track of winter storms, which generally cannot be predicted more than a week in advance, the center has said in the past.\n\nAs for the 50 million Americans who live in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, where big snowstorms typically bring the most angst, the climate center does not give a specific forecast for how much snow will fall.\n\nHow cold and snowy will US winter be?:Why October snow in Siberia could hold the answer.\n\nOther patterns aren't figured in\n\nClimate patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation – which can unleash intensely cold temperatures across the central and eastern U.S. – aren't included in this official forecast at this time because they can't be predicted more than one or two weeks in advance.\n\nOther large-scale climate patterns in the atmosphere that can influence winter weather include the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can affect the number of heavy-rain events along the West Coast. It also can contribute to other extreme events in the U.S., including Arctic air outbreaks during the winter months across the central and eastern portions of the nation, the Climate Prediction Center says.\n\nThe forecast does also not factor in Siberian snow cover, which other forecasters use as the basis for their winter weather forecasts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/weather/cloud-seeding-weather-modification-wxn/index.html", "title": "Weather news: Scientists in the US are flying planes into clouds to ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.\n\nCNN —\n\nWith 61% of the contiguous US in drought, wouldn’t it be nice if we could just “make it rain” or just “make more snow?”\n\nWell, certain parts of the country are doing just that, sort of. It’s called cloud seeding, and it’s nothing new.\n\nIt’s been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons (most notably China), but it’s a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West.\n\nIt’s also surrounded with controversy.\n\nWe spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for Wyoming’s Weather Modification Program, who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing.\n\nGondzar said some people say “you’re playing God,” others say “you are stealing moisture from the storm,” making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\nThere are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold.\n\n“Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,” is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, “in a nutshell.”\n\nWyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 as part of a study. Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works.\n\nThis season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming.\n\nKing Air's twin engine plane that is used for cloud seeding. Weather Modification International 2022\n\nShe pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down.\n\nWhen you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the ’70s and ‘80s, the state is fairly new to the game.\n\nCloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injectssilver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze).\n\nClouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky.\n\nThe nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise.\n\nIt’s done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent.\n\n“The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,” Gondzar explained. “But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.” It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you’ll completely miss your target.\n\nThe most popular way is by plane, using flares. “There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,” Gondzar pointed out.\n\nThis photo shows flares fixed on the aircraft's wing that house the silver iodide used for cloud seeding. Weather Modification International 2022\n\nOnce the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and “seed” the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation.\n\nThe silver iodide “is a natural salt compound,” Gondzar emphasized. “The reason it’s used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don’t have that, you’re not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.”\n\nBut if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again.\n\nIs it working?\n\n“Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,” Gondzar said. “You can’t break a drought with cloud seeding. It’s a tool in the toolbox.”\n\nGondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it’s difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting.\n\n“There’s evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,” Gondzar noted. “The question that they’re trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that’s a difficult question to answer. Because there’s an abstract piece of this. There’s really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.”\n\nShe knows cloud seeding doesn’t generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days.\n\nAccording to Wyoming’s Water Systems Data Map, some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down.\n\nSince most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term.\n\n“It’s a small incremental change over a long period of time. That’s why consistency is important,” Gondzar urged.\n\nShe added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap.\n\n“Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.”\n\nBut you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can’t just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain.\n\n“This is not something that we can do out of thin air,” Gondzar cautioned. “The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.”\n\nIt can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range.\n\n“The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,” Gondzar said. “But you can’t just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.”\n\nShe explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed.\n\n“A lot of people think it’s manipulating the weather pattern,” Gondzar remarked. “We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.”\n\nShe is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific.\n\n“There’s always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.”\n\nPlaying God\n\nWhile Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn’t steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree.\n\nDaniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer Rachel Ramirez.\n\nHe told her “It is possible that you’re actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it’s even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.”\n\nHe went on to ask, “To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?”\n\nHe believes water equity issues need to be researched more.\n\nAnother note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim.\n\nShe pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver.\n\n“There’s silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,” Gondzar noted. “So you already have a natural background level of silver, it’s been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.”\n\nShe said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she’s hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road.\n\nThere have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here’s more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding’s climate angle.\n\nClimate scientists remain skeptical this is the silver bullet\n\nAlthough cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology’s efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather.\n\nSwain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are.\n\n“How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?” Swain told CNN. “This isn’t a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.”\n\nCloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways.\n\nThat’s what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. Their results, published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger.\n\nDuring the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall.\n\nIn three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified “unambiguous seeding patterns,” in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds.\n\nDespite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding — up to 10% — isn’t enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West.\n\n“It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,” she said. “That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It’s not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager’s toolbox.”\n\nWhen it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology.\n\n“I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,” she contended. “So it’s to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.”\n\n“But that does not mean that there isn’t room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,” Tessendorf added.\n\nWith the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts.\n\n“There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,” Swain asserted. “The best case scenario is it’s a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that’s not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray Rachel Ramirez", "Jennifer Gray", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2021/10/18/la-nina-returns-nj-winter-impacts-and-why-experts-less-certain/8506022002/", "title": "La Niña returns: NJ winter impacts and why experts are less certain", "text": "New Jersey will be under the influence of the La Niña climate pattern this coming winter, but weather experts say it's still too early to call for what temperatures or how much snow we should expect in the coming months.\n\nA La Niña pattern — the opposite pattern of El Niño and translated in Spanish as \"little girl\" — is a natural ocean-atmospheric phenomenon, which happens when there are cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures developing in the tropical Pacific Ocean along the equator, forecasters said.\n\nThe pattern is being referred to as a \"double dip\" by weather officials because it is returning for a second consecutive year.\n\nHeavy snow on the way to NJ?: Is NJ in for a rough winter? What Old Farmer's Almanac predicts and why experts question it\n\n\"Our scientists have been tracking the potential development of a La Niña since the summer, and it was a factor in the above-normal hurricane season forecast, which we have seen unfold,\" said Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.\n\n\"La Nina also influences weather across the country during the winter, and it will influence our upcoming temperatures and precipitation outlooks,\" Herbert said.\n\nBoth El Niño and La Niña largely play important roles in each season's weather pattern across the world.\n\nDuring La Niña, weaker winds between the ocean surface and upper levels of the atmosphere often impact global jet streams and can influence not only the track, but the severity of winter storms and hurricanes during warmer months.\n\nLa Niña is back: What does this mean for our winter weather?\n\nAs for El Niño, the pattern tends to cause more wind shear across the Atlantic hurricane basin, reducing the strength and formation of tropical storms and hurricanes, the prediction center said.\n\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season will end on Nov. 30, which is great news for many after a very active season with already 20-named storms. The National Hurricane Center said the Atlantic remains quiet and there are no major storms expected any time soon.\n\nSo how does a La Niña weather pattern affect New Jersey's long-range weather outlook?\n\nLa Niña's impact on New Jersey\n\nAnytime there is a La Niña weather pattern, it tends to generate colder, snowier winters in most northern portions of the United States, the climate prediction center said.\n\nBut for New Jersey, the weather pattern is often uncertain when there is a La Niña, as they are typically not strong in the northeast, according to Rutgers University Professor David A. Robinson, who is also the New Jersey state climatologist.\n\n\"New Jersey sits in a geographic region where influences on our weather and overall seasonal pattern can rather readily come from all directions, the cold north, warm south, continental west, and maritime east,\" Robinson said. \"Thus the absence of a strong signal during La Niña or El Niño winters.\"\n\nOverall in New Jersey with La Niña, the state rarely sees big extremes in winter temperatures — meaning more cooler or warmer weather — when the pattern is active, Robinson said.\n\nUsually a strong La Niña pattern will generate a milder winter with slightly average or close to average warmer temperatures for many New Jersey areas, but it always has the potential to change each year, according to Sarah Johnson, a forecaster from the National Weather Service.\n\nLa Niña:Conditions have developed and are expected to continue through February 2022\n\nLast year, La Niña was active throughout the winter season, as New Jersey had its 29th warmest winter on record, according to the state's climatologist office, which dates back to 1895.\n\nForecasters and private meteorologists agree that La Niña is only one factor in how New Jersey's winter season will look. Another factor is how strong the polar vortex is during the winter season — a band of frigid air circulating constantly around the North Pole.\n\nMore snow coming to New Jersey?\n\nNew Jersey saw one of its snowiest winters in recent history last year, even with La Niña present, as the New Brunswick region seeing up to 30.6 inches of snow in February — marking the second snowiest February on record, according to the state's climatologist office.\n\nAs a whole, the state saw an average of almost 30 inches of snow last winter, or about 10 inches higher than normal.\n\nWhen the polar vortex is weak, cold air tends to drift downward from the Arctic region into Canada and northeast portions of the United States and increase the chance for many snow systems to develop, according to Sarah Johnson, a forecaster from the National Weather Service.\n\nWhen La Niña is active, it often favors a more stronger polar vortex, which limits the amount of snow throughout the northeast, Johnson said. But just like last year, even with La Niña, there is still always the chance for cold air to come down toward New Jersey.\n\n\"Usually we tend to see average and sometimes below-average snowfall, but sometimes we get hit hard with a lot of snow, just like last year when La Niña was present,\" Johnson said.\n\nForecasters and meteorologists stress that it is \"incredibly difficult to predict when or how much snow\" is in the long-range forecast, mainly due to the fact it's dependent on many factors playing a role in order for snow to happen, forecasters said. This includes wind direction and speed, cooler artic temperatures and moisture development.\n\n\"For us, our long-range models are much more generic then that, we just look at on-average what temperatures and type of precipitation we should expect in the coming days,\" Johnson said.\n\nFor this coming winter, the La Niña winter storm track tends to favor a path up the Ohio Valley into the eastern Great Lakes, rather than one that brings storms up the coast, or as we know them as nor'easters, according to Robinson.\n\n\"This track tends to favor rain over snow, but the records show that only in strong La Niña winters since 1980 (five of them) did New Jersey snowfall average below normal,\" Robinson said. \"This should tell you that La Niña isn't a good snowfall forecast aid.\"\n\nJoshua Chung is the 9-5 breaking news and weather reporter.

A battleground in the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, Texas has reached nearly 60% of its overall turnout from 2016 with 5.3 million people voting so far.\n\n\"The numbers that we've seen, they've blown out our expectations,\" said Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins. \"We certainly expect that this will be the highest turnout election of all-time here.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:'Staggering numbers': Early voting is breaking records in 2020, fueled by a big mail-ballot lead for Democrats\n\nMonths ago, some questioned whether the U.S. could pull off an election during a raging pandemic.\n\nNow, early voting is smashing records across the country: North Carolina, Georgia and Michigan, other swing states in the race for president, have either surpassed or are approaching 40% of their overall 2016 turnout. More than 42 million people had voted early, either in-person or by mail, as of Wednesday afternoon, seven times the 6 million who had voted early around this time in 2016.\n\n\"It's unprecedented,\" said Michael McDonald, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, who manages the United States Elections Project.\n\nUS passes 30% of 2016 overall turnout\n\nWith less than two weeks before Election Day, voter turnout nationally has reached 30% of the overall 138.8 million people who voted four years ago. For the first time in election history, more people are expected to vote early than on Election Day.\n\nMcDonald, who tracks early voting numbers by the minute, said it's possible 85 million people could vote before Election Day and perhaps 150 million will vote in total. Ten times more mail ballots have been returned than at this point in 2016 and twice as many people have voted in-person.\n\nSeveral states changed laws from four years ago to either offer or expand early voting, and more people are taking advantage of it, particularly voting by mail, amid the coronavirus pandemic. States have also gotten better at reporting their daily vote tallies.\n\nMore:Who's undecided? Donald Trump's toughest hurdle to pull off a win: Most minds are made up\n\nDemocrats continue to fuel the mail-voting surge, accounting for 10 million, or 52%, of the 19.1 million mail ballots returned by voters in the 19 states that report voter registration data. Trump has slammed mail-voting throughout the campaign, likely turning off many of his supporters to the method.\n\nRepublican voters have returned 5 million mail ballots, or 25.2% of all returned ballots, and voters with no party affiliation have returned 4.1 million mail ballots, accounting for 21%.\n\n\"Voters are heeding the call of election officials and the campaigns, particularly the Biden campaign, to vote early and get those mail ballots in early,\" McDonald said. \"There was some doubt whether or not we'd be able to run an election in the midst of a pandemic. It's going to happen. Now we just need to see how it all shakes out.\"\n\nMore:Donald Trump keeps blasting 'universal' mail voting. But few states are planning that in November\n\nTurnout of eligible voters could reach highest since 1908\n\nIf voters on Election Day – who are expected to disproportionately favor Trump – turn out as expected, McDonald believes the U.S. could have the highest percentage of eligible voters actually vote since 1908. (Figures are according to the Vital Statistics of American Politics. )\n\nThat year, Republican William Howard Taft defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan with 65.7% of the voting-eligible population participating. This was before the the 19th Amendment, so the pool of eligible voters did not include women, and laws in the South also restricted many Black Americans' ability to vote. Turnout was much higher, greater than 80% of eligible voters in some years, throughout much of the 19th century.\n\nTurnout among those eligible to vote began to decline in 1972 and was in the low 50%-range throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The lowest mark in recent history was 1996 with 51.7% of the voter-eligible population participating. The rate started to rise in 2004 and has been at about 60% since. In 2016, 60.1% of the voter-eligible population voted.\n\nAfter the 2018 midterm election, which was the highest midterm turnout since 1914, McDonald predicted the 2020 presidential election could hit the 1908 turnout rate. It would require more than 150 million people voting.\n\n\"There's no reason at this point to revise that downwards with these record numbers,\" McDonald said.\n\n'I'll show you' attitude, Houston clerk says of voters\n\nNowhere is high turnout on display more than rapidly growing Texas, which for the first time in a generation is getting attention from both the Republican and Democratic standard-bearers as Biden looks to put the Lone Star State in play. Democrats last won Texas in 1976.\n\nTexas is breaking records despite not being among the states that expanded vote-by-mail during amid the pandemic.\n\nIn Houston, Hollins pointed to tripling the number of early voting sites to 122 and for the first time offering drive-thru voting, in which around 10% of in-person early voters have taken part. On Oct. 29, Harris County will also offer 24/7 early voting in certain locations to accommodate medical workers and others who work graveyard shifts.\n\nMore:We analyzed a conservative foundation's catalog of absentee ballot fraud: It's not a 2020 election threat\n\nHollins, a Democrat, said he believes efforts aimed at \"misinformation\" and \"voter suppression\" from Trump and Republican leaders in the state have motivated voters. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this month ordered that no county – including Harris County which has a population of 4.7 million – have no more than one mail-ballot drop off location, a move that was upheld in court.\n\n\"I think the voters' reaction to that is to say, 'I'll show you.' Basically, 'Don't mess with Texas,'\" Hollins said. \"I think some of these efforts at getting people to stay home have backfired. And people are really, really motivated to get out. I think that's regardless of their party, regardless of who they are planning to vote for. Everyone is yearning to have their voices heard right now.\"\n\nTrump, Republicans relying on big Election Day turnout\n\nBehind Texas, states with the most early votes as of Wednesday are California, 4.5 million; Florida, 3.7 million; North Carolina, 2.1 million; New Jersey, 2 million; and Michigan, 1.8 million.\n\nStates with the highest share of voters in relation to their overall 2016 turnout are: Texas, 59.3%; Vermont, 53.4%; New Jersey, 50%; New Mexico, 47.8%; Montana, 47.1%; Georgia, 45.9%; North Carolina, 45.2%; Tennessee, 42.6; Virginia, 39.3%; and Colorado, 37.5%.\n\nRepublicans have matched turnout among Democrats with in-person early voting in some states and surpassed Democrats in others. For example, in Florida, 44.5% of the state's 721,000 in-person early voters have been Republican, compared to 39% of Democrats.\n\nMore:Biden voters twice as likely than Trump supporters to vote by mail in November, survey finds\n\nMore:'Running out of time': Efforts to speed up counting mail ballots stall in battleground states\n\nRepublicans also have an edge with in-person voting in states such as New Mexico and Nevada. But it hasn't overcome Democrats' massive advantage with mail voting.\n\n\"If Republicans aren't eating into the edge that Democrats have, it's really putting all of the eggs into the Election Day basket,\" McDonald said. \"The Trump campaign is going to have to hope that all of their voters show up on Election Day, and that's risky.\"\n\nVoting problems have been minor, experts say\n\nDavid Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said voter enthusiasm across the political spectrum was high heading into the election. Faced with a pandemic, he said people are accepting the \"new normal\" and making plans for how they will vote in the same way they plan before buying their groceries.\n\n\"Voters are saving us right now,\" he said. \"For all of the late-breaking court decisions and the partisan gamesmanship, it's the American voter that is really doing the hard work here. They have educated themselves about their options. And they are showing up in numbers that we've never really dreamed of before.\"\n\nMore:'I’d wait for hours if I had to': Long lines greet voters on first day of early voting in Georgia\n\nBecker said issues so far – long lines in Georgia and other states on the first day of early voting and incorrect absentee ballots issued in some states – are \"remarkably small\" given how many people have voted. He said high early voter turnout should ease the length of lines in may states on Election Day.\n\n\"We don't have anything in American history that looks like this before,\" said Becker, who believes \"it's not crazy to think\" that 100 million American voters could vote early.\n\n\"I don't want to sound too optimistic about everything. But if you can watch the tens of millions of voters showing up to vote early or returning their mail ballots and not feel inspired, then you have a harder heart than I do. This is really turning out so far to be a great moment in American Democracy.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/13/election-2020-mail-voting-shouldnt-delay-results-several-key-states/3623320001/", "title": "Election 2020: Mail-voting shouldn't delay results in several key states", "text": "WASHINGTON – Many election experts have warned it might take days or even weeks after Election Day for a final outcome in the presidential race because of the unprecedented deluge of mail ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut the country could get major clues on election night even as counting continues in some key states.\n\nSeveral battleground states – some accustomed to high-volume mail-voting and others that start processing absentee ballots weeks before Nov. 3 – are expected to have substantial shares of their votes counted and reported on election night and into the next morning.\n\nRecent polling shows Democratic nominee Joe Biden has built a double-digit lead nationally since the first presidential debate and has widened his leads in most swing states. Election night numbers in some states could indicate whether the former vice president is on track for a decisive win over President Donald Trump – and surpassing the needed 270 electoral votes – or whether the outcome remains in doubt.\n\nMore:The week in polls: Biden hits double-digit lead in national average, surges in Florida, Michigan\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThose states include Florida, which begins processing mail ballots 22 days before the election; Arizona, which starts that process two weeks before the election; North Carolina, which started processing ballots on Sept. 29; and Texas.\n\nAlthough Texas is not among states that expanded mail-voting to all voters during the pandemic, its largest counties can begin processing absentee ballots 12 days before the election. Georgia, which did make mail-voting available to all voters, allows the processing of ballots to begin two weeks in advance. Ohio started processing mail ballots last week. In Iowa, counties can start opening the outer envelopes on absentee ballots the Saturday before Election Day.\n\nEach is in contrast to three critical Rust Belt states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – where election officials must wait until Election Day, or in Michigan's case, 10 hours before the election, before they can open mail ballots and begin counting. These three states are expected to be counting millions of absentee ballots days after polls close.\n\n\"I think the conventional wisdom of this thing taking weeks or many, many days is probably wrong,\" said Thomas Volgy, a political science professor at the University of Arizona.\n\nMore:'Running out of time': Efforts to speed up counting mail ballots stall in battleground states\n\nA 'large signal' on election night?\n\nProcessing absentee ballots involves opening the envelopes containing the ballots, matching signatures to registration rolls and verifying barcodes on the envelopes. Each is a necessary step before ballots are counted.\n\nEven before the coronavirus pandemic, 4 out of 5 Arizonans voted by mail. The state won't have results instantly, according to Volgy, a former Democratic mayor of Tucson, but the winner of Arizona could be known by the next morning. Recent polls in Arizona, which hasn't voted Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, have Biden ahead 2 to 8 percentage points.\n\n\"We'll have clues very, very clearly,\" Volgy said. \"If a state like Arizona reports out with Biden having won, as the polls look like right now, or Florida, it's going to give a really large signal about what's happening with the rest of the ballots in the Midwestern states as well that are counting late.\"\n\nMore:'Staggering numbers': Early voting is breaking records in 2020, fueled by a big mail-ballot lead for Democrats\n\nSeveral of the early-indicator states are in the Sun Belt, lean conservative historically and went for Trump in 2016. But Biden is either ahead or competitive in each, according to recent polls, as the president's support among seniors, college-educated suburban voters and women erodes.\n\nSome of the states that begin processing early also feature competitive U.S. Senate races – Sen. Martha McSally versus Democrat Mark Kelly in Arizona and Sen. Thom Tillis against Democrat Cal Cunningham in North Carolina, for example – that could decide whether Democrats take control of the Senate.\n\nNone of these states will have complete results on election night, but they could have enough counted and publicized to show whether Biden or Trump is likely to prevail or if the race is going to remain tight as outstanding absentee ballots are counted.\n\n\"We're going to know about Florida and Arizona by the very latest probably the next morning,\" Volgy said. \"There is no path to victory for the Trump campaign if he loses both Florida and Arizona.\"\n\nConversely, Biden would still have life if Trump were to carry Florida and Arizona. The former vice president would need to carry every state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and flip Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, each won by Trump four years ago. That's why a Trump victory in Florida and Arizona would not necessarily mean a reelection victory but rather shift the focus on the counting efforts in the Midwest states.\n\nFlorida, Florida, Florida\n\nEven if Biden and Trump are neck-and-neck in Florida or Arizona on election night, that could mean Biden is in good shape in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania – states where Biden has polled better and consistently led throughout the race.\n\nClose contests in Georgia or North Carolina could also spell trouble for Trump nationally. Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said the Tar Heel State expects \"98% to 99%\" of ballots to be reported in the hours after polls close. Recent polls in North Carolina range from a tied race to Biden ahead by 4 percentage points.\n\n\"We should be able to see what's going to happen,\" said Michael McDonald, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, looking ahead to election night.\n\nMore:Biden is getting trounced with Cuban American voters in Florida, a trend that could tip the state to Trump\n\nIn Florida, absentee ballots must be in election offices on Election Day. The first results posted in Florida will include early in-person and mail ballots. Historically, 30% of Floridians voted by mail before the pandemic. This year, already 1.7 million people have voted early by mail in Florida, with Democrats holding a big advantage – 850,000 Democrats have returned mail ballots, compared with 480,000 Republicans.\n\nPolling suggests Biden voters are twice as likely to vote by mail than Trump supporters amid the president's monthslong assault on mail-voting, which he has argued without evidence is rife with fraud. Most recent polls in Florida show Biden ahead.\n\nIf Biden is ahead on election night in Florida, even by just 1 percentage point, then the only ballots left to count will be military, overseas and provisional ballots likely to benefit Biden, McDonald said.\n\n\"The most likely scenario is that we know who wins Florida,\" he said, adding that if Biden wins, it \"greatly restricts Trump's pathway to an Electoral College victory. If Biden wins North Carolina and Texas on top of that, or Arizona, these pathways become virtually nonexistent for Trump. So there's a good chance on election night we will know who the president is.\"\n\n'We will know in short order which world we live in'\n\nElection night numbers in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are likely to favor Trump because of his anticipated advantage with in-person voting on Election Day. Democrats have raised the alarm about a \"red mirage\" on election night showing Trump ahead in these states, only to replaced by a \"blue shift\" as mail ballots, which could skew 2 to 1 for Biden, are counted.\n\nMore:Some Democrats warn Trump may use 'red mirage' to prematurely declare victory while absentee ballots are being counted\n\nBut the opposite could be true in Florida, a state that has voted for the presidential winner in every election since 1996.\n\n\"If anything, we're going to see the 'red shift' in Florida,\" McDonald said, alluding to the mail-in ballot tallies likely to be posted first. \"Biden should probably jump out to a huge lead in Florida, and then as the Election Day results come in from the precincts, that's where we're going to see Trump make up ground on Biden.\"\n\nNathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford University and a co-director of the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Projects, said it's true a winner might not \"definitively' be known on election night. But he said it's more likely that election night will produce enough results from fully counted states and fully counted counties to \"make inferences\" on the likely winner.\n\nHe said that even though Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin might not be finished counting all absentee ballots, some fast-counting counties in those states should be finished shortly after the election. Election observers should be able to compare Trump's tallies in those counties to his performances in 2016 to know where things stand.\n\n\"Since 2016 was such a narrow victory, if he's doing worse than in 2016, then that gives you a sense of whether he's going to be able to win this year,\" Persily said.\n\nMore:Not old enough to vote, but old enough to help: How teens are helping to avert an election crisis\n\nTrump has not committed to a peaceful transfer of power or agreed to refrain from prematurely declaring victory. He has also hinted at post-election litigation, even up the Supreme Court, leading many to predict the election will be decided in court.\n\n\"It make sense to preach caution but not to predict chaos,\" Persily said. \"We need to prepare the American people for a different kind of election night because it's possible if we have a repeat of 2016, or let alone 2000, we may be in for the long haul.\"\n\nBut he added: \"We will know in short order which world we live in – one where there is a clear winner or one where we will be fighting over absentee ballots for many days.\"\n\nMore:Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess\n\nCampaigns targeting Georgia, Texas\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump campaign – facing a fundraising disadvantage against Biden – pulled TV ads slated to run in Michigan and Wisconsin and boosted their ad spending in Florida, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, a swing state that Clinton won in 2016, according to BuzzFeed News.\n\nIn a sign of a close race in Georgia, which polls show in a virtual tie, the president has scheduled a rally in the state later this week, days after his daughter Ivanka Trump will campaign in the state.\n\nTexas, second to only California in electoral college votes with 38, remains perhaps the toughest of the Sun Belt states for Biden to win. But it's a state that, thanks to changing demographics and several tight congressional races, Democrats think they can win for the first time since the 1976 presidential election.\n\nMore:Go big or play it safe? Electoral map widens for Joe Biden and Democrats, but with risk\n\nIn a push to put both Georgia and Texas in play, Biden's wife, Jill Biden, campaigned in Georgia on Monday and plans to travels to El Paso, Dallas, and Houston on Tuesday. The Biden campaign has spent nearly $4 million on TV ads in Georgia and $6 million in Texas, according to Advertising Analytics, a political advertising tracking firm.\n\nBiden carrying Texas \"is something that's possible but not probable,\" said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas-Austin.\n\nTexas' biggest cities, such as Houston, have a history of long lines lasting late into the night of Election Day and even early morning. But Texas, which begins in-person early voting Tuesday, shouldn't have the massive amount of outstanding absentee ballots like other states because its leaders opted not to expand mail-voting amid the pandemic.\n\n\"I think we'll have a pretty good indication of what's going on, but there's a lot of big ifs there,\" Henson said.\n\nTrump won Texas by 9 percentage points in 2016, but polling shows him maintaining a slimmer lead of 2 to 7 percentage points this year. If Texas is close on election night, it could be a sign of a Biden landslide.\n\n\"If Wednesday morning rolls around and Texas looks too close to call, I think you have to assume that there has been a pretty successful wave for Biden nationwide,\" Henson said. \"And so at that point, who knows?

Nearly 1 in 7 voters cast their ballots ahead of Election Day in 2020, according to the University of Florida's Election Lab. However, many Republicans opposed the dramatic expansion of mail voting that year, saying it was less secure than in-person voting, and Trump cited false claims of mail ballot fraud as he sought unsuccessfully to overturn his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nSome Republicans continue to insist that voters should be able to cast their ballots only in person on Election Day, though party officials are encouraging supporters to vote ahead of time.\n\nNationwide, 5.5 million Americans have already voted this year, according to Election Lab. By contrast, 27 million people had cast their ballots at this point in the 2020 election as voters sought to avoid crowded polling places during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nLike some other states, Georgia has tightened its mail-voting laws since then, requiring voters who want to cast an absentee ballot to provide proof of identity and limiting the number of places they can deposit their ballots.\n\nGeorgia is one of the seven competitive battleground states expected to play a decisive role in deciding the election.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/01/trump-needs-election-day-vote-biden-democrats-dominate-early-voting/6085797002/", "title": "Trump must dominate Election Day vote after Democrats led early ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – As Democrats dominate mail-in early voting, President Donald Trump will have to rely on strong in-person Election Day turnout among Republicans to defeat Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus is surging in several Midwest battleground states – Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan – where the president needs Republican voters to flock to the polls.\n\nTrump's yearlong disparagement of mail-in voting turned off many of his voters to absentee ballots. Democrats embraced the method, casting nearly double the mail-in ballots of Republican voters nationwide. Though Republicans narrowed the gap with in-person early voting, Trump heads into Election Day facing a likely vote deficit nationally and in swing states.\n\nAt least 92 million people, a record, have voted early, either in person or by mail, according to the United States Elections Project.\n\n'Unprecedented': Voter turnout in election could reach highest rate in more than a century\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDemocratic voters accounted for 48.3% of all early votes cast, and Republicans accounted for 41.5%, according to TargetSmart, a Democratic elections data firm that combines party information from states and its own modeling. Voters with no party affiliation made up 10.2% of early voters. Polling has shown Biden ahead with independent voters, although the margin has thinned.\n\nTrump has one day to reverse turnout trends.\n\n\"His voters have clearly listened to his call to avoid mail voting, and many of them are waiting for that Election Day experience to go out there,\" said Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart. \"Because of what we've seen with the early vote – Democrats are reaching record levels of turnout – Republicans are going to need to do something similar on Election Day. They're going to need to vote in numbers of the likes of which we've never seen before.\"\n\nDemocrats turned in 49% of the 33 million mail ballots returned in the 19 states that detail party affiliation, data from the U.S. Elections Project shows. Republicans accounted for 26%, and voters with no party affiliation, 24%.\n\nElection Day: Here's when we might know a winner and how each candidate could claim victory\n\nOver the past two weeks, Republicans chipped away at the Democratic lead as early in-person voting exploded in Texas, Florida and North Carolina. Among the states that release party identification data of voters, Republicans made up 42% of the in-person early voters; Democratic voters, 36%.\n\nOn Oct. 12, Democrats led Republican in overall votes nationally, 55% to 34%, according to TargetSmart, but Republicans have narrowed the advantage each day since.\n\n► In Florida, Democrats accounted for 40% of the state's 8.3 million early votes, Republicans made up 38% and voters with no party affiliation 21%, the U.S. Elections Project found. Democrats returned 46% of the state's absentee ballots, while Republicans returned 31%. The numbers flipped for in-person voting: 46% for Republicans and 32% for Democrats.\n\n►In North Carolina, Democrats returned more than twice the mail ballots as Republicans, 46% of the 884,000 absentee ballots to 20% for Republicans. Unlike Florida, Democrats narrowly edged Republicans in in-person early voting, 36% to 35%, and 29% of the state's early in-person voters had no party affiliation. More than 4.3 million North Carolinians voted early.\n\n►In Pennsylvania, Democrats accounted for a massive 68% of the 2.3 million returned mail ballots, more than three times the 22% made up by Republicans. (Pennsylvania does not have traditional in-person early voting but does have early in-person absentee voting.)\n\nBecause of the disparity in Pennsylvania, Trump is likely to jump out to a large lead on election night as in-person Election Day results, likely to favor him, are posted. Biden probably will begin erasing the gap as absentee ballots are tallied, which could take days because Pennsylvania does not start processing them until Election Day.\n\n\"In a place like Pennsylvania, what he'll need to do from a turnout perspective will be substantial,\" perhaps topping Biden by 45 percentage points in Election Day voting, Bonier said of Trump. \"In others states, like Florida, where there has been more of a Republican turnout operation and they've been able to take advantage of early in-person voting, the margins will certainly be less than that.\"\n\nMore:Some Democrats warn Trump may use 'red mirage' to prematurely declare victory while absentee ballots are counted\n\nFor months, polls showed mail-in voting would favor Biden and Election Day would favor Trump. How it ultimately breaks down could decide the election.\n\nBiden maintains a 52%-44% lead over Trump nationally, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released last week. Of the 33% of voters who say they plan to vote on Election Day, 48% are Republicans and 20% are Democrats.\n\nChris Wilson, a Republican pollster who has worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said Republicans have \"quickly closed the gaps\" that Democrats built via mail voting.\n\n\"This is what we expected, and we also expect Republicans will cast many more votes than Democrats on Election Day,\" he said. \"The GOP advantage on Election Day will likely be biggest in states without extensive or easy in-person early voting and smaller in states like Texas which have lots of in-person early vote available.\"\n\nDespite their success in mail voting overall, he pointed to \"warning signs for Democrats\" in turnout among Hispanic voters in Miami and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\n\n\"It may well all come down to Pennsylvania, and if it does, we may not know what happened for days and days,\" Wilson said.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Samantha Zager downplayed Democrats' early voting advantage, saying voting by mail is what Biden and Democrats \"told them to do for months.\"\n\n\"But Biden is simply cannibalizing his Election Day vote and not bringing in new voters,\" she said. The Trump campaign \"knows who our voters are, where they are and that they overwhelmingly want to vote in person on Election Day.\"\n\nEchoing Trump, Kavanaugh argues states have an interest in finalizing results on Election Day\n\n'There's no way to sugarcoat it': COVID-19 cases are surging; one American dies every 107 seconds\n\nIn some states, Trump needs to ensure his voters turn out even as coronavirus cases rise. Wisconsin reported more than 5,300 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, Michigan reported 3,434, Minnesota 3,155 and Iowa 2,741.\n\nSpokesman TJ Ducklo said the Biden campaign is \"encouraged\" by early voting numbers, \"but the job is not finished. We know Donald Trump will have a big turnout on Election Day, and we are going to ensure that our supporters who are showing up on Election Day are able to cast their ballots safely.\"\n\nDucklo said the Biden campaign will wage an \"aggressive effort at every level of our campaign\" through Election Day to \"ensure we have the kind of turnout that will send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House.\"\n\nEven amid the COVID-19 spikes, Trump has gotten large crowds in outdoor rallies in each of the four states the past week. He will need more than just his diehard supporters to show up Tuesday.\n\n\"It's really putting all of the eggs into the Election Day basket,\" Michael McDonald, associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, who manages the United States Elections Project, said in October. \"The Trump campaign is going to have to hope that all of their voters show up on Election Day, and that's risky.\"\n\nBonier turned to a sports analogy.\n\n\"Republicans are counting on having the ball last and putting together a winning drive on Election Day. The question is, are they starting that drive from their own 2-yard line and need to go 98 yards? Or are they a little bit closer? ... At this point, it does appear that they've got a long ways to go.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/04/mail-ballots-efforts-stall-speed-up-counting-battleground-states/5879074002/", "title": "Mail ballots: Efforts stall to speed up counting in battleground states", "text": "WASHINGTON – Battleground states that could decide the presidential election face a shrinking window to take action to allow the processing of absentee ballots before Election Day to cut down on the days or even weeks it could take to have final results.\n\nIn Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two swing states, efforts stalled in Republican-controlled state legislatures. In a third crucial state, Michigan, a push to begin the counting process several days before the election is dead. Lawmakers gave election officials a 10-hour head start.\n\nOutcomes in the three Rust Belt states could remain in doubt long after polls close Nov. 3, the result of unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots likely because of the coronavirus.\n\nBecause of the importance of these three states – Donald Trump narrowly won each in 2016, but polling shows Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead in all three – the outcome of the entire presidential election is likely to be on hold as well.\n\nOf the 16 most contested states in the presidential election, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine and New Hampshire don't allow the processing of absentee ballots to begin until Election Day. Michigan was in the same category until last week. Experts said Michigan's 10-hour jump-start before polls close will have little impact.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nNo presidential winner on election night? Mail-in ballots could put outcome in doubt for weeks\n\n\"It's like taking a Band-Aid and putting it on a gushing wound,\" said Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, which has lobbied states to give election officials the ability to process mail ballots before the election. \"The three states that remain as the most problematic are Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania\" – each of which has a Democratic governor and a legislature with a Republican majority.\n\nPresident Trump has assaulted mail-in voting, saying it's open to fraud, though there's been little evidence of such. He declined to pledge to hold off on declaring victory before all absentee votes are counted and bemoaned the amount of time it could take to count ballots.\n\nLess than one month before the election, any state action would need to happen soon. Mail voting is underway in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, along with several other states.\n\nBefore counting absentee ballots, election officials must open the envelopes containing the ballots, match the signatures on the ballots to registration rolls and verify the bar codes on the envelopes. In some states, they have to remove a \"secrecy envelope\" containing the ballot from the envelope it's mailed in. Battleground states such as Florida and Arizona allow this process to begin weeks before Election Day, but other states must wait until Nov. 3.\n\n'Mailmen selling ballots. Dumped in rivers. Found in creeks': Trump assails mail-in voting\n\nIn Wisconsin, municipal clerks have long sought the ability to count at least some ballots before Election Day, but Republicans who control the Legislature have been unable to reach an agreement on the issue. Legislative leaders have no plans to come back into session before Election Day, even though Wisconsin’s top Republican, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, argued the ballot-counting law should be changed.\n\nMore than 1.2 million Wisconsin voters requested mail ballots for the election. Democrats and nonpartisan entities who sued over a number of the state’s election laws sought to allow absentee ballots to be counted before Election Day.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Conley didn’t go along with that request, but last month, he agreed to allow absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted if they are postmarked by then. Ordinarily, ballots must be in the hands of clerks by Election Day to be counted in Wisconsin.\n\n'Uncharted territory' in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania took weeks to count all absentee ballots during its presidential primary in June.\n\nElection officials pleaded with state lawmakers to grant them at least the ability to open envelopes and verify signatures in advance. Pennsylvania officials expect more than 3 million ballots to be cast during the election after 1.5 million people voted absentee during the primary.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tom Wolf and the Republican-controlled Legislature have not reached an agreement. Wolf wants counties to be able to process ballots 15 days before Nov. 3, and Republicans offered three days. The Republican plan would ban absentee ballot drop-off boxes throughout the state – something the Trump campaign sued Pennsylvania in June to try to achieve and Wolf strongly opposes.\n\n\"We are truly in uncharted territory in Pennsylvania,\" said Forrest Lehman, director of elections in Lycoming County. \"Counties are very concerned about the ongoing uncertainty as we try to prepare for November. We are running short of time to pass a bill, but we're not out of time yet, especially if conversations continue.\"\n\nFormer Republican Pa. Gov. Tom Ridge: Election Day could be election month without changes\n\nThe bill is tied up in a state Senate committee, controlled by Republicans, despite having the support of former Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, who co-chairs a group called VoteSafe, which advocates for vote-by-mail expansion during the pandemic.\n\n\"Let's face it,\" Ridge said. \"It's very unlikely, given the unprecedented nature in use of absentee ballots, that we're going to know on election night who the victor is. But anything we can do to accelerate that process, I think, contributes significantly to preserving the integrity of the election.\"\n\nRidge, a Trump critic who bucked his party last week and endorsed Biden for president, urged lawmakers from both parties and the governor to work out a compromise.\n\n\"Inaction is not an option,\" he said. \"And if you look at each other's alternative, remember, perfect should never be an enemy of the good.\"\n\nRepublicans haven't budged from their requirement of eliminating drop-off boxes. State Rep. Garth Everett from Lycoming County, chair of the State Government Committee, and other Republicans in the General Assembly raised concerns that \"unmanned, unsecured drop boxes\" could lead to fraud.\n\n“If they’re not comfortable with mail-in voting, you know what you can do?” Everett said. “You can do it the old-fashioned way.”\n\n'Any extra time' in Michigan\n\nMichigan's Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, called for at least seven days before Election Day to process absentee ballots. Democratic lawmakers' efforts to move the date to the weekend before the election went nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature.\n\nAfter finagling, legislators approved a bill last week that would give clerks in cities with at least 25,000 people an extra 10 hours to process – but not count – absentee ballots. The measure would affect 72 cities, including the state's largest, Detroit, which is notoriously slow to tally its votes.\n\nMore:Michigan lawmakers give time on absentee ballots, require video monitoring of drop boxes\n\nMichigan voters must place absentee ballots in a \"secrecy envelope,\" then place that into a larger envelope. The legislation would allow clerks to open the outer envelopes and sort ballots from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Nov. 2. Although this would cut down on steps clerks generally take on Election Day, it's unclear how much time it would save in terms of obtaining final vote tallies.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, signed the legislation into law Tuesday – which would allow poll workers to rotate on multiple shifts to count absentee ballots – but as of Friday had not signed it into law.\n\n\"While the Bipartisan Policy Center recommends at least seven days, any extra time would be a help to our clerks,\" said Tracy Wimmer, a spokeswoman for Benson.\n\nMichigan is on track to see more than 3 million people vote absentee during the general election, nearly twice the 1.6 million who did in the primary in August. Wimmer said it took until Wednesday evening after the election Tuesday to finish counting all the absentee ballots in the primary.\n\n\"It makes sense to expect double the time,\" she said in an email. \"We’re hoping to have all ballots counted by Friday.\"\n\nAdvocates say nonpartisan issue has become 'partisan football'\n\nDemocratic voters have requested vastly more mail ballots than Republicans nationally, and polling shows Biden supporters are twice as likely to vote by mail than Trump supporters.\n\nAs a result, some Democrats warned of a \"red mirage\" on election night as in-person results – which might show Trump ahead in many states – are reported before a record number of absentee ballots that could skew toward Biden are counted.\n\nMore:Some Democrats warn Trump may use 'red mirage' to prematurely declare victory while absentee ballots are counted\n\nSome states changed their laws to brace for more absentee ballots. Last week in Iowa, the Legislative Council moved to allow counties to begin the process of opening the outer absentee ballot envelopes on the Saturday before Election Day, rather than the traditional day before. Georgia, where Trump and Biden are running close, moved in August to let county officials process absentee ballots two weeks before the election.\n\nExpecting a surge of mail-in votes, Iowa will give counties a head-start on opening absentee ballots\n\nOther states already allowed a processing window before the election. Florida begins processing mail-in ballots 22 days before the election; Arizona 14 days before; North Carolina five weeks before; and Ohio, Minnesota, Nevada and Virginia upon receipt. Texas, one of a handful of states in which no-excuse absentee voting won't be available during the pandemic, allows the biggest cities to process absentee ballots 12 days before the election.\n\n\"We are running out of time, but they could still do it and it would really help the election go more smoothly,\" Kristin Eberhard, director of democracy research at the Sightline Institute, a nonprofit think-tank, said. \"There's no reason not to. There's every reason to do it.\"\n\nShe said she believes Trump's rhetoric about mail-in voting fueled GOP resistance to legislation that should be nonpartisan.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's become such a partisan football. I think Republican lawmakers are kind of getting accused from the head of their party that they shouldn't be making reforms or making anything easier around absentee voting,\" Eberhard said.\n\nMcReynolds, who oversaw elections in Denver, which conducts its elections entirely by mail, said extended processing periods let voters know the status of their ballots earlier and help election officials, who require more manpower and equipment if ballots build up.\n\n\"This would be like telling the IRS and telling the public, 'You have to have your taxes in by April 15. The IRS can't touch it until the day of the 15th, and it has to be done by the next day.' That's basically what we're saying to our election officials in these states,\" she said.\n\n\"They need to do it as soon as possible,\" McReynolds said, \"but even if they did it in two weeks, it's still very, very positive and impactful for the election.\"\n\nContributing: Ian Richardson, Des Moines Register\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/12/election-day-2024/74767715007/", "title": "When is presidential election day 2024?

But the wait was less than an hour at most locations by late morning, and less than 30 minutes at half of them.\n\nOther parts of the state had longer wait times. There were reports of voters waiting two hours or longer in some locations.\n\nSarasota resident Francine Santacroce waited about an hour to vote at the Sarasota Square Mall early voting location. There were nearly 100 people in line there at 3 p.m. Monday. Santacroce said she didn’t mind waiting.\n\n“It was important for me to do my duty,” said the 63-year-old Publix meat cutter.\n\nSantacroce always votes in person, saying: “It’s something I like the electricity of.” She was eager to cast her ballot for President Donald Trump.\n\n“He’s had a proven track record,” she said, arguing he’s been successful despite “every time he’s tried to do something there’s been so much push against.”\n\nIn-person early voting was the most popular form of voting in Florida in 2016. Mail voting almost certainly will eclipse it this year, but there still are a large number of people who would rather cast their ballots in person, and elections officials are expecting steady traffic at early voting locations across Florida.\n\n“This will be big for the next 14 days,” Turner said.\n\nVoters are being encouraged to social distance and wear masks.\n\nAt Sarasota’s downtown voting location, tape marks have been put on the floor to keep voters apart. Every voting booth is sterilized after it is used, and so is the equipment that voters touch, Turner said.\n\nDespite the lines, Turner said people were in a good mood Monday.

The anticipation and anxiety surrounding this election is high.\n\nSarasota resident Jennifer Fairley, 44, was among the first few dozen people in line Monday at the elections office downtown.

Now, it’s setting its sights on adding more varieties of cans, bottles and value packs to offer cash-strapped consumers more options — even if that ultimately means paying more for less.\n\n“Package innovation takes a bigger role,” when shoppers are worried about spending, CEO James Quincey said Tuesday during an analyst call discussing third-quarter results. “We will be approaching ’23 with a broad innovation agenda, but with some slight weighting to packaging.”\n\nFor companies like Coke, offering more types of containers — particularly smaller ones — is a way to hold on to or draw in customers worried about spending, even as prices continue to increase.\n\n“It’s about extending the price ladder,” Quincey said, “making sure the entry price point … becomes as low down in the price spectrum, the actual out-of-pocket, as possible.”\n\nThat’s especially important now, as Coca-Cola has seen consumers start to tighten their belts because of soaring prices.\n\nTo keep price-conscious customers in the fold, companies like Coke offer more packaging options. George Frey/Getty Images\n\nSome shoppers have started to spend less at the grocery store. “Therefore, the price point becomes even more important than the price per liter,” Quincey said. “That’s absolutely what we’re pursuing.”\n\nIn other words, even though customers may end up paying more per liter when they buy small packages, some are willing to make that trade to get a lower price because they cannot afford the higher priced item.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) has already been selling smaller containers and multi-packs with fewer cans. In the third quarter, the company introduced a value collection that offers customers products in a variety of sizes. Those items, available at some stores in the US, are “helping to retain and recruit more consumers while creating value for our customers,” Quincey said.\n\nThe CEO also pointed to returnable containers as another way of lowering costs, because consumers get some money back for returned bottles and cans.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced a goal to sell at least a quarter of all of its beverages worldwide in refillable or returnable containers by 2030. (Coca-Cola also recently announced a change to the look of Sprite bottles, ditching its signature green for clear plastic, which is easier to recycle.)\n\nThose strategies could help offset the impact of higher prices on consumers. The company expects inflation and volatility in the commodities market to affect its own costs, and is likely to continue to raise prices.\n\n“There’s going to be above normal input costs,” Quincey said on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. “So we are expecting pricing to be ahead of normal next year on top of what’s happened this year. ”\n\nThe company is eyeing other changes as well, including adding “more premium options for those that still have plenty of disposable income,” Quincey said during the analyst call.\n\nAnd it plans to continue to bolster Coke Zero Sugar, a growth driver, with more marketing and other innovations.\n\nSo far, Coca-Cola’s pricing and innovation strategy appears to be working. In the third quarter, the company’s net revenues jumped 10% to $1.1 billion.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}]}

Agents assigned to airports and train stations singled out passengers for questioning or searches for reasons as seemingly benign as traveling one-way to California or having paid for a ticket in cash.\n\nThe DEA surveillance is separate from the vast and widely-known anti-terrorism apparatus that now surrounds air travel, which is rarely used for routine law enforcement. It has been carried out largely without the airlines’ knowledge.\n\nIt is a lucrative endeavor, and one that remains largely unknown outside the drug agency. DEA units assigned to patrol 15 of the nation’s busiest airports seized more than $209 million in cash from at least 5,200 people over the past decade after concluding the money was linked to drug trafficking, according to Justice Department records. Most of the money was passed on to local police departments that lend officers to assist the drug agency.\n\n“They count on this as part of the budget,” said Louis Weiss, a former supervisor of the DEA group assigned to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. “Basically, you’ve got to feed the monster.”\n\nIn most cases, records show the agents gave the suspected couriers a receipt for the cash — sometimes totaling $50,000 or more, stuffed into suitcases or socks — and sent them on their way without ever charging them with a crime.\n\nThe DEA would not comment on how it obtains records of Americans’ domestic travel, or on what scale. But court records and interviews with agents, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to discuss DEA operations, make clear that it is extensive. In one 2009 court filing, for example, Justice Department lawyers said agents took $44,010 from two people traveling on a train to Denver after picking them out during “a routine review of the computerized travel manifest for Amtrak.”\n\nUSA TODAY identified 87 cases in recent years in which the Justice Department went to federal court to seize cash from travelers after agents said they had been tipped off to a suspicious itinerary. Those cases likely represent only a small fraction of the instances in which agents have stopped travelers or seized cash based on their travel patterns, because few such encounters ever make it to court.\n\nThose cases nonetheless offer evidence of the program’s sweep. Filings show agents were able to profile passengers on Amtrak and nearly every major U.S. airline, often without the companies’ consent. “We won’t release that information without a subpoena,” American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said.\n\nBy itself, a suspicious itinerary amounts to little more than a tip; it’s not enough evidence to permit agents to detain passengers, search their bags or seize their cash. Instead, agents use it to approach travelers and ask if they would be willing to answer a few questions, a process that often ends with them either asking for permission to search the person’s bags or having a dog sniff them for drugs.\n\nAgents seized $25,000 from Christelle Tillerson’s suitcase in 2014 as she was waiting to board a flight from Detroit to Chicago. The Justice Department said in a court filing that agents became interested in Tillerson after they “received information” that she was headed to Los Angeles on a one-way ticket.\n\nTillerson told the agents that her boyfriend had withdrawn the money from his U.S. Postal Service retirement account so that she could buy a truck, according to court records. Agents were suspicious; Tillerson was an ex-convict, who had spent time in prison for driving a load of marijuana into the United States from Mexico. She seemed to have little money of her own. And a police dog smelled drugs on the cash.\n\nAgents seized the money, and let Tillerson go. Her lawyer, Cyril Hall, said she was never arrested, or even questioned about whether she could give agents information about traffickers.\n\nA year and a half later — after she produced paperwork showing that much of the money had indeed come from her boyfriend’s retirement fund — the Justice Department agreed to return the money, minus $4,000. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Detroit, Gina Balaya, said prosecutors concluded that “a small percentage of the funds should be forfeited.”\n\n“It was outrageous. It’s still outrageous,” Hall said.\n\nFederal law gives the government broad powers to seize cash and other assets if agents have evidence that they are linked to crime. That process, commonly known as asset forfeiture, has come under fire from lawmakers in recent years after complaints that police were using the law as a way to raise money rather than to protect the public or prevent crime.\n\n“Going after someone’s property has nothing to do with protecting them and it has everything to do with going after the money,” said Renée Flaherty, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, an advocacy group that has battled asset forfeiture cases.\n\nTo the DEA, cash seizures are one prong of a broader financial fight against gangs and Mexican cartels, which have reaped huge profits — usually in cash — from selling drugs in the United States. Agents “employ strategies and methods that attack the financial infrastructure of these criminal organizations,” spokesman Russ Baer said, including tracking the couriers they use to transport the money.\n\nBaer said agents receive information from employees at \"airlines, bus terminals, car rental agencies, storage facilities, vehicle repair shops, or other businesses.\" He did not explain why so many suspected couriers are released without charges.\n\nMining travel records\n\nThe DEA came under fire for harvesting travel records two years ago, when Amtrak’s inspector general revealed that agents had paid a secretary $854,460 over nearly two decades in exchange for passenger information. A later investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general found that the secretary initially looked up reservations only at agents’ request, but quickly “began making queries on his own initiative, looking for indicators that a person might be planning to transport illegal drugs or money on a train,” according to a report obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nFive current and former agents said the DEA has cultivated a wide network of such informants, who are taught to be on the lookout for suspicious itineraries and behavior. Some are paid a percentage if their tips lead to a significant seizure. Records filed in asset seizure cases suggest the drug agency’s informant network is broad enough that agents have been able to profile passengers traveling on most major airlines, including American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, United and others.\n\n“Basically, it’s what that Amtrak guy was doing, but at the airport,” said a senior DEA agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss the agency’s use of confidential informants.\n\nCourt records show agents and informants flagged travelers for questioning based on whether they were traveling with one-way tickets, had paid in cash, had listed a non-working phone number on the reservation or had checked luggage. They also appeared to pay particular attention to people headed to cities such as Los Angeles (which prosecutors described as “a well-known source city for marijuana and other types of narcotics”), Fresno (“known for large quantities of outdoor grown marijuana”) and other California cities.\n\nAgents said Zane Young fit that profile when they approached him at Phoenix’s airport in 2015: An informant had told them that Young had bought a last-minute, one-way ticket from Orlando to Las Vegas, with a stop in Phoenix, according to a civil complaint filed in federal court there. And he appeared to have a record of having been arrested for a minor marijuana offense. They seized $36,000 from his bags.\n\nYoung’s lawyer, Thomas Baker, said in a court filing that the drug agency’s profile was “vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and can be manipulated to include just about anyone who flies on a commercial airline.”\n\nThe Justice Department agreed in May to return half the money, without explanation.\n\nExactly how often agents contact people based on their travel records is impossible to determine. Few cash seizures are challenged in court; those that aren’t leave no public record.\n\nAnd the Justice Department’s Inspector General has complained that the DEA’s airport units often did not track the instances in which they question someone but did not make an arrest or seizure.\n\nWhat the drug agency could not do was access the sea of data the government collects from airlines to spot potential terrorists. Airlines must provide basic information about all of their passengers to the Department of Homeland Security three days before a flight so that they can be checked against terrorist watch lists. That system is so tightly focused on detecting potential terrorists that the government typically will not use it even to spot wanted fugitives.\n\nNor were agents able to get information directly from the airlines. “They really did not want to be associated with subjecting their passengers to government scrutiny because of the privacy issues,” Weiss, the former DEA supervisor, said. \"They discouraged their employees from assisting us.\"\n\n'We want the cash'\n\nDrug agents were on the lookout for Nina Haywood when she stepped off an American Airlines flight at John Wayne Airport in the Los Angeles suburbs two years ago.\n\nThey knew she was returning from a trip to Tulsa that had lasted less than 12 hours, according to court records. They knew she had checked a suitcase, and they had a drug dog sniff it as baggage handlers unloaded it from the airplane. A detective assigned to a DEA task force approached her while she was waiting at the baggage claim.\n\nHaywood’s answers to their questions gave agents still more reason to be suspicious. When they asked why she had been in Tulsa, Haywood replied that she had been visiting her aunt in the hospital, but couldn’t remember the aunt’s last name. When they asked whether she had packed her own bag, Haywood answered that a different aunt had packed it for her, but she couldn’t remember that aunt’s name, either. They found $41,471 stuffed in her suitcase, stuffed in envelopes inside a toiletry bag and a pair of white tube socks, according to court records.\n\nHaywood also gave agents permission to search her cellphone. On it, the Justice Department said, they found a text message from an acquaintance asking why she was going to Tulsa.\n\n“Money baby money!!!!” she answered.\n\nHaywood was never charged. She declined to comment.\n\nA DEA group assigned to Los Angeles’ airports made more than 1,600 cash seizures over the past decade, totaling more than $52 million, according to records the Justice Department uses to track asset seizures. Only one of the Los Angeles seizure records included an indication that it was related to a criminal indictment.\n\nSuch charges appear rare. Of the 87 cases USA TODAY identified in which the DEA seized cash after flagging a suspicious itinerary, only two resulted in the alleged courier being charged with a crime. One involved a woman who was already a target of a federal money-laundering investigation; another alleged courier was arrested a month later on an apparently unrelated drug charge.\n\nIn many cases, current and former agents said, it was not clear that the couriers had committed a crime for which they could be arrested — at least not one that prosecutors would be willing to pursue as the Justice Department shifts its focus away from minor drug offenses. Instead, Weiss and others said, agents investigated the couriers after they were released in the hopes of finding a toehold that would let them identify bigger trafficking organizations.\n\nMany of the people from whom agents seized cash had records of minor drug arrests. And some were more significant targets.\n\nTwo years ago in Nashville, for example, agents intercepted a man prosecutors described in court filings as being a “top target” of a gun violence crackdown in Baltimore and a member of a drug crew known as LAX (also the shorthand for Los Angeles’ main airport). The man, Antroine Figueroa, was carrying $24,010 in cash.\n\nAgents told him they thought he was on his way to buy cocaine.\n\nFigueroa replied, “You can’t buy a kilo for $25,000,” according to court records.\n\nThe agents let him go without charges, but kept the money. Figueroa’s lawyer declined to comment on the case.\n\nThe DEA started monitoring airports in 1975. At the time, traffickers routinely used commercial flights to move large quantities off drugs both into and around the United States. But the airport security overhauls that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 made that kind of smuggling far more difficult. Over time, three agents who worked at airports during that period said, the operation became increasingly focused on seizing the cash proceeds of drug sales that still dribbled through the airport in the backpacks and suitcases of low-level couriers.\n\nBaer said the DEA’s airport groups — scattered from Los Angeles to Atlanta — do more than seize cash. In recent years, they have arrested drug trafficking rings that had infiltrated the airlines and used their badges to help carry large quantities of drugs past security checkpoints and onto commercial flights. A group assigned to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York seized 92 kilograms of cocaine and 27 kilograms of heroin since 2013.\n\nStill, current and former agents said, when it came to intercepting individual passengers, the goal was usually to find cash.\n\n“We want the cash. Good agents chase cash,” said George Hood, who supervised a drug task force assigned to O’Hare International Airport in Chicago before he retired in 2007. “It was just easier to get the asset, and that’s where you make a dent in the criminal organization.”\n\nContributing: Jessica Campisi in McLean, Va.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2024/04/08/who-is-running-for-office-in-maricopa-county/70172585007/", "title": "Maricopa County elections: Supervisor, sheriff, recorder candidates", "text": "This year's election cycle is expected to be a pivotal one for Maricopa County, the most populous in Arizona.\n\nIts past decade has been dominated by a population boom, mounting costs from a landmark racial profiling lawsuit, several high-profile resignations and a wave of election denialism that has led to threats against sitting elected officials.\n\nNow, all of its top seats are up for grabs.\n\nVoters will weigh in on county supervisors, who serve on a five-member board responsible for setting a vision and direction for the region. The county recorder, who maintains voter registration records and administers early voting, will also be on the ballot.\n\nBut those aren't the only county races voters will decide. Here's who is running for control of the county's future.\n\nCounty supervisors directly control the county's $4.5 billion checkbook. That gives them authority over the resources of the Sheriff's Office, Attorney's Office and other departments with elected heads.\n\nAdditionally, they serve as the municipal body for those living in unincorporated areas of the county, who aren't residents of cities or towns and do not get the same amenities as those who are.\n\nSupervisor spots are highly coveted by Arizona politicos, often serving as a stepping stone to higher political office. Supervisors are not term-limited, and all of the seats on the board will be up for election in 2024.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors has long been a Republican stronghold with a solid conservative majority. But demographics are changing in the Valley, which could give Democrats a chance to pick up seats on the board — and win a majority for the first time in decades.\n\nEven some primary races for the seats are expected to be contentious. The county's sitting supervisors were hit with unfounded accusations of widespread fraud and a stolen election after Donald Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe situation has only intensified in the years since, with conservative candidates and personalities launching challenges and criticism at Maricopa County before, during and after the 2022 election. It didn't help that the county experienced widespread technical issues on Election Day. Now, some GOP candidates are seeking to unseat incumbent Republican supervisors with conspiracy-focused platforms.\n\nHere's who is running:\n\nThe county recorder manages public records, including property documents and governmental information.\n\nThey are also responsible for maintaining voter registration records and administering early voting, including mailing out early ballots, providing on-site early voting locations and verifying voter signatures on early ballot affidavits and petitions.\n\nThe recorder holds tremendous power over how elections are run within the county, and previous politicians in the position have pushed massive changes to the way the county votes.\n\nFormer Recorder Adrian Fontes eliminated the use of assigned polling places in favor of vote centers where anyone can cast a ballot and expand early voting options — decisions that spurred some errors, legal challenges and criticism that he disregarded the spirit of the law in favor of partisan priorities.\n\nIn more recent years, the position has been mired in election conspiracies. County recorders across the state have received threats stemming from false fears of a stolen election in 2020. Some have left their posts after continued, relentless harassment.\n\nHere's who is running for recorder:\n\nStephen Richer: He was elected county recorder in 2020, beating out Fontes for the seat. Richer previously worked as an attorney. His background is in business management and public policy, with stints at think tanks such as American Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute.

Stringham lives in Tempe and is running as a Democrat.\n\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office is one of the largest sheriff's offices in the nation, with upwards of 3,000 employees, including deputies, jail guards and civilians.\n\nThe office is tasked with patrolling unincorporated areas of the county, as well as municipalities without a designated police force. It also serves Superior Court orders and warrants, collects delinquent taxes, coordinates search and rescue missions and oversees the county's five jails.\n\nFormer Sheriff Paul Penzone, a Democrat, blew the race wide open when he unexpectedly announced that he would step down from his post a year early.\n\nHis time in office was largely spent grappling with the legacy of his predecessor, Joe Arpaio. The Republican's tenure was marked by multimillion-dollar lawsuits arising out of jail deaths, political prosecutions, racial profiling that led to criminal contempt-of-court charges and other scandals.\n\nPenzone rolled back some of Arpaio's practices, including closing the outdoor jail known as \"Tent City\" and ending the use of pink underwear for incarcerated people. But he allowed others to continue. Under his tenure, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continued to screen people in county jails for potential immigration violations, allowing them to detain people they believed to be deportable as they were released from county custody.\n\nAdditionally, the Sheriff's Office remains under the cloud of the Melendres v. Arpaio court case and the resulting set of federal court orders that require the department to be watched by a court-appointed monitor.\n\nWhile Penzone has consistently claimed the conditions that brought about federal oversight — civil rights violations, targeting people of color — are no longer present in his Sheriff's Office, some activists say the underlying attitudes that brought about those problems still exist. Costs related to the court case continue to mount, reaching $250 million in May.\n\nHere's who is running for sheriff:\n\nIn their words: We asked the candidates five questions, including why they want to be sheriff.

The office also provides legal services for the Board of Supervisors and county departments and agencies.\n\nThe seat has a long and controversial history. Former Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery was a hardline, law-and-order politician who critics described as overall punitive. He spent $400,000 building up an arsenal of semi-automatic rifles that were hidden around his downtown Phoenix office building. Later, former Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel resigned from her position amid questions about her sobriety and absences from office.\n\nThe office continues to grapple with questions about racism in the criminal justice system, the conduct of some of its prosecutors and enforcement of Arizona's new abortion law.\n\nHere's who is running for county attorney:\n\nRachel Mitchell : She has served as county attorney since 2022. Before taking on the role, she served as a bureau chief at the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office overseeing teams of prosecutors, most notably the sex crimes bureau. That experience led her to be tapped by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question witnesses during the hearing involving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.

But it’s not the only cause of the spike.\n\nNumerous factors are pushing prices up, with regular gasoline hitting a record $4.67 a gallon Wednesday according to AAA’s survey.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired in Eastern Europe or economic sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\n“I think we reach $5 somewhere between this weekend and Juneteenth/Father’s Day weekend,” he said.\n\nIt was back in March that prices first broke the record of $4.11 a gallon, which had stood since 2008. That now seems like the good old days: The national average has been rising steadily for the past month, setting 27 records in the last 28 days.\n\nMore than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than $5 a gallon for regular, and just more than half are charging $4.75.\n\nThere are 10 states, plus Washington, DC, where the average price is already at $5 or more: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Several more are within a penny of $5, so those states’ prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark.\n\nThat’s because there’s a number of reasons beside the disruption of Russian oil exports driving prices higher according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. And making predictions about where prices will go has proved difficult. Wednesday’s record is already higher than Kloza a few weeks ago expected prices would reach. As school let out and summer travel picks up, so will gasoline demand and price, he said.\n\n“Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,” Kloza said.\n\nHere’s what’s behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. In 2021 Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects prices around the globe no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led Western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nBut in March the United States announced a formal ban on all Russian energy imports. And Monday the EU announced a ban on imports of Russian oil by ship, which represented about two-thirds of the oil European nations imported from Russia. Russia’s oil is slowly and steadily being removed from global markets.\n\nChina lockdowns ending\n\nOne factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of Covid cases, and strict lockdown rules in much of the country. That was a major drag on demand for oil.\n\nBut as the Covid surge has started to retreat, the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as Shanghai. And more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nLess oil and gas from other sources\n\nOil prices plunged when pandemic-related stay-at-home orders around the world crushed demand in the spring of 2020, and crude briefly traded at negative prices. In response, OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed to slash production as a way to support prices. And even when demand returned sooner than expected, they kept production targets low.\n\nUS oil companies don’t adhere to those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns that tougher environmental rules could cut future demand. Many of those stricter rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\n“The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,” Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said earlier this spring. “People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.”\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n“They can’t find people, and can’t find equipment,” McNally added. “It’s not like they’re available at a premium price. They’re just not available.”\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives would rather find ways to boost their share price than increase production.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, said earlier this spring. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks, instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nOne of the starkest examples: ExxonMobil (XOM) last month announced first quarter profits of $8.8 billion, more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items. It also announced a $30 billion share repurchase plan, far more than the $21 billion to $24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment, including searching for new oil.\n\nNot only is oil production lagging behind pre-pandemic levels, US refining capacity is falling. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be processed into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. Some companies are closing older refineries rather than investing what it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd the fact that diesel and jet fuel prices are up far more than gasoline prices shows that refiners are shifting more of their production to those products.\n\n“Economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline,” said Kloza.\n\nAnd with prices in Europe even higher than in the United States, both Canadian and US oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent. That has also limited the US supply.\n\nStrong demand for gas\n\nBut supply is only part of the equation for prices. Demand is the other key, and while it’s very strong right now, it’s still not back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US economy had record job growth in 2021, and while those gains have slowed, they remain historically strong. Demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office.\n\nThe start of the summer travel season on Memorial Day weekend is likely to spark the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel. US airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel, even with airfares climbing above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel. US trips in passenger vehicles have increased 10% since the beginning of this year, according to the mobility research firm Inrix.\n\n“Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations,” said Kloza.\n\nCommuting may remain down slightly. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, and the total number of jobs is still slightly below 2019 levels. But there will be periods, most likely this summer, with higher demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic, Kloza predicts.\n\n“Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,” Kloza said. “Now it’s a question of how much we break the record by.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/us/us-border-entry-food-rules-cec/index.html", "title": "If you're planning to travel to the US with food items from overseas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUnited States border officials have a message for travelers who bring food items from overseas: Violations will cost you.\n\nLast month, a passenger traveling from Indonesia to Darwin Airport in Australia’s Northern Territory was fined $1,874 after two egg and beef sausage McMuffins – along with a ham croissant – were found in their luggage. (Australian authorities had imposed tough new biosecurity measures on all arrivals after a foot and mouth disease outbreak in Indonesian livestock.)\n\nIn a separate incident a few days earlier, an Australian woman was fined $1,844 after she forgot to declare a leftover Subway sandwich she bought in Singapore.\n\nIn the past year alone, US border officials have fined passengers for bringing a wide range of undeclared food items in their luggage, including balut eggs, pork bologna and turkey ham. Border officials conducted “630,150 positive passenger inspections” in 2021, according to statistics for the fiscal year released by US Customs and Border Protection, and issued thousands of penalties and violations to travelers who failed to declare prohibited agriculture items.\n\nCBP officials at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston discovered balut eggs in a passenger's luggage on March 6. Balut eggs contain a duck embryo, and are boiled and eaten from the shell. US Customs and Border Protection\n\nFailure to declare food products at US air, sea and land border entry points can lead to fines and penalties of up to $10,000, according to the CBP.\n\nHere’s what you need to know before bringing food products into the US.\n\nWhy are some foods not allowed?\n\nTravelers bringing food products into the US can inadvertently introduce foreign pests and food-borne diseases into the country, which can have a devastating effect on agriculture and the environment. And a pest or disease outbreak could impact more than just farmers. It also means higher grocery bills and shortage of some food items for consumers.\n\nLast year, border officials discovered 264 pests at US ports of entry, a slightly higher number than the 250 found the prior year. Pests intercepted last year include a Saunders 1850 butterfly larvae found in pineapples from Costa Rica. The larvae feeds on plants and legumes, and is considered an invasive pest mainly found in Amazonian tropical rainforest. Introducing it in the US ecosystem could be detrimental to the agriculture industry, the CBP said.\n\n“We work closely with the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Health Inspection Services to prevent the introduction of plant pests and foreign animal diseases,” a CBP spokesperson told CNN.\n\nWhat food products are not allowed into the country?\n\nMost meat, poultry, milk and egg products are either banned or restricted in the US – with rules depending on the country of origin and what livestock diseases are prevalent in the region.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture prohibits animal and bird products from countries with reported cases of livestock diseases such as mad cow, foot-and-mouth, avian flu and swine fever. The USDA provides a link where travelers can check common animal diseases in specific countries.\n\nSometimes, there are gray areas. Pork products from Mexico are banned, for example, but a small amount for personal use – like a ham sandwich – may be allowed at land borders if the meat is thoroughly cooked.\n\nWhat food products can you bring?\n\nA long list of food items are allowed into the US, including condiments, cooking oils, bread, cookies, crackers, cakes, cereal, packed tea and other baked and processed products. The CBP provides a list of allowed items on its website.\n\nJarvis, a beagle, works in the baggage claim area at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. He's part of the Beagle Brigade, which works with border officials to sniff out banned food items in luggage. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a catch: If a traveler brings over 50 pounds of an item, it’s considered a commercial shipment and must undergo additional measures, including extra safety inspections. And every agricultural food item has to be declared on US Customs forms, so inspectors can examine them and ensure they do not carry harmful foreign pests or diseases.\n\n“The declaration must cover all items carried in checked baggage, carry-on luggage or in a vehicle,” the CBP’s website notes.\n\nCan you bring in fruits or vegetables?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nNearly all fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are prohibited from entering the US due to risks of pests and diseases – some of which can survive in frigid temperatures, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Even the fruits and vegetable snacks provided on an airplane or cruise ship should be left behind, says Lucero Hernandez of the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nTravelers crossing a land border into the United States from Canada can bring some fresh fruits and vegetables – as long as they were grown in Canada. But they need proof that the produce is free of soil, pests, and diseases, and that it was grown in Canada, not just sold there, the USDA says.\n\nAnd in all cases, travelers coming to the US should save receipts and original packaging to prove food products’ country of origin, according to the CBP.\n\nWhat happens if you bring forbidden items?\n\nTravelers who declare agricultural products in their luggage don’t face penalties – even if an inspector concludes the items are not eligible to enter the country, the USDA says. In such cases, the food is destroyed.\n\n“An apple or snack that can mistakenly be brought won’t always make a significant incident,” the CBP spokesperson explained of an unintentional failure to declare a food item. “However, attempting to bring in prohibited items would lead to traveler delays and may result in a fine.”\n\n“Failure to declare a prohibited food item may result in the issuance of a civil penalty,” the spokesperson added.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/us/r-kelly-sentencing-racketeering-sex-trafficking/index.html", "title": "R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal racketeering and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDisgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Kelly, 55, to more than 25 years behind bars, while his defense attorneys asked for 10 or fewer, saying prosecutors’ request was “tantamount to a life sentence.”\n\nSurvivors of Kelly’s abuse held hands and prayed as US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly began reading his sentence. Kelly – who wore a tan prison uniform, dark-rimmed glasses and a black mask at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn – showed no emotion.\n\n“You left in your wake a trail of broken lives,” Donnelly told Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.\n\nIn deciding the sentence, Donnelly said she considered Kelly’s own traumatic childhood, during which his attorneys said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member and a landlord.\n\n“It may explain, at least in part, what led to your behavior,” the judge said. “It most surely is not an excuse.”\n\nJovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, praised the sentence.\n\n“I started this journey 30 years ago,” Cunningham said outside the court after the hearing. “There wasn’t a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls. I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.”\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”\n\nThe five-week federal trial in Brooklyn included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating the disgraced R&B singer’s 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she’d gotten pregnant.\n\nKelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said he would not address the court, pointing to the other criminal case faced by Kelly, but said before the sentence was read that her client “rejects that he is this monster.”\n\n“He accepts that he is a flawed individual,” Bonjean said, “but he is not this one-dimensional monster that the government has portrayed and the media has portrayed.”\n\nKelly made his only comment in response to the judge after Bonjean said he wouldn’t speak: “Yes, your honor, that’s my wish.”\n\nBonjean said she advised Kelly not to speak at the sentencing because of pending litigation against him, but added, “he has regrets. And he is sad. Nobody wants to hear what he heard today.”\n\nKelly and the judge are seen in a sketch of the sentencing. Sketch by Christine Cornell\n\n‘No one can undo the harm’\n\nPrior to sentencing, the court heard impact statements from seven of Kelly’s victims, including Jane Doe 2, who testified at trial.\n\n“It’s been 23 years since we knew each other, and you’ve victimized a lot of girls since then,” she said, addressing Kelly. She later added: “Now it’s your turn to have your freedom taken from you.”\n\n“No one can undo the harm that has been done to these victims,” attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three victims who testified, told reporters Wednesday outside court. “But at least it’s time for Mr. Kelly to be accountable.”\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors argued Wednesday in court over whether Kelly even could pay a fine. The defense said he is “pretty close to indigent” and could not. Prosecutors disagreed, saying money from the sale of some of his music rights and millions of dollars in royalties held by Sony could cover any fine.\n\nIn the nine months since his conviction, Kelly has replaced his entire legal team with Bonjean and her firm. Bonjean is the attorney who helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned and also represented Cosby in a civil case he lost this month at trial.\n\n“We were prepared for it,” Bonjean said of the sentence outside the court. “We are now prepared to fight this appeal.”\n\nKelly is being held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn and is expected to be moved back to Chicago, where he faces another federal trial in August on child pornography and obstruction charges.\n\nBonjean will ask for Kelly to continue to be held at the Brooklyn federal detention center as her team prepares for his upcoming trial, she told CNN on Thursday, adding she is based in New York. CNN has sought comment from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Bureau of Prisons and US Marshals, who would be tasked with moving Kelly.\n\nKelly also has state cases pending in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nChildhood trauma revealed\n\nIn over 14 hours of interviews with psychiatrist experts, Kelly said his closest relationship growing up was with his mother. His earliest memories were watching his mom perform as a singer in a band called “Six Pack,” and he would often accompany her to McDonald’s where she would drink coffee and they would share a pastry.\n\nKelly had never met his father and described his mother’s death as the most tragic event of his life, saying he would go to McDonald’s frequently to smell the coffee and remember her, according to a letter filed by Renee Sorrentino, a clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“To me, the ‘M’ stands for mom. Going to McDonald’s is always being around my mother,” Kelly said.\n\nBut his childhood was also marked by trauma.\n\nKelly saw a childhood sweetheart drown when he was a little boy. And people interviewed by psychiatrist experts say Kelly was repeatedly sexually abused beginning when he was a 6 or 7-year-old boy, his attorney wrote, saying he was abused by his older sister and also a landlord, at times on a “weekly basis.”\n\nSorrentino said in her letter Kelly’s childhood sexual abuse may have contributed to his “hypersexuality,” or difficulty controlling sexual urges, and believes it was a factor in his criminal convictions.\n\nWhile Kelly was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, Sorrentino refused to diagnose Kelly with pedophilia because he told her his “sexual behavior has never involved prepubescent individuals,” she said.\n\nFaith, another woman who testified at Kelly’s trial, countered that defense argument Wednesday in her victim impact statement, saying her own father had also been sexually abused as a child but “never molested me.”\n\nSupport for the singer\n\nAmong the letters that asked for a shorter sentence for Kelly was one written by Diana Copeland, Kelly’s former assistant who testified as a government witness and said she wrote a letter in support of Kelly because it was the “right thing to do.”\n\n“God doesn’t want us to throw humans away,” Copeland wrote. “If we have the audacity to care for the perpetrators as well as the victims, we can all rise.”\n\nJoycelyn Savage, who was considered a victim of Kelly’s by prosecutors, also remains a supporter.\n\n“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage wrote. “I’m a grown woman, and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.”\n\nIn her letter, Savage revealed she is now engaged to Kelly.\n\nProsecutors faced threats\n\nAhead of the sentencing, a Chicago man who had attended Kelly’s trial in Brooklyn was arrested and charged for making threats against the three US attorneys who prosecuted Kelly, a copy of his arrest warrant shows.\n\nChristopher Gunn was arrested Saturday for allegedly posting threats to kill or seriously injure the female prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant, Gunn posted video to his YouTube channel in October, shortly after Kelly was found guilty, that showed an image of the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York where the women work. Prosecutors believe a voice narrating the video is Gunn’s, and he says, “That’s where they at. That’s where they work at … We’re going to storm the office,” saying each of the three prosecutors’ names.\n\n“If you ain’t got the stomach for the sh*t we ‘bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” he allegedly said in the video.\n\nProsecutors also analyzed a CashApp account linked to Gunn that shows multiple transactions from February 26, 2021, to June 1 that indicate Gunn “engaged in the sale of firearm ammunition in relation to the Kelly matter,” they said. Transactions included payments for $20 with descriptions saying “30 rounds.. free R kelly.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Kelly for comment.\n\nProsecutors believe Gunn was planning to attend Kelly’s sentencing on Wednesday after he posted another video saying he had a “spot” for supporters to meet up near the courthouse.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Gunn, who is expected to have a detention hearing Friday.

But just because there’s a news appetite for it doesn’t mean that Boeing is responsible for everything that goes on with its aircraft once they leave the factory floor.\n\nAt a time when people are thinking about the planes they fly on more than usual, it can be hard to highlight relevant information without misleading readers into thinking there’s more malfeasance than there actually is.\n\nIt’s a newsroom conversation every time we see Boeing bubbling in news trends. My job is to hold Boeing accountable without fearmongering.\n\nAviation professionals agree that while Boeing and its practices deserve scrutiny, you should still feel all right flying on its planes.\n\nSo, let’s try to cut through the noise.\n\nWhat’s wrong with Boeing?\n\n“There are genuine worries about Boeing in terms of its performance as a company, its safety culture, its manufacturing culture,” Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of The Air Current, told me.\n\nIt’s hard to boil down the problems at Boeing because they didn’t happen overnight. They’re systemic and the result of a series of small changes and corporate decisions over decades that de-emphasized engineering excellence and safety and put extra importance on shareholder returns. But that’s not the only thing.\n\n“During COVID we had a lot of retirements that happened both on the pilot front and the mechanic front, and there was a lot of senior expertise that left,” Laurie Garrow, a civil engineering professor specializing in aviation at Georgia Tech, told me. “The senior expertise probably provided a series of checks and balances that are being relearned and reinstitutionalized in some companies.”\n\nGarrow is on a consulting contract with Boeing on unrelated issues. She said her perspective applies to not just Boeing but the aviation industry as a whole.\n\nAccording to Ostrower, Boeing needs to change its corporate culture to emerge from the current shadow.\n\n“Boeing’s behavior in terms of the design of the 737 Max is an aberration in an otherwise phenomenally safe system,” he said. “They need to put themselves back together, and I mean that quite literally. There has been an internal breakup of the company over decades that has fractured their workforce, both the engineers and the machinists, spiritually and geographically.”\n\nBoeing is, of course, under investigation by federal regulators as a result of these issues. It’s unclear what the outcome of those investigations will be, but it seems likely that some internal company changes will be required.\n\nWhat airplane issues is Boeing responsible for?\n\n“What’s going on at Boeing is distinctly separate from the types of issues that happen in service, that by the way, would largely go unnoticed or unreported on if it wasn’t what happened on Alaska 1282,” Ostrower said.\n\nSaid another way: A Boeing plane can be involved in an incident that has nothing to do with Boeing itself.\n\n“There is a pile-on fixation that happens in the broader media landscape,” Ostrower said. “That is a function of how people are feeling about their confidence in Boeing, but it fundamentally is not related to anything that’s been going on at Boeing.”\n\nGarrow pointed out that aviation is extremely safe overall and has only gotten safer over time.\n\n“A lot of the safety features have redundancy. A lot of the kinks have been worked out,” she said. “Not every aircraft flies perfectly, there are maintenance issues that happen, but they are getting increased scrutiny right now.”\n\nOf course, Boeing is responsible for manufacturing defects like the missing bolts that led to the Alaska Airlines explosive decompression earlier this year. But as an airframer, Boeing doesn’t manufacture things like engines – those are supplied by other companies – or place the tires on planes that have been in service for many years. Once an aircraft is away from the factory, airlines largely take over its maintenance.\n\n“If a flight is delayed because of a problem, it’s because someone has noticed it and it’s being addressed,” Ostrower said.\n\nThat’s the system working.\n\n“These are incredibly complex machines, and they run at a reliability level that is truly extraordinary,” Ostrower added. “There are levels of redundancy. You can defer maintenance items in a safe and well-understood way. … 'This component wasn’t active on my airplane, and that’s fine, you can operate safely with that, it’s approved to do that.'”\n\nWhat is an emergency landing?\n\nAnother gray area when it comes to the news is emergency landings. A casual traveler understandably hears the word “emergency” and thinks of the absolute worst case. Still, the Federal Aviation Administration allows, and in fact encourages, pilots to declare an emergency in any “distress or urgency condition.”\n\nAccording to the pilot/controller glossary, that can include “a condition of being concerned about safety and of requiring timely but not immediate assistance.”\n\nAviation safety is built on redundancy and overcaution, so a pilot declaring an emergency is usually another sign that the system is working as designed. It doesn’t always bear being reported on.\n\nAre Boeing airplanes safe?\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\n“Trust has been broken at Boeing and the airlines are paying for that,” Ostrower said. “It makes it really hard for us to say ‘Trust the airlines and their processes,’ but you have to because there’s ample evidence and ample history and safety culture to back that up.”\n\nThousands of Boeing aircraft fly without incident every day. Eventually, the company’s place at the top of the news cycle will fade, though the focus on safety throughout aviation will remain as it always has.\n\n“People shouldn’t have to think about what kind of airplane they’re getting on, and we need to get back to that,” Ostrower said. “The way we’re going to get back to that is through getting not just Boeing but the airlines on a reliable footing.”\n\nIn the meantime, Garrow said, travelers should consider the bigger picture.\n\n“The few times an aircraft has gone down or there has been a major accident. I personally have found it very difficult the next day to get on a flight if I’m traveling. Aviation has one of the best safety records of all of the modes and I personally don’t want to change my life – not go on my dream vacation to Europe or not go on my professional trip that I literally could not drive to – because of a fear of flying,” she said. “I just always remind myself that aviation has had one of the best safety records, and I’m comforted by the fact that I’m not driving the plane, that I have two experienced pilots that have been trained for multiple safety scenarios, and I’m in good hands when I travel.”\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

Here's what you can do", "text": "Are we sharing too much of our personal health data?\n\nIt’s a question worth asking after massive breaches of our personal health data in recent years and reports that, even in low-tech settings like a hospital waiting room, privacy protocols are faulty.\n\nAccording to the health trade publication HIPAA Journal,more hospitals and doctors’ practices reported breaches in 2016 than in any other year since the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Civil Rights, which collects data on leaks, startedpublishing breach summaries in 2009.\n\nAmong the latest leaks: Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in New York City left patients' names, home addresses, medical and mental health diagnoses, addiction histories, HIV statuses and even sexual assault and domestic violence reports exposed online. The culprit: A misconfigured backup server that stored the medical data.\n\nTwo years ago, Anthem Inc. notified 80 million customers that their personal health information may have been stolen after the insurer was hit by a sophisticated cyber attack.\n\nMake no mistake,those vast databases give healthcare providers a comprehensive view of their patients’ health, an advantage that easily could be lifesaving in an emergency. The down side is those databases put our most private information at risk for exposure.\n\nHospitals, insurers, doctors and government agencies didn’t pay “much attention to privacy and security” in their rapid efforts to digitize a lot of health data and aggregate it electronically, says Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation a digital liberties nonprofit.\n\nEven the choice of paper envelopes can make your private health data public to unwanted views. Insurer Aetna recently told its customers that it was aware of a late July \"privacy breach\" after it mailed prescription information in envelopes with large, clear plastic windows. Two legal groups representing individuals with HIV had notified Aetna after the patients received envelopes exposing their participation in HIV prevention or treatment programs.\n\nMore:You've split from your fitness tracker. Can you get your data back?\n\nMore:4 ways to finance health care in retirement\n\nShocked? Do this\n\nAs scary as these examples are, the solution isn't to stop seeking medical treatment. Patients can take some steps to protect their data and their privacy.\n\nOne thing to do is a reference check on your insurer, hospital or health care provider by visiting the Office of Civil Rights' list of providers that have experienced breaches, sometimes referred to as the “Wall of Shame.” Since July 1 alone, 35 breaches have been reported and are under investigation affecting more than 850,000 individuals.\n\nYou can also report basic human negligence to a hospital or physician practice's privacy officer if you experience the low-tech ways privacy breaches happen — from a computer printout left in a trash can or a computer screen left visible to anyone with a decent pair of eyes.\n\nPatients can also demand their hospital or doctor follow these best practices for health care providers:\n\n-- In the waiting room, limit the information asked for on a sign-in sheet (for instance, don’t ask the reason for their appointment).\n\n-- Instead of calling someone out loud by their full name, only use their first name and the initial of their last name.\n\n-- And, if there’s a board listing patient names, follow the same protocol (just like the airlines do at the gate nowadays. I’m always listed as “PET, S.”).\n\nHere’s one story that didn’t have to happen: A couple of years ago my husband checked into UNC Health Care in Hillsborough, N.C. for an outpatient procedure. In the waiting room, I couldn’t help but notice a computer that listed all the scheduled patients that morning: Name, age, doctor, and procedure. No screen saver came on during the hour I sat there.\n\nAppalled by the dearth of privacy, I took a photo of what I had seen and then reported the problem to a staff member. She didn’t seemed fazed by the disclosure, but said she’d relay the breach on up the food chain and that someone would be in touch. When I did get a response back, it was from the hospital's legal department -- rebuking me for taking a photo of the computer screen listing the patient names.\n\nThen earlier this month, now two years later, a friend of mine whose wife gave birth at a different UNC Health Care facility told me that he’d seen the same thing — a computer screen left open for all to see.\n\nWhen I spoke with the UNC chief privacy officer, David Behinfar, he said he couldn’t discuss specifics of those incidents, but said \"we need to take much more care of our electronic health records” speaking both about UNC Health Care and other medical institutions. This includes \"simple privacy practices,\" such as the purchase of screen protectors and the requirement that staff must re-enter password and login information after a short timeout. Be on the lookout for these precautions.\n\nSimple stuff? Yes. But look only to the “Wall of Shame” to note how many breaches are the result of “improper disposal” of records, theft and loss.\n\nWhat more you can do\n\n-- Ask your health care provider or medical institution about their security measures and if they don’t know, find out who does. Data should be encrypted, “not left in plain text and vulnerable to criminals,” says Bob Diachenko, the chief security communications officer at Kromtech Security Center who discovered the Bronx-Lebanon breach. Regular security audits are a must.\n\n-- Don’t provide your Social Security number on forms, says UNC’s Behinfar, who fears the “devastating effects” of identity theft if the data is hacked.\n\n-- If you have especially sensitive information—a mental health disorder, history of an abortion or a sexually transmitted infection, or a genetic predisposition, talk with your health care provider about your concerns. Consider asking your doctor to exclude it from your record but be careful about omitting pre-existing conditions since that leave some doctors in the dark about your medical history (and may be considered fraud when it comes to insurers).\n\n-- Speak up if you witness a breach. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU’s Langone Medical Center, says: “If you see something, say something.”\n\nAs for the answer to my original question: If there were better security protections in place, both for high-tech and low-tech leaks, there wouldn’t be a problem of this magnitude. Without that, any information you divulge, no matter how private, could become public.\n\nMore:With my cell-phone number, a private eye found 150 pages on me\n\nMore:I got taken for a ride by a fake Uber driver.

Photos from opening day showed customers hoisting massive sandwiches and Crimo posing with his beaming family – including his eight-year-old son Robert Crimo III, who went by Bobby.\n\nThe deli quickly became a popular local fixture: a hangout spot for teenagers, a friendly gathering place for the neighborhood, and a pit stop for an affordable, delicious lunch.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the Crimo family was in turmoil. Police reports show that officers were regularly called to their home over domestic disputes between Crimo and his wife, and in 2019, police briefly confiscated a collection of knives after then 18-year-old Bobby threatened to “kill everyone.”\n\nMore recently, after the once-bustling deli closed, the family appeared to fall into dire financial straits, with foreclosure cases proceeding against both of the homes they owned and Bob Crimo telling a judge several weeks ago he was on food stamps.\n\nThen, as Highland Park prepared to celebrate the Fourth of July this week with the annual parade through the city’s picturesque downtown, Bobby allegedly climbed onto a cosmetics store rooftop with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire on the festivities, killing seven people and injuring dozens of others.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, the close-knit community of Highland Park is reeling and trying to understand a massacre with no apparent motive. Locals said that it was even more shocking that the shooter was Bobby Crimo – the son of a well-known local figure beloved by his regular customers, who even ran for mayor several years ago.\n\nBob Crimo at the Bob's Pantry and Deli opening in 2008. Obtained by CNN\n\nThe elder Crimo is facing scrutiny in part because he sponsored a permit allowing his son to purchase firearms before he turned 21, including the gun he used in the shooting. Locals who once lined up for “Nicky D” sandwiches at Bob’s say they can’t comprehend how the family could have missed warning signs, including violent imagery in the music videos Bobby posted online, or why Crimo would have signed the gun permit application.\n\n“To be that irresponsible and signing off is mind-blowing to me,” said Barbara Medina, a longtime Highland Park resident who often shopped at the deli and was marching in the parade when the shooting took place. “It’s a shock that it’s anybody in your town, that they could come in and do that to their own community.”\n\nCrimo did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, but in an interview with the New York Post, he said he had no idea Bobby was preparing to commit the shooting and that he wasn’t responsible for his son’s actions.\n\n“I’ve been here my whole life, and I’m gonna stay here, hold my head up high, because I didn’t do anything wrong,” he declared.\n\nPolice called to family home several times\n\nMore than a dozen Highland Park residents who knew the shooter or his family spoke to CNN about his upbringing, as they tried to piece together how their city had joined the long list of American communities whose names have become shorthand for mass shootings.\n\nBy all accounts, Bobby Crimo was a quiet kid, who could be seen running around his dad’s shop as he grew up. His father ran the White Hen Pantry, a franchise of a local convenience store chain that became known for its sandwiches.\n\nIn an affluent lakeside suburb where most shops closed early, the White Hen Pantry was open 24 hours, giving teenagers a safe hangout spot at night. Regulars remembered the elder Crimo as a gregarious, generous presence who would let customers waiting on a paycheck buy food on credit, and who seemed to be manning the counter at all hours of the day and night.\n\nLocals described Crimo as “the mayor of Ravinia,” the local neighborhood where the store was located, who knew all his customers and their regular orders.\n\nLoyal customers eagerly await the opening of Bob Crimo's deli in 2008. Obtained by CNN\n\nCrimo could be eccentric: One time, a friend said, he competed with another local restaurant owner to see which business could go longer without replacing any lightbulbs – until both stores were almost completely dark.\n\nCrimo’s shop closed after 7-Eleven bought out the White Hen Pantry chain. But Crimo reopened in a new location under his own name, and his loyal clientele followed.\n\nStill, there were signs of trouble in the family. One longtime customer and friend of Crimo’s — who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about the family — remembered that he and his wife, Denise Pesina, would have heated arguments in the deli, even in front of customers.\n\n“It was awkward for people,” the friend said. “I remember thinking, if that’s the public arguments, I can only imagine the private ones.”\n\nPolice reports released this week show that the couple’s fights continued behind closed doors. In the six years after the deli opened, officers were called to their home at least a dozen times to settle domestic disputes or respond to allegations that one or the other was intoxicated.\n\nIn one 2010 incident, Crimo alleged that Pesina “had hit him with a screwdriver on the left forearm” – before recanting once he got to the police station – and in another, he claimed she hit him on the head with a shoe.\n\n“He threatens to call the police for any and every argument we get in,” Pesina wrote in one handwritten witness statement. “He says he wants the police to think I’m crazy.”\n\nThere is no record that any of those incidents led to criminal charges against either Crimo or Pesina.\n\nThe two separated at some point, according to friends, with Pesina staying in their Highland Park home and Crimo moving to his father’s home in neighboring Highwood. Bobby lived in both homes over the years.\n\nPesina had had another brush with the law as well: In 2002, when Bobby was nearly two years old, she was arrested for child endangerment after allegedly leaving him in a locked car at a Toys-R-Us parking lot for about 27 minutes on a 79-degree day with the windows rolled up, according to court documents. Pesina pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment, and completed a year of court supervision.\n\nPesina did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Her lawyer at the time, Steven Lunardi, said that she admitted having made a mistake.\n\nJeremy Cahnmann, who taught Bobby and his brother in an elementary after-school sports program, said the boys stuck out in his memory because their parents almost never picked them up on time.\n\n“I remember talking to faculty at the school about how uninvolved the parents were,” he said. Bobby was “always the kid there at the end who didn’t get picked up.”\n\nFormer classmates describe suspect as withdrawn and odd\n\nAt school, Bobby kept to himself, with former classmates of the future gunman describing him as an odd, soft-spoken kid who showed little interest in class, school activities or his peers. But he explored a different side of his personality with rap songs and music videos he posted online – some of which included troubling imagery.\n\nMolly Handelman, who attended middle school and high school with Bobby, described him as a “very quiet” guy. “When he did talk, he was very soft. He didn’t seem aggressive ever, at all,” she said.\n\nHandelman, who worked with Bobby on class projects a few times, said “something definitely seemed off” about him. “He made it very clear he didn’t care about school,” she said.\n\nAnother former classmate who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns said he and Bobby used to hang out, play video games and skateboard together in middle school. “He would make YouTube videos all the time back then,” the classmate said, “DIY videos on how to grip a skateboard or replace a wheel, stuff like that.”\n\nBut in high school, the former classmate said, Bobby grew more insular and distant. “He was always by himself,” he said. “No one seemed to try to be his friend.”\n\nAccording to a school district spokesperson, Bobby stopped attending Highland Park High School in 2016, after his freshman year. It’s unclear whether he went to another school after dropping out.\n\nA body is transported from the scene of a mass shooting during the July 4th holiday weekend in Highland Park, Ill. Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/AP\n\nIn recent years, Bobby revealed a louder side of himself online, posting music videos he apparently made – some of which featured ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence. Bobby, who made music under the moniker “Awake the Rapper,” uploaded his music on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website.\n\nIn one video titled “Are you Awake,” Bobby sports multicolored hair and face tattoos and declares, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.” The video shows a cartoon animation of a stick-figure man resembling Bobby in tactical gear, carrying out an attack with a rifle.\n\nIn another video, a similar stick-figure cartoon character resembling Bobby is depicted lying face down on the ground in a pool of his own blood, surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn. And in a third, Bobby is seen wearing a helmet and a tactical vest and dropping bullets onto the floor of a classroom.\n\nFinancial struggles took a toll\n\nAs Bobby was struggling in school, his father’s business was also having trouble staying afloat. Regular customers said that they noticed more of the shelves in the store going empty, and the hours it was open shrinking. In conversations with friends, Bob Crimo complained about a downturn in the business, increases in rent, and fees he said he had to pay the city.\n\nIn 2018, Crimo settled on a solution: running for mayor of Highland Park. People who knew him said they were puzzled about why he would embark on what seemed like a quixotic campaign against the popular incumbent, Nancy Rotering, who was Bobby’s former Cub Scout leader.\n\nIn a local news profile, Crimo talked about making the city more business-friendly, but he didn’t seem to actively campaign, and it’s unclear how seriously he took the race. State records show Crimo didn’t receive any campaign donations other than a $560 loan from himself, which he spent on yard signs. In the end, Rotering won 72% of the vote in the April 2019 election, soundly defeating Crimo.\n\nIn another blow, Crimo’s deli shuttered around the same time. Google Street View photos show that while the shop had a big “Bob Crimo for Mayor” poster hanging in the window in late 2018, by September 2019, the storefront was vacant and empty.\n\nAccording to court documents, the store was under a mountain of debt: A lender sued the deli and Crimo in late 2018, alleging he owed more than $764,000. A judge ruled in the lender’s favor by default in March 2019 after Crimo failed to appear in court. It’s unclear whether the debt was ever paid.\n\nGun permit granted despite ominous threats\n\nAround the same time, Bobby started showing more troubling behavior.\n\nIn April 2019, according to police reports released by Highland Park, officers performed a wellness check on the 18-year-old Bobby after receiving a report that he had “attempted to commit suicide by machete” a week prior. Mental health professionals handled the episode, officers wrote.\n\nThen in September of that year, police received the report that Bobby had “stated that he was going to kill everyone.” Bobby admitted that he was depressed and had a history of drug use, according to the report. His father turned over a collection of 16 knives, a dagger and a “Samurai type blade” to police, and officers sent the Illinois State Police a “clear and present danger” report related to the threats Bobby made. But the state police declined to approve that determination, which could have blocked Bobby from buying guns, because there wasn’t enough evidence to do so, the agency said this week.\n\nJust three months later, Crimo signed his son’s application for a Firearm Owners Identification card, a requirement to buy guns in Illinois. Under state law, young adults under 21 years of age need a parent or guardian to sponsor them in order to get the permit.\n\nCrimo told the New York Post that he sponsored the application so his son could shoot at a gun range. This week, an attorney for Bob Crimo – who no longer represents him – told the Chicago Tribune that Crimo was not aware of the incident that resulted in the confiscation of the knives when he signed the card. Yet, according to the state police, Crimo was actually the one who reclaimed the knives from officers. In the Post interview, Crimo downplayed Bobby’s threats in that incident as a “childish outburst.”\n\nAttorney George Gomez, who is representing both parents, told CNN that “the family denies that there was any issues of suicide at the time,” and stressed law enforcement found “no safety risk.”\n\nBobby went on to use the card to legally purchase multiple guns before he turned 21 last year, passing a total of four background checks, according to the state police. That included the semi-automatic rifle he used in the shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, the family’s finances appeared to unravel in recent years. HSBC Bank filed for foreclosure on their Highland Park house, where Bobby had grown up, in December 2019, alleging Crimo, Jr. owed more than $460,000. The case was delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the lender restarted efforts to take possession of the home last year.\n\nIn April 2022, a mortgage servicing company filed to foreclose on a second property Crimo owns in the neighboring town of Highwood. The company, NewRez LLC, alleged that he had failed to make payments since July 2020, and owed more than $197,000.\n\nIn the Highland Park case, a judge granted Crimo a full waiver of court fees in May after he appeared in person and provided proof that he was receiving food stamps, according to court documents.\n\nLast Thursday – four days before the shooting – Crimo filed a last-ditch motion to block foreclosure of the house, arguing the lender hadn’t given him sufficient notice of being in default or of accelerating the due date for the balance of the mortgage.\n\nPaul Crimo, Bob’s brother, who lives with him and worked at his delis, told CNN he didn’t think the financial stress affected Bobby.\n\n“My brother always made sure his kids always had a roof over (their) head at all times,” he wrote in a text message, adding that Crimo “is a great father.”\n\nCommunity looks to family for answers\n\nMourners embrace during a memorial for the victims of the July 4th parade shooting on July 5, 2022 in Highland Park, Ill. Taylor Glascock for CNN\n\nSome of the Highland Park residents who were at the parade when Bobby opened fire said they blamed the father for allowing his son to buy guns.\n\nThe elder Crimo “should be held liable for it and responsible for it,” declared Fred Kroll, a three-decade Highland Park resident who attended the parade with his wife and daughter and said he saw multiple people shot dead. “Whether it’s civil lawsuits by the survivors or he goes to jail … he should be punished.”\n\nState officials have poured cold water on the idea of Crimo facing criminal responsibility over the deaths. “There’s not a criminal liability that’s directly attached to vouching for someone else… and they end up doing something terrible like this,” said Eric Rinehart, the Lake County State’s Attorney.\n\nGomez said the family is “trying to cooperate with all local, state, and federal authorities at the moment.” When asked if he felt there was any criminal wrongdoing on part of his clients, particularly the father, Gomez said, “we take the position that my client, Crimo Jr., did nothing wrong in this case.”\n\nCrimo reportedly has said he wants “a long sentence” for his son, who faces seven counts of first-degree murder and a sentence of life in prison, if convicted. Illinois abolished capital punishment in 2011.\n\nStill, even Crimo’s friends say they doubt he’ll be able to stay in his hometown, or ever open a business here again.\n\n“His kid shot up his hometown, and he’s going to have to come to terms with that action and, honestly, the role he played in his son’s evolution as a person,” one friend said. “It was his son’s name on the news – and that’s his name, too.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Daniel A.

Bailey\n\nWhat is racketeering?\n\nThe federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act originated in 1970 to fight organized crime by allowing prosecutors to target people at the top of criminal organizations.\n\nStates then passed their own RICO laws so prosecutors could charge multiple people involved in a conspiracy together if they were working toward a common goal.\n\nGeorgia’s RICO law, adopted in 1980, makes it a crime to participate in, acquire or maintain control of an “enterprise” through a “pattern of racketeering activity” or to conspire to do so. The alleged scheme does not have to have been successful for a RICO charge to be proven.\n\n− Ryan Randazzo\n\nWhere is Fulton County?\n\nFulton County is located in northwest Georgia.

During an impromptu press conference, Greene said she spoke to Trump on Thursday ahead of his booking.

Why?\" she said.\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow long will Trump be arrested for?\n\nIn a typical booking process, a defendant has their fingerprints and mugshot taken, according to Chris Timmons, a trial attorney at the Knowles Gallant Timmons law firm.\n\nIf the defendant is being taken into custody, they would be put in a holding cell, Timmons said. But defendants can have legal agreements that get them out of custody without having to post bail.\n\n“In this particular case, I don't expect anyone going into custody,” Timmons previously USA TODAY.\n\nThe time a booking takes depends on the person, Timmons added. Taking fingerprints takes about three minutes, and getting a mug shot taken takes a minute and a half to two minutes.\n\n“I would assume if the former president of the United States (is) coming to the jail that they're going to be efficient − ready to go,\" Timmons said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat does indictment mean?\n\nAn indictment is a formal document that contains allegations that someone committed a crime. It includes the charges laid out against a person and is filed before a case can move forward in court, David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nWeinstein said that an indictment means a grand jury decided that there’s “more likely than not” enough evidence – based on testimony – to move forward with charging a person. At least twelve jurors must be in agreement that a defendant allegedly committed a crime to issue an indictment.\n\nAfter a person is indicted, they must go to trial where a jury will reach a unanimous decision on whether to pursue conviction.\n\n− USA TODAY staff\n\nWho is Fani Willis?

Georgia prosecutors allege Trump orchestrated a series of crimes with a common objective in mind – remaining in power despite his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nThe Georgia case is centered on the state’s RICO statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The law was originally intended to combat organized crime, specifically aimed at prosecuting mafia bosses. Though the mafia is largely non-existent today, RICO laws are still used to battle other forms of criminal enterprise.\n\nRICO laws allow prosecutors to connect multiple crimes among multiple defendants for them to tell a clear story. The charges detail what prosecutors allege is a clear conspiracy to overturn Trump’s loss in the state, with the former president as the mastermind behind the crime.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhy is Donald Trump being arrested?\n\nTrump faces 13 charges for alleged racketeering, soliciting state officials to violate their oaths of office, making false statements, filing false statements and conspiracy dealing with fake electors in the state.\n\nThe indictment from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis details a series of episodes where Trump urged state officials to change presidential electors, where his lawyers made false claims about election fraud to state lawmakers and where he asked Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to alter the election results.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump raises presidential campaign funds off surrender, arrest\n\nDonald Trump wielded his Georgia arrest Thursday as a fundraising tool for his presidential campaign, as he has after previous indictments.\n\nIn a message to supporters, Trump called the “unjust” arrest “a staged and televised spectacle” that he called a “shakedown.”\n\nTrump argued that all four indictments against him – including two from the Justice Department and one in New York – were designed to strike fear into Americans and intimidate his supporters.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump to surrender at Fulton County jail criticized for poor conditions\n\nTrump and other defendants in the case are being booked at Fulton County jail, which is known for its poor conditions and management.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating the jail's living conditions, medical care and use of excessive force.\n\n\"The jail is a public health nightmare,\" Terrica Ganzy, executive director of the Southern Center Human Rights, said in a statement.\n\nLaShawn Thompson, 35, was found dead in his cell at the Fulton County Jail last year.

Fulton County Attorney Fani Willis offered to start the trial two months after the indictment, on Oct. 23.\n\nTrump has proposed to delay his other pending criminal trials until after the 2024 presidential election. Willis had proposed to start her trial March 4, although Trump and the judge haven’t responded yet.\n\nChesebro is a lawyer who allegedly developed the strategy to have Vice President Mike Pence reject the state’s presidential electors when Congress counted them Jan. 6, 2021.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Willis launched a fundraising website four days before the indictment was handed up, promoting her investigation into Trump. A county clerk inadvertently released the charges against Trump before the grand jury voted. And a judge barred Willis from investigating Lt. Gov. Burt Jones in the case because she held a fundraiser for his political opponent.\n\n“The timing of this prosecution reinforces concerns about your motivation,” Jordan wrote.\n\nJordan also questioned the timing of the indictment. Willis began her investigation in February 2021 and brought charges two and a half years later. She proposed the trial begin March 4, eight days before Georgia’s primary, when Trump is running for president and Willis is running for reelection.\n\n“It is therefore unsurprising many have speculated that this indictment and prosecution are designed to interfere with the 2024 presidential election,” Jordan said.\n\nJordan asked Willis to provide information by Sept. 7 about federal funding to her office and communications with Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump with interfering with the 2020 election.\n\nLegal experts and House Democrats argued Jordan was interfering with a local prosecution when he wrote a similar letter to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who charged Trump with falsifying business records.\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\nRudy Giuliani's surrender demonstrated how Trump's arrest could be chaotic\n\nRudy Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former federal prosecutor who was indicted with him, attracted a throng of reporters and a crowd of protesters supporting or opposing the charges when he surrendered at the Fulton County jail.\n\nGiuliani's political strategist, Ted Goodman, signaled to reporters he would give an impromptu statement after being booked. But he attempted to hold the gaggle in the middle of a two-lane street, which would have blocked traffic in an area sheriff's deputies spent hours trying to keep clear.\n\nResidents near the jail demanded vehicles be towed for parking along the neighborhood streets. One resident was so fed up with the national spotlight he screamed at people to leave the area while driving up the tiny road. The loudspeaker of a deputy's SUV blared orders for reporters to disperse.\n\nGiuliani’s team found another location, but reporters, protesters and body guards swarmed him before he took two paces out of his SUV.\n\n“This indictment is a travesty,” Giuliani said, as city crew workers began setting up portable toilets for tomorrow when Trump's booking is expected to bring an even larger crowd.\n\n– Phillip M.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nWith the Super Bowl win with Tampa Bay, Brady joined Peyton Manning as the only starting quarterbacks in NFL history to win a Super Bowl with multiple teams.\n\nBrady is the first quarterback in league history to lead his team to seven Super Bowl wins, surpassing Terry Bradshaw (four) and Joe Montana (four). Brady’s 10 Super Bowl appearances is more than any franchise in the Super Bowl era – the Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers each have eight.\n\nIn his final season, Brady led the league in passing yards (5,316) and touchdowns (43) and earned an NFL-best 15th Pro Bowl selection.\n\nBrady was named to the league’s 2000s All-Decade Team, the 2010s All-Decade Team and the NFL’s 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft paid his respects to Brady’s career, saying in a statement that: “Words cannot describe the feelings I have for Tom Brady, nor adequately express the gratitude my family, the New England Patriots and our fans have for Tom for all he did during his career.\n\n“A generation of football fans have grown up knowing only an NFL in which Tom Brady dominated. He retires with nearly every NFL career passing record, yet the only one that ever mattered to him was the team’s win-loss record. In his 20 years as a starter his teams qualified for the playoffs 19 times. He led his teams to 10 Super Bowls, winning an NFL-record seven championships. In a team sport like football, it is rare to see an individual have such a dominant impact on a team’s success.\n\n“You didn’t have to be a Patriots fan to respect and appreciate his competitiveness, determination and will to win that fueled his success. As a fan of football, it was a privilege to watch. As a Patriots fan, it was a dream come true.\n\n“I have the greatest respect for Tom personally and always will. His humility, coupled with his drive and ambition, truly made him special.

What should fans expect?", "text": "Tom Brady’s journey to the broadcast booth began 28 months ago when FOX CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the stunning announcement on an earnings call that the storied quarterback would be joining the network’s top announcing team … eventually.\n\nAt the time, Brady had reversed course on his initial retirement announcement and committed to another season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He took a “gap year” during the 2023 season, prompting questions about whether \"Brady the broadcaster\" would actually ever happen. Finally, when the Cleveland Browns host the Dallas Cowboys at 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday in America’s “Game of the Week,” the most decorated player in NFL history will hold the microphone in his much-anticipated second act.\n\nBrady has discussed his new career little during his sporadic public-speaking engagements. FOX has not made Brady, any of their top broadcast team talent or production staff available for comment on the seven-time Super Bowl champion’s preparation.\n\nBrady requires little promotion. But his new career will be one of the most notable storylines of the 2024 NFL season, all the way until he calls Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans.\n\n“It’s going to take a while for all of us to get used to Tom Brady,” longtime broadcaster and media personality Boomer Esiason said. “It’s not going to happen overnight.”\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nWhat to expect from Tom Brady in broadcasting\n\nOver the past year, Brady has done his due diligence in learning the broadcasting trade. He’s reached out to top analysts at other networks, such as NBC’s Cris Collinsworth and ESPN’s Troy Aikman, for advice. According to The Athletic, he watched a January Miami Dolphins home game from the NBC production truck. He and broadcast partner Kevin Burkhardt have called practice games; Brady would apologize to Burkhardt after mistakes, and the play-by-play man offered reassurances, Brady said in a sit-down interview with FOX “NFL Sunday” host Curt Menefee.\n\n“I want to get up every day and try to prove to them, ‘Hey guys, I know I’m the rookie, but I’ve got your back, too,’” Brady told Menefee.\n\nBecause of this level and type of preparation, Esiason said Brady’s entrance into the business is unique.\n\n“Nobody has done it the way he’s done it thus far,” the New York radio host and former broadcaster told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nEarly on, Esiason said, the broadcasts may sound more like an interview between Burkhardt and Brady. As they built chemistry, the pair will sound more like a traditional booth. Brady won’t be perfect and will make mistakes, and Esiason believes Burkhardt is the ideal broadcaster to be the safety net alongside a rookie announcer.\n\n“I knew he was going to be good. And he turned out to be great,” said Esiason, who started watching Burkhardt while he was the reporter for the local New York Mets’ television broadcasts. “FOX found a replacement for Joe Buck. That’s how good ‘KB’ is.”\n\nEsiason knows the importance of starting on the right foot with a new broadcast partner. He and Al Michaels famously did not work well together in their lone season in the “Monday Night Football” booth on ABC. Burkhardt, 50, is three years older than Brady, and Esiason predicted the duo would have enough in common to form a foundation during their first go-round.\n\n“I think that’s the perfect guy for a guy going into it for the first time,” Esiason said.\n\nHow critical will Tom Brady be of NFL players, coaches?\n\nSince actually retiring, and even during his final years in Tampa, Brady has been unafraid of offering his opinions through a variety of media, mainly his SiriusXM podcast, “Let’s Go!” Last season, while speaking with Stephen A. Smith, Brady was critical of the league’s coaching and rules that protected offensive players.\n\n“I think there's a lot of mediocrity in today's NFL,” Brady said.\n\nThe three-time Most Valuable Player posted on social media last December that quarterbacks should “throw the ball to the right places” following a hit that injured Indianapolis Colts wideout Michael Pittman Jr.\n\nPrior to his New England Patriots’ Hall of Fame induction ceremony in June, Brady told Yahoo! Sports that “quarterbacking has gone backwards a little bit in the NFL” due to coaching at both the college and pro levels.\n\nThe purest form of football commentary comes from “somebody that’s devoid of friendships and somebody who isn’t afraid to criticize,” Esiason said.\n\nBrady curtailed expectations about how harsh he might be during Fanatics Fest in New York last month. On a panel with ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, Brady said he might want to make a remark that a play “was horrible.”\n\n“I just can't say that on TV,” he said.\n\n\"Why not?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"Well, because there are parents and there are family members, and I don't want to always necessarily say it in that way,\" Brady said. \"But if I was doing it myself, and let's say I threw a really bad interception, I would walk to the sidelines and say, 'You are the worst quarterback in the world. How could you possibly make that throw? Terrible!'\n\n\"But I don't want to be so critical, because in some ways I don't necessarily know exactly what the problem was on that play.”\n\nIn 1997, the New York Times wrote about how Esiason’s relationship with Cris Collinsworth had taken a hit because of Collinsworth’s assessments early in his broadcast career.\n\nCollinsworth’s advice to Brady was what everybody at FOX told him – and is one of the core tenets of sports television: be yourself.\n\n“Just be yourself,” Brady told Menefee. “I’m like, ‘That’s the worst advice.’”\n\nThe kind words are a bit different in tone from what Collinsworth told the Times 27 years ago.\n\n“This is a nasty business,” Collinsworth said then. “But I can only rationalize what I do by seeing myself as a coach. If everyone loves you, you're not a good coach.”\n\nRestrictions are already shaping Brady’s work. As he pursues a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, Brady is not permitted to enter another team’s facility, thus barring him from traditional production meetings and access that rights holders are accustomed to. Burkhardt, the production team, and sideline reporters Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi are still allowed to hold those meetings, and Brady can also acquire original information similar to how Peyton Manning does for his “ManningCast” shows.\n\nPermitted to call Raiders games, Brady must abide by the league constitution and bylaws, the NFL said, which could “prohibit public criticism of officials and other clubs.”\n\nAikman, who formerly sat in Brady’s chair at FOX before joining “MNF” two years ago, told the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast in June that Brady will have to find his voice in that respect.\n\n“I think he’s gonna give an honest, unvarnished opinion,” Aikman said, “and I think he’s gonna be really good.”\n\nHow will fans react to Tom Brady’s announcing?\n\nOn the other side of the criticism spectrum is how Brady will receive the inevitable detractors. Brady will always have a handle on what’s happening on the field and is eloquent enough to relay it, Esiason said. An adjustment period will occur nonetheless.\n\n“His voice is a little bit higher-pitched,” Esiason said, “so people are going to have to get used to that for three-and-a-half hours.”\n\nWorking against Brady is that football fans already have an opinion of him. Followers of teams in the AFC East not named the New England Patriots likely won’t have the kindest feedback at the outset.\n\nSocial media has only amplified the negativity. At some point Sunday, Esiason said, Brady will be trending. The criticism going his way is “gonna come hot and heavy.” There will be trolls and supporters.\n\n“I don’t think Tom would be overly affected about that,” Esiason said, “but you never know.”\n\nBrady does have instant credibility and respect of most fans due to his individual accomplishments and commitment to the game.\n\n“Still, everybody will nitpick,” said Esiason, who called \"Monday Night Football\" and the Super Bowl for Westwood One from 1999-2018 and was a member of CBS' \"NFL Today\" on Sundays until this year.\n\nThe job of a lead network analyst requires thick skin.\n\n“Reptile skin to get in there (the booth),” Esiason said.\n\nWhich leaves Esiason asking the question everyone else has on their minds as the GOAT smiles for the camera and fires up the telestrator.\n\n“Do you really want to do this?”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/patriots/2022/01/29/tom-brady-retiring-from-nfl-patriots-buccaneers/9269400002/", "title": "Tom Brady, NFL quarterback, retiring after 22 seasons, 7 Super Bowls", "text": "The greatest quarterback of all-time and the greatest story in New England sports history will be hanging up his cleats.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Tom Brady is retiring from the NFL after 22 ridiculously successful seasons that saw him develop from a sixth-round pick to a seven-time Super Bowl champion.

Not only did Brady unseat a franchise quarterback, but he then led the Patriots to the franchise’s first Super Bowl win, in an incredible upset victory over the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\nHave you heard about that time Tom ...?:Ex-teammates share their favorite Brady stories\n\nAt first, the Patriots dynasty was built off strong defensive play and a clutch young quarterback with ice in his veins. By his fifth NFL season, Brady helped the Patriots win three Super Bowls with wins over the Carolina Panthers (Super Bowl XXXVIII) and Philadelphia Eagles (XXXIX). Those first five years would’ve been enough to place Brady among the all-time greats in NFL and Patriots history.\n\nInstead, Brady developed into the greatest quarterback of all-time. He won three NFL MVP awards in 2007, 2010 and 2017. In 2007, Brady set an NFL record with 50 touchdown passes to go with 4,806 passing yards. He led the Pats to the NFL’s first undefeated regular season since the 16-game schedule began in 1978. Of course, that season ended in disappointment with the Patriots losing to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. That marked the first of what would be three Super Bowl losses for Brady and the Patriots. They also lost to the Giants during the 2011 season in Super Bowl LII.\n\nYou could easily break Brady’s career off in multiple parts. There was the first part of the dynasty with the three Super Bowl rings. There was the middle part from 2005-2013 where Brady suffered his only season-ending injury in 2008 and as good as the team’s offense was, the Patriots went 10 years before they’d win another Super Bowl.\n\nBrady's still here:Everywhere you can find the former Patriots QB around Gillette Stadium.\n\nBrady’s last run with the Patriots (2014-2019) was spectacular. In 2014, he won his fourth Super Bowl title with the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX over the Seattle Seahawks. Brady was named the Super Bowl MVP for the third time in his career, tying Joe Montana’s record. He finishes his career with an NFL record five Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nControversy marked this period of Brady’s career when he was suspended for four games over the Deflategate scandal. Brady appealed the suspension with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Although some – including Brady – claimed weather forced footballs in the 2014 AFC Championship game to be deflated, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodwill claimed Brady ordered two Patriots employees to deflate footballs.\n\nThe NFL without Tom Brady?:Twitter reacts to TB12's retirement news\n\nThat cost Brady four games to start the 2016 season, but marked the start of one of the most successful runs in NFL history. The Patriots won their fifth Super Bowl that year with Brady getting the ultimate revenge for the scandal. That game – Super Bowl LI – also saw Brady orchestrate the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. The Patriots were trailing the Atlanta Falcons 28-3 midway through the third quarter. Brady & Co. scored 25 unanswered points to force overtime before winning. Brady won his record fourth Super Bowl MVP that night.\n\nThe Pats ended up going to three Super Bowls in a row. As Brady aged through his late 30’s, he never showed signs of slowing down.\n\nAfter beating the Falcons, Brady and the Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII the next season. Brady threw for a Super Bowl and playoff record 505 yards in the 41-33 loss. That season saw a 40-year-old Brady lead the NFL in passing yards en route to his third NFL MVP award. In typical Brady fashion, he got the Patriots back to the Super Bowl the next season. The quarterback won his sixth ring in a 13-3 win over the Rams in Super Bowl LIII.\n\nThe 2019 season saw Brady’s time in New England come to an end. With rumors swirling of discontent between him and coach Bill Belichick, the quarterback signed a new contract that summer that voided at the end of the league year and didn’t allow the Patriots to place the franchise tag on him.\n\n\"It wasn’t a question of not wanting him\":Belichick says he never wanted Brady to leave\n\nThe Pats season ended in the wildcard round that year. Two months later, Brady announced he was signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At age 43, he did it again – leading the Buccaneers to a 31-9 championship win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV.\n\nBrady won the MVP on that night as well. He also became the second quarterback in NFL history, joining Peyton Manning to lead two different teams to Super Bowl wins, but the first to earn Super Bowl MVP honors with two different franchises.\n\nHe became the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl, win and win the MVP award. With seven Super Bowl titles, Brady has the most championships in NFL history and ties Otto Graham for the most in professional football history.\n\nIn his final season, at age 44, Brady finished with a career-high 5,316 passing yards to go with 43 passing touchdowns. Both marks led the NFL. The Buccaneers season ended in the wild card round. Of course, after falling behind 27-3, Brady led Tampa Bay to tie the game with 24 unanswered points before the Rams won in the closing seconds.\n\nAfter 22 years, seven championships and a spoiled New England fan base, Tom Brady is now onto Canton.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/05/06/tom-brady-roast-netflix-patriots-belichick-gronk/73582349007/", "title": "Tom Brady roast on Netflix: 12 best burns* of NFL legend, Bill ...", "text": "\"The Greatest Roast of All Time: The Roast of Tom Brady,\" part of the annual \"Netflix is a Joke Festival,\" took place Sunday night at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, and aired live on the streaming platform.\n\nBrady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback, was the key figure getting roasted.

Even for an ...", "text": "NASHVILLE – Another Tom Brady roast continues.\n\nNFL owners held another round of meetings this week, and the business did not include finalizing a much-anticipated deal that would allow the iconic former quarterback to purchase a stake in the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nAgain.\n\nBrady’s apparent deal with Raiders owner Mark Davis to buy an undisclosed percentage of the franchise, which is escalating in value, has been in the works for more than a year.\n\nYet Brady, the subject of a recent Netflix special labeled “The Greatest Roast of All-Time,” is still waiting for his proposed purchase to pass muster with the league’s finance committee – the first step toward final approval before advancing for a vote before the full body of owners.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nIt’s fair to wonder: Will Brady, poised to launch this season as an NFL analyst for Fox Sports, ever become a part-owner of the Raiders? Will this vision of a New England Patriots legend joining the Raider Nation ever really happen?\n\nThe proposed deal was apparently rejected by the finance committee recently for at least the third time and wasn’t even on the official agenda to be voted on this week, despite the expectation weeks ago that the deal was close to the finish line.\n\nBrady, 46, gained approval in October to buy a stake in Davis’ champion WNBA team, the Las Vegas Aces, yet his NFL approval for a piece of the Raiders keeps falling short of the end zone.\n\n“It’s alive, but I’m not going to comment any more,” Davis told USA TODAY Sports before the meetings began on Tuesday. “I’m going to leave it at that for now.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that as the Brady proposal has been under consideration, the Raiders' value has popped, bolstered by their new home, Allegiant Stadium, in a new market since the move from Oakland. In its last report on NFL team values in September 2023, Forbes ranked the Raiders as the NFL’s sixth most-valuable franchise, worth $6.2 billion – and one of four teams with a value growing at least 20% over the previous year.\n\nWhile the Brady matter wasn’t voted on this week, it was apparently discussed behind closed doors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Davis beamed as he stood in the lobby and shared a quick update. “There may be some progress,” Davis told USA TODAY Sports, without elaboration.\n\nProgress. That’s the word NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell used, too, when asked about the potential Brady deal (again) during a press conference as the meetings concluded on Wednesday.\n\nPart of the issue: Would Brady’s role with Fox open up a can of worms that involves a competitive advantage – or suspicion of an advantage – for the Raiders?\n\nIn his media role, Brady would gain access that conceivably could include his presence at team practices. Generally speaking, the network TV crews are at practices sparingly – maybe once per week – as they prepare for calling the games.\n\nAs a minority stakeholder in the Raiders, it seems likely that the franchise would want to tap into Brady’s football expertise. After all, Brady won a record seven Super Bowl rings with the Patriots (six) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (one).\n\nSo, in a league with rampant paranoia and instances over the years where spying has been alleged or proven (see Spygate), a comfort level with Brady is apparently a box to be checked as it pertains to a potential conflict of interest.\n\n“I do think progress is being made,” Goodell said. “The finance committee has done its work on this. We have a little more to do, but that was one of the factors. As a member of the media, what access would he have every week as he prepares for the broadcast of the game. We discussed that. We’re making progress on it.”\n\nDuring the last NFL owners meetings, in Orlando in late March, an NFL owner who requested anonymity told USA TODAY Sports that he believed the conflict-of-interest question had been resolved. The owner did not want to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the issue.\n\nIt also seemed apparent during the meetings in Orlando that Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt was at peace with the conflict-of-interest question. This week, Hunt, chairman of the NFL’s finance committee, declined a USA TODAY Sports interview request to address the Brady matter (or any of the other embarrassing off-the-field issues linked in recent weeks to his two-time defending Super Bowl champions). In March, though, Hunt, mindful of the snags, told USA TODAY Sports that he considered the Brady transaction to be on track for approval.\n\n“I would expect that at some point it will be back in front of the finance committee for approval,” Hunt told USA TODAY Sports in March. “It’s an ongoing process. There were a lot of hoops that had to be jumped through.”\n\nWell, now it seems that Brady, who had a huge hand in the biggest comeback victory in Super Bowl history, is engaged in a different type of overtime.\n\nIs there another issue? In the context of NFL big business, you can never forget about money.\n\nWhile Davis or any other NFL owners or officials have not publicly revealed details of the proposal – including the exact percentage or total investment – it is logical to suspect that the value or structure of Brady’s proposal is at the heart of the inability to gain approval from the finance committee.\n\nIf you’re Davis, you might be willing to sell a piece of the franchise for less than market value because it’s Brady, who would bring celebrity gravitas.\n\nIf you’re a fellow NFL owner, though, such a sale with a so-called “pretty-boy discount” could conceivably devalue your franchise at a time when team values keep rising. Talk about conflict of interest.\n\nSo, while in a separate matter NFL owners ponder changing policy to accommodate investments from private equity firms, the Brady case may test the conditions for selling off pieces of their franchises to minority stakeholders.\n\nIn the meantime, Brady’s deal remains under further review – a big-business replay of The Tuck Rule.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/media/2024/09/09/tom-brady-announcer-nfl-broadcast-debut/75144933007/", "title": "Tom Brady's NFL announcer debut leaves much to be desired", "text": "CLEVELAND – Because Tom Brady had the most decorated NFL career of all time doesn’t automatically mean that he’ll immediately be the best broadcaster in his new career. The transitive property does not exist in football and sports television. But the good news for Brady is he can mirror his playing career by improving in the role and rise to the top of the craft, even if his first time on the call Sunday during the Dallas Cowboys’ 33-17 defeat of the Cleveland Browns was a forgetful, up-and-down showing.\n\nThe overall broadcast will have to be better by the time the cameras roll on Brady and broadcast partner Kevin Burkhardt at Super Bowl 59 in February. But this was by no means a disaster for Brady or FOX.\n\nThere have been worse debuts and performances in the field-to-booth pipeline, even recently. Brady does not belong in the bottom-tier category of Drew Brees, who couldn't stick at NBC as a studio analyst or color commentator, and Jason Witten, whose stint as the \"Monday Night Football\" analyst in 2018 was bad enough that he returned to the Cowboys.\n\nIt was pretty clear the emphasis during Brady’s offseason training with the FOX team and the advice he received from other top broadcasters was to quickly go in and out of his points. Brady was almost too terse. His first big time to shine was a Dak Prescott touchdown pass to Brandin Cooks while the quarterback was facing an all-out blitz. FOX had to go back to Brady after the commercial break so he could go deeper into the play because his first go-round left a little too much dead air.\n\nI hadn’t considered Brady’s voice to be “high-pitched” until Boomer Esiason mentioned it to me last week. Hearing the GOAT talk at length about football somewhat stunned the senses. But the way he speaks shouldn’t present much of an issue in Brady’s broadcasting endeavors.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nIt doesn’t help Brady’s case that he is replacing a popular broadcaster in Greg Olsen, who meshed well with Burkhardt thanks to their shared northern New Jersey roots. Olsen became worthy of a No. 1 analyst chair in a short amount of time in the profession and should be his replacement’s shining example of what to work toward. Burkhardt and Brady sounded fine together, highlighted by Burkhardt joking he wore more gel in his air because he figured there would be more on-air shots of the booth; Brady replied that he does what he’s told and is the rookie.\n\nPredictably, Brady rarely went negative, despite the putrid performance from Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson. He said Prescott was “lucky” to not have been picked off late in the first quarter. There was a decent breakdown of Micah Parsons dealing with chip blocks and politely corrected Burkhardt by explaining “he got a chip and beat it!” He tried to take us inside Prescott’s mind as he dropped back and Myles Garrett, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year, bore down on him.\n\nBrady is essentially operating within a mandate to keep his comments positive or neutral. Outside of the broadcast booth, Brady is nearing a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. Becoming a limited partner of the league has its restrictions. He’s not allowed to attend FOX production meetings because his standing with the Raiders prohibits him from entering another team’s facility. The league said Brady can call games involving Las Vegas. Brady must abide by the league constitution and bylaws, which could “prohibit public criticism of officials and other clubs.” It's a conundrum that leaves Brady unable to provide \"real talk,\" which fans crave, and forces him to dance around topics – a difficult enough task for a seasoned broadcaster, let alone a newbie.\n\nOn Sunday, his early analysis was armchair quarterback-adjacent, not GOAT-esque. By the end of the game, he was comfortable enough to expand on why he believes the quality of offensive line play has decreased over the past few seasons.\n\nThe product on the field did not do him any favors, to say the least. Some examples:\n\n“Quickest way to get upfield is to go vertical.”\n\n“Get the ball out to his playmakers.”\n\n“Negative plays hurt you so much.”\n\nBurkhardt did his best to lead Brady into that second level of analysis; he asked the seven-time Super Bowl champion whether he preferred facing man or zone coverage, for example.\n\nMost of the timing between the pair was totally fine, beginning early in the game. Brady was pretty good on the nice catch by CeeDee Lamb, not stepping on Burkhardt’s call but letting out a “wow!” He did a little Tony Romo imitation on the Cooks touchdown with the “oh!” But that could be a positive for Brady. He was wise not to invade Romo’s play prognosticator lane. Some of Brady’s most insightful material came during the blowout portion of the broadcast as he explained what made going against Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer so difficult.\n\n“I played for a coach who wasn’t afraid to cuss out his players, either,” Brady said, referencing his fellow media rookie and former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nDialing into emotion could turn into a strength if it’s ultimately presented in the right way. Brady took this job because he loves football – his multiverse promo commercial that aired on FOX the week of the game reinforced that as much. The relatability factor is something that a part-owner of an NFL team might struggle with; instead, Brady should infuse that passion into his analysis and win over viewers.\n\n“NFL RedZone” host Scott Hanson joked that Brady needed to show more emotion as the Cowboys flirted with the idea of letting kicker Brandon Aubrey attempt a 71-yard field goal after he nailed one from 66 yards out that was negated by a penalty.\n\n“Oh come on,” Hanson said. “Brady's gotta get more excited than that in the booth.”\n\n(Hanson made a formal, albeit unnecessary, apology on social media Monday.)\n\nThe biggest currency in sports broadcasting is authenticity. For so long, the Patriot Way boxed Brady into a talking-points reciter who gave the public (via the media) little to work with. Those who assumed Brady would be a natural in the booth because of the amount of time he’s spent on camera were ignorant to the reality that answering questions – with the goal of saying nothing – is much different than providing substantive analysis. Pausing to consider one’s words is not only wise, it’s viewed favorably by those watching news conferences. In the broadcast booth, that cautiousness comes across differently.\n\nBrady’s shell started to chip away during his years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Still, his play did most of the talking. Now, Tom Brady the public figure and businessman has to deal with letting everyone know the real him in his 40s rather than his 20s – with a microphone in his hand and an audience of, say, 20 million people every Sunday afternoon.\n\nBrady will have 20 more games – maybe fewer if he opts for a bye week – before the lights go red at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans for Super Bowl 59. He’s not ready for that assignment yet. But consider how many teams wind up in the Super Bowl after looking lost Week 1. FOX is banking on a similar trajectory, and Brady learning enough on the job over the coming months to make sure the big game sounds like one.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2023/03/23/tom-brady-becomes-part-owner-las-vegas-aces-wnba/11532607002/", "title": "Tom Brady becomes part owner of WNBA's Las Vegas Aces", "text": "Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum will likely be seeing a lot more of her \"favorite athlete\" – seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nMark Davis, owner of the 2022 WNBA champion Aces and the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders, announced on Thursday that Brady has acquired an ownership interest in the WNBA team.

It was the first time Thanksgiving was celebrated under the country's new Constitution.\n\nPresidents after Washington would also issue a proclamation for Thanksgiving, but the months and days Thanksgiving was celebrated varied. With President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 proclamation, Thanksgiving became regularly celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, the last Thursday in November fell on the last day of the month in 1939, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved that year's Thanksgiving to the second-to-last Thursday of November to allow for a longer Christmas shopping season. But not all states followed suit: 32 issued similar proclamations, which 16 kept Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November.\n\nBy 1941, the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution, declaring Thanksgiving Day to be the last Thursday in November each year.

The biggest food holiday of the year is almost here.\n\nThanksgiving, the day we give thanks while stuffing our faces, is Thursday, Nov. 23.\n\nThrough the years, Thanksgiving has become known for spending time with family and friends, watching football and the famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and, of course, eating good food.\n\nWhile the holiday's origins may not be as accurate as the tales that appear in children's stories or high school textbooks, many see the day as an opportunity to enjoy the company of loved ones and show gratitude.\n\nBut how did Thanksgiving begin? When was the first celebration, and what did they eat? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhen is Thanksgiving 2023?\n\nThanksgiving is on Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023.\n\nOn what day does Thanksgiving fall?\n\nThe holiday falls on the fourth Thursday in November each year.\n\nWhen did Thanksgiving become a federal holiday?\n\nThanksgiving was celebrated independently by colonies and states for more than 200 years, The History Channel reports. Magazine editor and famed author Sarah Josepha Hale became known as the Mother of Thanksgiving for her campaign to establish it as a national holiday.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln answered her call during the Civil War in 1863 and proclaimed a national Thanksgiving would be celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nBut, in 1939, department store mogul Fred Lazarus Jr., concerned that the late Thanksgiving that year would mean less shopping days before Christmas, persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to move Thanksgiving back a week. For a couple years, the confused nation celebrated the holiday on two different days. To end the confusion, Congress passed a joint resolution, signed by Roosevelt on Dec. 26, 1941, that established Thanksgiving as a federal holiday held on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nWhen was the first Thanksgiving?\n\nAccording to the History Channel, the first Thanksgiving celebration is believed to have occurred in 1621.\n\nThe story, historically told from the pilgrim's perspective, is that Plymouth colonists from England shared a meal with the indigenous Wampanoag people to give thanks for a successful fall harvest.\n\nThis lore, however, may not be completely accurate. Most recounts of the event's significance are often overstated, journalist Eryn Dion noted in her reporting.\n\nMembers of the Wampanoag were not formally invited as a gesture of good grace, she says. Instead, the pilgrims became a bit rowdy at their feast and began shooting into the air. Fearing violence, Wampanoag warriors went to see what was occurring, prepared for war (if need be), but saw it was a celebration and eventually joined the feast.\n\nThe second Thanksgiving celebration was held in 1623 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark the end of a long drought that threatened the year's harvest. Days of fasting and feasting would soon become common practice in other New England settlements over the years.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe national holiday began as a celebration of the harvest and other blessings, per the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Thanksgiving, however, has since moved away from its Puritan roots and has become a day to \"symbolize intercultural peace, America's opportunity for newcomers, and the sanctity of home and family.\"\n\nHow is Thanksgiving celebrated?\n\nFor generations, Thanksgiving Day, fondly referred to as Turkey Day, has been celebrated with a large feast consisting of several dishes that vary by culture, ethnicity, state and region. But in most households, you will usually find stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, corn, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, candied yams, macaroni and cheese, pumpkin pie, and the quintessential main dish: turkey.\n\nThanksgiving Day is also often celebrated with football games, parades, and volunteering, BBC Good Food reports. The day after Thanksgiving has also become its own celebration known as Black Friday. During this day, stores nationwide offer extended hours, discounts and special promotions in preparation for the Christmas shopping season.\n\nWhat was eaten at the first Thanksgiving?\n\nThe History Channel reports that no record exists of the first Thanksgiving menu. Although turkey has become the official mascot of Thanksgiving Day, many historians believe it was likely not a part of the original feast. Here's a list of foods that might've appeared on the table instead:\n\nDeer, likely roasted over a smoldering fire or made into a stew.\n\nLocal vegetables such as onions, beans, lettuce, spinach, cabbage, carrots and peas.\n\nIndigenous fruits such as blueberries, plums, grapes, gooseberries, raspberries and cranberries.\n\nCorn, likely pounded into a thick corn mush or porridge.\n\nVarious types of seafood like mussels, lobster, bass, clams and oysters.\n\nPumpkin custard.\n\nRoot vegetables like turnips and groundnuts.\n\nWhat other countries celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nThe United States isn't the only country that has a designated holiday for giving thanks.

As we navigated several traffic roundabouts, plunked in the middle were signs of the holidays; life-sized Christmas balls stacked like pyramids, Feliz 2017 sculptures, etc.\n\nFrom the back of the van came an observation, “Wow, so they just skip Thanksgiving and go straight to Christmas?” Cue the record scratch. After a few seconds of deafening silence he said sheepishly, “Oh never mind,” and we burst into laughter.\n\nThis uniquely American holiday is not celebrated in other countries, with the exception of a few expats who still honor their traditions.\n\nWhen the Pilgrims had their first successful corn harvest in 1621, they celebrated with a feast, invited some Native American friends and began the tradition known today as Thanksgiving.\n\nTurkeys go local this Thanksgiving\n\nSpeculation varies as to what was served at that meal, but it is widely thought the celebratory beverage was fermented apple cider. While I am thankful for the Pilgrims, I’m especially thankful for the Italian, Spanish and French who joined the party, bringing wine.\n\nCredited with discovering the “New World” in 1492, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus first set foot on what would become the U.S. The Italian influx didn’t begin in earnest until the early 1800s.\n\nIn honor of that influence, start your Thanksgiving celebration with prosecco; after all, bubbles ARE a holiday staple. Not only are Mionetto Prestige Prosecco Brut ($14) and Mionetto Prestige Gran Rosé ($14) affordable and enjoyable for an aperitif, the “Pink Cork For The Cause” (under way until the end of the month) could make for a fun discovery.\n\nIf you find one of the 125 pink corks that have been placed in random bottles, you win a prize and a chance to earmark a $10,000 donation to the breast-cancer related charity of your choice.\n\nFor white wine lovers, Luna NudaVigneti delle Dolomiti Pinot Grigio ($15) complements salty and fatty dishes with its racy minerality. The wine is fresh and floral with white fruit and a hint of pineapple.\n\nSpanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon landed in Florida in 1513. From his country of origin, look for the aromatic 2013 Beronia Crianza ($16); a wine perfectly suited for your grilled meats. Made from 88 percent tempranillo, it’s a bit dusty and acidic, not too heavy, with chocolate, coffee and red fruit on the palate.\n\nGrenache or garnacha is often considered a good grape for Thanksgiving fare because of its fruitiness. Pinyolet Garnacha ($17) is not as jammy as some, but it’s still juicy, spicy and vibrant. You’ll smell and taste raspberry in this wine that is very hard to put down. It’s a good one for white meats and perfect for leftover turkey sandwiches.\n\nGina Drinks: The time is right for malbecs\n\nOne of the first French colonies in the U.S. was in the Jacksonville area of Florida, thanks to sailor Jean Ribaut in the 1550s. However, most of the migration from this country didn’t occur until after the French Revolution.\n\nWith it’s herbal and earthy characteristics, Chateau FontanesPic Saint-Loup Rouge ($17) makes great sense for turkey and stuffing. Made of 40 percent syrah, then followed mostly by grenache and mourvèdre, you’ll find anise on the nose, cherry in the mouth and pleasant tannins on the finish.\n\nA French wine with grace and power for your holiday feast is the Agly Brothers Cotes du Roussillon ($40). Its fruit is full, dark and ripe, balanced with spice and a touch of char from the grill.

Because the holiday is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of the month, it’s locked in between Nov. 22 and Nov. 28.\n\nThanksgiving has moved around multiple times, from a set month and day, to different days in both October and November. It was even celebrated on two different dates in the same year before it finally settled on the fourth Thursday of November we now celebrate.\n\nPresident George Washington declared Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789 as a \"Day of Publick Thanksgivin,\" after he was asked by the first Federal Congress, according to the National Archives. It was the first time Thanksgiving was celebrated under the country's new Constitution.\n\nPresidents after Washington would also issue a proclamation for Thanksgiving, but the months and days Thanksgiving was celebrated varied. With President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 proclamation, Thanksgiving became regularly celebrated on the last Thursday in November.\n\nBut, it wasn’t until 1942 when an act of Congress permanently assigned the holiday to the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nMany see Thanksgiving as celebrating racism\n\nThanksgiving, although a national holiday, isn't a time of celebration for many, however.\n\n\"Some in the US Native American community feel the mythology of the holiday ignores the destruction of indigenous cultures that followed European settlement,\" read Time and Date's Thanksgiving website. \"Beginning in 1970, a group of Native Americans and their supporters have staged an annual protest for a National Day of Mourning at Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts on Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\"American Indian Heritage Day is also observed at this time of the year.\"\n\nDamon C.

They can be sad ones: The first Thanksgiving without a grandparent. They can be exciting ones, ones that celebrate the beginning of a new chapter or a new era — just like that original Pilgrim Thanksgiving, four centuries ago.\n\nIn 2016, some 25 Portuguese-speaking immigrants in Newark celebrated their first Thanksgiving in a new country with the Rev. Fernando De Almeida, who invited them into his home. It was a day he — and they — will never forget. \"I asked everybody who doesn't have families here in America to my house,\" says the Rev. Almeida, of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church in Newark.\n\nSide dishes:Spicing up your favorites\n\nWine:The best for Thanksgiving in every price range\n\nIt was more than a day of feasting and partying, he says. It was a day to celebrate their new dreams. Their American dreams. \"People, when they come to the United states, they want to be part of the nation,\" he says. \"They recognize that America is a great country and their desire is to be like Americans.\"\n\nOther Thanksgiving milestones? Here are a few that will be playing out this year, at dining room extension tables and kids' tables all over North Jersey. Behold the first Thanksgiving …\n\n...with a new baby\n\nThe table is set and family is gathered around. The scene is similar to last year — with one small change: a new baby. Rutherford’s Courtney Calderon, 36, will know this feeling. She is celebrating her first Thanksgiving as a new mom to her son, Jaxon, 4 months old.\n\nShe says her plans aren’t changing that much this year, except she will be loading “two dogs plus a baby into her car,” she says, to drive to her parent’s house in Manchester. Unfortunately, her husband, Ray, has to work the holiday.\n\nCalderon will try not to dwell on the absence of her husband on Thanksgiving, but celebrate in the excitement as Jaxon meets her older brother, Bobby, and his family for the first time.\n\nStory continues below video.\n\n“He lives in North Carolina with his wife and two kids so we don’t see them too often.” (Jaxon has already met Calderon's younger brother, who lives in Clifton with his wife.)\n\n“Our Thanksgiving usually consists of appetizers, games, turkey, a dance party, nap, dessert, turkey again and football,” she says.\n\nAlthough Jaxon is too young to try any food, he may reveal a smile when he sees one of his family members wearing a turkey hat during dinner, a Thanksgiving tradition that Calderon secretly loves.\n\nAnother holiday tradition: “The next morning we enjoy leftover turkey and cranberry sauce on a biscuit,” Calderon says.\n\nThere's another reason why Thanksgiving now holds a special place in Calderon's heart: Last year, she and Ray revealed to her parents that they were pregnant.\n\n“My parents were so surprised they couldn’t believe it,” she says. “They were beyond happy and excited. Lots of happy tears! It made me so happy seeing them happy.”\n\nAnd what is she thankful for this year?\n\n“My beautiful son, my amazing husband and my parents who I don't know what I would do without,” she says. “I look forward to spending time with family…always.” — Laura Adams Stiansen\n\n…with a high-end vegan menu\n\nSeventeen-year-old Elizabeth Benson has been busy planning her vegan \"Friendsgiving\" menu for some time now. While the Lakeland Regional High School senior may have cooked an all-vegan feast for her friends last year — it was her first Friendsgiving dinner — this year she is going to present a whole batch of new dishes, more sophisticated fare. After all, this Thanksgiving, she can use the cooking skills she's learned over the summer at the culinary school at Passaic County Community College and this semester.\n\n“I’m thinking of making sweet potato casserole with a cinnamon and sugar streusel topping, biscuits stuffed with gravy and mashed potatoes, and a lentil loaf, but I still have to test it out.\"\n\nShe isn't worried. \"My knowledge of cooking has grown over the year,\" she said. \"It's been enhanced.\"\n\nLast year was different, when she invited her four close fiends, three girls, one boy, none of whom are vegan, to her Ringwood home. \"I was nervous,\" she recalled. \"I didn't know how they were going to like it.\"\n\nApparently, the anxiety was unwarranted.\n\n“They loved it,” said Benson, who cooked the lavish buffet meal herself over the course of two days. She plans to do likewise this year.\n\nHer friends, she said, couldn’t believe it was vegan.” In fact they went for second helpings. “They put everything on their plate again,” she said.\n\nBenson does not use any animal products — no meat, dairy, honey, eggs, seafood or even gelatin.\n\nHer meal included: faux-turkey appetizer, made of a guacamole body with finely chopped red, orange and yellow peppers for feathers; fresh baked rolls; green bean casserole with a vegan mushroom glaze; mashed potatoes with a splash of almond milk; bread stuffing flecked with onions, celery and carrots; thick gravy made with vegetable broth and corn starch; pumpkin spice ice cream made with coconut milk and pumpkin puree, plus whipped cream (coconut milk and powdered sugar); and ganache balls rolled in coconut flakes. A friend contributed peanut butter chocolate brownies. And for drinks? Shirley Temples made with cherry juice and ginger ale and Lipton iced green tea.\n\nHer table was decked with orange place mats set atop a crisp white tablecloth, tall wine glasses, white plates, and fresh-cut flowers in the center and lit candles all around.\n\nBenson, who has been a vegan for the past two years and a vegetarian for the previous three, loves to cook. “It’s a stress-reliever,” she said.\n\nShe discovered her love for cooking “through Thanksgiving,” she said. “Cooking for Thanksgiving is an entire family activity. As soon as I was old enough, I joined my brother and sister and parents making the family Thanksgiving dinner.” The family usually has 20 or so guests.\n\nLast year, she said, \"we had so much fun. We were all so stuffed.\" This year everyone may be even more stuffed, given her more advanced cooking skills.\n\n— Esther Davidowitz\n\n...in America\n\nJean Radyn Piard's first Thanksgiving in America is a heartfelt one. He's thankful to be alive.\n\n\"I'm thankful to the Lord, because I'm present now,\" says Piard, 34, who has been in Teaneck since September. \"The people in the United States, in New Jersey, are very nice.\"\n\nHaiti, the country where he's originally from, is a land of rich culture and deep spirituality. But it's not overflowing with creature comforts. Port Au Prince, where Piard is from, is Haiti's capital and biggest city, but there are many who don't have a roof over their heads, and anything — let alone turkey and cranberry sauce — to eat. The devastation wrought by the epic 2010 earthquake and tsunami remains, seven years later, a painful reality. And there is violence.\n\n\"Someone tried to kill me,\" says Piard, who came over here in July on a tourist visa (he's hoping to get a green card). As a professional dancer, teacher, actor, model and makeup artist, it wasn't easy for him down there, he says. \"My situation is Haiti is very bad,\" he says. \"I'm an artist. People are jealous.\"\n\nThat was after he had already survived the 2010 earthquake. \"I said only 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, I don't need to be dead,' \" he remembers. \"I was very scared. I go outside, I hear somebody saying, 'Help! Help!' I see some people with their legs cut off. People were white with all the dust. And the blood on the face. The buildings — down.\"\n\nPiard will be celebrating his first Thanksgiving in the apartment he shares with his aunt, Marie Vinite Piard (\"my second mother\"), her two children, and a niece. \"I will cook for us,\" he says. \"I can't wait.\"\n\nHe's heard a bit about the American Thanksgiving — enough to know that it's about food, and family. \"I know about the turkey,\" he says. \"In the United States, people come and cook their food, their dinner. The date's important for the United States.\"\n\nIn Haiti, there is a somewhat similar festival. Independence Day, Jan 1, marks the anniversary of Haiti's 1804 victory over the French (Haiti was the first black country to gain its independence; Toussaint L'Ouverture is their George Washington). It is a day of bounty.\n\nJoumou, a pumpkin-beef soup, is the commemorative dish. Neighbors share ingredients: those who have celery, onions, carrots or potatoes lend to those who don't. And as with the American Thanksgiving, people provide for the less fortunate.\n\n\"If the homeless are passing, they give them the food,\" Piard says. — Jim Beckerman\n\n...home from college\n\nStephanie Schmidt Rivelli of Wayne is looking forward to a festive Thanksgiving at home with her two sons, her boyfriend Rod, who lives in Butler, and his parents.\n\nTheir first?\n\n“My oldest son Robert went away to college in September,” Rivelli said. “Labor Day weekend. So this will be the first time he’ll be coming home for the holidays. He’s a sophomore. He attended freshman year at CCM [County College of Morris]. Now he’s studying accounting at Rutgers in New Brunswick. He’s about an hour away, but I’ve only seen him once since he left, so we’re all looking forward to this Thanksgiving.”\n\nRivelli said the change was harder on her younger son, Evan, than it was on her.\n\n“He and his brother always used to hang out together, watching sports on TV,” she said. “So that was difficult. In the last couple of weeks it’s gotten easier, but Evan still worries about him. He’ll say, ‘I hope he’s not partying too much.’”\n\nLike most moms, Rivelli hopes that, too. “Still,” she said, “I really encouraged him to go away to school. I thought it would be a good experience for him, an experience I didn’t get to have. He’s 21, and I know he’s having a good time. I assumed we’d talk all the time but the truth is I barely hear from him. We would text here and there. Then last week, I texted, ‘Can you talk?’ And he texted back, ‘Why?’ And I texted back, ‘Because I haven’t seen you in weeks!’”\n\nShe’s not too concerned, though.\n\n“They grow up so fast,” Rivelli said, “but he’s always been mature and level-headed for his age.”\n\nAs for their holiday celebration: “I have to be honest, I’ve had a lot of disappointing Thanksgivings. You spend so much time preparing everything and everyone eats it all so fast!\n\n“This year,” she continues, “will be a little different in another way, too. My boyfriend and I have been eating mostly vegan for the last six months, basically a plant-based, whole-food diet. So I will be making vegan options in addition to the usual turkey and sides. I think Robert coming home, though, will make it special, since I see Thanksgiving, traditionally, as a homecoming. It’s the start of the holiday season. It’s colder outside. The house smells of all that good food and everyone just wants to be close.” — Bill Ervolino\n\n...away from home\n\nInstead of carving a turkey, Rich Lopez, 36, of Hawthorne will be building scenery this year — in South Korea. Lopez works for Blackwalnut, a scenery-building company located in Valley Cottage, New York. \"I’m working with a crew building the scenery for NBC's coverage of the winter games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\"\n\nLast-minute kitchen tips:Oh no!

This year, with a new baby in the family, it’s no doubt going to be an amazing Thanksgiving.\"\n\nHe'll still get to celebrate, though. NBC will be having a Thanksgiving dinner for everyone working on the crew. \"So, it’ll be different, but still a great gesture— I’ve known a lot of these people for a bit now, so it’ll be a good time with the 'makeshift' family.\" — Kristin Coursen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/10/16/when-is-thanksgiving-2023/71057242007/", "title": "When is Thanksgiving 2023?

Similar celebrations of abundance and thanks occur around the world every year and have for centuries.\n\nGermany celebrates \"Erntedankfest\" typically on the first Sunday of October, when some carry brimming harvest crowns to churches and feast on chicken and rooster. Japan's Thanksgiving-style celebration – called Kinrō Kansha no Hi – has roots in an ancient rice harvest festival.

This year, both Kabob and Curry and Rasa will be open, serving meat and vegetarian specials.\n\nThe meat special, Dhar said, will be ground lamb meatballs seasoned with cumin, coriander and a touch of garam masala. They'll add a mixture of almonds, cashews and raisins, and braise onions with ginger. The meatballs will be served with sides of warm garlic naan bread and cranberry rice pilaf.\n\nVegetarians can order butternut squash and grated tofu along with roasted Brussels sprouts, turned into croquettes cooked in a coconut curry.\n\n\"I know all of us who are now living here and migrated from India, this is our homeland now,\" said Dhar. \"I think this is a very special holiday because as you grow older, I think you're thankful for the opportunities that you have. It's a wonderful way to say 'thank you' to immediate family and neighbors.\"\n\nEast African Thanksgiving dishes\n\nFatima Mohamed came to the U.S. from Kenya, and now operates Fatima's Cafe in Worcester, Massachusetts, where she cooks up East African fare.\n\nMohamed said she adopted Thanksgiving traditions when she arrived in the U.S. – being invited to friends' homes for the holiday and then raising her children here.\n\nMohamed's Worcester restaurant serves a fusion of Kenyan and Somali food, paired with Indian influences.

That could very well represent the number of ways Indonesians celebrate Thanksgiving, said Raude Raychel.\n\nRaychel, who is from Manado, is the force behind the world's first Little Indonesia in Somersworth, New Hampshire, where the largest Indonesian population north of Manhattan lives. She said foods eaten during their Thanksgiving-style celebrations vary depending on from what island you come.\n\nThe offerings can include Padang-style beef tripe and tendons, crispy Galangal fried chicken and beef Rendang, the most popular traditional dish of Indonesia. For Indonesians in the U.S., Raychel said, these dishes often accompany classic American selections such as mashed potatoes.\n\n\"The gathering is pretty much the same, with family or people in the same type of ethnic group or religious group,\" she said. \"We celebrate together.\"\n\nEach year, Raychel's Indonesian church holds a grand Thanksgiving lunch. Two years ago, the meal was Balinese-themed, featuring a Balinese spiced turkey and sate lilit, lemongrass-seasoned minced chicken or fish wrapped around skewers.\n\n\"It's a potluck, a time where everybody is bringing different things,\" she said. \"It's so diverse because everybody comes from different islands.\"\n\nRaychel fondly remembers hopping from one house to another in Indonesia on their Thanksgiving-like holiday, \"to eat and eat and eat.\"\n\nInterested in trying some Indonesian fare this holiday season? The Little Indonesia Cultural Center in Somersworth will be hosting a holiday bazaar on the Saturdays before and after Thanksgiving, and through December, with each week featuring a different menu.\n\nPuerto Rican Thanksgiving dishes\n\n\"The pork shoulder is like, the biggest thing for Thanksgiving for us,\" said Natalie Rodriguez. \"Pork shoulder is our turkey.\"\n\nBoth sets of Rodriguez's grandparents are from Puerto Rico, and she was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts. She's the chef and owner of Nuestra, an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant preparing to reopen in a new location in the city this month.\n\nRodriguez called Thanksgiving a \"Christmas kick-off\" for Puerto Ricans. \"It starts a whole series of parties for us,\" she said.\n\nThere's yellow rice and pigeon peas, collared greens, potato salad, and a holiday staple called pasteles – root vegetables and bananas boiled in banana leaves, similar to a tamale, Rodriguez said.\n\nShe laughed that she'd never eaten mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving until her 20s.\n\nLast year, as COVID-19 kept many people home for Thanksgiving, Rodriguez and her team at Nuestra served 100 meals for the holiday, featuring both pork shoulder and turkey.\n\n\"Anybody who ate, they had two meals in that one meal,\" she said. \"We made it a point to have American and Puerto Rican, mixing traditions.\"\n\nJamaican Thanksgiving dishes\n\nOn Erica Sterling's Thanksgiving dinner table each year is an impressive spread of Jamaican and Caribbean dishes. She and her husband, Patrick Sterling, own Island Café & Grill in Hyannis, Massachusetts, which they opened in 2017 after spending years working in the Cape Cod hospitality industry.\n\nSterling said they don't celebrate Thanksgiving in Jamaica, but have fully adopted the holiday as their own since arriving in the U.S. in 1998.\n\nMore:Island Café & Grill in Hyannis cooks up authentic Jamaican cuisine, inspires local award\n\n\"We do oxtail, one of our classic, special things,\" she said. \"We also do curry goat. We do turkey, but we do it a little differently, with jerky or something like that, or deep-fried. That is really good.\"\n\nAlso on her family's menu is sweet potato pudding, fried chicken, and rice and peas, she said.\n\n\"We definitely do our own little touch to it,\" said Sterling. \"We celebrate everything we've been through. We're thankful for everything. It does mean a lot to us.\"\n\nMexican Thanksgiving dishes\n\nMexican-American chef and James Beard semifinalist David Vargas appeared on the \"Today\" show in 2019, highlighting how he incorporates his heritage into every Thanksgiving.\n\nA Kittery, Maine, resident who operates Vida Cantina across the border in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Vargas showcased his famed Masa cornbread stuffing. The stuffing, he said, was an important part of his childhood growing up in southern California, and to this day is his favorite part of the holiday.\n\nVargas makes it every year, featuring locally-grown corn, buttermilk, celeriac (a variety of celery), leeks, chorizo and fresh herbs.\n\nHaitian Thanksgiving dishes\n\nAt Yveline “Eve” Bontemp's house, they call it \"Family Day.\"\n\nBontemp did not have an easy childhood growing up in Haiti, and she came to the U.S. when she was 12. Today she's the chef and owner of Garden of Eve Restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island where she cooks legume and curry chickpeas, and classic fritay dinners of beef, shrimp and pork.\n\nIt's the cuisine she ate as a child, and a bright spot of her years in Haiti.\n\nBontemp was the hostess of \"Family Day\" last year, with relatives attending from Boston and Providence. Every year they have turkey, but specifically turkey with sauce, she noted. It's a brown stewed turkey sauce, made with turkey broth, tomato paste and topped with onions and bell peppers.\n\nBontemp laughed that \"Haitian people love sauce.\"\n\nTheir side dishes include traditional black rice made with dry mushrooms, a beet salad featuring potatoes, peppers, peas and carrots, baked macaroni and cheese, and fried plantains.\n\n\"We play dominos and cards as we eat and chat with each other,\" she said. \"Video game for the younger ones. They grab a plate and sit with it on the floor.\"\n\nAngolan/Cape Verdean Thanksgiving dishes\n\nIt's all about the cod fish casserole for Amelia Goncalves and her family in Brockton, Massachusetts. Goncalves is originally from Angola, her parents having immigrated there from Cape Verde.\n\nGoncalves and her son Jaysen co-own Brockton's Luanda Restaurant and Lounge, which serves Afro-Portuguese food influenced by both Angola and Cape Verde. Though not traditionally celebrated in their cultures, many Angolans and Cape Verdeans in the U.S. go big with the Thanksgiving holiday, Goncalves said.\n\nSome of their Thanksgiving gatherings can see up to 60 people, and \"no less than 10.\"\n\n\"Nephews, nieces, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandfather, grandmother,\" she said. \"It's everyone.\"\n\nGoncalves said the cod fish casserole is a favorite for the holiday season. They soak salted cod in water for a few days, and then cook it with potatoes, olive oil, onions and parsley. Some people like to add heavy cream, while others go a different route with an addition of chickpeas. The casserole is usually served with white rice, Goncalves said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/18"}]}

It's an ancient indicator of time, and one that Native American tribes recognized as a signal of the changing seasons. They gave the moons names to mark the occasions, and while sky-gazers have variations on why moons garner certain monikers, most can agree on the ethereal appeal of the quiet lunar performance each month.\n\nApril's full moon is dubbed the pink moon because it corresponds with the first springtime blooms of the creeping phlox plant or moss phlox, which has a flower with a lavender to rose-colored hue.\n\nIt rises Tuesday in West Palm Beach at 7:46 p.m. following a cool front that should sweep the skies of clouds, providing a clear stage for its debut over the horizon.\n\nThis month's full moon rises just below the bright star Spica. While the full moon may block the light from Spica, EarthSky.org recommends standing so that a building or large tree can block much of the moon's brightness so that Spica can sparkle.\n\nHow the town of Jupiter got its name:Is Jupiter, Fla. really named after the planet Jupiter?\n\nThe April full moon has many other names given to it by people celebrating the arrival of warmer weather after winter challenges. It is also known as the \"breaking ice moon\", the \"budding moon\", and the \"growing moon,\" according to TimeandDate.com.\n\nHere are explanations for the names of all full moons:\n\nWolf Moon, January\n\nJanuary is dark and cold, giving over its evenings to wolves who howl and hunt amid the deep snowpack of midwinter. It has other names, according to a compilation by Western Washington University, including the Maker Moon, Great Spirits Moon, and from the Arapaho tribe of the Great Plains, the moon when snow blows like spirits in the wind.\n\nSnow Moon, February\n\nFebruary was a time when food stores may have been running low and hunting in the snow was difficult. For the Arapaho, February was the moon of frost sparkling in the sun. The Assiniboine in the Northern Plains called it the Long Dry Moon.\n\nWorm Moon (or Crow Moon), March\n\nThis is a time when the land softens, the earthworms reappear and the robins return. Basically, it signals the end of winter. It was also called the Crow Moon by northern tribes, and the moon of buffalo dropping their calves by the Arapaho of the Great Plains.\n\nPink Moon, April\n\nIn April, the groundcover phlox would appear with pink flowers signaling spring. It was also called the Full Sprouting Grass Moon, and the Full Fish Moon, which was a nod by some coastal tribes to shad coming upstream to spawn. Sometimes this is the first full moon after the spring equinox, marking it as the Paschal Full Moon. The Paschal Full Moon, which sometimes occurs in March, determines what date Easter falls on.\n\nFlower Moon, May\n\nFlowers become more abundant in May, but May's moon is also called the Full Corn Planting Moon and the Milk Moon. In the Northern Plains, it was given the name the Idle Moon. The Cherokee of the East Coast called it the Planting Moon.\n\nStrawberry Moon, June\n\nJune is the time to pick strawberries. It is also a time when the corn is not yet ripe, giving June the name the Green Corn Moon or the Full Leaf Moon. The Arapaho of the Great Plains dubbed this moon the moon when the buffalo bellows.\n\nBuck Moon, July\n\nIn July, deer begin to grow their new antlers. The Apache of the Southern Plains called July the moon of the horse/time of ripeness.\n\nSturgeon Moon, August\n\nFishing is robust in August in many areas around the Great Lakes. The Anishnaabe of the Great Lakes also called this the Berry Moon, while their neighbors to the northeast, the Algonquin, said the August moon is when Indian corn is edible.\n\nHarvest Moon, September\n\nAccording to Space.com, the Harvest Moon traditionally is the moon closest to the fall equinox, which is usually Sept. 22 or 23. Fall vegetables including corn, pumpkins, squash, beans and wild rice are ready to harvest. The Arapaho of the Great Plains call September the Drying Grass Moon.\n\nHunter's Moon, October\n\nWith the harvest gathered, October is a time to hunt. It is also a time for a marked change in seasons with the Arapaho calling October the Falling Leaves Moon, and the Algonquin calling it the moon of white frost on grass.\n\nBeaver Moon, November\n\nThere are different ideas on why November is the Beaver Moon, including that it is a time when beavers are active before winter and that it is a signal to set traps before waterways freeze. The Abenaki of Northeast Maine called November the Freezing River Maker Moon.\n\nCold Moon, December\n\nThe first day of astronomical winter is Dec. 21 or 22. It is when the top half of the Earth is tilted away from the sun, giving way to colder days and longer nights. The Cherokee also called it the Snow Moon. To the Comanche of the Southern Plains, it was the Evergreen Moon.\n\nWhat's a Supermoon?\n\nThe term Supermoon has many meanings. For staunch astronomers, it is usually the closest moon of the year to Earth, but astrophysicist Fred Espenak gives the title to full moons that come within 90 percent of the closest approach to Earth. Depending on the source, there could be between one four six supermoons on average a year.\n\nWhat about a Blue Moon?\n\nBlue Moons, like Supermoons, have different definitions. Some steadfast blue mooners consider a moon blue only if it's the second full moon in a month. But Blue Moons can also be defined as the third of four full moons in a season — the time between a solstice and an equinox, according to EarthSky.org.\n\n\"How can both of them be Blue Moons? The answer stems from the nature of skylore, and folklore in general. It’s lore. And it’s of the 'folk.' So it sometimes gets messy,\" wrote EarthSky columnists Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd.\n\nKimberly Miller is a veteran journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

The moon will appear full for about three days, from Monday evening through Thursday morning.\n\nIn addition, on the night of the full moon, there will be a partial lunar eclipse, adding to the skywatching fun.\n\nWhy is it called the 'harvest' moon?\n\nThe harvest moon is the full moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox, which this year is Sept. 22.\n\nThe harvest moon's name has long been tied to when crops need to be picked from the fields. \"In the days before tractors with headlights, having moonlight to work by was crucial to getting the harvest in quickly before rain caused it to rot,\" said Alan MacRobert, an editor at Sky & Telescope magazine.\n\nMany crops ripen in late summer and early autumn, so farmers were extremely busy at this time of year and had to work after sundown, according to NASA. Moonlight became an essential part of farming, and the harvest moon was born.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites 1706 as the first year the term \"harvest moon\" was published, NASA says.\n\nNews about our planet, explained. Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nWhy is it a 'supermoon'?\n\nWhen the moon’s orbit brings it closer to Earth than usual, the cosmic combo is called a supermoon.\n\nWhen this happens, the moon can appear slightly bigger and brighter than normal.\n\n\"Different publications use slightly different thresholds for deciding when a full moon is close enough to the Earth to qualify as a supermoon,\" NASA says. \"Because the orbit of the moon is not a perfect circle, the moon is sometimes closer to the Earth than at other times during its orbit.\"\n\nOn average, supermoons appear about 7% bigger and about 15% brighter than a typical full moon.\n\nThis is the second of four straight supermoons: After Sept. 17, the next supermoons are Oct. 17 and Nov. 15.\n\nSeptember full moon also brings partial lunar eclipse\n\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth’s shadow falls on the moon, either dimming it or turning it a striking red over the span of a few hours, according to NASA. The partial lunar eclipse on Sept. 17 will result from an imperfect alignment of the sun, moon and Earth, so only part of the moon will be covered by the Earth’s shadow.\n\nThe moment of greatest eclipse Tuesday will be 10:44 p.m. ET. At that moment, the top 8 percent of the moon will be in full shadow.\n\nThe next total lunar eclipse visible from the Americas will be on March 14, 2025.\n\nContributing: Steve Howe, The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/17/full-moon-harvest-supermoon-what-when/75259657007/", "title": "A Harvest Moon reaches peak illumination tonight: When to look up", "text": "As the nights grow long and the temperatures cool in the Northern Hemisphere, a new moon famed for its brightness and orange hue will rise in the sky.\n\nThe Harvest Moon, which has inspired no shortage of cultural touchstones – from a Nintendo game to Neil Young’s Billboard hit – occurs annually around the start of fall at a time when Earth's only natural satellite is especially close to our planet.\n\nBecause it rises near sunset and reaches peak fullness earlier, the Harvest Moon not only provides more working hours to farmers, but can provide quite a sight to skygazers across the hemisphere.\n\nHere's what to know about this year's super Harvest Moon and how you can see the celestial body as it's also eclipsed by Earth's shadow.\n\nMoongazing:Partial lunar eclipse to combine with supermoon for spectacular sight across U.S.\n\nWhat is a Harvest Moon?\n\nUnlike other moon names, the Harvest Moon is not associated with a specific month but, rather, occurs each year around the time of the autumnal equinox, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. This means that the Harvest Moon can occur in either September or October, depending on how the lunar cycle lines up with the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThis year's autumnal equinox is Sunday, Sept. 22, but the Harvest Moon is rising in the night skies already.\n\nWhen is the Harvest Moon?\n\nThe Harvest Moon appeared Monday and will last for three nights, ending in the early pre-dawn hours of Thursday morning, according to the Almanac.\n\nThe moon will reach peak illumination at 10:34 P.M. EDT Tuesday.\n\nWhy is it called a Harvest Moon?\n\nDuring the nights preceding the autumnal equinox, the moonrise occurs sooner than is typical, resulting in an abundance of light earlier in the evening after sunset.\n\nThe extra light has traditionally provided farmers with more time to pick (or harvest) their crops, and so the name \"Harvest Moon\" was born.\n\nAutumn is historically a busy time of year for farmers as they work past sundown harvesting the summer's crops, according to NASA. As such, moonlight became an essential part of farming.\n\nAccording to NASA, the first known written use of the name \"Harvest Moon\" in the English language was in 1706, per the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nWhat does a Harvest Moon look like?\n\nMany skygazers regard the Harvest Moon as appearing bigger, brighter and more orange than a typical moon.\n\nBut according to EarthSky, a website devoted to astronomy and Earth sciences, that may partly be due to an illusion. That's right: The way our brains process the view causes the moon to appear larger near the horizon than it does when it's higher up in the sky, NASA says.\n\nBecause most people look at the full Harvest Moon after sunset, when the celestial body has just risen, it naturally appears bigger as any full moon would, EarthSky says. It's proximity to the horizon – at least from a skygazer's vantage – is also what lends the moon an orange-ish hue as spectators must peer through a thicker portion of Earth's atmosphere than when gazing overhead.\n\nThe moon's orbit is not a perfect circle around Earth, which means that the full Harvest Moon's distance from Earth in any given year can effect how big it appears in our skies.\n\nHarvest Moon coincides with lunar eclipse, supermoon\n\nThis year, the Harvest Moon is not only also a full supermoon, but also coincides with another celestial event: A partial lunar eclipse.\n\nA supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the satellite's closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit. A lunar eclipse, meanwhile, results from the Earth moving between the sun and moon. This week, those three celestial bodies imperfectly align, creating a partial lunar eclipse as Earth’s shadow falls upon – but does not entirely cover – the surface of the moon.\n\nThis week's partial lunar eclipse should be visible Tuesday night across the entire northern hemisphere, including North America. For those in the United States, that means all lower 48 states should have a view.\n\nAccording to NASA, the moon will enter Earth's partial shadow at 8:41 PM EDT, but it's the peak of the eclipse that viewers will want to witness. While the moon will slightly dim around 10:13 p.m., the peak itself will occur at 10:44 p.m.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

This claim is correct, with one slight asterisk on the definition of a blood moon.\n\nWhat is a blood moon?\n\nThe post lists a lunar eclipse and blood moon as separate things. Both are happening, but a blood moon is actually just a type of lunar eclipse, not a separate phenomenon.\n\nMay 26's lunar eclipse gets its red coloring from the Earth. The atmosphere surrounding the larger planet acts as a filter, scattering blue light but allowing red light to seep through.\n\nAs the moon travels along its orbit around Earth, it will inevitably come to a point where the Blue Planet casts a shadow because it blocks the sun's radiating light. (This light is otherwise reflected off the moon, giving it a luminescent appearance.)\n\nWhen the moon is full and reaches this shadowy point in its orbit, it's then engulfed in darkness, and the event is called a lunar eclipse.\n\nHow much darkness though varies depending on where exactly in Earth's shadow the moon is. Total lunar eclipses happen in the deepest part of the shadow, called the umbra. Partial eclipses happen when the moon is partly in the umbra or entirely in the penumbra with only some sunlight blocked.\n\nFact check:Heavily edited viral image of sun's surface wasn't taken by NASA\n\nWhile full moons occur once a month, lunar eclipses don't happen that frequently because of the five-degree tilt in the moon's orbit, which prevents it from matching perfectly with Earth's.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nAs the name implies, a supermoon is when the moon appears slightly larger and brighter than it usually is.\n\nThis is because the shape of the moon's orbit is not a perfect circle, but rather an oval or ellipse, much like a chicken egg. Throughout an orbit the distance between the moon and the earth ranges from 226,000 to 253,000 miles, according to NASA.\n\n\"The main reason why the orbit of the moon is not a perfect circle is that there are a lot of tidal, or gravitational, forces that are pulling on the moon,\" Noah Petro, deputy scientist of NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission, told Space.com in 2016.\n\nThe moon must be at its fullest phase and approach its closest point for a supermoon to happen.\n\nFact check:Viral image of Great Conjunction is artistic rendering, not Ball State photo\n\nAnd despite the name, the moon isn't actually as close as it may seem to the eyes of the beholder. Scientists call this optical effect the \"moon illusion,\" and it's unclear why humans do this. Some theories suggest it may be the way the brain is hardwired to perceive size relative to the horizon or other objects.\n\nOur rating: True\n\nBased on our research, we rate as TRUE the claim a lunar eclipse, blood moon and supermoon will all be visible May 26 and the moon this day will be closest to the Earth this year. Lunar eclipses are the result of a full moon falling into Earth's shadow and a blood moon is a type of lunar eclipse. Because of the shape of its orbit, the moon will be at a shorter distance from the Earth than it usually is.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

In a statement sent to the company's associates at the time and obtained by USA TODAY, L Brands ex-CEO Les Wexner revealed that the show would be moving in a different direction.\n\n\"Fashion is a business of change,\" Wexner said in a statement in 2019. \"We must evolve and change to grow.

When Harris ended her speech Thursday night, the fan favorite song immediately played.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBut folks think the rumors were just a ploy to boost Harris' convention speech, which reached around 29 million people at its peak — and the theory is uniting Democrats and Republicans.\n\nPresidential election:Kamala Harris gets Beyonce permission to use song 'Freedom' in presidential campaign\n\nMitt Romney, Sean Spicer, and more add to Beyoncé at DNC commentary\n\nThe performance buzz first started when Emmy Ruiz, the Biden White House Political Director, tweeted a single emoji of a bee. Even though she put it off on her child getting ahold of her phone, it has sparked rumors across the internet.\n\n\"Sorry guys my 6 year old took my phone,\" she later tweeted. Then, on X, more users weighed in on the DNC performance that never came to Bey.\n\nShort-lived Trump White House communications director and \"Dancing with the Stars\" alum Sean Spicer wrote on X that \"the Beyoncé rumor was just a Harris ploy to inflate ratings.\"\n\nOne seemingly left-leaning X user wrote: \"So they let the Beyoncé rumor of her performing at the DNC rock to attract more viewers. Can’t say I’m mad at the tactic,\" with another adding, \"Hats off to the genius who planted the rumor about a surprise performance by Beyonce’ or Taylor Swift at the DNC. Instead viewers were treated to the best speech they’ll probably ever see and no doubt it changed a lot of people’s minds.\"\n\nOutgoing Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent critic of former President Donald Trump, posted on X: \"Contrary to fake news posts, I am not the surprise guest at the DNC tonight. My guess is that it will be Beyoncé or Taylor Swift. So disappointing, I know!\" before the TMZ controversy reached a fever pitch.\n\nCNN anchor Abby Phillip of \"News Night With Abby Phillip\" joked that \"TMZ lost a lot of credibility tonight.\" The entertainment news outlet is known for breaking celebrity news first.\n\nLater, TMZ took to X to address the incorrect reports: \"To quote the great Beyonce: We gotta lay our cards down, down, down ... we got this one wrong,\" in reference to lyrics from the track \"Texas Hold 'Em.\"\n\nHow many tuned in for the Democratic National Convention?\n\nNielsen estimates 26.2 million viewers tuned in to the final night of Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe four-day event in Chicago drew audiences of at least 20 million every day, according to event averages calculated by Nielsen, as celebrities including Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey took the stage to speak to a star-studded crowd and a sea of Democratic delegates.\n\nOn Thursday, as Harris delivered her acceptance speech, that average went up to 28.9 million, Nielsen said in a Friday press release.\n\nBeyoncé rumors coincide with cease-and-desist notice to Trump\n\nBeyoncé's camp previously went after the Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump for using the singer's music without consent.\n\nAccording to Billboard and Rolling Stone, the singer's record label and music publisher sent a cease-and-desist notice to Trump's presidential campaign over its use of the song without approval.\n\nRolling Stone was first to report the news that the \"Cowboy Carter\" artist did not clear her song for the former president to use.\n\nContributing: Caché McClay, Joyce Orlando, Kinsey Crowley", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/24"}]}
